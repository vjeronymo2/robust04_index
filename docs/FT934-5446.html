			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: View from America - US lawyers claim they are better than Europeans It will come as no surprise to European law firms that US lawyers have a pretty high opinion of themselves when it comes to providing international legal services. Their opinion of European lawyers, however, is not so flattering. According to a survey of America's top 400 law firms, conducted by Global Research, the market research organisation, US lawyers believe their European counterparts are less hard-working and less capable of taking an aggressive commercial stance in deal-making. Comments ranged from the relatively restrained: 'We are ahead on the cutting-edge developments in capital markets' - something Linklaters, Allen &amp; Overy, Clifford Chance, Slaughter and May and Freshfields might dispute - to the more forthright: 'US firms take a more proactive approach, whereas the Europeans only react when asked to.' Historically, there may be some justification for such a viewpoint. Many US corporations active in international markets have preferred to take their US lawyers with them rather than look for a suitable local alternative. US investment banks also appear to be more comfortable working with US lawyers. But it is questionable whether such a gap still exists between the leading US and European firms, particularly in western Europe, which is viewed by US law firms as their most important international jurisdiction. Even in the Asia/Pacific region, regarded by the Americans as their second most important market, the gap between the US firms and the UK and Australian firms has closed in recent years. Nevertheless, respondents to the survey felt they had a competitive advantage over non-US law firms when operating in foreign jurisdictions for several reasons. These included greater knowledge and understanding of multinational commercial transactions, a stronger work ethic, more expertise in specialist areas, greater efficiency and more competitiveness on price. The price question - whether US law firms are cheaper than European ones - is likely to remain unresolved while there continues to be such a difference of approach in the way that firms bill their clients. The American claim to be cheaper appears to be based on the assertion that they are more productive. The number of hours billed by US lawyers last year averaged 1,752 for partners and 1,864 for associates, compared with an average of 1,570 and 1,520 respectively in Europe. But these figures ignore the revolution that has taken place in charging practices over the past two years, such as contingency and success fees, brought about by the recession. US firms apparently still rank the number of hours spent on a job as the most important criterion when billing clients. It is doubtful whether many European firms take that view. In spite of the upbeat responses to the survey, the US profession seems much less confident of its standing in the global legal services market and, in many instances, unsure of how best to position itself as recession turns slowly to re-covery, according to Global Research. About 60 per cent of respondents see themselves as international rather than US law firms, but few have invested in new overseas offices recently. Resources are scarce after a couple of lean years, and many have not decided how to allocate the limited spare cash they have available. The survey suggests that US firms must answer several difficult questions when working out their strategy. Should they concentrate on Europe, where competition from UK and other European firms has made market conditions more difficult? Or should they be opening offices in the Asia/Pacific rim to target the emerging markets of Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and India? Given the tough time many firms have had of late, few will be able to afford such a high-cost strategy, particularly as most firms must expect to wait two or three years before seeing any return on their investment. On the other hand, can they afford to wait until they have built up sufficient cash reserves at home to fund such overseas expansion? The risk of allowing their competitors to become established in these markets is considerable. Those who, owing to limited resources, have little alternative but to wait for domestic recovery before contemplating further expansion should take heart from the fact that two of the three firms rated the best in the US by their peers - Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore, and Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz - have achieved such a reputation in spite of their relatively small size, their low-key approach to marketing and without a large overseas presence. They should also be encouraged by the Dollars 1bn Singapore Telecom privatisation, one the biggest deals ever to come out of Asia. Two New York firms, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton, neither of which had an office in Singapore, were appointed this year as lead advisers on the deal, much to the dismay of the US and UK firms which bid for the work from their Singapore bases. This deal, says Global Research, underlines more than anything that there is no right or wrong approach to overseas expansion. Those firms still undecided on their best strategy must also bear in mind that the international legal market is changing. US and UK firms are increasingly competing for international work on each other's home territory. The first indication of a change in the relationship came recently with the decision by Clifford Chance, the UK law firm, to hire a US-qualified regulatory lawyer in its New York office. It was followed by the announcement by several New York firms that they would shortly begin appointing English solicitors to their partnerships. Such open competition for international work in each other's backyards is set to become more common, as there is an increasing volume of work that could be done as easily under UK or US law. Perhaps in recognition of the difficult trading conditions overseas, US lawyers appear to be pushing a revival in domestic markets. Mr Joseph Flom, the doyen of Wall Street mergers and acquisitions lawyers, was quoted recently as saying the big companies now had money available and soon they would be saying: 'I've got money to lend - where am I going to lend it?' It is unlikely that we are on the verge of a mergers and acquisitions boom such as that of the late 1980s, but Mr Flom is not alone in predicting an upturn in M&amp;A activity. Respondents to the survey said corporate work was currently the most important source of business, followed by securities, bankruptcy and insolvency work, M&amp;A, banking, tax and litigation. Immigration, telecommunications, investment management and product liability were identified as the main growth areas, with M&amp;A leading the list of specialities making a comeback. Other areas expected to show a recovery included environmental issues, asset finance and intellectual property. Bankruptcy and insolvency will become progressively less important. This optimism, however, is dampened by the knowledge that the dynamics of the market have changed. Lawyers have to learn the trick of maintaining market share in the face of increased competition. Or, as one lawyer put it to Global Research, they have to learn to live in a market characterised by 'fee pressure downward, cost pressure upward'.

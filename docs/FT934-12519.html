			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sale of unit lifts Inco to Dollars 91.2m in third quarter THE sale of a gold-mining subsidiary enabled Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer, to post a strong third-quarter profit in the face of a 25 per cent fall in nickel prices. Third-quarter earnings rose to Dollars 91.2m, or 83 cents a share, from Dollars 10.6m, or nine cents, a year earlier. The increase was entirely due, however, to an after-tax gain of Dollars 127.9m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, from Inco's disposal of its 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold. The weaker nickel price, as well as lower prices for copper, cobalt and rhodium, resulted in a sharp reversal in operating performance, from earnings of Dollars 70m to a Dollars 13m loss. Net sales slumped to Dollars 468m from Dollars 608m, in spite of virtually unchanged metal deliveries. Nickel shipments totalled 111m lbs, compared with 112m lbs a year ago, but the average price received fell to Dollars 2.60 a lb from Dollars 3.47. One silver lining was a turnround in the troubled alloys and engineered products division, from a Dollars 7m operating loss to earnings of Dollars 2m. Inco said that lower prices were offset by reduced costs. Finished nickel inventories fell to 49m lbs on September 30 from 71m lbs a year earlier as a result of holiday shutdowns. Inco earlier this month announced a 16 per cent reduction in planned 1994 nickel output, with the bulk of the cutbacks taking place in the first quarter. The company said yesterday that it 'will continue to monitor market conditions to determine whether additional measures will be required'. Proceeds from the TVX sale reduced the debt-to-equity ratio to 37:63, the lowest level in three years. Long-term debt has been cut to Dollars 925m from Dollars 1.08bn.</p>

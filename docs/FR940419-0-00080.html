			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15. Alternate IV (TES) paragraph (b)_Remove or limit restriction. One commenter suggested that the TES LOFC clause be limited to CERCLA activities by a private party at the NPL sites where work was performed under TES contracts. The commenter stated that requiring future contracting requests for any work of a remedial nature within the regions covered by a TES contract is arbitrary and inconsistent with the requirements of actual site work required under other EPA contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is our intent for paragraph (b) to cover the entire geographic area covered by the contract. The TES clause coverage is different than the other clauses because of the special sensitivity of TES work which includes support for enforcement cases. We have seriously considered the recommendation to change this language. However, because of the high sensitivity of enforcement work, we believe this provision is necessary to best protect the Agency's enforcement and cost recovery cases. Moreover, because of the sensitivity of all Superfund enforcement work, the clause cannot just be limited to CERCLA activities at NPL sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Alternate IV (TES) paragraph (d)_Broaden TES LOFC restriction. One commenter recommended TES contractors should be absolutely prohibited from working for private sector PRPs in order to avoid the potential for compromising enforcement related data. Although we agree that TES work is highly sensitive, we believe the rule provides adequate measures to protect EPA's interests. To broaden the LOFC clause would be too restrictive to competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Alternate V (Headquarters Support) paragraph (c)_Response action work. Several commenters expressed concern about the vagueness of the term ``response action work'' and asked if it had the same meaning as the SARA definition of ``response action contract''. To clarify the term ``response action work'', we included a number of examples in the proposed and the final clause. The examples in the final clause include ARCS, TCRR, TAT, and TES contracts. It is our intention that ``response action work'' have the same definition as ``response action contract'' provided in CERCLA Section 119, as amended by SARA. However, we have included, in the prescription to this clause, authorization for the Contracting Officer to modify this paragraph to reflect any unique limitations applicable to the program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Alternate VI (Site Specific)_Site specific contracts for construction or other non-discretionary work. Some commenters assumed that this clause would primarily affect construction contractors and recommended that EPA not apply this clause to site specific contracts which are for construction. Another commenter suggested that work which a contractor believes is non-discretionary should also be exempted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree. When a solicitation, prime contract or work assignment is issued solely for construction work or for work that the contractor believes is non-discretionary, the offeror or contractor can request that the LOFC clause be modified or waived. The Contracting Officer has the authority to approve the request if the work does not pose a high risk of conflict to the Superfund program. Under Alternate VI, to ensure that prime contractors clearly understand they have the option of requesting a waiver from or modification of this clause when non-discretionary work is performed, language has been added to Alternate VI, describing how to obtain a waiver or modification from the Contracting Officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (b)_Site specifications. One commenter suggested that the words ``for the site'' be inserted in paragraph (b) of the clause so that the clause would only apply to EPA solicitations for the site. We disagree. Specifications could be developed under a site specific contract which may be included in other EPA solicitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;80, Annual Certification,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is added to require all Superfund contractors that do not provide other EPA conflict of interest certifications during contract performance to certify annually that all organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to EPA, and contractor employees have been informed of their obligation to report conflicts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> B. Demonstrated experience in conducting, evaluating, and publishing injury control research on the applicant's project team.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Effective and well-defined working relationships within the performing organization and with outside entities which will ensure implementation of the proposed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. An explanation of how research findings could lead to the development of injury control interventions within 3&hyph;5 years of project start-up. Furthermore, how the research findings might be disseminated and implemented through organizations (such as public health agencies) or systems, both public and private.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. The ability to carry out injury control research projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. The overall match between the applicant's proposed theme and research objectives, and the program priorities as described under the heading ``Programmatic Interest'' and in Injury Control in the 1990s: A National Plan for Action. Atlanta: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993; Healthy People 2000; Violence in America: A Public Health Approach; Understanding and Preventing Violence; and Injury Prevention: Meeting the Challenge.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Grant funds will not be made available to support the provision of direct care services. Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements (as set forth in the PHS Grants Policy Statement) as necessary to meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Programmatic Interests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grants should concentrate on the need to prevent the morbidity, mortality, and disability which result from violence against women, in order to reduce the devastating social and economic impact on the nation. Applicants are encouraged to propose research which either: (1) Rigorously evaluates the outcomes of violence prevention strategies currently in use, or (2) identifies modifiable risk factors which can lead to the development of effective interventions. Examples of possible projects listed under the priority areas below are by no means exhaustive, and innovative approaches are encouraged. Because of time constraints, comments were not solicited from the general public regarding funding priorities and special considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In prevention, there is specific interest in research that evaluates the effectiveness of interventions to prevent injuries and deaths due to violence against women, or reduce their impact. There is also interest in research that develops the basic sciences of injury control (i.e., social and behavioral sciences, and epidemiology). This research might evaluate one or more different approaches to implementing a specific intervention strategy. In addition, there is a need to examine intervention strategies for which evidence of effectiveness is either sparse or totally lacking. Interventions chosen for evaluation should have a significant potential for reducing morbidity, mortality, disability, or cost. Special consideration will be given to grants which target populations at high risk for violence-related injuries and their consequences, including adolescents, children, racial and ethnic minorities, urban residents, and people with low incomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of strategies for preventing violence against women which need to be rigorously evaluated for impact on violent outcomes include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establishing protocols for early identification and referral of abuse victims in health settings (e.g., Are women who are identified as being physically or sexually abused through victim identification and referral protocols in hospital emergency departments, substance abuse and mental health centers, STD clinics, or prenatal care clinics less likely than others to experience future abuse? Do home health visits reduce partner abuse in targeted families and, as a consequence, reduce the likelihood that children will witness such violence?);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Batterer treatment programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Alcohol and drug abuse treatment services for batterers and victims in tandem with batterer treatment programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Public information and awareness campaigns to change attitudes and beliefs which perpetuate violence against women (e.g., Can well-designed and administered public awareness campaigns change knowledge and attitudes that perpetuate violence against women? Are hotlines that provide crisis intervention counseling an effective mechanism for increasing the use of available services and programs?)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

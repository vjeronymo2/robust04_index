			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / People: A radical solution for Japan's double whammy - Nippon Steel's Takeshi Imai tells Michiyo Nakamoto how he thinks Japan should deal with a strong currency and domestic recession In just six short months, Takashi Imai has pulled off a spectacular coup which has roused the envy of many of his colleagues in Japan's business world. Without so much as a whimper from Nippon Steel's unions, the president of the world's largest steel company has lost 4,000 jobs from a total payroll of 36,000 across the country. The majority of the 4,000 - most of whom are white-collar workers - have been transferred to subsidiaries and affiliated companies. They had expected to return from secondment to Nippon Steel eventually; now they find that their move is permanent. But as far as Imai is concerned, this achievement is only one step in the pressing task of corporate and economic restructuring facing Japan. Sitting in his office on the 20th floor of the headquarters building in the heart of Tokyo's business district, the soft-spoken Imai preaches the need for far-reaching changes. Ever since Japan's economy has been subjected to the double whammy of a strong currency and domestic recession, one of the biggest headaches confronting business executives has been how to reduce spiralling labour costs with the minimum of social upheaval. 'Looking back at the two oil shocks and at the yen's rise against the dollar, it can be said that it was the yen's appreciation this time which has had the worst impact on the Japanese economy,' says Imai. At 64, Imai has been at the helm of Nippon Steel, a classic example of Japan's spectacular industrial success since the second world war, for the past two years. He has experienced the ups and downs of Japanese industrial development at close hand. On graduating from Tokyo University's law faculty in 1952, he immediately joined Fuji Iron and Steel; he then rose steadily through the ranks of Nippon Steel which was created through the 1970 merger of Fuji and Yawata Steel. The yen's latest rise, he says, has had a devastating effect on Japanese corporate profits. The squeeze has been such that even with official interest rates at historically low levels for over a year, companies have been reluctant to resume capital spending. In the case of Nippon Steel, with total revenues of about Y2,000bn (Dollars 20.83bn), the effect of the yen's appreciation has been to slash revenues by 15 per cent, or Y300bn. Worse yet, in the longer term, the yen's surge against the dollar raises the cost of domestic manufacturing on a dollar basis, thereby robbing Japanese companies of their international cost competitiveness, Imai warns. This situation has led to something of an exodus by Japanese manufacturers to other parts of Asia which have lower production costs. But this is not an easy option for industries which need to make use of as much excess capacity at home as the Japanese steel industry is thought to have. A more fruitful solution, then, would be to bring the cost of manufacturing in Japan more in line with international standards. On a corporate level, this means trimming bloated workforces and bureaucratic organisations that hinder efficiency and maintain high costs. To this end, Nippon Steel has introduced a programme of cost-cutting over the next three years by which it hopes to recoup the Y300bn fall in revenues it has suffered from the yen's rise. Imai is confident. 'We believe we can complete half our targeted cuts by the end of January,' he says. But on a wider front, bringing the cost of manufacturing in Japan closer to international standards requires a wholesale review of both the Japanese corporate system and the structure of the Japanese economy. Take, for example, the annual spring wage offensive. This institutionalised system of wage bargaining was useful when the economy was growing. 'When manufacturing (capacity) is increasing or living costs are rising then it is necessary to raise wages,' Imai says. But that is not the case today; living costs are stable, real wages are rising, and given that manufacturing is not expected to grow as it has in the past, 'it is necessary to keep wages down for some time,' he asserts. Imai, who is widely respected as a considerate leader with a sharp mind, clearly practises what he preaches. Last year, along with other Nippon Steel executives, he did not receive his annual bonus - considered part of an employee's salary in Japan. His and other executives' salaries were cut 10 per cent in 1992, and by another 5 per cent this year. Although Japan's blue chip companies have publicly declared lifetime employment to be sacrosanct, Imai emphasises, albeit quietly, that it has contributed to the high costs of Japanese industry and therefore needs to be reviewed. This need to bring costs down extends to the whole of the Japanese economy; manufacturing industries which export their products and compete in the international marketplace at Y100 to the dollar exist alongside protected service industries - which are therefore operating with an exchange rate equivalent to Y200 to the dollar, Imai says. Stringent government regulation has not only kept the cost of manufacturing much higher than in other countries, it has also prevented the Japanese from fully enjoying the country's wealth, which should have been enhanced by the yen's recent rise. 'That is why the business community has been saying that regulation is the cancer of Japan, because it is keeping prices up,' Imai continues. Along with many of his fellow executives in the business community, Imai has called for far-reaching deregulation of the Japanese economy; this would introduce competition into uncompetitive industries, particularly the service industries, and help close the price gap between Japan and the rest of the world. Deregulation would also encourage new businesses to start up - thus lessening the impact of the unemployment created by the restructuring of much of the rest of Japanese industry, Imai believes. While to western eyes these ideas would seem logical, in a country which favours harmony and gradual transition, such steps would lead to social upheaval and invite potentially harsh criticism. Imai's dedication to change, coming as it does from the head of a company which has long served as a model of Japanese business propriety, is a measure of the urgency and commitment Japan's business community feels is essential if it is to overcome its latest, and perhaps most challenging, ordeal.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT TOLD GARY COLEMAN CAN MANAGE HIS ESTATE  </P> <P> Lawyers for actor Gary Coleman, the former pint-sized co-star of TV's  "Diff'rent Strokes," argued in court papers Wednesday that Coleman can manage  his multimillion-dollar estate and is in good health.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Martha Goldin, meanwhile, continued a hearing  that had been requested by the actor's mother, Edmonia Sue Coleman.  </P> <P> The latter is asking the court to appoint conservators to care for her son and  manage his finances.  </P> <P> Coleman argued in her petition that her son's prolonged kidney problems have  had a debilitating effect on him and that he is no longer able to manage his  own estate, which includes about $6 million in personal property and an annual  gross income of $750,000 from that property.  </P> <P> But in court papers filed in opposition to the petition, attorney Barry Mallen  said, "Edmonia Sue Coleman's petition is no more than an attempt . . . to wrest  control of Gary Coleman's personal and financial affairs away from him as a  defensive tactic in connection with a civil lawsuit brought by Gary Coleman  against W.G. Coleman and Edmonia Sue Coleman, his former personal managers and  his former business managers."  </P> <P> Goldin said she wanted to give court-appointed attorney Arne Lindgren a chance  to talk to the 21-year-old actor and his doctors before the judge decides if  there is a basis to proceed with a conservator hearing or jury trial.  </P></p>

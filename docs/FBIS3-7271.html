			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, March 27 (AFP) -- Cambodian Foreign  Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut on Sunday strongly protested  Thailand's "forced repatriation" of Cambodian refugees fleeing  fighting in the northwest.    The Thai military continued sending the 25,000 Cambodians  back over the border into Khmer Rouge-held territory, but was  encountering resistance from some refugees who did not want to  go, according to traders at the border.    Phnom Penh had asked Bangkok to allow free access to the  International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to  determine if the refugees wanted to return to areas controlled  by the Cambodian government.    But the Thai military kept the Cambodians in an area closed  to outsiders, and has not let foreign aid agencies or  independent observers interview them.    "The Thai authorities have not listened to our request,"  Prince Sirivut said.    "I think it is a human rights abuse from some people or Thai  authorities, and I would like to say clearly that the Royal  Government ... and the two prime ministers, we are not happy  about this," Prince Sirivut said.    "We think it is a forced repatriation," he added.    At least half of the refugees, according to Thai soldiers,  were repatriated to a Khmer Rouge-held zone following the Phnom  Penh government offensive against the Khmer Rouge bastion of  Pailin in northwest Cambodia. Pailin is Cambodia's most  important mining center for rubies.    "It is not normal that the Thai authorities take this  decision to send 25,000 people without security, with nothing we  can check," the prince said.    "I'm quite disappointed and I asked all the international  community to look very carefully in this way," he said.    "In particular, we have requested the presence of the  UNHCR,"  the prince said.    Sagato Ogata, the UN high commissioner, made, without  success, an official request Friday to the Thai government for  access to the refugees, the UNHCR in Phnom Penh said.    The refugees began streaming out of Khmer Rouge zones of  control around Pailin following a government offensive that  captured the resource-rich area last week.    The repatriation was launched Friday night by the Thai  military and continued Sunday and Monday, a source on the Thai  side of the border said.    According to an unconfirmed report, the Thai military may  have culled out the young men and the able-bodied and  repatriated them first by truck, to the Khmer Rouge-controlled  zone of Phoum Malai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the north.    Thai troops are regularly accused of aiding the Khmer Rouge  at the border, an accusation strongly denied by Bangkok.    Prince Sirivut said he would still meet to discuss the issue  as planned Monday with his Thai counterpart in Bangkok, Prasong  Sunsiri, with whom discussions on the repatriation of the  refugees had been anticipated.    The minister hinted that Thai requests for an extension of  the March 31 deadline for the return of timber harvested by Thai  loggers in the Pailin area -- concessions granted by the Khmer  Rouge -- would be carefully examined.    The request was conveyed Tuesday to Phnom Penh by the Thai  vice minister of foreign affairs, Surin Phitsuwan, who asked for  the return to Thailand of expensive mining equipment as well as  cut timber left in place before the advance of government troops.</p>

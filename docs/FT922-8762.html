			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Thai protesters call truce: Government given a week to achieve compromise PROTESTERS called a truce in their week-long demonstration in the Thai capital yesterday, but said they would return next weekend to make sure a compromise reached on Saturday was implemented. The main issue still to be resolved is whether Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the unelected prime minister, will have to leave office soon. The protesters, whose numbers reached 100,000 over the weekend, accused him of trying to increase the military's domination of Thai politics, and have been calling for his immediate resignation. The prime minister said yesterday he would accept whatever parliament decided. A key point in the compromise agreed by nine governments and opposition parties on Saturday, is an amendment to the constitution that would prevent the appointment of a prime minister from outside the House of Representatives. This would force Gen Suchinda, who engineered last year's coup d'etat and was army chief until he was appointed prime minister last month, to leave office or seek election. Asked if he would stand in a by-election, he insisted he would not. Maj Gen Chamlong Srimuang, the opposition leader who ended his hunger strike on Saturday, told the crowd to go home, get some rest and return to their jobs. A new rally is planned for Sunday. Maj Gen Chamlong said yesterday an interim provision should allow Gen Suchinda to remain as caretaker prime minister for no more than 15 days after the amendments take effect to allow a new premier to be picked. But one government party leader said it would be wrong to dismiss Gen Suchinda hurriedly since he was chosen constitutionally by a majority in the elected House of Representatives. The government parties could try to extend Gen Suchinda's premiership by proposing an interim measure that would allow him to stay in office for much longer, perhaps until the next election. The parliamentary process of amending the constitution could itself take a month or more. The stock market reacted with relief to the easing of tension after a month-long crisis. Its share price index rose 41.81 to 774.70, recovering much of the ground it had lost over the past week.</p>

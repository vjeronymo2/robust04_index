			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (7): A dilemma for new biotech companies - Fall in share prices has worried investors ECONOMIC recovery may be whetting the appetite of risk capital investors in many industrial sectors, but not yet in biotechnology. 'What we have now is a protracted and difficult bear market with a shortage of capital and low prices for companies,' says Mr Brook Byers, a partner at California specialist biotechnology venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. The bear run began in 1992 when the whole healthcare sector, including some large capitalisation drug company stocks that had been stars in the 1980s, was threatened by the prospect of healthcare reform imposed by the Clinton Administration in Washington. Biotechnology was especially vulnerable since the proposed reform was designed, among other things, to control prices that could be charged for drugs. Biotech companies rely on the prospect of being able to charge high prices for new treatments to pay off their substantial investments. At the same time, confidence in the sector was undermined by the failure of some of the most promising quoted companies. These included Centocor, Xoma and Synergen, whose multibillion dollar market capitalisations all but vanished when their drugs failed in clinical trials. As a result, share prices of quoted companies fell rapidly almost across the board. With no prospect of a profitable exit, venture capitalists sought other investment vehicles. This was a reversal of fortune for the sector. As one biotech company chief executive says: 'Early 1992 was a waterfall of money. You held out your cup and it was full.' Now investors are asking themselves whether they have created too many companies. 'People are beginning to realise that 1,300 to 1,400 biotech companies means that the demand for capital to keep them going is too high. Biotech is rapidly running out of money,' says Mr Alan Carr of San Francisco investment bankers Hambrecht and Quist. The sector's appetite for capital can be measured by comparing cash reserves with the rate at which they are being consumed. 'In aggregate, there is less than two years' money left,' says Mr Carr. US stock broker Lehman Brothers follows 100 biotech companies, of which 45 have less than two years cash left and 17 a year or less. The prospect of a heavy round of rights issues or secondary public offerings has not only depressed the values of quoted companies but also those awaiting their initial public offerings. Risk capital investors have had to switch part of their funds from seeds and early-stage ventures to the mezzanine to keep their earlier investment vehicles alive, according to Mr Stephen Burrill of San Francisco finance house Burrill and Craves. Mr Jeremy Curnock-Cook, director responsible for bioscience investment at Rothschild Asset Management, echoes this, saying that early stage venture investors 'are beginning to ask themselves whether to limit investment. Are we not better off making the ones we have already more successful?' Amid the gloom, investors are looking beyond the US, the original home of both venture capital and biotechnology, to Europe. There are several incentives to cross to the Old World for both US and European investors: Europe has yet to see the failure of any of its larger biotech companies. Rather the reverse: the rapid progress being made by British Biotech, now the world's 12th largest biotech company by market capitalisation, has maintained confidence in the UK and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Europe while the US languishes, says Curnock-Cook. European scientists are increasingly prepared to consider becoming entrepreneurs. Research this year by Mr Daniel Schoch of the Hautes Ecole Commercial University of Lausanne suggests that while 28 per cent of Swiss scientists had considered starting a company, only four per cent had. None had been started with local venture capital because there is virtually no Swiss venture capital industry. It is easier to conduct research and development in Europe - 'it is only a slight exaggeration to say that the Food and Drug Administration is driving some companies to Europe,' says Mr Carr. 'Approval for a clinical trial in Europe can take one month, in US it can can take 13-14 months.' The gap is likely to grow with the establishment in 1995 of the pan-European Medicines Evaluation Agency. There is a 'reverse brain drain', according to Mr Burrill, of experienced biotechnology entrepreneurs from the US to Europe. Examples includes Mr Nowell Stebbing, formerly of Amgen and Genentech, the two highest capitalisation US biotech stocks, who is now chairman of the UK's Chiroscience. Changes in stock market regulations to ease the initial public offerings of companies with no profits record. The London Stock Exchange implemented one round of reforms last year and is close to enacting another. Privately, some of venture capitalists fear that the new-found European confidence in biotechnology will be short-lived. They suggest that European investors and entrepreneurs are unsophisticated and may become victims of the sector's appetite for 'a new generation of suckers'. Others argue strongly against this view. Several say that European biotech companies are better businesses than those in the US, which before the current difficulties found it too easy to raise capital. Some believe that the biotech sector generally will recover, partly because it 'always does' and partly because of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the wider healthcare industry. They also note that the share price falls so far - an average of 25 per cent this year alone in Lehman's 100-stocks - has created bargains. In the absence of commercial funds, many large healthcare companies are scouring the sector for the good buys. A number of deals have already been struck. Venture capitalists welcome the arrival of the pharmaceutical companies which hold out the promise of higher prices for quoted companies and hence an easier exit eventually from unquoted investments. At least as important, they should bring a higher profile to the sector and encourage the view that the principle of biotechnology, rather than the performance of individual companies, is valid. 'The jigsaw must be put together. It's time to see the forest not the trees,' says Mr Curnock-Cook.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kris Janovski, spokesman for the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] in Sarajevo, presented today,  as he put it: Alarming news from Banja Luka on the  intensification of the campaign of terror against the Bosniak  people in that part of Bosnia. Over the last few days in  Prijedor at least 7 Bosniak civilians were killed in retaliation  for casualties the aggressor's army suffered in central Bosnia.  The civilians were murdered after bodies of six of the  aggressor's policemen, killed in the fighting around Doboj, were  returned to Prijedor. All the Bosniaks have had their telephones  cut off. The UNHCR was first informed of this terrible crime by  a Muslim woman hiding in the house of her Serb neighbor.    [Word indistinct] is continuing in Sanski Most, where Serb  refugees are moved into the homes of Bosniaks, Kris Janovski  said. Exposed to constant pressure and unbearable living  conditions, the Bosniaks are simply forced to leave their homes.  Some 850 Serbs, refugees from Zenica, Zepce, and Zavidovici  have recently arrived in Banja Luka, and they are accommodated  through the expulsion of Bosniaks.</p>

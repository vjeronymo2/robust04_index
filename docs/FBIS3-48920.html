Parliament passed an act regulating bad credits,  while the cabinet and the IMF forged a third agreement which  will in all likelihood be initialed early next year.    Production slump continued throughout the year. GDP fell  short of the 1993-projected 350 thousand million leva. GDP will  total 270 thousand million leva, the National Statistical  Institute says. The projected 27 thousand million leva budget  deficit, or 8 percent of GDP, was exceeded and parliament  updated the budget at the end of the year raising the deficit by  5.5 thousand million leva.    Trade in 1993 was much lower as compared to 1992 which was a  successful year for Bulgarian exports, statistics show. The  Agency for Economic Coordination and Development's annual report  indicates a $100-150 million export decrease every three months.  Agricultural exports were half the 1992 level at the end of  September. There are no major changes in the country's trade  geography. Bulgaria's trade has three main trends. Nearly 30  percent is effected with the European Union (EU), another 30  percent of trade is done with the former Soviet Union and the  ex-socialist countries with the rest covering other countries.  The delay in the trade agreement with the EU and the  Yugoembargo consequences entailed a livening up of trade with  Greece, Turkey and Macedonia. Economists do not expect miracles  from the trade agreement with the EU which took effect in  December.    The Privatization Agency, the Ministries of Trade, Industry,  Agriculture and Construction sold 56 state enterprises  throughout the year. The Ministry of Trade concluded 30 deals,  the Ministry of Industry sold six light industry enterprises  while the Ministry of Construction sold seven construction  companies. The Sofia Municipal Privatization Agency announced  55 privatization procedures, held 127 auctions and two tenders.  Just 40 percent of the other municipalities have started  privatization. Council of Ministers Privatization Agency's  Executive Director Mrs. Reneta Indzhova said too many  institutions had been authorized to sell state property. The  Privatization Agency sold a total of seven enterprises and  payment is forthcoming on four of them. The state collected 2.8  thousand million leva in revenue.    Five groups united 53 commercial banks of majority state  holding throughout the year. The ambitious project of the Bank  Consolidation Company on a restructuring of Bulgaria's banks  remained halfway done. The institutionalization of new private  banks was initiated. Three private projects were granted  authorization by the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB), while  another four are waiting for a bank license.    Big private business was united throughout the outgoing  year.  In late September, 12 private businessmen met with the  intention of uniting and have since been known as the G-13. Two  months later they formally founded the Confederation of  Industrialists. Soon afterwards, in mid-December, big state  business established an organization of their own. A total of  21 state-run companies instituted the association of Bulgarian  state industry. Foreign trade companies, among which arms  manufacturers like Kintex and Teraton, are the most important  members.    The national energy system functioned without electricity  blackouts. Electric power cost was raised on two occasions. It  went up 15 percent early in the year and another 50 percent in  May. The cabinet is planning a third 67 percent rise at the  beginning of 1994. In the credit accord with the World Bank,  the cabinet pledged to raise the cost to 3.5 cents per kw/h in  June, 1994, the current price being around 2 cents.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Less is more - Manufacturers are trying to cut their use of packaging materials In the early 1980s, when Procter &amp; Gamble first test-marketed a highly concentrated laundry product, few people would buy it. Shoppers were put off by what they perceived to be less fabric softener or washing liquid at a premium price. Few of them seemed to care very much that so-called 'ultra' products could slash the amount of packaging finding its way into landfills. But it was hard to keep a good idea down. P&amp;G and other big consumer products manufacturers are now profiting from a shift in consumer sentiment. By 1993, 'ultra' - or concentrated - products were capturing about 70 per cent of the laundry market, according to Green MarketAlert, a trade news-letter. 'Consumers once believed more is more, now they think otherwise,' says Jacqueline Ottman, a New York environmental consultant. Concentrates are perhaps the most conspicuous success in the campaign by US companies over the past decade to minimise the undesirable effects of their packaging, most often by cutting the amount of material that requires disposal. 'Source reduction' is the buzzword phrase used in the field to describe a movement that embraces package redesign, 'light-weighting', and greater use of refillable containers and concentrates. It overlaps with efforts to promote recycling, which slows down demand for virgin materials. Industry representatives and environmental activists agree that it is a cause that seems to be coming into its own in the US. Over the past four years, P&amp;G has cut its use of packaging materials overall by 24 per cent, including a 42 per cent reduction in paperboard. It has also lifted the level of recycled materials in its packaging to 37 per cent, from 23 per cent in 1989-90. 'There is now a critical mass of recycled materials available to meet our needs and those of our competitors,' says Scott Stewart, a spokesman for P&amp;G. Between 1985 and 1992, the rate at which solid waste in the US was recovered doubled to 21 per cent, according a recent study prepared by Franklin Associates, a Kansas waste-management consultancy. In the soft drinks industry, the American Plastics Council says nearly 58 per cent of plastic bottles shipped last year were recycled. The rate for aluminium cans was 63 per cent, according to trade groups. In part, these trends have picked up momentum because of new regulatory initiatives at state level and increased pressure by government officials of every stripe, from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to the local level. Under the Clinton administration, the EPA has placed a stronger emphasis on source reduction in all areas of environmental control. In the field of solid waste, however, the agency has shied away from imposing rules to require certain levels of recycled content in products or packaging. Many cities and towns have taken a more active role, enacting laws that require residents and businesses to separate discarded cans, bottles and paper for recycling. For the most part, there is strong political support for such measures in spite of recent evidence that the US is not running out of landfill space as fast as was feared in the late 1980s. Meanwhile, nine states have controversial 'bottle' bills on their books, which promote recycling by imposing returnable deposit fees on beverage containers. In Florida, the state has taken a unique carrot-and-stick approach. Certain containers that meet targets for recycling or recycled content are exempt from an 'advance disposal fee'. Mostly, however, source reduction and the use of recycled materials are succeeding because they can be profitable in their own right. 'Source reduction yields significant economic benefits,' says Ann Mattheis, director of the Source Reduction Task Force of the Council of Northeastern Governors. 'When companies choose to eliminate or minimise the amount of packaging they use, that translates into reduced costs for materials, transportation and retailing.' The task force has sought to prod the private sector gently along the green path by drawing up a set of guidelines on preferred packaging. Companies are invited to set their own timetables for conforming with the principles and to report annually on their progress. So far, 50 of them - from the leading multi-nationals to small niche marketers - have agreed to participate. Their solutions range from the obvious to the ingenious. Mobil was able to pack its Hefty trash bags with 10 per cent less material by devising a better method for squeezing out the air between them. For Crisco cooking oil, P&amp;G designed a squat container which carries the same volume with 30 per cent less plastic than its predecessor. Many marketers have simply eliminated unnecessary cartons and wrap-pers. 'Because of the economic considerations, companies will continue to reduce their packaging to whatever extent they can and still retain the integrity of their products,' says Anthony Montrone, vice president of environmental business strategies at the Arthur D. Little consultancy group. A secondary benefit for marketers is an improved public image. Nevertheless, when shoppers make their choice, a product's perceived environmental qualities usually are not as important as its performance, convenience and price, according to experts in consumer behaviour. 'Most often, the environment is a tie-breaker. When two products are otherwise equal, the tie usually goes to the dolphin,' says Ottman. Likewise, public demand is a big reason why marketers are turning to recycled materials for their packaging. 'Companies are trying hard to keep in step with the environmental wishes of consumers as well as the policy makers,' says E. Gifford Stack, vice president of environmental affairs at the National Soft Drink Association. But they are not using more recycled material simply to curry favour, says Montrone. 'They are doing it because it makes economic sense - it's a cheaper packaging material,' he says. Not as cheap as it was, however. Prices for recycled materials have risen over the past two years, in part because the US economic upturn has accelerated the demand for raw materials of all types.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Banana producers need support while diversification takes place Sir, In last year's much fought-over deal, the EC has not 'Gone bananas' (Editorial, June 3). The livelihoods of farmers, communities and, in some cases, whole nations rest on the EC standing by those promises of assured access to bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. Europe has historical obligations to countries where it created and maintained a dependency on bananas. The EC also has legally binding obligations under the Lome Convention to maintain protection of ACP bananas until the year 2000. Without that shelter, the fairer wages and better working conditions of small-scale farmers in ACP countries will be sacrificed for cheaper fruit grown by US multinationals on huge Latin American plantations. In the Windward Islands, for example, unemployment could quickly double to two-thirds of the workforce. Responding to predictions of sharp price rises, agriculture commissioner Steichen points out that prices are higher in Germany, where no import duties are imposed, than in the Benelux countries, which already apply the 20 per cent import duty now being extended EC-wide. EC banana imports have risen substantially in recent years, with Latin American producers increasing their share from 50 per cent to 67 per cent over three years. They will be the beneficiaries of future growth in consumption, notably in eastern Europe. Moreover, the Community has said that quotas may be increased to meet future demand. The current agreement simply maintains ACP producers' present import levels, giving them time to adjust their economies. Everyone agrees on the need to encourage growers of Eurobananas to diversify, but that cannot be done overnight. Instead the EC should support long-term diversification programmes in ACP countries, while continuing preferential access until 2000.

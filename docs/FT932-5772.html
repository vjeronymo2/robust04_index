			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Clinton ready to compromise on deficit proposals PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday declared he was willing to accept smaller tax increases and deeper spending cuts in order to get his deficit reduction plan through Congress. In a speech conspicuous for its bipartisan tone, he said the US must 'move beyond entitlement and abandonment'. Democrats had to accept that not all cherished social programmes could be fully funded, as in the past, while Republicans should recognise that it was impossible 'to abandon the cities'. The address to a lunch organised by conservative and other groups in Milwaukee, a blue collar Democratic city, was replete with campaign-style pleas for a new political consensus. Washington, he said, had to forget 'brain dead politics from either party' and seize 'the historic moment to regain control of our economic destiny'. He did not specify which of his proposed new taxes might be cut and where spending might be reduced more sharply. Indeed, he continued to defend his overall programme as 'balanced and fair'. But it is widely assumed that the proposed energy tax will not emerge from the Senate later this month in anything like the broad-based form in which it passed the House last week. Mr Clinton's willingness to compromise on the energy tax has already elicited optimistic forecasts from conservative Democratic critics such as oil-state senators David Boren of Oklahoma and John Breaux of Louisiana that an amended budget package stands a fair chance in the Senate. The prospective change in the tax and spending mix of his proposals may also appeal to some moderate Republican senators. Mr Clinton received some support for his attack on the federal deficit from the independent Congressional Budget Office yesterday, which reported that his proposals would 'curtail but not arrest' growth in the national debt and interest payments. His pitch on the need for greater investment was also underlined by mixed economic data which pointed, at best, to only weak expansion last month. The purchasing managers index showed a modest increase to 51.1 per cent from the 49.7 per cent of April, but statistics on personal income and construction spending showed no changes in April compared with March.

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Personal View: The brave way to banish inflation Prices in Russia are currently rising at an annual rate of more than 1,000 per cent. Such hyperinflation is destroying the monetary system, which has just begun to operate on market principles. Indeed, it also dashes hopes of reaping all the other benefits of the market economy. No one is willing to invest, domestic trade has degenerated to mere barter, and the country finds itself unable to exploit the advantages of international specialisation. Time horizons have shrunk to days if not hours. All are agreed that the hyperinflation must be stopped - but 'at all costs', in the words of Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund? Is there only one way to bring inflation under control, and must it be pursued even if it runs counter to the goal of establishing a functioning market economy? Money must be scarce, say the economics textbooks; the IMF's recommendation is for a 'strong, restrictive, market-oriented monetary policy'. But what does the scarcity of money mean, when the aim is not to finance the creation of an effective, western-style market economy, but rather to curb a hyperinflation which has become entrenched in both the actions and expectations of the entire population. Two hundred years of monetary macroeconomics have taught us that the success of restrictive monetary policies, and the price which must be paid for that success, depend on the flexibility of prices. This flexibility is, in turn, heavily contingent on wage flexibility: if wages react quickly to a rise in unemployment, the price which must be paid for a restrictive monetary policy is low, and vice versa. The reality of western market economies is that prices are highly inflexible. Contemporary experience shows that even in the country which has been shown to have the most flexible wages in the world, West Germany, it has taken three years to push the inflation rate down from 4 per cent to 2 per cent; and even this has been at the cost of a deep recession and a sharp rise in unemployment. How long will it take to free Russia from inflation in excess of 1,000 per cent, and what will be the cost? During the entire transition period the scarcity of money will prevent the market economy from performing its most important function - to induce investment and entrepreneurial activity. Even in western countries investment declines in such phases. It is both absurd and irresponsible for the west to recommend a cure for the struggling east European countries which would certainly be the death of far healthier patients. The great majority of western economists seem unable or unwilling to understand that restrictive monetary policy can only ever be the exception to the rule of a relatively expansionary monetary policy coupled with moderate wage growth. Even in the west, a scarce-money policy can never be the leitmotif of economic policy in the longer term, without threatening the market economy itself. Those western countries which have enjoyed greatest success have been able to maintain expansionary monetary policies and low interest rates over long periods because trade unions have refrained from making income distribution a matter for day-to-day bargaining. In Russia, restrictive monetary policies would merely serve to complete the destruction begun by runaway inflation. There is only one way to banish hyperinflation without doing irreversible damage: Russia must gather its political strength in order to break inflationary expectations at a stroke. This will require a reform of the currency. Of course, it is clear that currency reform itself - the mere exchange of bank notes - will not solve the underlying problems. Currency reform can, however, be the cornerstone of a successful approach where it is embedded in a far-reaching reform of economic policy, one which effectively stabilises prices and wages, preventing new inflationary expectations arising. This, of course, is conditional on at least a minimal social consensus - and on scarce money. But it is not until price stability can be entrusted more to social consensus than to the scarcity of money that Russia will fulfil a necessary condition for the creation of a successful market economy. Even if this path is taken, the chances of success appear far from rosy. Restrictive monetary policies, however, in an attempt to impose social discipline through rising unemployment and to break inflationary expectations step by step, offer no hope whatsoever given the conditions prevailing in Russia.

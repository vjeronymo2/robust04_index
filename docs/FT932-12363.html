			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World News in Brief: UN team calls for Sarajevo to be made 'safe area' A UN Security Council delegation which returned to New York from Bosnia proposed designating Sarajevo, the capital, and several Moslem enclaves as safe areas. Meanwhile, Bosnian Serbs said they would bar aid convoys from reaching one of those enclaves, Gorazde, for at least two weeks, according to UN officials. France may withdraw its 5,000 troops in former Yugoslavia unless the role of the peacekeeping force is clarified. Clinton ponders options, Page 3 PM fails to calm fears, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 2 Apr (AFP) -- The majority party in the  Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] on 1 April  officially endorsed the new Transitional Constitutional Act,  which was adopted on 30 March by the High Council of the  Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT]. The act is being  contested by the USOR's hardliners.    In a press communique, the Union for the Republic and  Democracy [URD], which contains most of the USOR's major  political parties, with the exception of Etienne Tshisekedi's  party, said it has noted that "from a legal standpoint, both  Article 76 and the Transitional Constitutional Act were  correctly adopted by the HCR-PT plenary session, which wsa  officially held in line with the normal procedure."    The Article 76 being referred to here deals with the  provisions for appointing a prime minister. It does not make  any allusion or reference to former Premier Etienne Tshisekedi  or to the Sovereign National Conference, which had appointed him  to that post.    The drafting of the article led to the departure of most of  the USOR hardliners from the HCR-PT. The USOR hardliners  maintain that Tshisekedi is Zaire's "legal prime minister."    The URD communique was initialed by key figures from the  main  opposition parties, notably Gerard Kamanda of the Nationalist  Common Front, Edouard Mambu of the Union of Independent  Democrats, and Raphael Mwanba of the Social Christian Democratic  Party, which, with the exclusion of Tshisekedi's Union for  Democracy and Social Progress, form the backbone of the Sacred  Union.    It was also signed by Pierre Lumbi, a representative from  the  civil society (peasant solidarity) and foreign minister in  Tshisekedi's government.</p>

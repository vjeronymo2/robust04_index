So far, China has 300 deepwater berths along its 32,000-km  coastline, and the total deadweight tonnage of its ocean-going  ships ranks eighth in the world.    According to a plan, more than 100 deep-water berths will be  added to boost its port handling capacity in 1995.    Through years of construction, the country has formed three  major port groups -- the area around Bohai bay with 40 ports,  the Chang Jiang river estuary with 20 ports and the southeast  coastal area with ten ports.    Another port group is being formed in Shandong and Jiangsu  Provinces in the central part of the coastline.    A survey shows that the Chang Jiang river estuary has 60  deep- water berths able to accommodate ships of 10,000 dwt in  recent years, and the construction of large ports and wharves is  well under way in the southern coastal areas.    By the end of this century China will have some ten ports  with annual handling capacities exceeding 100 million tons each.    While building more ports, China is paying attention to port  modernization in co-operation with overseas companies.    The coastal areas are home to five special economic zones, a  dozen bonded zones and a number of open coastal cities.    The areas around bohai bay have established trade relations  with 160 countries and regions.    As a result, their imports and exports account for more than  one half of the country's total.</p>

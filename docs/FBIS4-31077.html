			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovene Defense Minister Jelko Kacin by Samo </F> Kobenter; place and date not given: "Lifting of Embargo Is a  Must"]    [Text] [Kobenter] Defense Minister, how is the  international arms embargo against the states of the former  Yugoslavia affecting Slovenia?    [Kacin] Our job is to reduce the possibility of military  conflicts on the territory of Slovenia to a minimum. This is  only possible if we can also deter an opponent that is superior  in strength. We would have to invest in the early detection of  the enemy and in reconnaissance, that is, to buy radar  facilities and develop our air defense. We will not get this  equipment unless the embargo is lifted. The embargo is a  political problem because, as a UN member, we have a duty to  defend ourselves, but this organization deprives us of the  opportunity. We are suffering from the embargo against rump  Yugoslavia, although we are participating in it. Moreover, we  cannot choose our neighbors.    We do not only have borders with states like Austria, but  also with such as are involved in military conflicts. The  lifting of the arms embargo is a must for our road to Europe,  all the more so since Slovenia cannot threaten anyone by its  size, but will only ensure its security.    [Kobenter] What would be the strength of a Slovene Army that  is fit for military service?    [Kacin] It is very limited, we draft about 12,000 recruits  every year. This number cannot threaten anybody, although our  army would be stronger in the case of mobilization. (In the war  of 1991 the territorial defense forces had about 60,000 men --  the editors)    [Kobenter] Could you imagine a neighbor like Croatia trying  to solve its differences with Slovene by force of arms?    [Kacin] It depends on the parties involved. In 1991 we  showed that we are very good at our defense tasks and we would  do it again. However, something completely different is at stake  for Slovenia: integration with Europe. Any conflict would be a  step backward. In the next eight years we want to invest 1  billion German marks in securing our airspace.    [Kobenter] Also in aircraft?    [Kacin] Yes. Twelve aircraft should be enough for us. But  radar facilities and defensive systems should also be procured.    [Kobenter] ...which could also be bought on the black  market.    [Kacin] No, by no means. First of all, we are only  interested in the legal way of procurement because we consider  ourselves a member of the international community of states.  Second, you cannot buy aircraft on the black market. And, in  view of the small amounts and our defense needs, the objections  that our arms might turn up on the theater of war are an  illusion.    [Kobenter] As a conclusion, you would also have to oppose  the lifting of the embargo against Bosnia and Croatia.    [Kacin] As defense minister, I can only speak for Slovenia.  I would welcome it if one of the states that developed from  Yugoslavia's disintegration and whose name I do not want to  mention were to sign the "Partnership for Peace" agreement.  This would be a security guarantee.    [Kobenter] Are you also planning accession to the military  alliance of the European Union [EU] in the long run?    [Kacin] It depends on the future restructuring of NATO and  the Western European Union. If you look at Slovenia from  Europe, you get a completely different view from the one you get  if you look at it from the United States through the prism of  Moscow. We have not set out on the road to Europe to persist in  self-restraint like Albania. We want to develop more quickly  and live better.    [Kobenter] What could future cooperation with Austria be  like, also in view of Austria's efforts for entry into the EU?    [Kacin] We signed a cooperation treaty a year ago. Our  soldiers participate in joint military competitions and we  benefit from the exchange of experience. Later, we will also be  able to talk about joint maneuvers.</p>

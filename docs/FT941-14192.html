			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / People: Ladbroke Ladbroke yesterday ended nearly two months of uncertainty by announcing that Tommaso Zanzotto (above) is to become chief executive of its Hilton International hotels subsidiary. At the beginning of December the group said it was having discussions with Michael Hirst, the head of Hilton, about his future. Hirst is a highly-respected hotelier and news that he would probably be leaving Hilton contributed to a fall in the Ladbroke share price last month. The group is thought to have decided that a new head of Hilton International could make more of one of the world's best-known brand names. Zanzotto, 52, was previously international president of American Express Travel Related Services, based in New York. He has worked for American Express in Italy and Mexico and as president of its Europe, Middle East and Africa division his move to the US. Zanzotto, who was born in Italy, was a founding member of the World Travel and Tourism Council. Ladbroke says Hirst has decided it was an appropriate time for him to leave the company, although he will assist his successor until the beginning of May.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'KING OF THE HILL' IS A BLIGHT ON THE AREA  </P> <P> I live four blocks below the "King of the Hill." Every time I look north, this  house hits me in the face.  </P> <P> I work in Santa Monica. Every time I look north, this house hits me in the  face. I cannot get away from it. And, when I don't look at it, I know it is  there -- looming down at me like some great dinosaur ready to devour its kill.  The King of the Hill is a blight in our neighborhood -- a pimple on a flawless  complexion.  </P> <P> The only way Mr. (Dennis) Tito can redeem himself is to plant enough trees to  obscure his ugly, overindulgent monument to himself from the rest of the  populace.  </P> <P> A pretty view is not his exclusively. It belongs to everyone.  </P> <P> KADY LANE  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

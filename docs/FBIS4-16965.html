			<p>BFN     [Text] My slogan in the presidential election campaign  will be: Social accord and unity of all the people residing on  Belarusian territory. This was said by Genadz Karpenka,  candidate for the post of the first Belarusian president, at a  news conference held on 19 April. Among the primary problems  Karpenka singled out that will have to be resolved if he were to  be elected were housing construction, the transformation of  plants and factories into joint-stock enterprises, and the  development of economic ties with all the CIS states including  our close neighbors. For the first time ever, the candidate  presented his viewpoint on the agricultural sector. He spoke  skeptically about the treaty on unification of the monetary  systems of Belarus and Russia. In his opinion, the current  quite difficult situation should be resolved by economic  measures, rather than by joining the ruble zone. Karpenka added  that the main task is to make plants work, while money is only a  by-product.</p>

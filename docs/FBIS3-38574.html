			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Bilateral Negotiations With European </F> Union: Coordination Provided by Jakob Kellenberger"; as released  by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern, 2 Feb (ATS) -- The coordination of bilateral  negotiations with the European Union [EU] will be carried out by  Secretary of State Jakob Kellenberger. On Wednesday [2  February], the Federal Council gave this coordination task to a  body which has existed since 1989 -- the Interdepartmental  Committee for European Integration. This committee is jointly  chaired by Secretaries of State Kellenberger (foreign affairs)  and Franz Blankart (foreign economic affairs). In matters of  bilateral negotiations, Mr. Kellenberger will be given the power  to decide.    No other name was being discussed, Vice Chancellor Achille  Casanova said in reply to a question. In reply to another  question, Mr. Kellenberger said that it would be entirely  possible for him to take on this task in addition to his work as  head of the political department of the DFAE (Federal Department  of Foreign Affairs).    Moreover, he plans to rely on the Office for Integration,  which remains and which will prepare the mandates for  negotiations. In cases of disagreement within the committee,  Mr. Kellenberger will be able to decide. But he will also be  able to submit the matter to the Federal Council through his two  direct heads, Mr. Delamuraz and Mr. Cotti.    The Federal Department of Public Economy will conduct  bilateral negotiations in the economic sphere. In this  connection, Secretary of State Blankart will regularly consult  the Consultative Commission for Foreign Economic Policy and the  Commission of Customs Experts.    With regard to the strategy for negotiation with the EU, the  Federal Council will inform and consult the foreign policy  commissions of the two houses, as a new article of the law on  relations between the councils stipulates.    Created in 1989, the Interdepartmental Committee meets at  least once every three months. It will continue its work of  analyzing relations between Switzerland and Europe. For this  general mandate, it will continue to be chaired by Mr.  Kellenberger and Mr. Blankart in turn.</p>

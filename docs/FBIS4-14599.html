			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BY ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- The Russian Foreign Ministry [MID]  has expressed serious concern in connection with the continuing  incidents of violence on the West Bank of the Jordan and the  Gaza Strip, as a result of which there has been an increasing  loss of life. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Foreign  Ministry's Information and Press Department, noted at a briefing  today that these incidents could "deal a blow not only to the  prospects for achieving accords between the Palestine Liberation  Organization (PLO) and the Israeli Government, but also to the  whole Near East peace process."    In these conditions, the MID spokesman stressed, "the  Russian  co- sponsor for a settlement considers it his duty to once again  urge both sides -- the Israelis and the Palestinians -- to show  maximum restraint and calm in order to prevent the fate of the  peace efforts being handed to [ne otdavat na otkup]  irresponsible extremist elements."    The main thing now, the Russian foreign political department  believes, "is to do everything to ensure the speediest  conclusion of an agreement by Israel and the PLO on Gaza and  Jericho and its practical implementation." "This would signify  the first real step on the way toward implementing the  Palestine-Israel declaration on principles, and would give a  strong boost to the successful advancement of the peace process  in the Near East," Grigory Karasin stated.</p>

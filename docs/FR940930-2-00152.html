On June 17, 1994, the parties filed a Stipulation and a proposed Judgment, and on July 1, the United States filed a Competitive Impact Statement regarding the proposed Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the Competitive Impact Statement, the proposed Judgment permits Morton Plant and Mease to achieve cost savings by consolidating some hospital and administrative services, but it enjoins the proposed consolidation and requires Morton Plant and Mease to continue competing in the provision of inpatient hospital services as separate corporate entities, thus preserving that competition upon which consumers have relied to reduce the cost of hospital care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>   [Text] Under the current conditions, further efforts to  continue the talks on the confidence-building measures may  result in the opposite -- their destruction.    According to I MAKHI information from the UN headquarters,  UN  Security Council members seem to be heading toward this  conclusion and believe that for now, the best solution would be  to adopt a compromise formula (in the upcoming UN Security  Council resolution). This would avoid a "head on" clash with the  UN Secretariat, would not expose UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali (based on his 30 May report), and at the same time  prevent the possibility of President Glavkos Kliridhis  resigning. It would also keep the implementation of the  confidence-building measures on the negotiating table at a  priority level.    The same sources added that Security Council members appear  determined to safeguard the confidence-building measures even if  this means temporarily sidelining them. This is why they seem  to end up in a two-stage scenario about the future course of the  Cyprus issue: In the first stage (according to Butrus-Ghali's  fourth alternative) they will send representatives from the five  UN Security Council permanent members to the  Ankara-Athens-Nicosia triangle to reach an agreement on the  basic principles that would characterize a future overall  solution to the Cyprus issue. By doing this they will create  the appropriate conditions to guarantee an effective "passage"  to the second stage, the implementation of the  confidence-building measures (not discussion) while at the same  time beginning new negotiations on the substance of the Cyprus  issue (for example demilitarization).    Circles in Nicosia have expressed their optimism that  according to the developments that are being formed, the  Security Council will not select Butrus-Ghali's fifth  alternative and only recommend that talks on  theconfidence-building measures continue.    In any case, yesterday a diplomat of a country that is a  permanent UN Security Council member told I MAKHI that a lot  depends on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' final positions  on the implementation of the measures. Denktas is expected to  relate his positions to Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, during  their meeting today.    The diplomat also revealed that in his well-known letters,  President Glavkos Kliridhis stresses his readiness to proceed in  an agreement on the measures based on the 21 March UN document.  He added: This is why all the Security Council members are  taking Kliridhis' positions seriouly and respect his  constructive stance during the duration of the talks on the  measures. He reiterated, however, that the new positions of the  Turkish Cypriot leader following the UN secretary general's 30  May report, which he described as positive, cannot be overlooked.    Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis reiterated  yesterday  morning that President Kliridhis has made it clear that he will  resign if our side is forced to participate in further  negotiations on the confidence-building measures, unless the  Turkish side accepts the 21 March UN document as is.</p>

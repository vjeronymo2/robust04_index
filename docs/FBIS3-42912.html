			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Center for Social Problems of the Republic </F> of Tatarstan: "How We Lived Through the Year. What Awaits Us  Ahead"]    [Text] According to information from the All-Russian Center  for the Standard of Living (VTsUZh) under the Ministry of Labor  of the Russian Federation, the proportion of the population in  Russia living below the poverty line was 32 percent in July 1993  and had more than doubled as compared to the same period of 1992.    Here the lower limit of poverty was taken as the budget of  the subsistence minimum or, as we usually say, "subsistence  minimum." According to data of the VTsUZh, its level in monetary  terms varies depending on regional peculiarities. Thus it is  highest in the Far East, in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug,  and in Amur Oblast, and it is lower than others in the Central  Chernozem regions of Russia, Rostov Oblast, and the Republic of  Tatarstan. In December the value figure of the subsistence  minimum for Tatarstan amounted to 24,000 rubles [R], while the  average for Russia was R44,350.    In order to evaluate the standard of living we now use the  concept of subsistence minimum and not minimum consumer budget.  Although society cannot for very long allow itself to be  oriented toward the subsistence minimum (lower limit of  poverty), which makes it possible to make ends meet only with  difficulty. This is why it is necessary to prepare for a shift  to indicators of the minimum consumer budget, which is  considerably higher than the subsistence minimum and is  essentially the upper limit of poverty.    Recently the appearance of new sources of income for the  population has led to rapid changes in the social structure of  society and further separation in terms of income levels. Last  year the average per capita income of the most well-off 10  percent of the population increased at the most rapid rates. In  September 1993 they increased 15-fold as compared to September  1992 (for the least well-off--12-fold). The difference between  the per capita incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent and the  poorest 10 percent of the population was 10.2-fold as compared  to 8.2-fold in September of the preceding year. The wealthiest  20 percent of the population accounts for 43 percent of all the  monetary incomes, and the 20 percent of the population with the  lowest incomes--7 percent. In 1991 these figures were 36 and 9.4  percent, respectively. The ratios for Tatarstan are  approximately the same as for the Russian Federation in 1992.  This is if the subsistence minimum is used for evaluation. But  if one takes the amount of the minimum consumer budget, the  picture shows even sharper contrasts. This is why our republic's  government devotes so much attention to questions of social  protection when conducting the economic reforms. Moreover, while  at the beginning of the year, in keeping with the Program for  Targeted Social Protection, assistance from the state was  received by practically all of the republic's population, today  it is received specifically by the underprivileged.    In April 1993 a permanent republic commission for  implementing the Program for Targeted Social Protection was  formed under the Government of Tatarstan. This resulted in the  creation of a comprehensive system that makes it possible to  improve methods of state regulation of the economy during the  process of conducting the reforms. On the commission's  initiative, laws were adopted on the minimum wage and the  subsistence minimum and went into force effective 1 January  1994. This means that the minimum wage cannot be below the  subsistence minimum. Changes were made in the Program for  Targeted Social Protection that keep the standard of living of  underprivileged groups of the population from dropping.    We all understand that the state can render assistance to  the  underprivileged and unfortunate and guarantee a minimum wage at  the level of the subsistence minimum only if the economy is  functioning normally and the budget is being augmented.  Unfortunately, 1994, like last year, is beginning with a decline  in production, profit, and investments...and nonetheless,  according to predictions of analysts of the Center for Social  Problems, in 1994 the rates of the economic decline should slow  up. The volumes of industrial production will decrease, but not  as severely as last year (5-6 percent as against 18 percent).  The volume of investments will probably remain at the current  level. In today's economic and political conditions it is  difficult to imagine large-scale reconstruction of the economy  or large structural changes. We found this out for ourselves  from the example of YelAZ and the KamAZ Engine Plant. Obviously,  this year the main "players" in the structural rearrangement  will be the enterprises themselves. Let us hope that they will  begin more actively to change the profile of production for  their own development and economic growth. One can assume that,  having learned from bitter experience in overstocking finished  products, the producer enterprises will be oriented toward  satisfying the effective demand. Then productions that cannot  compete will be shut down and capital investments from  ineffective productions will shift to effective ones and,  naturally, there will be a stronger tendency toward the  formation of prices that precisely reflect expenditures and  conditions of demand.    And this, in turn, will exert an influence on inflation as  well. For, according to preliminary data, in 1993 inflation  amounted to about 1,000 percent and prices grew on average  10-fold (in 1992--30-fold). And if a strict finance-credit  policy is observed and relations between the federal and  republic budgets are clearly defined, in 1994 we can count on an  easing of inflation. Then it will be possible to predict also a  stabilization of the standard of living of most of the  republic's population. At the same time there will be a sharp  increase in expenditures by the population on municipal services  and transportation costs. It is known that these branches are  surviving on state subsidies here. But it is also known that if  the producer is subsidized, the branch is subject to stagnation.  In other words, if society has a social need for certain goods  or services and their production is costly or too expensive for  the consumers, it is not the producer who should be subsidized  but the specific consumer himself. And conditions must be  created for the branches whereby the operation of their  enterprises is profitable. All these issues must be resolved  during the forthcoming year.    A great deal, of course, will depend on the course of the  economic reforms in the republic. But the solutions to certain  problems are obviously being dragged out. Thus while small-scale  privatization has almost been completed in the Russian  Federation, in our republic only 2 percent of the enterprises in  retail trade have been turned over to private hands, and the  volume of commodity turnover in retail trade was 5.6 percent  during the 10 months as compared to 32.6 percent in the Russian  Federation.    Now about unemployment. In 1993 it held at the level of 0.2  percent (as against 1 percent on average for the Russian  Federation). According to the economic theory of the market  economy it is necessary to choose: either high inflation or a  further decline in the economy but a small percentage of  unemployment (as now), or suppression of inflation and  strengthening of the ruble but inevitable bankruptcy of  enterprises and growth of unemployment. The inevitability of  these alternatives is confirmed by world practice, but the ratio  between them can be regulated. If we awaken a spirit of  entrepreneurship and resourcefulness that lies dormant in each  person, if we create conditions that support entrepreneurship  (the system of taxation, credit policy, and the code of laws on  entrepreneurship), this will also entail the creation of new  jobs and, hence, both a reduction of unemployment and an  increase in production volumes.    And so during the year that has begun there are  preconditions  in the republic's economy for overcoming the crisis phenomena  caused by the transition to the market. In certain branches  stabilization and even an insignificant growth of production  have occurred. Therefore it is possible to count on 1994 being a  year of hope and real positive changes.</p>

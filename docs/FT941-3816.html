			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Kumagai sells stake in Thai expressway A dispute between Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese construction company, and the Thai authorities over a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) elevated motorway in Bangkok was resolved yesterday when a consortium led by Thai investors bought Kumagai's 65 per cent stake in the project. The dispute had cast a shadow over other proposed Thai infrastructure projects because Kumagai and international banks financing the toll-road accused the Thais of breaching the revenue-sharing contract and effectively nationalising the road as soon as Kumagai had built the first 20km section. Full details of the accords signed yesterday were not released, but executives from both sides said a consortium led by Ch. Karnchang, a Thai construction company with close links to the armed forces, was buying Kumagai's equity in the Bangkok Expressway Co (BECL) for about Bt3.5bn (Pounds 93m). They also said the new partners in BECL would pay off the dissatisfied international banks immediately, releasing them from the project in accordance with their demands, and would pay unpaid creditors - including construction companies and materials suppliers - as soon as possible. Kumagai executives put a brave face on yesterday's deal, although at best the company is likely to have broken even on the project after five years of work. Higher than expected traffic on the road, boosted by congestion on the streets of Bangkok below, has now made the project into a cash cow. Ch. Karnchang executives were jubilant following weeks of negotiations to secure support from Thai banks and finance companies. They plan to build a further 10km of the road by October 1996 and to list BECL on the local stock exchange as soon as possible, a move that will probably mean substantial capital gains for the new shareholders. Replacing Kumagai as project manager is a new joint venture including Ch. Karnchang, its partner Tokyu Construction of Japan, and Bilfinger and Berger of Germany; they will also be shareholders in BECL. The foreign banks, including National Westminster, Credit Lyonnais, the Asian Development Bank and several Japanese banks, previously said were owed about Dollars 145m. 'The money is to be remitted tonight,' said Mr Athueck Asvanund of legal firm Baker and McKenzie, which drafted yesterday's agreements for Ch. Karnchang. He said the next section of the road would be financed by Thai banks, 'but in the future the company (BECL) would invite foreign banks'. He added: 'The creditors will be paid but not tomorrow. . . . We need contractors and contractors need us. Everyone is happy.'</p>

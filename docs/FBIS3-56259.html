			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tajik </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sayed Abdullo Nuri, leader of the Islamic Rebirth  Party of Tajikistan, has sent a letter addressed to Abdulmadjid  Samadov, chairman of the Council of Ministers of Tajikistan,  which says:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate:    To esteemed Abdulmadjid Samadov, chairman of the Council of  Ministers of Tajikistan, and esteemed Mahmudzoda, chairman of  the executive committee of the Soviet of People's Deputies of  Leninabad Oblast.    Your Excellencies, you are among those persons who have been  witnesses to all the [words indistinct] of the republic, which  need no explanation. However, I am confident that our hearts  are in pain at the suffering of the nation and at the pains of  the freedom and independence of the homeland. Tajikistan is  [words indistinct] and bleeding. He who sprinkles the salt of  hatred and animosity on these wounds and he who is eager for  bloodshed is not among the wise. [passage indistinct]    One can conclude from the course of events in Tajikistan  that  certain forces are bent on (?spreading) the devastation of the  civil war to the ancient Khojand [present-day Leninabad]. One  should remember the tragic events in Afghanistan and should  refrain from repeating them in Tajikistan. Now is the time to  ponder--for the sake of national sanctity, the integrity of the  homeland, and the destiny of the present and future  generations--to (?remove) the communist government. Efforts  should be made to bring about a government that is for justice  and that cares for its citizens and one that will bring  prosperity to all the people of Tajikistan. [passage indistinct]    [Signed] Sayed Abdullo Nuri, leader of the Islamic Rebirth  Party of Tajikistan</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> MARSHALL: "THREE PENITENTIAL VISIONS," "HIDDEN VOICES." With soprano Cheryl  Bensman Rowe.  </P> <P> Nonesuch 9 79227-2 (compact disc). "Hidden Voices" is filled with cries and  whispers, electronically sampled from various sources and processed in digital  loops, with the distant purity of Rowe's soaring hymn only the icing on a  complex confection. Art and craft are all of a part in Ingram Marshall's work,  in a seemingly inevitable union of music and means. More traditionally  developed, atmospheric tapescapes, the "Penitential Visions" share Marshall's  love of bells with the "Visions." JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: SME buys 50% of Cepsa catering concern SME, the Italian state-controlled foods, catering and retailing group due to be privatised, has taken another step in its foreign expansion with a plan to develop about 100 motorway catering outlets in Spain, creating 3,000 jobs. Autogrill, SME's catering subsidiary, is buying 50 per cent of Procace, a catering offshoot of the Spanish Cepsa oil and chemicals group. The two companies will build 15 motorway restaurants in a first development phase, which will be extended with the construction of about 10 restaurants a year over the next decade. Autogrill did not reveal how much the stake had cost, nor the size of its future Spanish investments. A company official said the Spanish motorway catering network was relatively undeveloped and offered considerable opportunities. Autogrill has been seeking to expand beyond the mature Italian market, in which it is the dominant force. The group, which has 328 motorway catering outlets, along with 44 restaurants in Italy's main cities, claims to be Europe's third biggest catering group. The company had sales of about L1,100bn (Dollars 753m) and operating profits of L36bn. Its roadside restaurants are a familiar sight on Italy's autostrade, while its city-centre catering activities are now being restructured. Earlier this year, Autogrill extended its foreign operations by buying '4 Pentes', a French motorway catering concern owned by the Elitair group. The company is the third biggest motorway catering operator in France, with 15 sites and sales of about L17bn. When the deal goes through in October, the sites will be modernised and redeveloped. No price for the French transaction was revealed.</p>

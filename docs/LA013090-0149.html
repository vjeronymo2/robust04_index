			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOARD REJECTS GATES' DRUG TRAINING PLAN  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors today unanimously rejected Orange County  Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates' plan to build a narcotics enforcement training  center at Rancho del Rio, voting instead to sell the South County property,  seized in a 1985 drug raid.  </P> <P> Board members cited the training center's uncertain funding and the escalating  budget of the Sheriff's Department as their main reasons in voting to sell the  213-acre ranch.  </P> <P> "The board is at a crossroads today," Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth said.  "We are in a poor fiscal condition in this county."  </P> <P> Roth offered a list of items as evidence of "skyrocketing costs in the criminal  justice system": the Sheriff's Department's $4.67-million budget deficit,  covered today when the board approved a midyear supplemental budget package; an  upcoming expansion of patrols in South County that could cost $3.6 million;  projected staff costs at Theo Lacy Jail of $6.8 million, once the expansion  there is complete; and uncovered annual debt service costs of $300,000 for a  planned forensic science building.  </P> <P> "I wish the $4.6 million we approve today (to make up the current deficit)  would be enough to meet the sheriff's needs," Roth said. "Sadly, that will not  be true."  </P> <P> Other supervisors echoed Roth's concerns.  </P> <P> "I don't think there is any question this would be a welcome addition if  everything fell into place," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said of the training  center proposal. "I don't think we can fill all the gaps with our very small  pocket."  </P> <P> Gates, who compared his proposal for a training facility for "domestic  soldiers" to President Bush's preparations to invade Panama, said he was  disappointed by the vote.  </P> <P> "I'm sure every narcotics officer on the street feels the same way," Gates said  after the meeting.  </P> <P> "It's just a sad day that we can't offer the kind of training they need. . . .  I just hope we don't see things happen down the road that could have been  avoided if the decision had been different."  </P></p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A test for ports at under Pounds 10 a bottle - Jancis Robinson sniffs a bargain - with some help from her friends We all know that vintage port is a relative bargain at the moment, what with Oddbins offering 1977s for just Pounds 22.99, but can any decent port be had for less than Pounds 10 a bottle? To find an answer 35 very different wines were summoned for inspection by myself, Edmund Penning-Rowsell and Giles MacDonogh, fellow Weekend FT drinks writers, and Richard Mayson, author of the prizewinning book Portugal's Wines &amp; Winemakers. Out of some consideration for our teeth and brain cells, we excluded the most basic ports, those labelled Ruby and Tawny and selling for about Pounds 5 to Pounds 7. The two chief styles of port represented were Late Bottled Vintage (LBV), wines from a single year bottled at about five years old, together with the category which has been called, with considerable hyperbole, Vintage Character. This term is likely to be outlawed within a few years in favour of Premium Ruby, for these ports are not at all like Vintage port but are essentially Ruby given a few more years' wood ageing. There was enormous variation in quality between different shippers' bottlings, and buyers' own labels (the latter by no means necessarily inferior to the former). Although the leading brand Cockburn's Special Reserve was perfectly acceptable, if relatively expensive, some Vintage Character wines were vapid  -not a quality normally associated with port. Mayson suggested that a good regular Ruby such as Smith Woodhouse (Pounds 5.99 Oddbins) can offer more unadulterated fruit than these supposedly superior versions. These ports are made typically from bought-in wines rather than from the produce of the shippers' own vineyards. The LBVs were in general a more satisfactory group costing perhaps only a pound more per bottle, although very few of them bear much resemblance to true vintage port, and too many taste like superior Ruby. Thanks largely to a number of deals struck especially for Christmas, however, it is possible to find genuine wood-aged Tawnies (as opposed to the commercial blended Tawnies that are mainly young Ruby with a dash of white port) at less than Pounds 10, although it is clearly asking too much to expect great finesse and 10 years in cask for a tenner. We also tasted two Crusted ports (blends of different years bottled so young that they throw a deposit in the bottle) and even managed to find one genuine Vintage port, a special offer bargain from Majestic. Only the Crusted ports need decanting, although LBVs from Niepoort and Churchill may have some sediment as they are not subjected to the same filtration regime as other LBVs. The most interesting port of the lot was the vintage, Offley Boa Vista 1982; the other bargain was Sainsbury's Vintage Character; the best Vintage Character was Churchill's; the best LBV was Graham's LBV 1986. The wine about which we disagreed most strongly (Richard and myself in favour, the others against) was Niepoort Senior Tawny. Quady's Californian riposte to port (called Starboard and sold by Majestic for Pounds 8.99) was preferred by most of us to the majority of Vintage Character ports, although Richard Mayson found it rather too sweet.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Serbs Brought `Mad-Max-Launching </F> Pads,' Too"]    [Text] Intelligence monitoring performed by proficient UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] members confirms that the biggest  battle since the beginning of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina will  be fought at Brcko. All parties to the conflict (led by Serbs)  have brought large quantities of weapons to this area, so that  the UN Security Council, the United States, and Russia have  unanimously stated that a spark should not cause a fire, and a  small fire should not develop into an uncontrolled blaze.    The establishment of a security zone around Brcko is most  convenient for the Bosnian Serbs. In this way they will be  given international guarantees needed for the creation of the  Serbian corridor between Serbia, Semberija (Bijeljina), Brcko,  Pelagicevo, and further to Banja Luka. It is not true that the  corridor was invented because of the Serbs, or that its  importance is exaggerated! If there were no corridor, the  so-called Serbian republics in Bosnia and in Croatia really  could not function normally. If we look at the territory  presently controlled by the Bosnian Serbs, we can see that it  looks like an oak leaf split in the middle -- two separate parts  are kept together by a narrow strip of land (the area between  Brcko and Orasje, which is the most sensitive part of the  corridor).    Ratko Mladic has admitted himself that Muslims and Croats,  who can "terminate" the corridor, have excellent weapons. The  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is extremely strong in that area  because it has a direct communication with Tuzla and Zenica,  from where it can be supplied. Apart from 40,000 regular  soldiers, approximately the same number have been recruited from  territorial defense units. Apart from light weapons and  all-terrain vehicles, the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina has a large  number of guns and howitzers of Russian and Chinese origin,  "Mi-8" helicopters flown by former Yugoslav People's Army pilots  (carrying launching pads with missiles); they also have modern  communications equipment, various types of antitank missiles,  light antiaircraft launching pads, and so forth.  <H5>  Problem With Soldiers </H5>   Ratko Mladic openly admits that the largest Serbian problem  is soldiers -- there are not enough soldiers, their number  cannot approach the number of members in the Muslim forces (half  of the Serbian brigades are filled with only 50 percent of  soldiers, for example). The Croatian side in Bosanska Posavina  [HVO units] has far fewer soldiers compared to both the Serbs  and the Muslims, but they have excellent weapons. Apart from  older models, the "T-54," "T-55," and "T-34," the HVO also has  "M-84" tanks that can be compared to Serbian armored units. It  has self-propelled 122-mm howitzers of the "Gvozdika" type (they  were seized in the Varazdin Corps), and all types and calibers  of guns, howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers.    The Serbs have brought to Brcko not only all known types of  guns and missiles, but also new self-propelled "missile  vehicles" assembled like in a "Mad Max" movie. Rails were added  to adapted military transporters (on wheels) on which Russian  air-to-air missiles of the type "AA-2 Atoll" are mounted (the  Russian copy of the U.S. "Sidewinder AIM-9"), with which Serbian  fighter planes ("MiG-21" and partially a "MiG-29") are armed.  Since there are enough missiles in the Serbian air base near  Banja Luka, which cannot be used because of the fly ban,  necessary modifications were made at the "Vazduhoplovni zavod  Kosmos" ["Kosmos" Air Force Institute] in Banja Luka so that a  large number of vehicles are now equipped with two adapted  missiles each.    "Atoll" has a half-round front and front wings, it weighs 70  kg, it is 2.8 m long, its diameter is 120 mm and the distance  between the back and front wings is 530 mm. Its red warhead  carries 6 kg of highly destructive explosive. "Atoll's" range  in air combat is 6.5 km (it has various types of infrared and  semiactive radar control); the purpose of its ground version is  to achieve a propaganda effect rather than its combat value.    It has to be admitted, however, that the Serbs do not throw  anything useful away. Some types of air-to-ground missiles  ("Sparrow") are used even in the West in the modified  ground-to-air version. The Serbs did the same thing as the  United States did a long time ago (they adapted the "Sidewinder"  into the light system ground-to-air "Chaparral," which is  induced by heat sources). The "AA-2 Atoll" was transformed by  the Serbs into a missile which should hit strong sources of heat  radiation (various industrial facilities, tanks with running  engines, and so forth), including helicopters flying at an  altitude of several meters above the ground or flying in low  flight.    It is obvious that the Serbs are trying to help themselves  somehow. The UNPROFOR, on the other hand, needs a large number  of high-quality tanks of the "Leopard" type in order to  supervise all three warring factions around Brcko. With the  present number of 20 tanks the UN is able to protect only a very  small territory and their personal safety.    UNPROFOR intelligence professionals stress another thing,  too: If the HVO joins the conflict on the Muslim side, the Serbs  plan a revenge against "HVO logistics and supply bases" in  Croatia with several additional multiple rocket launcher  batteries of the type "M-7" and "Oganj" (caliber 128 mm, range  21 km). Artillery attacks would be aimed at Slavonski Samac,  Stitar, Zupanja, Bosnjaci, Podgajci Posavski, Rajevo Selo, and  Gunja. The UNPROFOR headquarters is warning officials in charge  that the time is passing, and tension around Brcko growing,  since the Serbian corridor is like a steak offered on the table.</p>

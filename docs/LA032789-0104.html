			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TEXAS' MCORP TO FILE CHAPTER 11  </P> <P> MCorp, the second largest banking company in Texas, said today it will file for  protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code because  of involuntary bankruptcy petitions filed against it.  </P> <P> The Texas-based banking concern, which last autumn stopped making interest and  principal payments on about $470 million of debt while it attempted to  recapitalize, said three noteholders last week filed a petition in federal  bankruptcy court in New York seeking to have MCorp liquidated involuntarily.  </P> <P> MCorp spokesman George A. McCane said it learned Friday that the involuntary  bankruptcy petitions had been filed.  </P> <P> Gene H. Bishop, MCorp's chairman and chief executive officer, said he hoped the  action by a very small number of noteholders seeking to force MCorp to  liquidate its holdings would not disrupt or interfere with ongoing discussions  by prospective investors with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on the terms  of a comprehensive recapitalization plan.  </P> <P> Under federal bankruptcy law, the MBanks cannot be made subject to a bankruptcy  petition, and MCorp's Chapter 11 filing would supersede the Chapter 7 petition.  </P></p>

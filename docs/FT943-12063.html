			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Margins for error It is ironic that the strongest CBI quarterly trends survey since before the recession should also contain seeds of worry about the future. One is the familiar concern about the disappointing level of investment spending. The other is the first signs of inflationary pressure: companies report that unit costs rose slightly over the past four months and are expected to continue on this track over the next four. The main problem seems to be higher raw material costs. Steel prices, for example, have begun to rise, albeit from a low base, and companies must be acutely aware of other input price increases in train or in the pipeline. The temptation will be to pass on these extra costs rather than absorb them in their margins. To do so could prompt the Bank of England to start raising interest rates again. But the CBI is probably right to suggest that it is too early for the Bank to take pre-emptive action. It will need to see how far price increases stick first, and that is a matter of some doubt. Besides, there are grounds for suspicion that respondents to the survey are over-stating the upward pressure on unit costs. Companies tend to look only at costs at this stage in a recovery and underplay the operational gearing effect that comes with increased volumes. That is another reason for them to make sure margins really are squeezed before they push too hard on prices. Otherwise they risk unnecessarily irritating their customers as well as higher borrowing charges.</p>

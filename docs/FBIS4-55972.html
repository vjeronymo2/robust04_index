			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ewa Spychalska, chairperson of the </F> All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, by Pawel Reszka: date and  place not given -- "Deceived A Little"]    [Text] [Reszka] Under what conditions are you leaving the  All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] at the end of your term  in office?    [Spychalska] The fundamental task that was assigned to me  when I was elected chairperson was to maintain and to  consolidate the organization; to improve its image and extend  support for it. The union did win new supporters. During my  tenure, as many as 11 new structures and over 350,000 new  members joined the union. Today we have 4,782,000 unionists.  However, many unionists have left us, particularly as a  consequence of transformations and layoffs.    [Reszka] Did the union become stronger when it was under  your leadership?    [Spychalska] Strength is not reflected merely in the number  of members. We learned how to negotiate and hold talks. We  have increasingly better and stronger arguments.    [Reszka] These successes are not easily seen where the  Charter of Social Guarantees is concerned, for instance. You  started to talk about it with the Suchocka government and there  are still no effects.    [Spychalska] The negotiations on the charter really started  in February of this year; however, they have been going on for  too long anyway. The stand of the unionists is not adamant  enough, and the government is prolonging the talks; it is not  making any definite measures or clear declarations. I am  getting the impression that the government is afraid of  solutions, that it is afraid to make decisions of a political  nature.    [Reszka] Did you expect so many problems with the  government, which includes so many of your political colleagues?    [Spychalska] I knew that things would not be easy -- I was  aware of the situation. I thought, however, that they would  have more courage and determination.    [Reszka] Before the elections, the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] was rather certain of its economic program. Do you feel  that it is not hurrying to implement it?    [Spychalska] Yes, I do. Especially as far as the equal  starting point for both sectors of the economy is concerned;  this is found not only in the program of SLD, but also in the  program of the entire governing coalition. This was a primary  issue.    [Reszka] I understand that it has not been put into effect.  However, before the government was formed, you formidably  announced that you would not give up even one item in the SLD  election program.    [Spychalska] This is still the case.    [Reszka] This program includes a few dozen pages full of  promises...    [Spychalska] ...plans that were supposed to be put into  effect. What causes friction is the fact that even though we  signed the program, we bear joint responsibility for it, and we  are already paying the price for being in the coalition, there  is still no four- year schedule for the implementation of the  program.    [Reszka] What price are you paying for being in SLD?    [Spychalska] Sometimes our members are dissatisfied that  everything is proceeding too slowly and that the government has  no clear policy.    [Reszka] Still, your unionists are still favorably disposed  toward the government?    [Spychalska] Their views are now much more moderate than  they were at the beginning.    [Reszka] You have travelled extensively outside Warsaw prior  to the congress. Have the unionists asked you about the various  promises, such as stimulating the housing sector, lifting the  popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases], full implementation  of the "Pact on Enterprise..."    [Spychalska] These were the most important issues at those  meetings and they will come back at the congress.    [Reszka] But how did you respond to the unionists?    [Spychalska] (after a moment of silence) Well..., I  presented the actual state of affairs to them. That is, the  state of affairs that is within the parliament -- because this  is what I know; what the government is doing -- I do not know.    [Reszka] You do not know what the government is doing?    [Spychalska] Well, I do not, I have problems. I only know  what the government has sent over to me in order to consult me  on those issues. Therefore, I can guess that this is what the  ministers may deal with next.    [Reszka] The evaluation of the situation is not very good,  then. It is worth recalling that in September last year you  said that you would give the government three to six months of  peace: "We will be trustful and restrained." Will a war with  the government break out after the six months?    [Spychalska] The government had six months to prepare the  budget; however, it also should have used this time to prepare  the foundations for the implementation of the election program.  But this is still missing. This issue may be discussed quite  sharply at the congress.    [Reszka] Does this mean that it does not pay for OPZZ to be  in SLD?    [Spychalska] It generally does not pay for unionists to be  in the Sejm. We were already convinced about that in the  previous Sejm; however, the political situation was not stable  enough for us to be able to conclude a political contract with  the party: implementation of the program in return for support.  I believe, however, that the presence of unionists will not be  necessary in the next Sejm.    [Reszka] Talking about contracts. As far as privatization  is concerned, do you find your views closer to those of Sejm  Deputy Pek or Minister Kaczmarek?    [Spychalska] Well... middle of the road, more or less. We  do not definitely oppose privatization; however, neither are we  supporters of everything being for sale, of such a "total  privatization." No extremes.    [Reszka] You have talked about future political contracts.  However, you already concluded a certain contract when you  entered the structures of SLD. Do you feel deceived?    [Spychalska] I feel disappointed. This program kept all of  us together. The fact that it is not being implemented has put  the coalition under question.    [Reszka] What is OPZZ going to do, then?    [Spychalska] The congress will set the specific dates. The  most fundamental issue is a social agreement which must include  a clear schedule of the implementation of the program. There is  a chance to sign the Charter of Social Guarantees very soon. I  think that at that time, the government will get not more than  two or three months for the preparation of a clear schedule. If  that is not done, it will mean that our presence in the  coalition just does not make sense.    [Reszka] Perhaps the SLD program was too simple? You spoke  about stimulating the economy very soon, about tariffs, tax  police... It turns out that it all cannot be achieved fast.    [Spychalska] Indeed, it cannot be achieved fast. There are  many factors, including the international ones... Sometimes the  prescriptions were too simple indeed; however, this is a  characteristic of an election campaign. One should draw  conclusions from this. Resorting to oversimplifications is very  often disastrous. People interpret well the information that  they want and they demand that it be put into effect.    [Reszka] Do you admit to mistakes? Do you think there were  things you could have done better?    [Spychalska] Yes, I do. A large part of the SLD program was  prepared by Marek Borowski. He was the economic guru of this  group and we trusted him. I sometimes read this program because  I have one copy of it, with the signature of Borowski. When he  was still deputy prime minister and we could not reach an  agreement, I would show this program to him and say: "These are  your own words and we believed you." Today we feel a little  deceived.    [Reszka] What would he answer?    [Spychalska] "Well, you know, it was a campaign, it is only  a program; I thought, but when I came here the situation was  more difficult..."    [Reszka] You are expressing unfavorable opinions about the  government, the coalition. Is this the election campaign before  the congress already?    [Spychalska] No, it is not. These are facts. I am still a  supporter of the idea of negotiations. I would only like the  other side to treat this as we do. It is not because the  congress is drawing near that I am criticizing the government.    [Reszka] Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], is publicly supporting  you.    [Spychalska] He is not a delegate. His statements are ill-  timed, too early, and moreover, out of place, which I have told  him.    [Reszka] Why do you think you are a comfortable person for  him?    [Spychalska] Go ask him! He will not corroborate the thesis  about my "being comfortable." He has enough troubles talking  with me.    [Reszka] Perhaps he would have even more troubles with  someone else?    [Spychalska] Perhaps..., but not necessarily, because people  often take rather adamant stands when they are not parties to a  conflict. Then they relent. I am just the way I am and I will  not change. I think that one of the features of my character is  that I am able to listen. This makes the other side trust and  respect me.    [Reszka] Spychalska belongs to the "Gray" (the seat of SdRP  -- editor's note), I learned from one unionist...    [Spychalska] (laughs) I am surprised. This was probably in  the context of that statement by Kwasniewski. I come across  many statements of the "Gray" which criticize me for being too  independent.    I think, therefore, that as far as my "belonging to the  Gray"  is concerned, the situation is rather quite the contrary.    [Reszka] Is OPZZ not too dispersed? The heads of the  branches reach agreements without the head of the center. Does  this not place OPZZ in the position of a group of several dozen  persons who do not have much influence on unionists?    [Spychalska] I do not think it is a mistake. The advantage  of the movement is the fact that it consists of branches and  that the branches are independent. We have chosen this form of  activity on purpose: independent branches and the serving role  of the center. I would not feel good in a union governed by a  structure based on commands. This structure works to our  advantage.    [Reszka] You want to sign a social agreement and you cannot  order unionists to do anything. Are you a serious partner for  the government?    [Spychalska] Yes, we are. We can reach a consensus without  issuing orders.    [Reszka] I have heard the opinion that the OPZZ heads who  are simultaneously Sejm deputies do not have much time left for  unionists.    [Spychalska] This is a fact and the most fundamental  accusation. Out of six persons who are in the OPZZ leadership,  five are deputies. These proportions should be more balanced.  However, there are also extreme views: that the function of  heading the union should not be merged with being a Sejm deputy.  I am a supporter of balancing these proportions in the  leadership: a group for contacts with the parliament, the  government, and a group for contacts with the unionists.    [Reszka] So far, no one has publicly announced that he or  she would like to compete with you at the congress. Are you  that strong? Are your competitors afraid of you?    [Spychalska] I do not think that there are any elements of  fear there. Nor do I think that I am that strong. I could  point to seven or eight persons who would be excellent  substitutes. I am aware of the fact that various meetings of  bigger and smaller groups are being held. This is only normal.  However, no one has come to me and said: "Listen, I want to run  as well." This would be nice. When I decided to run for the  post of the deputy chairperson, I came and said it.    [Reszka] How many opponents in the elections will you have?    [Spychalska] Three, I think.    [Reszka] Do you predict a difficult fight.    [Spychalska] I certainly do.    [Reszka] Are you going to win?    [Spychalska] I do not know. I am not superstitious, but  this is just not certain. I think that there will not be a  total attack.    [Reszka] How are you going to persuade the delegates that it  is you who should be elected?    [Spychalska] The bargaining chip will be the concept of  labor organization.    [Reszka] It is so marvelous that you will be elected.    [Spychalska] I do not think that it is so extraordinary, but  it certainly is rational from my point of view.    [Reszka] What will you do if you lose?    [Spychalska] I have received many offers for interesting  work -- that is not a problem. Two of them are very interesting  indeed: one concerns work in the banking sector, and the other  -- in journalism. It will not be a post in the government.    [Reszka] Will you leave OPZZ?    [Spychalska] I certainly will. I am not going to inflict  myself there.    [Reszka] If you win, what will change in OPZZ?    [Spychalska] The organization of work. The style of the  work of the center and of the units subordinated to it is a  little slow. It must be an organism that reacts fast. This  calls for statutory changes.</p>

"According to present information, insufficient  care was taken by the organisers of the march to prevent  violence and to discipline participants," Mr de Klerk said in a  statement in Pretoria.    "There can be no excuse at this critical stage in the  political process for provocative and potentially violent  actions such as we have seen today (Monday). It not only  endangers the elections and reform process, but also the very  fabric of society," he said.    Mr de Klerk called on all political leaders to exercise  control and restraint over their followers, to ensure there was  no repetition of Monday's events and to avoid any action which  could lead to violence. "The time has arrived for the urgent  consideration -- by the Transitional Executive Council,  government, the Independent Electoral Commission and others --  of additional measures or steps which can prevent a repetition  of what has happened today and on recent similar occasions. The  government intends discussing these matters with the relevant  institutions. Obviously, such measures or steps should not  prevent political parties from campaigning peacefully and  democratically," he said.    He expressed his condolences to the families of the dead.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: KB keeps top jobs internal Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, has abandoned its attempt to recruit a new chief executive from outside the bank, and will instead split the responsibility between three senior executives. Kleinwort has appointed two investment banking chief executives to complement its investment management chief executive. It has been looking for a new chief executive to succeed Mr Jonathan Agnew, who left the bank in August. There has been speculation that Kleinwort found it hard to attract an executive from another investment bank. But Lord Rockley, the executive chairman, who succeeded Mr David Peake in May, said he had not offered the job to anyone, and had decided it was unnecessary. 'We talked to a lot of people, but we did not get down to a short list. Over the months, I have been confirmed in my view of the strength of what we had internally.' Sir Nicholas Redmayne and Mr David Clementi have been appointed as joint chief executives of investment banking, which includes financing and corporate advisory services, equity securities and treasury operations. The two men will report jointly to Lord Rockley and Mr Simon Robertson, the deputy chairman. Mr Colin Maltby, the current chief executive of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, will continue to report directly to them. Lord Rockley said it was 'always going to be difficult' to introduce a new chief executive from outside, and he had been searching at a time when the existing management had shown itself capable of generating much new business. He said that 75 per cent of management decisions had been taken by executives in charge of investment management and investment banking during this year, and they had proved themselves able to deal with day-to-day issues. The bank reported doubled interim profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 42.2m. However, the lack of a chief executive for several months has led to some uncertainty over its future direction. The shares rose 30p yesterday to close at 591p.</p>

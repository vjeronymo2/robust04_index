			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / SE faces more secrecy on trades THE largest trades conducted on the London stock market will not have to be made public until up to a week after they have taken place, if a proposal to be put to the Stock Exchange's board today is adopted. If approved, the change could boost the profits of London securities firms, which claim current regulations expose them to losses. The move would be a reduction in the level of transparency on the London market, which already requires less disclosure of trade information than other international markets. The relaxation would apply only to the very biggest trades, in which a marketmaker buys or sells a large block of shares. The delay in publication would give marketmakers longer to lay off their risks before competitors were alerted to their positions. The rule change would apply only to trades which are at least 75 times bigger than the average trade in a company's shares (known as the 'normal market size'). Details would have to be published only after the marketmaker had laid off at least 90 per cent of its own risk, though publication of all trades would be obligatory after a week. The proposal is the latest step in a five-year battle between UK marketmakers and regulators over trade publication. Securities houses have argued that London's marketmaking system, unlike the auction systems in most other large stock markets, will only operate with a degree of secrecy. The rule change is understood to have been approved by the Securities and Investments Board, the Department of Trade and Industry and a number of City trade groups. The London International Financial Futures Exchange is believed to have resisted the change, arguing that reducing the level of transparency would harm trading in the FT-SE 100 futures contract. Under the proposed rule change, it would be left to each securities house to decide for itself when 90 per cent of its risk had been laid off. Regulators hope that the concession to the marketmakers, though reducing disclosure of block trades, will lead to greater disclosure of other routine transactions. Marketmakers can now get around the need to publish all trades within 90 minutes by agreeing a 'protected trade' with a client. Here, the marketmaker guarantees a certain price for a trade, but promises to try to improve on it during the day. The trade is not reported and published until it has been confirmed. Regulators fear that normal trades are being dressed up as protected trades to bypass the publication rules. By allowing marketmakers greater secrecy on large deals, the regulators hope they will be less likely to use protected trades.</p>

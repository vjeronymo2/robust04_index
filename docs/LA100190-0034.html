Commuter Products also offers gadgets for before or after a commute. Among  them: an under-the-pillow alarm that shakes a sleeper without disturbing anyone  else, a multi-pocket folder to organize glove box rubble and a Car Finder that  turns on the lights and honks the horn of your car from 200 feet way.  </P></p>

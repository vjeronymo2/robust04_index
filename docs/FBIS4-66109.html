			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin -- Dieter Schulze, 54, has been nominated as  the official candidate to succeed Heinz-Werner Meyer, the leader  of the German Trade Union Federation [DGB] who died two weeks  ago. The chairmen of the individual trade unions decided at a  special session today to present Schulte at the DGB Congress  scheduled to take place in Berlin between 13 and 17 June as  candidate for the chairmanship. DPA learned this from  participants in the special session.    The 54-year-old official is a member of the Executive  Committee of the Metal Workers Trade Union and responsible for  the steel industry and for codetermination.    The trade union chairmen rejected a crucial vote at the DGB  congress between Schulte and DGB Deputy Chairwoman Ursula  Engelen-Kefer.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JUROR WARNED NOT TO DISCUSS THEORY  </P> <P> A juror in the Manhattan Beach McMartin Pre-School molestation retrial  considered telling other jurors of a theory he developed about some testimony,  a violation of court rules, officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg this week privately told the juror that  he must not discuss his theory with other jurors in the retrial of Ray Buckey.  </P> <P> The judge further told the juror that he should not even be analyzing the  evidence until jury deliberations begin July 9.  </P> <P> In a letter received by the judge Monday, the juror laid out his theory about  the testimony of one of the alleged victims, who said that the man who molested  her had a beard and mustache. Buckey, 32, has denied ever having a beard or  mustache.  </P> <P> The juror stated in his letter, however, that he noticed that Buckey's face was  frequently "very red," apparently from spending time in the sun, and that the  alleged victim might have mistaken his sunburn for a beard.  </P></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Japanese banks account for fraud FUJI Bank and Tokai Bank, two of the largest Japanese commercial banks, have revised their profits forecasts down sharply to account for fraudulent loan practices uncovered last summer and the continued weakness of the stock market. Fuji Bank forecast pre-tax profits of Y140bn (Dollars 1.06bn) for the year ended March 31, a 26.3 per cent reduction from earlier predictions. In 1990 Fuji made pre-tax profits of Y204bn. The bank said that it made a transfer to reserves to cover loan losses arising from fraud and weak stock prices but did not specify the amounts set aside. The main loan loss from fraud is likely to arise from Y17bn loans advanced by finance companies which were secured on forged certificates of deposit supplied by a Fuji bank employee. Mr Taizo Hashida, chairman, resigned following the discovery of the fraud. Tokai Bank, the seventh largest Japanese bank by assets, said that it had made a Y50bn specific provision to cover losses arising from a similar fraud uncovered in July. The bank has said that it will assume full responsibility for Y62.5bn loans made by finance companies to Tokai clients, although it remains unclear whether any of the loans are recoverable. The provision contributed to a 24.5 per cent cut in Tokai's profit forecast for the current financial year. The bank now expects to report pre-tax profits of Y83bn.</p>

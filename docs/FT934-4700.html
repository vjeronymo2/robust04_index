			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Record-breaking drive for Argentina's volume car makers - The recent revival in the industry despite low levels of investment and profit return Once given up for dead, Argentina's car industry is recovering rapidly. Its three volume car makers, Ciadea, Autolatina and Sevel, are breaking production records almost every month and, for the first time in decades, companies are considering investing, rather than divesting, in Argentina. GM, which pulled out of Argentina 15 years ago because of political violence and plunging sales, is investing Dollars 100m to start making pick-up trucks next year in association with Ciadea, a local company that makes Renault cars under licence. Mr Leo Kunigk, the Brazilian organising the GM project, said GM will move part of its pick-up production from the Brazilian industrial city of Sao Paulo to Cordoba. Output in the first year will be only 5,000 units but should build up to around 25,000 units in a year. Four-fifths of the pick-ups would be exported to Brazil, other South American markets and possibly the Middle East. In addition Mazda is talking to its local distributor Cirlafin about a Dollars 50m venture to assemble pick-ups in Buenos Aires. Mr Sasson Attie, Cirlafin president, says he hopes to start building 5,000 Mazda pick-ups a year towards the end of 1994, and raise output to 10,000 a year within three years. The Mazda factory, like GM's, would be equipped with imported second hand equipment. But talks between Isuzu and Argentina's Cametal to build buses in the industrial city of Santa Fe are making little progress. A company official said 'the Japanese keep saying that they're looking and studying the situation, but nothing happens. They say it's the recession in Japan, or that they are not in conditions to invest.' As for the industry as a whole, output is growing at a rapid pace. Although sales dipped 6 per cent in October, output this year should hit a record 340,000 units, one-third more than last year. Next year it is forecast to rise to 400,000 units and it should hit 500,000 units before the end of the decade. Demand is expected to remain strong as Argentines continue to replace their obsolete cars, the average age of which is estimated to be 15 years. In addition, economic growth, forecast at 5-6 per cent a year to the end of the decade, should boost sales further. However, Argentina, a country of only 32m people, is not the main objective of the manufacturers. The great prize is privileged access to the much bigger Brazilian market through the Mercosur common market, that takes in Paraguay and Uruguay as well as Argentina and Brazil. Mr Alan Acosta, an analyst at Baring Securities in Argentina, said: 'The size of the combined Mercosur market is estimated to be about 1.5m units a year and is expected to grow to 3m by the year 2000'. Trade in cars and parts between Brazil and Argentina was worth about Dollars 1bn last year. Both governments require that trade be balanced. Companies based in both countries, like Autolatina, the company that manages Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina, can meet this requirement relatively easily. But Brazil-based GM lacks a foothold in Argentina while Ciadea has no operations in Brazil. GM, which exported about 13,500 pick-ups and small cars to Argentina last year, has trouble balancing this with imports of Ciadea's cars and vans. Building pick-ups in Argentina with Ciadea and shipping them to Brazil will make it easier to balance trade. The government also hopes increased competition will help the local car industry to shape up. It is the only large industrial sector still benefiting from significant import barriers and will retain this protection until the end of the decade. As a result, the industry's costs are high and investment has been low. Despite 1992 sales of Dollars 5.09bn, the industry's trade association Adefa says investments were only about Dollars 140m. It puts investments this year at Dollars 240m. Sevel, a locally-owned company which dominates the market with Fiats and Peugeots made under licence, has invested only Dollars 160m in 1992-93, despite sales of Dollars 1.38bn in the nine months to September. Profits are thin as well. Sevel, one of Argentina's two quoted car companies, earned Dollars 52.6m to September, a margin of just 3.8 per cent over sales. However, performance at Ciadea, where Renault transferred control to local management last year, did better, with a 7 per cent margin on sales of Dollars 1bn. Sales across the industry are levelling off after their heady explosion following economic stabilisation in 1991. Although analysts are confident growth will remain steady in the coming years, Argentina is unlikely to repeat the days of the 1960s when it had 24 car manufacturers. Companies and government both say Argentina cannot compete with Brazil's lower cost, high-volume car makers. They hope instead that Argentina can attract investments in more sophisticated design and component niches as well as volume production. However, for that to happen, the industry will need a shake-up in management, a big reduction in costs, more investment and more training to raise productivity. And productivity will first have to rise to Brazil's levels and then to world levels if the industry is to survive the planned elimination of import protection in 2000.</p>

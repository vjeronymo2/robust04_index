			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> MALL PLAN LINKED TO COMMUNITY CENTER  </P> <P> The Moorpark Planning Commission has approved a plan to allow the largest  developer in the city to enlarge a proposed commercial shopping center in  exchange for building a $1-million community center elsewhere.  </P> <P> The commercial shopping center to be built by Urban West Communities, a Santa  Monica-based company, was originally approved for 7 1/2 acres, with four acres  designated in 1983 for a community building.  </P> <P> The developer got approval to scrap the community-use acreage on Monday and  build a 12-acre shopping center that will include a Ralphs supermarket, retail  stores, medical offices and a restaurant.  </P> <P> Tom Zanic, a representative of Urban West, said his company had agreed in June,  1989, to build the community center at a nearby 69-acre park. It also agreed to  donate land for a new fire station in the Mountain Meadows area of the city,  which "constitutes community use. We feel it's a trade-off," Zanic said.

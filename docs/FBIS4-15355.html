			<p>BFN     [Text] TALLINN, Apr 07, BNS - The 18th round of  Estonian-Russian negotiations April 5-6 in Moscow ended without  any result, Raul Malk, Estonian Foreign Ministry deputy  chancellor and a member of the Estonian delegation for the  talks, said today at a press conference in Tallinn.    Malk said only the humanitarian issues working group made  some progress. The two parties agreed to resume talks at the  beginning of May.    Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation and head of  the military issues working group, claimed Estonia was prepared  for increased pressure on Russia's part, considering that Latvia  and Russia initialed an agreement on social guarantees for  military pensioners.    "The course of the talks didn't alarm us, although the  Russian party demanded sharply and in the form of an ultimatum  that Estonia should sign an agreement on military retirees and  pay Russia 23 million U.S. dollars (to build housing for the  repatriated military in Russia)," Tiiman said. "Since the texts  of the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements are available to us,  we can say Russia made similar demands on us."    Tiiman claimed Russia demanded that Estonia should issue  residence permits to all retirees and "give them apartments in  perpetuity."    Estonia put at the talks the question whether Russia  considers that Estonia's legislation concerning military  pensioners is inconsistent with international law, which the  Russian delegation failed to answer. The Estonian delegation  plans at the next round of talks to ask Russia to explain the  legal basis for retiring its officers on Estonia's territory.    Russia on Wednesday in Moscow officially backed off from the  Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of its troops.    "Russia itself proposed in November the Aug. 31 deadline.  Estonia agreed to it after serious deliberation. Now Russia  deleted the date from the text of the agreement without making a  new proposal. Thus, instead of the final deadline, there's a gap  in the text of the agreement. It shows that the work of the  delegations' military issues working groups has no prospects. I  don't understand what's the purpose of our meetings," Tiiman  said.    Tiiman told the press Estonia put forward an "entirely new  idea" for dismantling the Paldiski nuclear reactors, which  Russia is at present studying. He declined to disclose the  details of the proposal.    Tiiman said the humanitarian issues working group made some  progress in discussions about the maintenance of military  graveyards, exchange of prisoners, and citizenship problems.  Russia expressed willingness to present lists of Russian  citizens residing in Estonia, he stated.    Malk told the press the April 1 incident near Petseri when  two unidentified persons killed one and wounded two Russian  border guards cast a cloud on discussions in the border issues  working group.    "The parties agreed that absence of a relevant agreement  complicates cooperation between the two countries' border  guards," Malk said. "They discussed an agreement on cooperation  between border officials, and the Estonian delegation asked for  an explanation why Russia hasn't as yet ratified the agreement  on legal cooperation."    Malk declared that so far no facts have come to light to  support the claims that the persons who murdered the Russian  border guard arrived on Russian-controlled territory from  Estonia or that they escaped to Estonia after the crime.    The economic issues working group reported no progress. The  questions it discussed included an Estonian-Russian agreement on  commercial and economic cooperation for 1994, questions of  ownership, payment of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt,  and compensation for the gold and foreign currency Russia  removed from Estonia in 1940.    Malk said Russia links economic issues with developments in  other spheres, and for that reason "there was no progress in  this group, either."    In reply to BNS' question whether Estonia will after the  failure of the 18th round of talks again consider suspending the  negotiations, Malk said a relevant political decision must be  made on the government level.    Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today at a press conference  that Estonian-Russian talks must continue. Europe's support for  Russia withdrawing its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31 is very  strong, he said.    The foreign minister claimed Russia could pull out its  troops  even sooner than by Aug. 31. "There are no real obstacles to it,  it's only Russia's political incapacity," Luik maintained. He  added that the western states would react pretty sharply if  Russia should drag its feet over the troop withdrawal.</p>

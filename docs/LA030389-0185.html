			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMAZON PLAN UPSETS ENVIRONMENTALISTS;  </P> <P> JAPAN WON'T FINANCE HIGHWAY IN RAIN FOREST  </P> <P> Japan will not fund construction of the final segment of a controversial  highway through the Amazon rain forests in Brazil, Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr.  (R-Wis.) said today.  </P> <P> Kasten said he has received assurances from Japan's ambassador to the United  States, Nobou Matsunaga, that Japan would not fund the highway, known as  BR-364. Many environmentalists oppose the project because they fear it will  harm the rain forest.  </P> <P> "The ambassador assured me the Japanese are not considering any proposal to  fund this highway," Kasten said in a statement. He said he believed pressure  from the United States had helped persuade Japan not to fund the road.  </P> <P> "I assured them that we will watch this project very closely because we intend  to ensure that basic environmental safeguards are followed if an arrangement  between the Brazilians and the Japanese develops," he said.  </P> <P> "This particular project has, over the past several years, failed almost every  (environmental) safeguard conceivable," Kasten said.  </P> <P> Kasten is senior Republican on the foreign operations subcommittee, which has  jurisdiction over U.S. funds to multilateral development banks. He said Japan,  as a leading source of development funds, had a responsibility to make sure  projects are environmentally safe.  </P></p>

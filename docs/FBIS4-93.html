			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Coalition for the Defense of the Republic  [CDR] has demanded its seat in the Transitional National  Assembly. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Agathe  Uwilingiyimana yesterday, the CDR did not beat around the bush.  It reaffirmed that its participation in the Transitional  National Assembly had already been decided in accordance with  Articles 61 and 62 of the power-sharing protocol of 19 January  1993 and the annex to the text of the code of political ethics  to which the CDR was a signatory.    The CDR letter stressed that since negotiations are over,  there is no more room for verification of respect for the  conditions stated in Article 61 of the protocol (?to) which the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] refers [passage indistinct].    Concerning the [name indistinct] criticism of the peace  accord, the CDR party stressed that no text can be perfect. It  is normal for the Arusha accord to be submitted to criticism but  that is in no way a prerogative of the CDR party. Despite the  criticism, the CDR has decided to adhere to the agreement and to  respect it in order to contribute to the restoration of real  peace and national reconciliation.    The CDR also stressed that the recent reaction of RPF Leader  Titus Rutaremana reflects an ethnic [words indistinct] RPF  officials. According to the CDR, the RPF is not interested in  the problem of the war displaced and the need for a change in  mentality in order to generate durable and real social peace  between Hutus and Tutsis. However, the CDR ideology is pacifist  and realistic because it recognizes the ethnic problem which has  been eating away at our country for centuries. The CDR  furthermore denounced the ideology of ethnic purification  preached by many extremist RPF members.    In its letter to the prime minister, the CDR also pointed  out  that the RPF is not at all empowered to demand the exclusion of  the CDR from the Transitional National Assembly and urged the  RPF to renounce once and for all its ideology of power struggle  based on vengeance and revenge.    The CDR said it could obviously not accept joining the  Transitional National Assembly later simply based on a decision  by the RPF which is exceeding its powers. The CDR reaffirmed  that it has to enter the institution from the very first day and  under the same conditions as those of the other political  parties. CDR First Vice President Sylvestre Nahimana signed for  his party.    The entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly  is  also recommended by 11 political parties which were registered  at the time of the Arusha peace accord on 4 August 1993. The 11  parties, which signed a motion of support for the entry of the  CDR in the Transitional National Assembly, said they were  motivated by a spirit of justice and fairness, and were  concerned with strict respect for the Arusha accords and the  speedy return of durable peace in Rwanda and national  reconciliation. The entry of the CDR in the Transitional  National Assembly has to be on an equal footing with the other  political forces and under the same legal conditions in  accordance with Articles 61, 80, 81, and 82 of the protocol on  power-sharing signed in Arusha, the parties stressed. [passage  omitted]    Only the Social Democratic Party, the Rwandan People's  Democratic Union, the Rwandan Socialist Party, and the  Democratic Party did not sign the motion of support for the  entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly.</p>

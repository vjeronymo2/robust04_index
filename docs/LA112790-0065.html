			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> U.S. INCREASES ITS FRAUD SUIT REVENUE  </P> <P> Defense contractors and other companies accused in civil suits of defrauding  the government paid out $257 million in fiscal 1990, the Justice Department  said.  </P> <P> It is a major jump from the $27 million collected in fiscal 1985. The False  Claims Act in 1986 began authorizing the government to recover triple damages.  It also made it easier for private citizens to bring fraud suits on behalf of  the government. In one 1990 case $34 million was recovered from a Japanese  bid-rigging cartel in the procurement of U.S. military contracts.  </P></p>

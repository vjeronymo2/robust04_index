			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Riot report raps Dinkins THE chances of Mr David Dinkins gaining re-election as mayor of New York this autumn have been hit by the publication of a report which strongly criticises his handling of four days of violent disturbances in the city in 1991. The report was drawn up for New York's Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo. It blames Mr Dinkins, also a Democrat, for failing to act decisively enough to prevent disturbances in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn from escalating into four days of violent confrontation between blacks and Jews. The report calls it 'the most extensive racial unrest in New York City in over 20 years'. The report will provide ammunition for Mr Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican candidate in the November 2 election, who lost the 1989 race to Mr Dinkins by only 2 percentage points. Crown Heights is a touchstone for two of the most important issues: allegations that Mr Dinkins is an indecisive leader, and the need for the city's mayor to ameliorate New York's perpetual racial tensions. Mr Dinkins won the 1989 poll with an estimated 35 per cent of Jewish votes, and the report could erode his standing among this important electoral bloc. His support among Hispanics may also have been weakened by the decision in May of Mr Herman Badillo, the community's Democratic elder statesman, to join the Giuliani ticket and run as the city's financial comptroller. The Crown Heights trouble was sparked off when an car driven by a Hasidic Jew went out of control and killed a seven-year-old black child. In the ensuing disturbances, a Hasidic scholar was engulfed by a black mob and stabbed to death. The report, overseen by the state's director of criminal justice, Mr Richard Girgenti, rejects allegations that Mr Dinkins had instructed police to let black youths 'vent' their anger after the child's death. But it found the mayor slow to appreciate the scale of the violence taking place in Crown Heights, a lack of effective co-ordination in the City Hall command structure, and a 'leadership vacuum' at the highest level of the police department.</p>

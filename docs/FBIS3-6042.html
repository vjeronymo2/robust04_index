			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- The planned deregulation  in June of interest rates on ordinary bank deposits may be  delayed as intra-government negotiations over the issue have hit  a snag, government sources said Monday [14 March].    The Finance Ministry and the Posts and Telecommunications  Ministry are at odds over how to set interest rates on the Posts  Ministry's ordinary postal savings, scheduled to be liberalized  in line with those on rival ordinary savings.    The Posts Ministry wants the savings' rates to be linked  with  market rates, such as certificate of deposit (CD) rates.    The Finance Ministry opposes the idea, however, and has  demanded that ordinary savings rates move in tandem with those  on ordinary deposits, to be set freely by banks from June.    The Finance Ministry has proposed that the postal savings  bear interest rates somewhat higher than the average interest  rates on ordinary deposits after deregulations come into force.    The Posts Ministry criticized the Finance Ministry for  acting  only for banks and ignoring the interests of consumers.  Market-linked rates are expected to be relatively higher than  bank-set rates.    "The Finance Ministry speaks on behalf of banks, which want  to keep ordinary deposit rates as low as possible," a Posts  Ministry official said. "The Finance Ministry should advise  banks to be less egoistic."    The sources said the deadlock in the negotiations makes it  look uncertain that a law revision required for the deregulation  can be submitted to the Diet within April, the deadline for the  change to be implemented in June as originally planned.</p>

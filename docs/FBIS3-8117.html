He also  said that this vote of confidence gives an occasion to consider  the major goals the sitting cabinet has set for itself for 1994.    The prime minister told journalists that the passage of the  budget will set in action a system of measures aimed at taking  this country out of its financial isolation through settling the  problems pertaining to the finalization of the agreement in  principle on Bulgaria's foreign debt and through attracting  foreign investments.    Prof. Berov stressed that the cabinet-sponsored programme of  December 1992 continues to be effective. This was the programme  with which the government came out in December 1992 when it was  formed on the mandate of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms and the support of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  and the New Union for Democracy (set up by defectors and  expellees of the anti-Communist Union of the Democratic Forces,  SDS).    Prof. Berov said the cabinet will concentrate its efforts on  optimizing the management and privatization of state-owned  property. Forty percent of the capital of the functioning  state-owned companies will be denationalized after parliament  adopts the mass privatization programme, the prime minister  said. He went on to say that the cabinet is developing a system  of measures designed to promote the private initiative in the  production sector, as well as a variety of other measures aimed  at the social policy in the period of structural adjustments.  One of the major goals of the Cabinet will be to bring the  inflation rate further down from 64 percent in 1993 to 35-45  percent in 1994, Prime Minister Berov said.    Prof. Berov dismissed as groundless "the statements made by  some of our (the Cabinet's) adversaries alleging that the land  reform is likely to stop across the country, that some of the  major restitution acts will be repealed, that certain members  and supporters of the SDS will be persecuted, etc." The prime  minister described these allegations as publicity stunt and said  the threats for reinstating of the former nomenklatura to top  government offices, restoration of the Soviet-style cooperative  farms, plots against the private business, a new orientation of  this country's foreign policy and an attack against the  judiciary, all these come in vain.    The prime minister in mid-January called upon the MP's to  pass the 1994 national budget bill within mid-February. The  budget was passed yesterday [28 February], according to him much  later than the deadline he had set, on the votes of the  pro-cabinet parliamentary majority.</p>

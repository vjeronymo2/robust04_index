Leyton) is a serial killer, Jeremy Corbyn (Lab. Islington North) likes nothing better than to put on a dinner jacket and go nightclubbing with Amanda de Cadenet, or that John Prescott (shadow transport secretary) has a secret collection of pressed flowers Tony Banks, Labour MP, on prospect for a dirty campaign The fetish the Labour and Liberal parties have for raising taxes seems to be very damaging - very damaging to individuals and very damaging to the country and to the business attitude that prevails in the country John Major If Labour had won in 1983, Britain would be an isolated, fly-blown Socialist banana republic, stranded on the edge of Europe, isolated from America with the highest tax levels in the western world, half its industry nationalised and no means to defend itself Chris Patten, Conservative MP for Bath Past Tory manifestoes may have had some chance of winning the Booker prize for fiction.

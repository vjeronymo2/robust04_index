			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] Despite the much-awaited coffee price increase,  coffee growers are not satisfied and insist that the 120,000  pesos [unit not given] do not even cover production costs.    [Begin recording] [Coffee grower Alfonso Lopez] I see this  as  something wicked by the government, because it is a well-known  fact that this price will never cover costs.    [Coffee grower Jairo Barragan] The price the government has  just set is not what we coffee growers expected. We are  demanding a 30 percent increase to make this profitable.    [Coffee grower Manuel Hernandez] It does not make up for the  costs involved, especially when you take into account the stalk  borer plague.    [Coffee grower Aurelio Suarez] The truth is that this  government was unable to resolve the coffee problem.    [Unidentified reporter] What are you going to do now?    [Coffee grower Jose Acosta] Go hungry. What use is this  increase?    [Coffee grower Enrique Angel Mejia] We are disenchanted and  worried about the new coffee prices because to balance out  production costs and income the increase should have been at  least double.

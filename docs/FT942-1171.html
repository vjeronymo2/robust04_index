			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Float values UCM at Pounds 19m The weak stock market has not stopped Universal Ceramic Materials' flotation plans as the manufacturer of refractory and heating element products yesterday announced it had placed 6.97m shares at 86p, giving it a value of Pounds 19m. UCM has had to compromise, however, on the amount of new cash it can raise. Against hopes of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 10m, it will raise just Pounds 6m. After redemption of preference shares and expenses it will receive some Pounds 2m. Mr Bob Hughes, chief executive, said that though the climate had been difficult, he was delighted with the outcome of the placing. Sponsors Beeson Gregory had managed to get the placing away with a price comparable to expectations just a day later than planned, after discussions with Scottish institutions earlier in the week. Delaying the flotation any longer would have hindered plans to expand alumina capacity, to prepare for the withdrawal from the continental European market of two large competitors, he said. UCM reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 683,000 to Pounds 1.7m for 1993 on sales 12 per cent higher at Pounds 26.7m. Mr Hughes said sales in the current year were ahead of 1993. After flotation, the company expects to be less than 20 per cent geared. The board, which is selling 872,094 shares, is expected to hold 15 per cent of UCM. A consortium of venture capitalists will hold 40 per cent.</p>

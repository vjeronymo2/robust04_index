			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: French bank gives terms of FFr1.5bn share issue CREDIT Foncier de France, the French banking group, yesterday joined the queue of companies tapping the Paris stock market for capital by announcing the terms of a FFr1.5bn share issue. The group, which said it had decided to raise capital to 'increase our financial capacity and to help us with our development', is issuing 1.48m new shares at FFr1,000 each. Under the terms of the issue, Credit Foncier's existing shareholders will be given preferential rights to subscribe for one new share for every seven already held. Credit Foncier, like other French banks, has recently come under pressure because of the recession. It previously announced a 14.4 per cent fall in interim net profits, to FFr404m (Dollars 68.13m) for the first half of 1993 from FFr472m in the same period last year. However, the group also confirmed its performance was likely to improve in the second half, thereby producing a more favourable result for the full financial year. The announcement of the FFr1.5bn issue follows the launch of similar capital-raising exercises by other French companies, including the BSN food group, the Lafarge-Coppee building materials concern and Schneider, the electrical engineers. They have timed their issues to take advantage of buoyancy in the Paris stock market.</p>

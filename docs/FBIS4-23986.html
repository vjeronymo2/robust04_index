			<p>BFN     [Text] In view of the increase in incidents in northern  Mali and the problems of implementing the national pact, the  question of redeployment of the army in the region is a  prominent issue right now. We have the noncommital remarks of  Malian Defense Minister Diocounda Traore, speaking to Muriel  Pomponne:    [Begin recording] [Traore] The national pact provides a  unique framework for resolving this crisis in the northern part  of the country, and we believe there is no alternative.    [Pomponne] So there is to be no military management of the  crisis, but instead political management of it?    [Traore] Not exclusively military handling of the crisis,  but  basically political handling of it. There is no special  redeployment of the armed forces in the north. We are still  occupying the same locations, the same positions. We have not  occupied any new positions.    [Pomponne] Has there been any increase in the number of men  deployed in the north during the last few weeks?    [Traore] Yes, certainly, in line with the strengthening of  security in the north, it is quite normal that we should  reinforce the units we have on the spot there to some extent so  that they can handle their obligations better.

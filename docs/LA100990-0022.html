			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY AT UC IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE  </P> <P> Two important events took place Sunday afternoon in the Irvine Barclay Theatre,  on the edge of the campus at UC Irvine:  </P> <P> First, the new auditorium, an elegant, 756-seat hall costing $17.6 million,  hosted its first complete musical event.  </P> <P> Then, the South Coast Symphony, under its founder/conductor, John Larry  Granger, inaugurated a second series in an acoustical venue clearly more  beneficial to its musical pretensions than the problematic auditorium at Orange  Coast College, where it has been resident since 1984.  </P> <P> Both events promise much for the future.  </P> <P> The new Cheng Hall, its welcoming interior handsome in dusky rose, all of its  seats within 60 feet of the proscenium arch, is a most pleasant room, with  lively but not strident acoustics and good sight-lines.  </P> <P> With its programming mandated to be divided equally between university,  community and commercial uses, the Irvine Barclay facility can be an important  cultural center in an area which has long needed an auditorium of this size --  not to mention audience comfort.  </P> <P> Granger's orchestra, a professional ensemble which has struggled with the  sizable but unflattering Robert B. Moore Theater at OCC all these years,  deserves the kind of musical help the new hall gives it. And every orchestra  tends to perform better at a second performance -- which this one was, the  ensemble's Costa Mesa season having begun the night before at OCC.  </P> <P> Solid, characterful playing marked the entire performance, devoted to three  contrasting works, Ralph Vaughan Williams' "Serenade to Music," the Piano  Concerto by Aram Khachaturian and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  </P> <P> In the Fifth, Granger took unexceptionable tempos, enforced them with  gentlemanly ease and let the entire work unfold with compelling logic and  fluency. Except for some scrappiness in the exposing slow movement, his  orchestra played with tight balances, admirable ensemble values and strong  soloism. And this reading climaxed, as it should but does not always, with a  finale direct and unswerving in its impact.  </P> <P> In the Concerto, veteran pianist Leonard Pennario was the splendid,  communicative and high-energy soloist, making what is certainly a cheap and  tawdry piece seem almost elegant.  </P> <P> The full house in the new theater cheered Pennario relentlessly after the  concerto, and was rewarded with two encores: Scriabin's Prelude in D-flat for  Left-Hand Alone, and Louis Moreau Gottschalk's "Le Banjo."  </P> <P> Vaughan Williams' cherishable Serenade for orchestra and singers opened the  proceedings appropriately. Here, the instrumental ensemble was assisted by the  three-dozen members of the Lee Vail Singers and soloists Pamela Chapin, Nina  Edwards, Leland Vail and Royce Reynolds. Granger presided over a mellow and  noble performance.  </P></p>

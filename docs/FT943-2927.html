			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: APV APV's troubles have hit the company just when economic recovery should have been restoring margins. In that sense, the disappointment is similar to that engendered by BTR last week. Clearly the climate in engineering is such as to leave companies vulnerable to margin erosion, but the APV case has quite specific origins. Its German competitor GEA is determined to win market share in liquid food processing machinery and no one knows how long it will keep up the pressure. If APV can be faulted for not latching on to the risk sooner, yesterday's measures seem a reasonable response. The sharp cut in the dividend will conserve cash. APV has no choice but to restructure the liquid food business if it is to compete with GEA's prices. It is a daunting task just the same. While APV has been paying an uncovered dividend for the last four years, it has been able to maintain its stated net worth by realising goodwill through disposals. There is not much of that hidden value left to exploit, so the restructuring provision will eat into reserves. With interest cover a mere 2.9 times in the first half, APV will struggle to stay within its banking covenants. Perhaps the sensible solution would be to solicit a bid. Arguably a market value including debt of less than Pounds 300m is low for a company with turnover of Pounds 900m. Although a bidder from within the industry might fall foul of competition regulations, an outsider might find APV's industrial businesses attractive. But it would be a daring buy while the pressure on liquid food margins continues.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Satoshi Isaka: ``Opponents Want To Limit Life of </F> Nuclear Treaty; Current Pact Viewed as Unequal, Outmoded'']    [Text] The problem of North Korea, coupled with Japan's  active policy of using plutonium for domestic energy production,  has created an outburst of Western speculation about the  possibility of a nuclear Japan. As a result, one might conclude  that all Japanese have become enthusiastic supporters of the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a way to dispel what many  view as totally unfounded suspicions.    That, however, is not entirely the case. Although the  Japanese government has firmly maintained its support for  extending the treaty indefinitely beyond 1995, when it is due  for renewal, other influential people --including scientists,  some lawmakers and the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- argue  that the pact should not be extended without correcting what  they feel are its gross inequalities.    The treaty was established in 1970 to prevent additional  countries from acquiring or developing nuclear weapons. But  Japanese critics say Tokyo should make its support for extension  of the pact conditional on more efforts by existing nuclear  powers to shrink or eliminate their own nuclear arsenals.    ``If you want to build a truly effective non-proliferation  regime, the real question will be how to let countries like  India, Pakistan and Israel into the system,'' said Kumao Kaneko,  a professor of international relations at Tokai University and a  former director of the Foreign Ministry's nuclear energy  division. The three countries have so far refused to sign the  treaty.  <H5>  Doubly Unfair </H5>   He is not alone in sympathizing with such nations, which  have  resisted international pressure to join the treaty on the ground  that the declared nuclear powers -- China, France, Russia, the  UK and the U.S. -- have not done enough to cut their own atomic  weapons, as required by Article 6 of the treaty.    The current pact is doubly unfair, developing nations  contend, because unlike other signatories, the five declared  nuclear powers are under no obligation to accept international  inspections of their nuclear facilities. And it is practically  impossible to rectify this situation because the consent of all  five is needed to amend the treaty, critics point out.    ``The veto power of the five nations is clearly a problem,''  Ryukichi Imai, who represented Japan at a disarmament conference  in Geneva, told a recent international forum in Tokyo.    Looking back over the past 25 years, some important but  unexpected developments, such as the breakup of the Soviet  Union, have occurred, which demonstrate the treaty's inadequacy,  he said adding, ``You cannot guarantee that similar things will  never happen in the next 25 years.''    Imai thus objects to an indefinite extension of the treaty.  Instead, he said: ``We can extend it by another 25 years. After  that, we can take another look at the system.''    Annette Schaper, a nuclear physicist at Germany's Peace  Research Institute Frankfurt, agreed. ``The extension of the  treaty should be ... linked to nuclear disarmament,'' she said  at the Tokyo forum.    Even some Japanese government officials are resentful of the  existing regime's shortcomings. In fact, one of the main reasons  that the government failed to clarify its stance over extension  of the treaty by the time of the G-7 summit last July in Tokyo  -- which initially stirred overseas speculation about Japan's  nuclear intentions -- was that many Japanese officials had  difficulty with the tendency of the declared nuclear powers to  stress non-proliferation while showing relative indifference to  nuclear disarmament and security guarantees for non-nuclear  states.  <H5>  Classic Dilemma </H5>   To the Japanese officials, the issue of strengthening the  treaty poses a classic dilemma of making a transition from an  imperfect to perfect world.    ``I very much understand the sentiment of those developing  nations who complain about the (treaty's) unfairness,'' said  Akira Hayashi, director general for arms control and scientific  affairs at the Foreign Ministry.    However, if Japan makes its support for extension of the  pact  conditional on nuclear disarmament, this would encourage other  nations to harden their stance against the existing agreement,  he said. ``This would undermine the chances of even extending  the treaty for a short period. And it is better to have an  imperfect regime than no regime at all.''</p>

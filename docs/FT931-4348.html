			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wider use granted for Zeneca drug ZENECA, Imperial Chemical Industries' fully-owned bioscience subsidiary, has received a licence in the US for Diprivan, its anaesthetic, to be used for intensive care purposes. The drug, one of Zeneca's three fastest-growing compounds, is already available in the US for use for surgical applications. World-wide sales rose by nearly 50 per cent last year to more than Pounds 140m. Zeneca is stressing the need to obtain new indications for existing products as a means of generating growth. Dr Tom McKillop, Zeneca pharmaceuticals technical director, said recently that the company expected seven new indications to be approved this year. 'Pharmaceutical R&amp;D is not only about submissions for new chemical entities. You must ensure you get the very best from your existing products,' he said. Zeneca's drug division needs its three newer products, Zestril, a heart medicine, Zoladex, a cancer treatment and Diprivan to compensate for falling sales of Tenormin, its heart drug. In the 12 months after its US patents expired, American sales fell by about 50 per cent. ICI shareholders will vote in May on whether Zeneca should be completely separated from ICI. Zeneca is scheduled to make a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue in June.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Veto hits California budget deal CALIFORNIA'S Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a key bill yesterday, threatening to unravel a compromise budget aimed at ending the state's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Reuter reports from Sacramento. The Republican governor, who had strong-armed legislators into accepting most of his demands in a Dollars 57bn (Pounds 28.6bn) austerity budget, contended the education bill could result in a Dollars 1.9bn deficit. The Democratic-controlled legislature had passed the measure needed to complete the budget package and wipe out a Dollars 10.7bn deficit. Mr Wilson's veto did not immediately sink the budget plan, but he has vowed not to sign the overall spending package until enabling legislation has been passed. After weeks of haggling the governor and the legislature have come to terms on other deep spending cuts - Dollars 1.7bn from health and welfare programmes and Dollars 1.3bn from aid to local governments. California has been without a budget since July 1, when the legislature failed to pass a new spending package on time and the richest US state ran out of money.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / China set to top 13% growth: Rate of increase would be world's fastest for second successive year China's economy is likely to have produced the world's fastest growth rate in 1993 for the second successive year, in spite of the government's attempts to slow the pace and prevent overheating. Several western economists who recently visited China expect the economy to show 13.2 per cent growth in 1993, slightly faster than last year's 12.8 per cent pace. It is driven by huge growth in industrial output and by massive investment, with about Dollars 20bn pouring into the economy this year from foreigners alone. The economists are cautiously optimistic, however, that the Chinese government will succeed in slowing the pace of growth to about 10 per cent during the first half of 1994, and will avoid a 'hard landing'. Mr Cyril Lin, fellow of St Anthony's College, Oxford, said: 'We're going to see modest growth in the first half, mainly because the first half of 1993 was so strong.' Another senior economist said most Chinese leaders appeared united on the need to stabilise growth. He said the 16-point programme introduced at mid year to cool the economy 'seems to be working' but admitted there was 'a big if about monetary policy'. The economists believe that, while concerns about inflation remain, they should not be exaggerated. Fears have recently been expressed that the partial relaxation of monetary policy ordered in the autumn by Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier and central bank governor, will cause the economic boom to run out of control and force the government to take austerity measures later in 1994 to curb inflation. Mr Zhu admitted this week that the government, which had tightened credit in July to curb the most speculative aspects of the boom, had so far failed to control growth in money supply and investment in fixed assets. The Beijing municipal authorities have re-imposed controls on prices of grain, cooking oil and eggs because of recent sharp rises. Inflation in larger cities is above 20 per cent. There have been signs of inflationary psychology - for example, farmers holding back goods in expectation of further price rises. However, the economists do not believe that indicates the kind of panic buying and loss of belief in government policy that presaged previous crackdowns. Mr Zhu's easing of monetary policy in autumn has not yet had an impact on the inflation rate, but is likely to do so in the first quarter of 1994. The economists believe the government's expected 9 per cent target for 1994 inflation is unrealistically low, but that inflation will not run out of control. Strong political pressure forced Mr Zhu to go back partly on the tightening of credit. Even healthy state-owned enterprises were running out of money to pay wages. However, the economists believe the easing has been selective, that Mr Zhu's programme to slow the economy essentially remains in place, and that he is showing himself determined to press ahead with financial and economic reforms. Those include radical changes to the tax system during 1994 which are likely to contribute to the cooling of the economy. Local governments will have less revenue available.</p>

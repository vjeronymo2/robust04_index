			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's inflation put at 1.4% Norway's consumer price index rose by 0.2 per cent in July from June, the country's central statistics bureau said yesterday. This brought the year-on-year inflation rate to 1.4 per cent. According to the bureau, the rise in food prices recorded in the past couple of months has slowed, with an annual increase of 1.3 per cent in July, compared with 1.8 per cent in June. Meanwhile, oil and tobacco showed noteworthy price rises in July. The bureau said tobacco rose because of higher taxation, oil because of higher crude prices. Commercial bankruptcies in Switzerland rose 6.2 per cent to 580 in July from a year earlier, the highest number since 1974 when Schweizerischer Verband Creditreform, an association of Swiss banks, began collecting data. Creditreform, which gives banks information on borrowers' creditworthiness, also reported 3,326 commercial bankruptcy proceedings in the first seven months, a decline of 3.3 per cent from the same period last year.</p>

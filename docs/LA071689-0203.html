			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THEIR COURT;  </P> <P> U.S. DAVIS CUP TEAM TO KEEP FAST COMPANY WITH BECKER-LED WEST GERMANS  </P> <P> What all started as a simple revenge match five months ago in Florida is  getting to be serious stuff for the United States Davis Cup tennis team. No  more beating up on 98-pound weaklings from Paraguay. No more flogging of frail  Frenchmen.  </P> <P> Nope, it's the big leagues now, the heavy hitters from West Germany. Even  though it is only a semifinal, it has the feel of Dempsey-Firpo, the smell of  Yankees-Dodgers.  </P> <P> Indeed, it is quite a journey this U.S. team has taken -- from Hugo Chapacu to  Boris Becker.  </P> <P> Today, when Captain Tom Gorman leads his group of John McEnroe, Andre Agassi,  Ken Flach and Robert Seguso through its first practice session at historic  Olympia Halle in Munich, the week of hype and hope will be underway.  </P> <P> Friday, in front of a sold-out arena of 11,000 fans, many of whom paid $300 a  ticket for the three-day session, McEnroe and Agassi will play singles against  Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb, and the first punches in this anticipated  best-of-five donnybrook will be thrown.  </P> <P> Saturday, Flach and Seguso will play Becker and Eric Jelen in doubles, and  Sunday, the reverse singles from Friday will be held. The order of the singles  is determined in a draw Thursday.  </P> <P> ESPN will televise much of the action, starting with 2 1/2 hours Friday at 6  p.m., Pacific time, and continuing with 3 hours on Saturday, starting at 9  a.m., and 2 1/2 hours Sunday, starting at 1:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Clearly, the United States and Gorman face a tremendous challenge.  </P> <P> First, they are facing the team that won last year's Davis Cup, and did so by  beating a Mats Wilander-Stefan Edberg team on Sweden's home court. Part of the  charm and part of the controversy of Davis Cup tennis is that visiting teams  win about as often as sports teams from Atlanta. So the Germans' final-round  win in Sweden was a shocker.  </P> <P> Next, the United States must play on the surface chosen by the home team. For  this match, Nikki Pilic, West German team captain, went with a carpet-like  surface called Pegulan. Gorman isn't happy with the choice, saying that it is a  surface almost never played on by the pros; that a Davis Cup surface should at  least be something vaguely familiar to the players.  </P> <P> The reason for Pilic's choice of that surface is the third reason this is such  a tough challenge for the U.S. team. That reason is named Becker.  </P> <P> Becker just won his third Wimbledon title. His game has never been better, nor  has his popularity rating in West Germany.  </P> <P> And his serve-and-volley game was made for fast surfaces, such as Wimbledon's  grass and the Olympia Halle's Pegulan carpet. Pegulan reportedly is not as fast  as grass, but it may be neck-and-neck with an ice rink. Becker's 115-m.p.h.  serves that looked like bullets at Wimbledon may slow all the way down to  Gretzky slap shots in Munich.  </P> <P> For the U.S. team, the road to Munich started in February in Ft. Myers, Fla.,  where the Americans swept Paraguay in a match that slopped over into silliness  in terms of revenge and patriotism.  </P> <P> The United States had been out of the main draw since 1987, mostly because of a  stunning loss in Paraguay.  </P> <P> That match turned when Jimmy Arias lost a controversial five-set match to an  unheralded and relatively unskilled player named Hugo Chapacu, amid  drum-beating and rock-throwing. So when the Paraguayans got to Florida, they  were treated like the Indians treated Custer.  </P> <P> Not only were they beaten, 5-0, winning only two sets, but the whole thing took  on the air of some sort of nationalistic pep rally. Agassi, a bit too young to  know any better, acted as if he were pushing the flag upright on Iwo Jima.  </P> <P> In April, France came to San Diego. This time, Gorman substituted veteran  McEnroe for little known Michael Chang, who hadn't quite reached his 17th  birthday at the time of the Paraguay match and was deemed to be "too  inexperienced" for quality competition.  </P> <P> That, of course, was before Chang won the French Open and prompted Gorman, who  is sticking with McEnroe and Agassi for the West Germany match, to poke fun at  himself for "probably being the only Davis Cup captain in history to leave a  French Open champion off his team."  </P> <P> Against the French -- both Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte were slowed a bit by  injuries -- McEnroe and Agassi were spectacular, as were the ever-present Flach  and Seguso, and the United States won again, 5-0.  </P> <P> Next weekend's match brings to mind West Germany's 3-2 win over the U.S. team  in Hartford, Conn., in 1987. In that match, Becker beat McEnroe in a 6-hour  20-minute thriller and Jelen dealt the United States its death blow by  upsetting Tim Mayotte.  </P> <P> Were the United States to win this weekend, the final would be played against  the Sweden-Yugoslavia winner Dec. 15-17 in the 21,000-seat Coliseum at  Charlotte, N.C.  </P> <P> Although the Germans are the apparent favorite, Gorman is talking positive and  stressing that McEnroe is playing well and has a strong supporting cast.  </P> <P> "McEnroe is McEnroe," Gorman said, "and Agassi and Flach and Seguso have never  lost a Davis Cup match."  </P> <P> And Agassi adds, "If we're gonna win the Davis Cup, we've got to beat Becker  and the Germans, and we've got to do it on whatever surface, even if it's the  Autobahn."  </P> <P> Sven Busch of the German Press Agency DPA contributed to this story.  </P></p>

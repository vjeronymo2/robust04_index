The rabbi also ruled that Muslim tourism to the site should not  be encouraged.    Our correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld reports that the  halakhic  edict stated that Muslim tourists endangered the existence of  the Jewish people in their country.    Meanwhile, Waqf officials in Jerusalem said they would  continue to bar Israelis and tourists from entering the Temple  Mount. Israel Police, on the other hand, said that it was  preventing the entry of Israelis and tourists out of operational  considerations. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that  representatives from the police and the Jerusalem Municipality  met yesterday with Waqf officials on the matter.    [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 23 March in a page  14  report by Shlomo Naqdimon reports that "Former Chief Rabbi  Shlomo Goren yesterday said that `Masada could repeat itself in  Hebron.'" The paper notes that Rabbi Goren "warned that the  evacuation of the Jewish settlers from Hebron would end in  bloodshed." Goren added that "the Jews in Hebron must hang on  by their nails. They must on no account agree to be evacuated.  I am hereby declaring that I will stand at their side when this  happens. I am ready to give my life together with them and to  resist any attempt to evacuate them." YEDI'OT AHARONOT goes on  to explain that "in Masada, the defenders of the Jewish fortress  preferred to commit mass suicide rather than surrender to the  Roman conqueror."]</p>

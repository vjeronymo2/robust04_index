Coopers &amp; Lybrand reported that the government of northern Cyprus was close to agreeing to hand over the hotels to their lawful owners - Voyager Kibris Ltd (VKL), part of Polly Peck International.

The government had threatened to terminate the hotels' leases unless outstanding rent of Dollars 97,000 was paid by Monday.

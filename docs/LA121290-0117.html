			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 15 DIE, 50 HURT AS THICK FOG TRIGGERS 75-VEHICLE PILEUP  </P> <P> Two chain-reaction crashes in dense fog on a highway in southeastern Tennessee  killed 15 people Tuesday, injured more than 50 and left the roadway looking  like a war zone.  </P> <P> A morning fog covered Interstate 75 over the Hiwassee River, about 40 miles  north of Chattanooga, when the 75-vehicle pileup began about 9:30 a.m., said  Cecil Whaley, director of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.  </P> <P> People involved in the accident, which covered more than a mile of the  interstate, described hearing booms in the fog as dozens of tractor-trailers  collided with each other and with cars.  </P> <P> Traveling salesman Ralph Fisher, 43, of Cleveland, Tenn., was headed north when  he hit the fog patch. He said he noticed traffic slowing down, so he pulled to  the roadside.  </P> <P> "After that I started hearing bangs and booms from everywhere. Immediately  after that there was a truck on fire from across the road. We stared hearing  them banging and booming from over there. Then, all of a sudden, you started  hearing them from everywhere," Fisher said.  </P> <P> Whaley confirmed 15 dead but said the number could rise as crews searched the  burned shells of vehicles. In some cases, only nameplates distinguished the  wreckage of cars smashed into the sides of trucks.  </P> <P> "This is one of the worst accidents that anyone can remember happening in  Tennessee, in terms of the number of vehicles and fatalities involved," said  Whaley, who followed rescue efforts from his Nashville office.  </P> <P> Names of the victims could not be immediately released because some of the  bodies were burned beyond recognition, Whaley said.  </P> <P> Authorities believe that an initial accident occurred in the southbound lanes  and that cars jumping the median or people rubbernecking to see the southbound  crash may have caused the second pileup in the northbound lanes.  </P> <P> "There's unbelievable stories of tremendous bravery," Whaley said.  "Firefighters were dragging out people whose trucks were on fire. They were  getting them out just ahead of the flames.  </P> <P> "There were a number of motorists who stopped to help. They were taking off  their own clothes to bandage people. People were actually on fire, and they  were beating out the flames."  </P> <P> Russell Newman, eastern district regional director of the Tennessee Emergency  Medical Agency, says no one is really sure what happened.  </P> <P> "It's just a conjecture as to what caused it, but it was just one of those damn  chain-reaction collisions that happen in this kind of situation -- very heavy  fog and probably too much speed," Newman said.  </P> <P> In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was dispatching  a team of six experts in highway and hazardous-material investigations.  </P></p>

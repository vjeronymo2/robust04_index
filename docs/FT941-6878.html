			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Defiant double act shows a softer side: A look at Sinn Fein's mood at its conference The overtly uncompromising stance to emerge at Sinn Fein's party conference, held in a cramped community centre outside Dublin at the weekend, will not be an immediate source of encouragement to the British and Irish governments. Any lingering hopes that the political wing of the IRA would hail the Downing Street declaration as the key to ending violence in Northern Ireland were quickly dashed. Sinn Fein, as expected, decided neither to reject nor to approve the declaration and instead insisted that the UK government reopen direct talks to 'clarify' what it considers the key issues of self-determination and the 'unionist veto'. In a defiant double-act, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the party's national executive, made an elaborate display of unity following suggestions that the leadership was divided on the way ahead. Mr McGuinness won one of the weekend's biggest ovations when he insisted from the platform: 'There is not the slightest possibility of a split.' Both men repeatedly attacked the British government for breaking off its secret talks with Sinn Fein and dismissed threats of a security crackdown if the party rejected the joint declaration. Mr McGuinness, to cheers and applause from a packed hall of delegates, said: 'What are they going to do? Are they going to murder us? We've had that. Are they going to intern us? We've had that . . . we are not afraid of it.' Mr Adams described the UK government's attitude as 'despicable, devious and damnable . . . marked by diversions, lies and petty manoeuvrings'. So much for republican barnstorming. But behind this hard-line rhetoric seemingly designed to reassure the party hardliners that Ireland's reunification remains the goal, there are clear signs that Sinn Fein and the IRA are willing to explore further the Downing Street declaration and to keep the momentum of the peace process going. The central concern of Sinn Fein is the 'unionist veto', by which it means the joint declaration's guarantee to uphold the wish of the majority in Northern Ireland to any constitutional change. Sinn Fein's demand for direct talks with the British government is to clarify whether unionists would be allowed to refuse to reach any agreement at round-table talks, following an IRA ceasefire, and that any political progress towards new constitutional arrangements would then stagnate. Mr Adams, highlighting this concern in his speech, said: 'Is it unreasonable to ask the British government what process, timeframe and framework it proposes for reaching such agreement? Is it unreasonable to ask in advance what would be its reaction if any section of the people who inhabit our island refused to seek such agreement?' Mr McGuinness says Sinn Fein has been assured by Dublin that the British government appears happy with the Irish government's view that the unionists would not have a veto over reaching an agreement. If this could be cleared up in direct talks with the British government, he says, the impasse could be broken and an IRA ceasefire could follow. He is encouraged by recent speeches made by British ministers which he said showed the UK government was 'grappling with new realities'. He added: 'On the one hand they show a hard and stern face, and on the other there are clear signs that many of them are troubled by Britain's role in Ireland.' Sinn Fein's own 'hard and stern face' is similarly showing signs of softening. Mr McGuinness said: 'We must also grapple with new realities. We need to talk to the British government about this and how we can do that.' In a frank admission, Mr Adams acknowledged that Sinn Fein was 'the weaker party in the conflict' and that to move forward it needed to work together with the Irish government and other nationalist parties 'even though we are rivals'. As all these insist on an end to the IRA violence, implicit in Mr Adams' statement is a possible growing realisation that the nationalist goal may now be better served through purely political means rather than military ones. Strengthening the nationalist cause, he said, 'means local republican activists being able to represent and speak for our communities in conditions of peace, uninterfered with by the British military or the RUC, free of personal harassment and free from the threat of the death squads'. At the end of the conference Mr Joe Cahill, a republican veteran, said that Sinn Fein's rallying cry of 'Our day will come' was now obsolete. Now it was 'Our day is here'. But the reality is that Sinn Fein, buoyed up by its recent centre-stage performance, is threatened with a return to the shadows unless it is prepared to take further risks. A weekend opinion poll showed that, in spite of huge efforts to win publicity for its cause, public support remains minimal. As Mr Adams admitted, the next step in Northern Ireland is far from certain. In words even British ministers might support he suggested the situation was of such potential political fluidity that 'not us, the British or Dublin governments can accurately predict the outcome'.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Gartmore cuts bond fund charges Gartmore, the investment management group, reduced charges on its International Fixed Interest Fund this week. The initial charge has been cut from 5 per of the offer price to 3.5 per cent and the annual management charge reduced from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent of the value of the fund. The move follows other cuts by Gartmore this year: in May it eliminated the initial charge on its UK Index Fund and in July reduced start-up charges on its Peps, while introducing exit charges.</p>

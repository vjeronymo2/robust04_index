			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Councillors cluster round government honeypot: How a city is preparing its claim for funds to redevelop part of its centre THE CITY of Leicester is racing for a place at a government honeypot called City Challenge Two. The city's council, community groups, charities, educational institutions and business leaders are talking about what will go into a 5,000-word document appealing for Pounds 37.5m, spread over five years, out of that pot. Leicester is one of a possible total of 57 competitors for Urban Programme funds from the environment department programme to revive rundown areas. But only 20 can win. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, has taken Pounds 150m a year out of his departmental budget for urban renewal and will make those funds available to the councils which can produce the best schemes concentrated on specified geographical areas and involving all sections of the local communities. This is City Challenge, the first round of which took place last year on an experimental basis. It is the government's main innovation in urban policy. In spite of reservations about the competitive nature of City Challenge, local authorities have responded energetically. What is happening in Leicester is being mirrored up and down the country. Leicester City Council, in fact, was irritated that it had not been invited to take part in the first City Challenge. Shortly after his appointment as the council's chief executive, Mr Imtiaz Farookhi seized the opportunity of a visit last summer by Mr Heseltine for a quiet word. He won an informal undertaking that Leicester could compete in City Challenge Two. Work on the bid for funds started last August. There was little discussion about the area of the city to be the subject of the City Challenge bid. It was about 500 acres of inner Leicester based on Bede Island. Work on the area had already been done: plans for redevelopment had been discussed during the late 1980s with British Urban Developments, a consortium of contracting companies which is now defunct. 'It is not the most deprived area of the city, but in terms of matching problems and potential, it is likely to be the most effective (for City Challenge),' said Ms Sue Sanford, co-ordinator of the bid. The area around Bede Island is a jumble. In the middle is Leicester Polytechnic, which is squeezed for space, and anxious to develop its campus and improve its student housing. Leicester University is on the eastern edge. There are three scrapyards with their attendant environmental problems. There is a canalised river running through it - 'a potential tourist route, but nobody stops on it,' said Ms Sanford. Traffic is also a continuing difficulty. About 10,000 people live in the area. Unemployment has risen to about 15 per cent and many of those who do have jobs are on low pay. There is a host of small employers. Ethnic minorities make up about 25 per cent of the local population, slightly below the city's average of 30 per cent. Having defined the area, the next step was to set up an organisation which could draw up a development plan. 'We knew it had to be a partnership, so we made contact with the voluntary sector, the university, the poly, the heath authority and so on,' Ms Sanford said. A steering group was established and had its first meeting last October. 'It has taken longer to get local employers on board,' Ms Sanford said. The main reason was of the number of small employers, but the contacts were made through the Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Asian Businessmen. The 40 voluntary groups active in the area formed their own consortium, and quickly produced a blueprint of the overall needs of the area. The steering group was slimmed down to form a co-ordinating group consisting of the city council's leader and chief executive, the leader of the county council and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, the private sector and the voluntary groups, with others called in when needed. By last November, the co-ordinating group was calling for proposals from the community. From the 300 proposals which arrived, and from the comments which emerged at public meetings held in January and earlier this month, themes and concerns about Bede Island began to emerge. They included housing, traffic, the environment, better play and child-care facilities, more jobs, better training facilities, a higher level of health care and crime prevention. Now the pressure is to decide what goes into the 5,000 words which will outline the Leicester City Challenge proposal. The final document will have to list aims, means and costs. There will be some large property projects, probably including, for example, new science parks close to the educational institutions and a new football ground for Leicester City. There will also be many smaller projects in an attempt to answer the concerns already voiced in the community. Time is running out. The final bid has to be at the Department of Environment by 5pm on April 22, shortly after the general election. Leicester will do the work at Bede Island, even if does not win a place at the honeypot. The work will just take longer.</p>

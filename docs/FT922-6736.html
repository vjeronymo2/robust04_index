			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sky's the limit for airport information Airport arrival and departure displays provide important information to passengers about flights, but behind the scenes flight and other information is used by everyone from the airport controllers to service suppliers and accountants. Often this has meant re-keying information, which is costly and increases the risk of error. But Sign2000, designed by Sheffield-based Sanderson Computers, is a computerised information display and management system which allows users to access the information as required. The first installation at Newcastle Airport provides arrival and departure information, gate departure data, aircraft parking and weather information for flights. The system can also control baggage carousels and provide information to airport suppliers like aviation fuel and catering operators. Sanderson Computers: UK, 0741 434373.</p>

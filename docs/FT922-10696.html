			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Pledge to cut total of long-term jobless THE French government yesterday committed itself to bring down long-term unemployment, which now accounts for some 920,000 out of the jobless total of 2.8m. Meanwhile, the budget ministry indicated partial privatisations of state-owned companies should bring in an extra FFr10bn (Pounds 1bn) which could be channelled into the attack on unemployment. But the ministry did not specify which companies might be earmarked. The unemployment plan, described in yesterday's cabinet meeting by Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy as 'unprecedented', will ensure every long-term unemployed person will be interviewed between now and October, and offered a job, a training or some form of community service. The government believes about a quarter of those unemployed for over a year have some qualification which should help find them a job fairly quickly, while another 20-25 per cent need extra training. Some of the least qualified could be offered part-time community service work at a minimum wage. Mr Georges Pebereau, president of Marceau, the French property company, has been charged with failure to disclose adequate information to the French stock market authorities on share dealings during his company's raid on Societe Generale, the French bank, in 1988. Six other people have been charged with insider dealing during the raid, including Mr Jean-Charles Naouri, a former senior aide to Mr Pierre Beregovoy.</p>

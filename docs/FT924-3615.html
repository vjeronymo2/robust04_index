			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (5): The pains of adjustment - Russian Jews TWO and a half years after the beginning of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, many of the 450,000 newcomers often still feel lost and helpless in their struggle for full and successful absorption into Israeli life, writes EFRAT SHVILY. As a group, however, the immigrants have quickly made a big impact on society and politics. Most striking was their significant contribution to the change of government in the June 1992 elections. The big immigrant vote for the Labour party is commonly explained by economic hardship and high unemployment which the newcomers associated with the Likud government and which is the biggest obstacle to smooth integration into society of a group that is now Israel's largest ethnic community. In June 1992 immigrants were a quarter of 195,000 unemployed Israelis. Absorption Ministry data show that among 150,000 immigrant breadwinners, only 70,000 are employed, two thirds of them not in their professions and often in minimum-wage jobs. Another 30,000 are still enrolled in Hebrew schools or undergoing vocational training. Fears two years ago of an ethno-social 'explosion' between newcomers and Israelis over competition for jobs have not been fulfilled. The two groups found themselves 'sailing in the same boat of hardship and unemployment,' says Moshe Lisak, sociology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. But lack of work is a key grievance of immigrants. Marina and Yuri, both in their mid-30s, immigrated to Israel from Georgia two years ago. They live in one of Haifa's suburbs and are unemployed now. For several months they worked not in their professions. Marina, a lawyer, worked as a supermarket cashier and Yuri, a car electrician, worked as a plumber. But pay was too low to keep them in unsatisfactory jobs. Marina, who is currently enrolled in a lawyers' training course, says she has no hope of finding work in her profession even after she graduates. 'There are no jobs out there. I am taking this course for the lack of anything better to do,' she says. She believes, however, that 'things are tougher in Russia and in Georgia,' and is content to be out. But the Absorption Ministry says 4,450 Soviet immigrants have left Israel since the beginning of 1991. Marina speaks good Hebrew but she has no Israeli friends and she does not feel 'Israeli'. Professor Lisak says that despite 'adoption' attempts on the part of Israelis, Soviet immigrants failed to become part of Israeli social networks and remain closed inside their own circles. Interestingly, integration is often more evident in the peripheral development town communities than it is in the main cities. The immigrants find it easier to mingle in small centres despite the fact that in these places they are often breaking the ethnic homogeneity of Sephardi Jews who themselves were mass immigrants two generations ago. The problems of absorption, particularly unemployment, led this year to a sharp drop in arrivals from former Soviet territories to 70,000 from 175,000 in 1991. This slower pace of immigration may have the effect of easing the pressure on Israeli society of integrating newcomers.</p>

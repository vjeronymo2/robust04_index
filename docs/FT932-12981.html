			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Barclays chief warns of bank lending curbs HIGH street banks' lending to small businesses may be under threat unless the government helps them to widen loan margins and restore their profitability, Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, has warned. In one of the strongest warnings yet about the danger of a 'credit crunch', Sir Peter said it would 'not be very surprising if the banking system became risk-averse in a big way when a need comes for finance for the recovery'. Sir Peter's remarks at a lecture given to public-relations practitioners in London follow widespread concern that banks' losses on small-business lending in the late 1980s will lead them to restrict lending over the next few years. Although bankers have denied this, Sir Peter argued that 'whatever may be said, there are some areas of lending that are clearly under threat'  - even though 'money is always available at a price. 'It is not totally clear that lending to small businesses can earn returns sufficient to allow for the risks,' he told members of the Institute of Public Relations. Banks have suffered big losses on small-business lending over the past two years, and Sir Peter's bank made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m last year after provisions for bad and doubtful loans in the UK of Pounds 1.96bn. Sir Peter's remarks follow a call from Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief executive, in February for measures such as a 'loan support scheme' giving subsidies for small-business loans. Sir Peter said the government should follow the example of the US government and the Federal Reserve in helping banks to widen their margins in order to help them to raise profitability and maintain lending in recovery. The Fed has helped US banks to restore depleted capital by establishing a gap between money market interest rates and short-term bond yields. That has allowed banks to increase their capital by buying government bonds. However, the Bank of England has indicated that it is not likely to try to imitate that. Banks have limited incentive to use money-market funds to buy Treasury gilts at present as the yield on such bonds is not high enough. Sir Peter said banks needed 'some of the same attitude and some of the same understanding' on the part of the British government. He said banks had made mistakes in the late 1980s after the relaxation of credit control. Many 'took on excess amounts of risky assets and mistook the result for profits' only to suffer loan losses later. Unemployment is set to rise by another 210,000 and will peak at about 3.15m by March next year, National Westminster Bank predicted yesterday. Interest rates may also be cut by half a percentage point to 5.5 per cent in the summer - but the government will have to backtrack and increase rates to perhaps 7 per cent by next summer, said Mr David Kern, chief economist. In spite of the fall over the past two months, unemployment will continue to grow with the south-east bearing the brunt, he said. Joblessness in the south-east will increase by 94,000 and reach 1.034m by next spring, he predicted.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson's Quantum theory It is perhaps an indication of Hanson's stolid mass that a Dollars 3.2bn deal will have a modest impact on the company's prospects. It is also a mark of the caution in takeovers that agreed deals with appropriate due diligence are the model for the 1990s. Hanson's claim that Quantum will be mildly earnings-enhancing in 1994 looks reasonable given reduced interest costs and the improvement in operating profits which was expected prior to the deal. That said, the petrochemicals market remains fiercely competitive and further consolidation is required, as Quantum's hard-pressed position showed all too well. Yet even if Quantum's earnings double in 1995, and Hanson's rating remains unchanged, the acquisition will add less than 10 per cent to the value of the group. The constraint on Hanson's ability to complete a very large deal is shown by the strain on its balance sheet. Gearing was 18 per cent at the last year end, but if the current transaction is completed in time to be consolidated, gearing will rise to over 80 per cent this year. In part that reflects the rise in the dollar, and interest cover is more than adequate. Nonetheless, a deal which would have had a substantial impact on Hanson's prospects would in all probability have pushed gearing to unacceptable levels. Disposals thus seem likely, and it may be that smaller businesses in the US or even Quantum's propane retailing operation will be put on the block. For the foreseeable future, however, Hanson is stuck with organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. A cyclical upturn would help, but it is all a far cry from the gung-ho raiding of the 1980s.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. READIES DEMAND FOR DAMAGES FROM IRAQ;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION WOULD BENEFIT COUNTRIES HARMED BY  KUWAIT INVASION.  </P> <P> The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have reached  general agreement on a resolution demanding that Iraq pay other countries for  damages suffered by its invasion of Kuwait, diplomats said Thursday.  </P> <P> Final wording was being polished in Washington and other capitals before the  draft resolution is presented to the 10 other members of the council.  </P> <P> The measure also would call on Iraq to allow the resupply of Western embassies  in Kuwait city and ask U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to gather  information on the mistreatment of citizens and foreigners living in Kuwait.  </P> <P> In addition, the draft resolution asks that governments supply data on behalf  of citizens who have suffered financial losses because of the invasion. But the  precise means of assessing Iraq for such damages has not been spelled out.  </P> <P> "It is designed to help keep up the pressure," said one diplomat from a  nonaligned nation with Security Council status who is familiar with the  resolution worked out among the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union  and France.  </P> <P> Several nations have suffered major economic losses because of the seizure of  Kuwait, including Jordan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.  </P> <P> The precise wording of the new resolution was still being worked out late  Thursday.  </P> <P> "It isn't even completely OKd by the United States," said one member of the  Yemen delegation who had seen a draft. "I think the United States has some  revisions."  </P> <P> He said that although the United States was preparing to try to push for a  quick consensus in the council, the process among nonaligned council members  could take time.  </P> <P> "I don't think we will work on the weekend. There is nothing serious," he said.  </P> <P> According to the draft resolution, President Saddam Hussein's government would  not be responsible for punitive damages, only compensation.  </P> <P> Only a handful of foreign embassies still are operating in Kuwait city in  defiance of the Hussein regime, and water, electricity and shipments of  supplies have been cut off. According to the wife of a top U.S. diplomat, the  few remaining Americans still had stored water and were eating a monotonous  diet of rice and tuna.  </P> <P> The pressure for a new resolution against Iraq came as Perez de Cuellar  continued to try to clarify ways in which a U.N. fact-finding mission to  Jerusalem would be accepted by the Israeli government. The Security Council  voted last Friday to condemn Israel for the killing of 21 Palestinians in  Jerusalem last week and requested Perez de Cuellar to send a mission to  investigate.  </P> <P> But the Israeli government has made it clear such a mission is not welcome. For  almost a week, diplomats have been working behind the scenes to find a  compromise.  </P> <P> In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III defended U.S. support for  the U.N. resolution condemning Israel during a sometimes heated exchange with  members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> "You are saying that the resolution was unbalanced," Baker told Rep. Eliot L.  Engel (D-N.Y.). "I have to tell you that the (Israeli) response (to Arab  rioting on Temple Mount) was unbalanced, and the resolution condemned the  response. We think the response was excessive. There is no excuse for what  happened."  </P> <P> California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) issued a blistering statement  accusing the Administration of "allowing longstanding Arab hatred of Israel to  dictate American policy and drive a wedge between the U.S. and Israel." He said  Administration policy created a link between the Arab-Israel conflict and the  gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Goldman reported from the U.N. and Kempster from Washington.  </P></p>

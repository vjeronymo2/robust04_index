[passage omitted]    In a telephone interview, Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's  ambassador in Washington and head of the Jordanian delegation to  the bilateral negotiations, said these meetings are meant as  consultation between the heads of the four delegations, in  addition to the Israeli side, regarding the date and venue of  the next round of negotiations.    Al-Tarawinah said that there will be a comprehensive  assessment of the progress of negotiations on all tracks. In  light of this assessment, the parties will examine the  usefulness of holding another round of talks. They will also  look at ways to reduce differences or obstacles that could  obstruct the Arab-Israeli negotiations. [passage omitted]    Answering a question on the topics to be discussed on the  Jordanian-Israeli track in the next round, al-Tarawinah said:  No doubt, there have been many political developments since the  end of the last round of the bilateral talks, and specifically  since the signing of the Declaration of Principles between the  PLO and Israel on 13 September 1993. A Jordanian-Israeli agenda  was also signed, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  visited the region. Add to this the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva  and finally the Jordanian-U.S. summit in Washington.    Dr. al-Tarawinah added: Regarding the Jordanian-Israeli  track, the items on the agenda have not been discussed since the  signing of the agenda on 14 September 1993. This is because  there has not been a round of talks since then.    The head of the Jordanian delegation said: I think that in  the new round we will discuss the agenda items. This is in  addition to the meetings of the working groups on water, the  environment, energy, security, borders, refugees, among others.  He added that there is now a new dimension, which is the  Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement signed this month in  Amman. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Beijing is considering a single tax on peasants to  replace an array of arbitrary charges. A single tax was tried  by the Ming Dynasty in the 16th century, but it failed to save  it from tax revolts and eventual collapse.    Frustrated by its inability to cap the proliferation of  arbitrary charges and fees imposed on farmers, which have led to  violent uprisings among the 800-million-strong rural population,  policy analysts in the Ministry of Agriculture have proposed a  unitary tax geared to household income, sources in Beijing said.  The proposal was put to national leaders for the first time at  a national agriculture work meeting last month.    The ministry is pushing for the new tax to be implemented as  early as next year in order to guard against tax revolts like  those last year in Sichuan and Anhui. It would replace the  existing 3 per cent state agricultural tax and provincial and  local levies. The single tax idea has already won strong  support from farmers, the sources said.    A survey by the ministry and the State Council's Development  Research Centre early last month revealed growing friction  between local cadres and farmers over the actual amount of every  fee levied last year, a survey team member said.    "The peasants were also surprised when the cadres mentioned  the newspaper and entertainment fees. They said they had never  seen a movie in their lives!" According to the official, a  unified tax was seen by Beijing as the main way to calm the  peasants and bring political stability. "Those in the survey  were willing to accept rates of 7 or 8 per cent of their income,  as long as it was fixed from year to year."    A State Council decree of last April limited fees to 5 per  cent of peasant income, but evidence gathered so far suggests  that this has hardly dented the rapacity of local officials. A  report in the FARMERS' DAILY [NONGMIN RIBAO] last December  showed 47 per cent of households did not know about the national  directive limiting charges to 5 per cent of incomes.    The recent survey, which covered four counties in Sichuan  and  Hunan, found that taxes consumed an average of 8.4 per cent of  peasant incomes in 1992, a figure which the official said was  "almost certainly much higher" in 1993.    However, the single tax proposal was likely to run into  strong opposition from local officials, fearful the central  government would take most of the revenue, leaving them with  little.    "In fact much of the problem of excessive taxes comes from  the upper level governments, who demand money for large scale  irrigation and distribution projects," the official said. "The  local governments we have talked to say there would be nothing  left over for their provision of basic services." The official  said resolving the split of the tax between government levels  would be the biggest hurdle to overcome.    In 1579, Ming dynasty rulers implemented a so called "single  whip" tax system, meant to check the power of local authorities  to impose arbitrary charges, requisitions and services from the  peasantry. But the "single whip" tax is seen by scholars as a  failure because it came down harder on poor areas than on rich  ones. Local opposition to the tax contributed to the  deterioration of imperial finances control in the last few  decades before the dynasty was overthrown in 1644.    Under the Communists, the imposition of charges to pay for  local services has multiplied since agricultural reforms giving  peasants control over their own production began in the 1980s.  The burgeoning tax burdens of China's peasants were singled out  by scholars at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in their  1994 Outlook as an important factor causing a "trend towards  instability" in the Chinese countryside. It said that reducing  the tax burden on peasants would be difficult this year and it  would "very likely exceed the 1993 levels".    The ministry issued a further warning last week to local  governments about exaggerating local incomes in order to justify  higher taxes. "Each household knows its own income, and maybe  its neighbours', but they can't see what the cadres report to  the central government," the official said.    Despite changes in the countryside, mainland social analysts  say peasants remain vulnerable to being systematically oppressed  by the state. "Their unorganised nature makes them vulnerable  and an easy target of exploitation," said one analyst.</p>

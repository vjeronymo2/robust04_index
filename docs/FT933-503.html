			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / US multinational pulls out of Dollars 30m Indian project INDIA'S hopes of attracting foreign investment have suffered a setback with a decision by Cargill, the US multinational, to pull out of a proposed Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) salt-processing project in Kandla, Gujarat. 'This is a tremendous setback to our economic reforms,' a top official of the Finance Ministry said yesterday. The country is in the throes of a wide-ranging economic modernisation programme in which foreign companies are expected to play an important role importing capital and technology. Cargill's decision to abandon its proposed investment is largely due to factors specific to its project and is not a sign of general disaffection with India's economic policies. However, the fear in New Delhi is that other companies may also be tripped up by similar controversies, impeding the liberalisation process. Cargill South East Asia announced on Monday that legal action had prompted it to withdraw from the salt project. The company, facing a suit filed in February by the Kandla Small Scale Salt Manufacturers' Association, told a high court in Gujarat it was 'no longer interested in building an export-oriented salt works in the Kandla Port Trust area'. A company official said this was 'a business decision, as contesting the association would have meant protracted litigation and delay for Cargill'. But Mr George Fernandes, MP, and his protest group, the Samajwadi Abhiyan, is claiming credit for Cargill's decision. 'I am happy that we have hounded out Cargill,' says the Janata Dal politician who as industries minister in 1977 forced Coca-Cola and IBM to wind up their Indian operations. 'We have proved that by following Gandhi's method of concerted, non-violent people's action it is possible to defeat the combined power of the multinationals and the government.' Mr Fernandes and the Samajwadi Abhiyan, a combination of associations representing salt farmers, politicians and social workers, have been agitating against the salt project since it was approved earlier this year. They had threatened to intensify their stir against Cargill on October 2, the anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. The group won popular support through a publicity campaign highlighting their fears that Cargill's entry into the area would deprive thousands of small-scale salt farmers of their livelihood. Cargill, which in July faced the wrath of farmers in Karnataka attacking its seeds operations there, will not be the last multinational the organisation will target. 'We are already planning a 'Banish Coke and Pepsi' campaign,' Mr Fernandes said yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Zigunenko, TEKHNIKA-MOLODEZHI special </F> correspondent. First paragraph is TEKHNIKA-MOLODEZHI  introduction, a question from a student.]    [Text] ``In  1990's No. 5 issue, the capabilities of supercomputers were  described using examples of foreign supercomputers. In 1991's  No. 1 issue the development of the Elbrus 3-1 domestic  supercomputer, with a capability of more than a billion  operations per second, was mentioned. It's 1993 and I'm still  waiting for you to tell us about this computer in detail.''  Vladimir Sergeyev, student, Perm.    ``Don't describe our machine as anything special,'' they  told  me at the S. A. Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and  Computing, ``there's nothing special about it.''    This was a strange comment. What was behind it: exaggerated  modesty or a judicious recognition of the significance of what  had been done? I got the answer in the computer room where the  Elbrus 3-1 is being checked out.    ``If you want to be scrupulously exact, what stands before  us  is not a computer, but a general-purpose multiprocessor  computing system with well-developed software,'' stated one of  the authors of this work, the deputy chief designer, Vladimir  Abramovich Zhukovskiy. ``You can see the difference if you look  at its architecture. First let's be specific: architecture in  computing doesn't mean the metal racks and units filling the  room. Nor does it mean the design, in terms of shape, color,  etc. Computer architecture can only be clearly seen on a sheet  of paper showing what's connected to what and in what sequence  (see schematic).''    The main parts of the Elbrus are the modular switching  system, the peripheral system, the power supply system, the  cooling system, and the general system software.    Communication with the machine is facilitated by automated  digital printers, individual control panels, otherwise called  work stations, and automated digital displays.    Today's communication systems make it possible to input data  and receive the results of calculations without entering the  computer room, either from the next room or another city. One  can conduct not only man-machine dialogs, but machine-machine  dialogs. With one set of adapters the Elbrus 1-5B and Elbrus-2  representatives of the YeS family of computers can work with the  Elbrus 3-1.    In general, one can increase the power of the computer  complex, not only with external resources, that is, by attaching  other computers, but also using the internal features of the  Elbrus 3-1.    The central computer of the Elbrus 3-1 is the modular  switching system. It, in turn, consists of modular pipeline  processors, a bulk RAM, and the adapters which connect the  high-speed switching network. When these adapters are used  together, 16 modular pipeline processors can be attached, as  well as 16 RAM units. If this is not enough to solve the  problem, another 32 channels can be activated to connect in  more resources, including other computers.    The modular pipeline processor itself is comprised of  several  modules, each of which executes a certain operation, addition,  multiplication, etc. If one must first multiply the incoming  data to solve a problem, and then add it, then the assembly line  of modules is formed as follows: multiplier first, then summer.    Special modules which operate in a general pipeline mode  make  it possible to sharply increase speed. It is because of these  special processors that one can calculate at such a high speed:  from 50 million operations per second with scalar quantities to  400 million operations per second with vector quantities. The  modular switching system may have not one, not two, but four  processors (in the future more will be possible), so the total  performance of several such pipelines may reach 1.6 billion  operations per second or more.    The high level of performance of the Elbrus 3-1 creates  certain technical problems. One of them is that the computer  heats up when it is in operation, and the excess heat may melt  contacts, conductors, and integrated microcircuit elements, the  very foundations upon which the computer is built.    The traditional solution, blowing a stream of cold air  through the units, was ineffective in this case: one could  create a hurricane in the computer room. Then the developers  decided to use liquid cooling along with air cooling.    Abroad, this is what is frequently done: the units which  perform the most intense work are placed in Dewar vessels, that  is, in thermoses with liquid nitrogen or helium. The cooling is  reliable and in some cases may even reach the superconducting  stage, but a great deal of frost is formed. We managed to solve  this problem using very simple measures.    Zhukovskiy showed me a micromodule, a plate about 3X3 cm in  size. It had a radiator through which a cooling fluid was  pumped. The radiator removes the excess heat from micromodules  on a board 0.5X0.5 m in size. The fluid then enters a  refrigerator, where the heat is removed; the fluid is then  returned to the cooling system.    Boards with micromodules are placed in a frame similar to  the  plates of glass in a balcony door. The aluminum frame in turn is  fastened to a column in an equipment rack. Thus, by rotating the  door, the debuggers and operators can gain access to any unit,  to each micromodule, even while the machine is in operation.  This greatly simplifies and speeds up debugging and repair.    These are only some of the designs of the many used in the  construction of one of the first domestic supercomputers. And  yet, overall, the specialists are not very satisfied with their  work. For example, abroad one chip can have millions of  transistors, capacitors, and resistors; here in the best case,  only hundreds of thousands are possible. The result is a great  increase in size, mass, and energy consumption, as well as a  reduction in performance.    That is why the developers don't want to say anything  special  about their baby: they created a computer using domestic  micromodules which stands up to the remarkable Cray in a number  of ways; but if it only exceeded the Cray in every way!    American television reporters tagging along at the institute  held another opinion. They wanted to see with their own eyes and  show the viewers back home one of wonders of what is to them a  poorly understood nation. After work people stand in lines for  increasingly expensive bread; at work they manage to reach the  level of the world's best achievements. How do they do it?    Unfortunately, the answer for us is the same as in the  famous  Leskov story of Levsha. There is no scarcity of talent in  Russia: when there is no magnifying glass, we just sharpen our  eyesight...</p>

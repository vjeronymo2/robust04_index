After the sale of some subsidiary operations turnover was down from Pounds 53.5m to Pounds 38m. The interest charge fell from Pounds 813,000 to Pounds 573,000, mainly because of lower interest rates and the disposal of subsidiaries. After a nil tax charge (Pounds 1.17m), losses came out at 3.7p (2.7p) per share.</p>

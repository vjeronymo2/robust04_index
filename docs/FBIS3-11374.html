			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "New Banking Competitiveness Rules"] </F>   [Text] An administration decree has repealed articles in  the financial institutions law and empowered the Central Bank to  authorize the operations of foreign banks without requiring  reciprocity from their home countries. The classification of  banks by source of capital has also been abolished. This move,  which is already the subject of intense controversy, is  ultimately designed to reduce interest rates and the cost of  financial services in general.    We should indicate, first of all, that a law has been  amended  by decree, a by now all too common occurrence that has become  one of the most striking maladies of the institutional system.  In essence, though, it represents a unilateral opening of the  Argentine economy, in keeping with the decision about foreign  trade. Indeed, the series of decisions that cut tariffs  substantially and abolished other restrictions on imports of all  sorts of merchandise were equally unilateral.    A different approach in both instances would have been to  seek reciprocity from other nations. But the feeling was that  unilateral liberalization was indispensable to promote  competition and enhance the productivity of the Argentine  economy. Since a liberalization negotiated on condition of  reciprocity would have taken years perhaps, with no guarantee of  success, the decision was made unilaterally, to further the  country's own interests.    At the same time, though, a cut in Argentine tariffs, with  reciprocity, was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of GATT.  Once the negotiations are approved, these tariffs cannot exceed  35 percent. This means that our country can raise them to that  "ceiling" if it ever considers such a move appropriate.    In the case of banks we are talking about services, not  goods. This sphere of economic activity is rapidly becoming part  of international commerce, as has just been acknowledged during  the negotiations in the Uruguay Round of GATT, which created an  institutional framework parallel to trade in goods. In this case  tariffs cannot be applied. Liberalization means the right to do  business and to receive the same treatment accorded the services  delivered by domestic firms. This is precisely what the decree  in question is about.    The administration has thus chosen to apply to banking the  same principle of unilateral liberalization that it decided to  apply at the time to trade in goods.    The goal of the economic authorities is to stimulate  competition among banks, as a result of which it expects a drop  in interest rates and in the cost of financial services in  general, which has been a constant demand of agriculture,  industry, and in particular, small and mid-sized businesses in  the interior.    The principle of reciprocity is very common in the  legislation of major nations. In Argentina's case, however, it  has not yielded significant results, to judge by the delays and  inaction on various requests by Argentine banks to open branches  in major financial centers. The primary explanation of this is  our country's relatively minor financial bargaining power in the  world.    Other, more powerful nations have a better chance of success  in applying this principle, for example the United States in its  trade dispute with Japan. The economic authorities have no doubt  observed the difficulties of reciprocity and, as a result, chose  the potential advantages of financial competition.    The opening of the local market to foreign banks is largely  a  political issue. In past decades this would have been  unthinkable, as was foreign involvement in other areas of the  economy, especially those regarded as "strategic," such as  energy, petroleum, gas, and railways. Current political,  economic, and technological developments show that many economic  and financial borders are being erased.    Foreign firms already have a major presence in the banking  sector. So the liberalization will probably mean, above all, the  opening of more branches of the foreign banks that are already  here, which until now have been restricted from doing so.    The decision does not give free rein to establish all kinds  of banks and branches, as this will in any event remain subject  to the regulations and approval of the Central Bank.    A very important facet of the debate has to do with how much  this decision will help to lower interest rates. A likely result  is that competition will improve the productivity and efficiency  of banks, regardless of how many domestic, foreign, and  state-run banks are already in operation.    It is doubtful, however, whether the wide spread between  bank  interest rates on loans and on deposits is due mainly to the  lack of competition. There are other, major factors, such as  large reserve requirements, the many burdensome regulations and  activities that the banks must endure by government mandate, and  also, to some extent, the tax on financial transactions, which  pays for the costly, bureaucratic system of social benefits for  the sector, or labor legislation. Action will also have to be  taken on this front in order to truly lower interest rates so  that they cease to represent a drag on the competitiveness of  Argentine producers.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Turkmens in trade deal with Iran TURKMENISTAN has reached a transport, banking and trade agreement with its neighbour, Iran. The deal, agreed during a visit by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to the former Soviet republic, considerably expands Iran's economic influence in the region. It follows the failure last weekend of a joint central Asian, Turkish, Pakistani and Iranian summit to agree on economic co-operation, and is a setback to Turkish efforts to curb Iran's economic role in the region. Under the agreement, a joint banking and customs system will be established between Turkmenistan and Iran. Road and rail links will be completed. According to Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh, Iranian finance minister, the Dollars 500m (Pounds 282m) cost of the railway will be primarily born by Iran. This is in addition to Dollars 50m of Iranian credits to Turkmenistan announced last week. 'What we are offering them is the chance to export goods via the Persian Gulf,' said Mr Nurbakhsh, who envisaged that raw materials, including Uzbek cotton and silk, Kazakh oil and Turkmen natural gas could soon be exported through this route. A second project to build a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Iran had also been agreed, Mr Nurbakhsh said. A deal for the purchase of 19bn cubic metres of Turkmen gas by Iran has been signed, with plans to expand this once the pipeline had been completed. According to Mr Nurbakhsh, some of this gas would be used in Iran, and some exported to the west, and Turkey. Discussions were continuing about a controversial oil pipeline between Turkmenistan and the Gulf.</p>

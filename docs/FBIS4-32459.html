			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Status Quo on Border Line"] </F>   [Text] The situation with Serbian troops stationed on the  Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  territory near Kriva Palanka is in a status quo. The two  countries' soldiers are positioned only few hundred meters away  from each other. There are no incidents and the region is  regularly flown over by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  helicopters. The anxiety of the local population loosens, but  farmers are prevented from cultivating their land as it is on  the territory presently usurped by Serbian troops.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OK SWAP OF LAND IN OXNARD TOWN CENTER PROJECT  </P> <P> Ventura County officials agreed this week to swap a 14.7-acre plot of land  crucial to the mammoth Town Center development in Oxnard for a larger plot  northeast of the project.  </P> <P> Under the agreement approved Tuesday by county supervisors, the county will  part with an equipment yard that stands in the path of a freeway improvement  project that has to be completed before most of the Town Center can be built.  </P> <P> In exchange, the project's developers, Buellton-based River Edge, agreed to  give the county 22.5 acres of land in El Rio and build $4.5-million worth of  buildings to replace the existing facilities. The deal also provides the county  with a $2-million cushion against cost overruns on the project.  </P> <P> "I think it's a good deal for everyone," said Richard Wittenberg, the county's  chief administrative officer. "The Town Center gets built, and our  responsibility that the taxpayer be protected has been fulfilled."  </P> <P> Larry Lahr, the president of River Edge, also expressed satisfaction over the  deal, which clears the way for improvements to the intersection of the Ventura  Freeway and California 1 near the project, which was begun in January.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of headaches between now and completion," he said. "But having  this allows us to keep moving and to keep the momentum of the project."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Optimism on Caltrans  </P> <P> Meanwhile, county officials expressed optimism that the state Department of  Transportation would decide this year to fund a share of the $28-million  freeway widening project that will improve the intersection of the Ventura  Freeway and California 1 within the next five years.  </P> <P> "It's very positive," said Richard Spicer, acting executive director of Ventura  County's Transportation Commission, who attended a hearing this week to  determine the budget for next year's State Transportation Improvement Program.  </P> <P> He said the California Transportation Commission, based on testimony received  Tuesday, will decide late next month whether to fund the project, which is  considered a top priority by the Ventura County Transportation Commission and  the Southern California Assn. of Governments.  </P> <P> The only cloud over the deal came from Supervisor Susan Lacey, who warned  supervisors that residents in El Rio would be wary of increases in traffic  caused by the relocated yard.  </P> <P> "The county will have to jump through every hoop that a private person would  have to do, and there's a chance that we might not be able to jump through them  all," said Lacey, whose district includes El Rio. "Folks over there are  concerned about traffic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Former Site of Dairy  </P> <P> The equipment yard -- which houses county maintenance vehicles as well as the  county's fleet of cars, including all of the patrol cars in the Sheriff's  Department -- will occupy the former site of a dairy at Vineyard Avenue and  Lambert Street.  </P> <P> The $500-million Town Center project, which is the largest commercial  development planned for Oxnard, will bring office buildings, hotels, a mall and  a cultural arts facility to a 265-acre site in the next 15 years.  </P> <P> Under a development agreement with the city of Oxnard, only a quarter of the  project can be developed before the interchange is improved. The improvements,  which will widen the freeway between Johnson Drive and Vineyard Avenue, were  also part of a settlement that Oxnard reached with Ventura in a lawsuit over  the Town Center.  </P> <P> Lahr said company officials had reason to believe that Caltrans eventually will  condemn between six and 10 acres for the improvements, but they feared delays.  River Edge also plans to retain up to four acres of the land for a parking lot,  he said.  </P> <P> Lahr expressed relief over the county's acceptance of the deal, which he said  was nearly five years in the making.  </P> <P> "The county would say, 'We'd like this site,' " he said, "and we'd go out and  try to make a deal and everybody would know that we were buying for the county  so the price would go up. Then an official would decide they didn't want it."  </P></p>

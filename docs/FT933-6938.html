			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Unit trust funds bounce to record LOW interest rates and a buoyant stock market gave a further fillip to unit trust sales in July, with a net Pounds 948m flowing in, according to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. Funds under management reached a new high of Pounds 78.8bn, up from Pounds 76.3bn at the end of June. The industry has benefited substantially from sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism, and the consequent falls in base rates. Income offered by some unit trust personal equity plans (where returns are tax-free) is now higher than that provided by many building society accounts. Total net investment (gross sales minus repurchases) in the year to July was Pounds 5.25bn. Private investors were responsible for nearly half (Pounds 453m) of the net sales in July. The most popular sectors were UK balanced, UK equity income and UK general funds. In July 1992, private investors made net withdrawals of Pounds 98m from the sector. Gross sales of unit trusts in July 1993 were Pounds 1,631m, the eighth successive month in which they topped Pounds 1bn. If the pace continues, gross sales will outstrip the previous record of Pounds 14.55bn, reached in 1987. The number of unitholder accounts, in steady decline since the crash of October 1987, is also on the increase. After touching a recent low of 4.35m at the end of last year, accounts have increased to 4.68m, indicating that the industry has a growing appeal. The revival in the stock market has also helped unit trust performance, with the average UK equity income fund returning 28.6 per cent over the year to August 1 (offer-to-bid with income reinvested; source Hardwick Stafford Wright). The best performing sector over the same period was Japan, which produced growth of 91.8 per cent. Evolution helps trusts, Page 15</p>

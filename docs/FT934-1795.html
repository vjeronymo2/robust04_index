			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Man who crafted faction rule / Obituary of Kakuei Tanaka Mr Kakuei Tanaka, in whose image modern Japanese politics was crafted, died aged 75 in Tokyo yesterday after a long illness, which had cut short his career but had also ensured he would not be jailed for his involvement in a bribery scandal. The gravel-voiced Mr Tanaka dominated Japanese politics during the 1970s and 1980s, when he perfected the faction system of the Liberal Democratic party, which ruled the country for four decades until this year and served as the conduit between business and the bureaucracy. Popularly known as the 'computerised bulldozer' for his straight-talking determination and ability to calculate cost and benefit, Mr Tanaka's fund-raising powers allowed him to reward generously his supporters and constituents, ensuring his faction was the most influential in the LDP. Newly-elected politicians sought his patronage and promised him loyalty. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the current prime minister, is a former member of the Tanaka faction, and the coalition government's kingmaker, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, learned his political skills in the company of Mr Tanaka and carried on the Tanaka tradition of fund-raising. Mr Tanaka's organisational ability and his financial resources ensured his power even increased after his resignation as prime minister in late 1974, when his personal finances were the stuff of public scandal after the 'black fog' was lifted by a Japanese magazine. Two years later, the 'shadow shogun' was arrested on suspicion of accepting Y500m (Pounds 3.1m) in bribes, and he was sentenced to four years' jail in 1983. An appeal against his conviction was pending when he died. But the troubles with the law did not diminish his popularity in his home prefecture of Niigata, where he was consistently re-elected. His speeches were laced with references to his humble origins and his love of his home town, while his lack of a university education was popularly regarded as an antidote to the arrogance of the Tokyo University graduates who controlled the capital. Campaigning in 1946, Mr Tanaka promised he would level the mountains hemming in his home prefecture; 'then we shall have no more of the heavy snowfalls that have tormented us for centuries'. On later becoming a minister, he refused to attend the lecture provided by bureaucrats for education of the incoming politician. It was said there was a little bit of Mr Tanaka in every Japanese, that he represented the embodiment of old rural values in the post-war political world. He had a habit of wearing traditional wooden sandals with his business suit, and his rough-and-ready speaking style conjured images of the crude but endearing rice farmer. But Mr Tanaka's later life, spent in a comfortable Tokyo compound complete with pond jumping with Y1m carp, was far removed from that of the common man, and the earthy campaigning style became in part affectation. He was increasingly consumed by political intrigue, and his considerable personal wealth became an ever larger target for public criticism. Mr Tanaka began his business life in the construction industry, and Tanaka Civil Engineering profited during the war, when poor health led to his discharge from the army. His links to the construction and transport industries allowed him to build the network of political influence, fuelled by money from companies grateful for receiving lucrative public contracts. His first skirmish with scandal came in 1948, when he resigned as vice-minister of justice after allegations that he accepted bribes from coal mining companies. But he returned as minister for postal services and communications in 1957, later serving as finance and trade minister, when he collected ideas for a grand plan to 'remodel the Japanese archipelago'. Mr Tanaka was felled by a stroke in 1985 but did not retire from politics until 1989. His former associates fought over control of his faction; his daughter Makiko reformed his supporters' group this year, being elected to the Lower House. As with Mr Richard Nixon, the former US president, the sins of Mr Tanaka were overlooked by the Chinese government, which remembered him fondly for travelling to Beijing to normalise relations in 1972. China last night 'deeply mourned' his passing.</p>

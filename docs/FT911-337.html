			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Peer Gynt - Berlin Festival While A Doll's House and John Gabriel Borkman play among the magic dozen at the Berlin Theatre Festival (to May 20), the Deutsches Theater's sparkling new Peer Gynt gives Berlin audiences the rare fortune of seeing significant productions of early, middle and late Ibsen all within a fortnight. In this context, what a revelation the poet of Peer Gynt is - lyrical, witty, infinitely various. Morality, introspection, the rumbling, grumbling later playwright, these just peep through in Fredo Solter's interpretation, which offers a surprise Ibsen; tongue in cheek, spring in step, spirit soaring. Solter's is the lightest, brightest Ibsen staging I have seen. Clouds and stars, fjords and floods, cut across a giant gauze sheet which revolves with the seasons - autumnal brown, midsummer blue. Against this ever-unrolling backcloth, mood and timbre change as delicately as in Grieg's Peer Gynt suite; cool pastels for Solveig, burning red for the troll orgies, hard yellow sun and green moon for the exotic wanderings. A cornucopia of images, animals, masks, music, taped voices, suggest the whirlpool of Peer Gynt's mind. Claudia Geisler's Solveig, straw-hatted and flaxen-haired, stands like a Nordic Tess of the d'Urbervilles against the midnight sun. Transvestite trolls, plastic buttocks, tails and fangs attached, tumble out as from a nightclub down the road, and there's a joke about their Berlin accents. Peer mounts a troll girl as she mounts an electric-eyed rhino, tongue spurting flames, and all three whoosh off down a fjord. Man as beast, cooped up with his own conflicting sexual fantasies; Ibsen was writing half a century before Freud and the raw fear of Peer's responses still shocks as something new. Solter pulls together Peer's youthful imaginings and his later life as wealthy capitalist as two sides of the same coin. Peer Gynt was written in the same year (1867) as Das Kapital and Solter plays the speculator's ventures as no less fantastical than the young man's dreams. It's a wild, lavish reading of the play - a cast of 25 treble up over 70 parts - yet one with diminishing returns, as each gimmick must work harder while charming less hypnotically. Solter's vision would fit well into three hours, yet the play runs for five. The Deutsches Theater, Max Reinhardt's home in the 1920s and the National Theatre of the former DDR, has a repertoire of 20 such classical productions and is not a theatre to offer compromises. As Peer, Daniel Morgenroth's triumph is to hold the stage despite the distractions of the zoo. With absolute conviction he grows from gangly youth to autocrat. His voice - energetic staccato bursts modulating up to panic, down to reflection - speaks his continuing restlessness. Facial muscles are never still, knees knock together, hands wrestle with each other nervously. At once funny and vulnerable, he sweet-talks us into accepting the excess of his desires while acknowledging their theatricality. Yet each time Morgenroth pushes beyond the game, and when he comes to peel back the onion layers of his life at last and finds no kernel to himself, we agonise with him in his and our own exhaustion.</p>

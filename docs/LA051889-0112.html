			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Senate panel approved a uniform poll-closing time of 10 p.m. EST for  presidential elections in an effort to end network projections of results  before all voters have cast their ballots. "I believe early projections before  the polls close threaten the right of some voters to go to the polls and feel  their votes count," said Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) after the 9-2 vote by the  Senate Rules and Administration Committee. The poll-closing bill was approved  as part of a package of unrelated measures, including a blueprint for having  eight regional presidential primaries around the country with the Federal  Election Commission determining the order of the events by lot.  </P></p>

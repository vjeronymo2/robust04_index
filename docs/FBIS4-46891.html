			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Dudko, clergyman of the Russian Orthodox </F> Church, spiritual adviser for the newspaper DEN-ZAVTRA, Easter  1994: "An Easter Message"]    [Text] This year the celebration of Easter coincides with  the celebration of May 1st--the holiday of the Communists. Is  this coincidence not an sign?    If you look at the hardships the true Christians and the  true  Communists are bearing in our time, you will say: Yes, there is  some kind of sign, and right away you will add: and not just  some kind. I think that the fate of the Communists and  Christians are in some way the same. Although the majority of  Communists in Soviet times declared their lack of faith, as the  philosophers say, a lack of faith is the back door to faith.  They are basically for the people, they care about their  well-being, and they are self-sacrificing, their heroism being  reminiscent of the Christian martyrs. Take just Anpilov, who  stated outright that he is a natural Christian and can even  forgive his enemies in spite of the fact that they are  constantly tormenting him. Therefore, I would like to send an  Easter greeting first of all to the orthodox Christians and  Communists.    Christ is risen!--this means that our suffering will turn to  joy! No, this has never happened on our earth, not to mention  the fact that the physical collapse of the country will soon be  complete and moral degradation is making an ever more stunning  impression. From the screens of television sets and on the radio  the people are being duped, lied to outright, and exposed to  unconcealed cynicism and Satanism. It would seem that evil  forces are triumphant. But it just seems that way; behind all  this one must be able to see the triumph of Christianity. We  must not live the way they are living and the way we are called  to live! It illuminates Christian truths. Along with the poet  you will say: The darker the night the brighter the stars.    Christ is risen!--and Hell has been destroyed, its locks are  worn out, although some people are trying to reinforce them.  Hell has been destroyed not only in eternity but also here and  now, on earth. Listen to the beating of your heart: It beats  harmoniously and confidently. Sheep and wolves do indeed feed  together. Chekists who were previously threatening to us are now  asking forgiveness from their victims. Even from me. I cannot  forget the humble image of two Chekists who in the church where  I serve got down on their knees before me and said: "Forgive  us." I closed my eyes to all their offenses and said to the  Chekists: And you forgive me for the fact that I once allowed  myself to become bitter, willingly or not.    Orthodox Christians and Communists must walk in the front  ranks to save Russia--help us God, Christ is risen.    But it is not just I who see that believers and Communists  can speak the same language; soon all of us who populate Russia  will start speaking in the same language--of courage,  cheerfulness, and joy.    Easter is celebrated in Russia as it is in no other country.  In the West they celebrate Christmas more and in a secular way;  here even the so-called atheists back in Soviet times celebrated  this holiday along with believers because Russia, like Christ  himself, has always been on Golgotha awaiting its resurrection.    On which Golgotha or, rather, on which one of the Golgothas  are we celebrating Christ's resurrection and, consequently, ours  this year? The Golgotha with the name of Christ will not and  cannot bear destruction, this exhaustion of creativity. Russia  is exhausted in order to create because her creation is needed  by more than just the Russian people.    Look at what America is doing, at the police-like fervor  under the guise of reconciliation with which it inflames  hostility. Russia, tempered by all kinds of troubles and  misfortunes, having emerged from the crucible of all kinds of  temptations, is necessary to everyone. Her loving heart which  reconciles earthly passions is needed. Without her wise word,  said Dostoevsky, there will be no harmony in the world. That  would be a minor loss, but the disaster is that the world would  believe the deception of the Antichrist and blindly follow him  into the abyss.    Our Golgotha leads not to death but to resurrection!--it is  with these encouraging words that I wish to address all readers  of the newspaper DEN-ZAVTRA. Dear readers, you along with the  newspaper workers have experienced both the bitterness and the  joy, you have stood before the shameful court of law, and more  than once. That will not be in vain. We will not gloat about our  enemies and the fact that they have not always managed to  realize their evil intentions. Thus we want to say to them: God  be with you!    I also want to address my Easter message to workers and  readers who are not Russian and not Christian. Who knows the  human heart? Perhaps Christian truths are already beginning to  take hold in your hearts. Therefore I do not think that the  truths of love and resurrection are alien to you. And that being  the case I say to you: Christ is risen! We all have the same  God, there is no other God than the true God! Since for the  present day we are involved in the newspaper together it means  that we are proceeding together toward the true God, although in  different ways. And that which unites and gladdens us--this is  our common suffering. We shall always be brothers and rejoice in  one another's success, especially the success of our  long-suffering motherland in which we live together.    Nor would I want to forget those who are hostile to us.  Hostility has blinded you and you yourselves cannot see what you  are doing. Some day you will shed bitter tears: After all, many  of you are our blood brothers, but we are going against one  another as aliens.    God grant us that, having looked from our Golgotha of 1994  we  have seen the crucified and resurrected Christ and, along with  him, the crucified and resurrected Russia. All is forgiven with  resurrection, as it is said in the Easter Psalm, embracing one  another we shall cry out: Christ is risen from the dead, defying  death with death, giving life to the entombed.</p>

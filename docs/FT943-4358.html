			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Visible trade deficit beats City hopes with fall to Pounds 690m Britain's merchandise trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed in June as exports and imports rose to record levels. The visible trade deficit fell to an estimated, seasonally adjusted Pounds 690m in June from Pounds 1,045m in May, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. Exports rose in value by 3 1/2 per cent over the month to Pounds 11.35bn while imports grew less rapidly by  1/2 per cent to Pounds 12.04bn. The June deficit was well below the City's consensus forecast of Pounds 800m but the figures had little initial impact on financial markets. The May deficit was revised upwards slightly from the Pounds 1,032m shortfall published last month. Although the monthly trade figures are notoriously erratic, the CSO said that its est-imates of the trend showed a narrowing of the deficit. The news was hailed by City analysts as a sign that Britain appears so far to be escaping a deterioration of its trade position in spite of the apparent strengthening of its two-year-old economic recovery. Taking three-month figures, which the government regards as a better guide, exports rose in value by 4 per cent between the first and the second quarters of this year and were 13 per cent higher in the three months to the end of June compared with the same period in 1993. Imports rose in value by 2 1/2 per cent and 8 1/2 per cent respectively. The CSO's seasonally adjusted figures for volume trade, excluding oil and erratic items such as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver, showed a 2 1/2 per cent increase for exports and unchanged imports in the latest three months compared with the first quarter. Volume exports, excluding oil and erratics, were up 10 per cent compared with the year before, while import volumes were 7 per cent higher. The figures showed strong export growth to other members of the European Union, producing a drop in the UK's deficit on trade with the EU to an estimated Pounds 298m in June from Pounds 390m in May. The May figure was revised upwards from the Pounds 377m deficit published last month. Exports to the EU rose 3.6 per cent to Pounds 6.03bn in June from May while imports advanced by 1.9 per cent to Pounds 6.33bn. UK exports to EU countries grew more rapidly than those to the rest of the world between the first and second quarters although North America continued to be a buoyant market for British goods. Exports to Germany, France and the Benelux countries rose respectively by 5 1/2 per cent, 7 per cent and 6 per cent between the first and second quarters while UK exports to North America were up by 6 1/2 per cent in the period. Britain's surplus on trade in oil improved sharply to Pounds 491m in June from Pounds 398m in May as export volumes and prices rose. The surplus on oil rose from Pounds 900m in the first quarter to Pounds 1.3bn in the three months to June, its highest level since the first quarter of 1986. Analysts said the strong growth in UK export volumes reflected the economic recovery in continental Europe as well as the benefits of a low pound and spare productive capacity at home. However, the improvement in volumes was partly offset by a deterioration in Britain's terms of trade. While the unit value indices for UK exports increased by 1 1/2 per cent in the three months to June, higher commodity prices boosted the unit values of imports by 3 per cent.</p>

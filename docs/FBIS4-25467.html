			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China's exports have  been growing faster than imports in the first five months of  this year.    Exports were 24.1 percent up on the same period last year,  while imports were just 18.1 higher than those 1993 months,  according to the latest figures from China's Customs Department.    During this period, China's foreign trade volume totalled  76.77 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 21.1 percent over the  same period last year.    Exports, at 37.49 billion U.S. dollars, showed a steeper  rise  (24.1 percent) for the whole of the five-month period than they  had shown in the first four months (22 percent).    Imports for the five months totalled 39.28 billion U.S.  dollars, a rise of 18.1 percent over the same period last year.

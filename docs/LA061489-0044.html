			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'TRAPPED': HIGH-RISE TERROR ON USA NETWORK  </P> <P> "Trapped" (9-11 tonight on cable's USA Network) is a tightly wrought thriller  distinguished by its frequent use of the subjective eye (or camera "I," if you  will) -- in this case visual angles that catch the terrified point of view of a  woman stalked by a killer in a high-rise office building.  </P> <P> Kathleen Quinlan, as a management executive in a 63-story complex still under  construction, fills a cliche role with chills. Working too late one night, she  finds herself locked in the sprawling skyscraper with all the telephones dead,  not to mention her secretary and a heartless CEO whose toxic waste dumping has  triggered the killer's dementia.  </P> <P> Director and co-writer Fred Walton delivers a basic primer in taut suspense.  The craftmanship is assured, careening between first- and third-person  storytelling, creating terror in elevators, parking areas, rooftops and marble  corridors. Here is a genre thriller notable not for what you see but for what  you feel and hear.  </P> <P> The opening sequence, for example, perfectly and wordlessly sets up the  killer's motive and concludes with an outrageous image: The camera pans to an  eerie closeup of somebody's face that looks strangely asleep until, through  half open lips, a cockroach emerges from the mouth. Once in the high-rise, it's  George Koblasa's lensing and David Lloyd's editing, not dialogue by Walton and  co-writer Steve Feke, that propel the story. The killer, brandishing his  weapons of choice, a baseball bat and a dagger, is mirrored in quick, crazed  flashes through the eyes of Quinlan. Adding to the suspense is a major third  character, an industrial spy (nicely played by Bruce Abbott) who, inadvertently  caught in the killer's web, teams up with Quinlan in a cat-and-mouse run for  their lives.  </P> <P> The quiet sound track, the vengeful, wordless madman (Ben Loggins), and even  the building itself (the show was shot in Dallas) coalesce into a jumpy  catharsis. True film noir buffs, by the way, will be deliciously reminded of  the then-controversial 1947 Robert Montgomery MGM chiller, "Lady in the Lake"  (with Audrey Totter and Jayne Meadows), whose entire story was subjectively  seen through the eyes of Montgomery's Philip Marlowe.  </P></p>

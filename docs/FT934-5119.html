			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke tackles arcane mysteries - Analysis The Chancellor announced a number of proposals which will affect companies' corporation tax. Foreign Income Dividends He confirmed that the Foreign Income Dividend (FID) Scheme first announced in the March Budget will be introduced. Companies making the election will still be required to account for ACT on FIDs, but any surplus ACT paid in respect of a FID will now be recoverable. The shareholder receiving the FID is to be treated as having received income that has borne tax at the lower rate of 20 per cent, but basic rate taxpayers will not suffer further income tax on the dividend. But two classes of shareholders will be disadvantaged by the proposals. The dividend will not carry a tax credit, which normal dividends do, so that tax-exempt investors will not be able to reclaim any tax in relation to a FID, and overseas shareholders will not be able to benefit from any arrangements in Double Tax Treaties that enable repayment of all or part of the tax credit. While consultation following the announcements in March have resulted in some improvements, the Chancellor has not accepted that dividends can 'streamed' between FIDs and normal dividends. Effective streaming can now only be achieved by having different classes of shares, and finance directors and investors are unlikely to be attracted to that idea. Proposals for international headquarters companies will be a major benefit to international groups that have wished to establish a European holding company in the UK, but deterred, as so many have been by the UK rules on ACT. Tax haven companies The Chancellor announced an amendment to the tax treatment of Controlled Foreign Companies that will reduce the opportunities for tax planning. Non-trading CFCs are able to avoid a CFC charge if they meet the acceptable distribution test. This has previously required the company to distribute 90% of its accounting profits (less capital gains). However, the CFC charge is based on profits as adjusted for tax purposes. Companies were able to exploit the differences between accounting and taxable profits to reduce the impact of the CFC rules. It is proposed that for accounting periods of a CFC that end on or after 30 November, the acceptable distribution test will be based on taxable profits, so eliminating the opportunity for planning. The Inland Revenue estimate that the measure will yield an additional Pounds 50m in tax. Company residence The definition of company residence in UK legislation differs from that in double tax treaties. This causes difficulties where, under UK domestic rules, a company is treated as resident here, but is not resident for the purposes of the treaty. Some companies have exploited this distinction, for example enabling them to benefit from UK reliefs for losses under UK domestic legislation, even though profits may not be taxable because of the terms of the treaty. The Chancellor announced that for accounting periods beginning on or after Budget day, where a company is treated as non-resident for treaty purposes, it will also be treated as non-resident for UK purposes. Capital allowances The Chancellor announced proposals to stop 25% capital allowances being claimed on buildings that were said to constitute plant. There is no statutory definition of plant, and the courts have, in recent years, been increasingly sympathetic to claims from taxpayers that buildings and other structures that performed a function in relation to the trade, and were not only the setting in which the trade was carried on, were really plant. Consultation on the Corporation Tax treatment of interest The Inland Revenue will undertake a review of the tax treatment of interest paid and received by companies. The Corporation Tax treatment of interest can be very different from the accounts treatment of the same interest, and is founded in legal based distinctions between capital and revenue. The uncertainty causes problems in determining the correct tax treatment and timing of interest paid and received, both within the UK, and when considering the tax treatment of payments of interest into and out of the UK. The review will attempt to identify how to remove these inconsistencies, and uncertainties, and are a welcome attempt to eliminate some of the more arcane mysteries of the UK tax system.

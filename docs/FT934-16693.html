			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Balance maintained on a floating plane - Maggie Urry analyses the recent return to popularity of seeking a stock market listing THE RUSH of new companies wanting to join the stock market appears to show no sign of abating, with most issues having been well received by investors. There has been a balance in the market with no swing towards flops or heavy oversubscriptions and big stagging profits. Can this happy equilibrium continue? There seems to be a never-ending supply of companies, mainly at the smaller end of the spectrum, anxious to see their shares traded on the stock market and gain access to the equity capital they require. So far, corporate financiers agree, the quality of the issues has been good. A company which has survived the recession of the last few years and come out with a track record fit to be seen in a prospectus, has a head start. Many are management buy-outs, such as the forthcoming flotation of Allders, the retail group bought out from Hanson in 1989, and Parkdean Leisure, the holiday park operator bought from Beazer in the same year. Such flotations are often seeking an exit for venture capital backers and a chance to recapitalise. As well as recession, the companies have been tested by the rigours of being bought and examined by investors, and in many cases, the financial stringency imposed by heavy debt. Investors have yet to have their fingers badly burnt by an issue, although one or two have not opened trading at a premium. Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator, for example floated at 225p but saw the shares end their first day's dealing at 207p. Now they stand at 200p. Says one merchant banker: 'There have been no flops yet. But when venture capitalists sell, you know the market is too high.' He contrasts the prices available through trade sales and those through flotation. With only a few exceptions, such as Glass Glover, which was bought by Unigate, and Medway Ports which fell to Mersey Docks and Harbour, companies are planning to float to obtain a higher price than they could achieve in a takeover. Usually the reverse is true, with takeover multiples higher than flotation ratings, reflecting a premium for control. Currently, the market is on a high historic rating while bidders are wary of making acquisitions. Says a stockbroker: 'We are still in the early phase of the economic upturn. It is unlikely investors will be burnt soon, but it will happen one day'. Another adds: 'Our sense is that the quality is still good'. However, 'there will be some issues people will regret in three to five years time'. All say that it is up to the issuing houses to act as quality controller. 'We must be very careful about the quality of companies we sponsor,' says one merchant banker. However, is there sufficient demand from investors to match the supply of new companies? Although there are no signs yet of a turn against new issues, the market is fickle and the tap of capital can be turned off rapidly. A promising start to 1992 was disrupted in the summer when some flotations went badly. It was not until the autumn that confidence was regained. One difference this year is that institutional investors have become keen on small companies again and smaller capitalisation stocks have outperformed the top shares. Flotations, says one broker, 'are a means for large investors to commit material amounts to smaller companies . . . and ones which are newly verified' referring to the scrutiny sponsors apply to companies before they are floated. Institutions can buy a large block of shares through the institutional placing element of an issue. With already quoted companies they can spend weeks trying to build a decent holding through the market. The institutional appetite for new equity reflects the rise in the stock market this year and has been demonstrated by the take up of rights issues. These, at approaching Pounds 10bn so far in 1993, far outweigh the supply of new shares from flotations. Further, some of the shares of larger companies coming to market may prove more attractive than those being issued in rescue rights by floundering companies. James Capel, the stockbroker which has been involved in many new issues this year, reckons that shares in management buy-outs which float perform better than the market. This confounds the sceptical view that mbo managers dress their companies up for sale so as to realise the maximum incentives under ratchet arrangements typical of such buy-outs. However, the list of forthcoming floats includes a number of larger companies such as Gartmore, the investment management house, DFS Furniture, the retailer, Allders, and, after Christmas, Dairy Crest, the dairy products group, and possibly William Hill, the betting shop chain. These may prove to be a tougher test of the market's acceptance of new issues. As well as institutions, private investors appear to be taking an interest in new issues, although few involve full offers for sale. Retail investors may fear they will find it harder to buy shares in flotations because of the Stock Exchange's upcoming changes in the issuing rules. From December 1 issuers can place firmly shares worth up to Pounds 25m with institutions, an increase from the existing Pounds 15m. Issues above Pounds 25m but below Pounds 50m must involve a financial intermediaries offer as well, where investors can apply to buy shares through an intermediary such as a stockbroker. Public offers, in which investors can fill in an application form from a newspaper or a prospectus, are required above Pounds 50m, a rise from Pounds 30m. Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings at the Stock Exchange, believes retail investors can successfully use the financial intermediaries offer to apply for shares, and he has had no complaints from people saying they have been denied the opportunity to participate. At the moment there seems no cloud on the horizon to disrupt the balance between supply and demand. However, market operators who remember the flops and oversubscriptions of the past, believe it is only a matter of time before something goes wrong. But if sponsors exercise sufficient control over the companies that come to market, and estimate demand for and price issues correctly, the worst excesses of the past should be avoided.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Editorial report] Russian media have reported various  initiatives to overcome what has been characterized as a  continuing demographic crisis. In an article published in the  Minis try of Health periodical VRACH [Physician], Candidate of  Medical Sciences V. Brutman, who is a member of the  administration of Independent Association of Pediatric  Psychiatrists and Psychologists, reported that a group of  physicians, psychologists, legal scholars and sociologists has  proposed a program for women deemed likely to obtain abortions  or to reject their newborns (Sep 93). A key element of the  draft program ``Prevention of Early Rejection of Motherhood'' is  a crisis center, which would identify and counsel pregnant women  at risk of rejecting their infants. The crisis center would  maintain a hot line and a crisis team, which would visit  maternity hospitals to intervene in cases where rejection seems  iUinent. Women with high-risk social indicators would be  hospitalized at maternity homes to receive ``intensive  assistance in continuing their pregnancies.'' After providing  therapy to restore normal parent-child relations, a live-in  ``rehabilitation center'' would keep its graduates under  observation for several years. The measures are intended to  support women without coercion.    More recently, a different approach to demographic problems  was suggested by biologist Evgeniy Tsenov in an article on the  first page of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI (26 Feb 1994). Tsvenov, who  blames the country's demographic decline on its acute  environmental problems, excessive consumption of inferior  quality alcohol and abortions, opposes the manufacture of  contraceptives in Russia.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Reed Elsevier chief quits over policy Mr Peter Davis, one of the leading executives in the international publishing industry, yesterday resigned unexpectedly as co-chairman of Reed Elsevier. The Anglo-Dutch information group said Mr Davis, who had been a leading figure in merging Reed International of the UK and Elsevier of the Netherlands in January 1993, had resigned in a dispute over the group's future management structure. The executive committee which runs the merged company - Reed and Elsevier keep separate listings on the UK and Netherlands stock markets  - decided that in future the co-chairmen should be responsible for strategy, management development and corporate communications. Two members of the committee will be responsible for the operating businesses, which range from consumer magazines and newspapers to business and academic publications. The company said that although there was full agreement within the board on strategy, Mr Davis had resigned because the new allocation of responsibilities would not enable him 'to play an effective role suited to his management style'. The City took a relaxed view of Mr Davis's departure mainly because of the assurance that the group's interim results - due in August - were on budget and would be 'usefully ahead of last year'. Reed International's shares initially shed 50p on the news but recovered to close at 741p, down 9p on the day. In Amsterdam, Elsevier's shares closed Fl 1.8 lower at Fl 150.2, having dipped to Fl 145 at one stage. Mr Davis said yesterday: 'I have given a lot to Reed so the decision was not taken lightly. I have been so involved in turning Reed from a conglomerate to a major publishing company and putting the two businesses (Reed and Elsevier) together. The business has done well and is doing well.' One City analyst said: 'They have lost a charismatic leader, but perhaps the game has changed.' Businesses such as IPC, the magazine division, and Reed Regional, which runs local newspapers, may be too cyclical and consumer-oriented for the group, he said. Mr Irvine emphasised that it was business as normal, and the company would soon begin looking at two large potential acquisitions, the database interests of the Mead Corporation and Ziff Communications, although Reed Elsevier would not try to buy both.

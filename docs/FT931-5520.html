			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Learning from Barclays WHEN BARCLAYS raised Pounds 921m in new capital in 1988, the FT's Lex column consoled itself that, though the issue might lead to lax lending, 'at least Barclays will soon have plenty of capital to cushion itself against its future bad debts'. What seemed a pessimistic comment has proved wildly over-optimistic. In the last two years Barclays has taken charges of over Pounds 4bn for bad and doubtful debts, a figure that dwarfs the capital raised five years ago. In 1992 alone, the bank discovered nearly Pounds 800m of bad lending to the property sector; nearly Pounds 600m was accounted for by 27 big borrowers. These are remarkable figures. They call into question not merely the judgments at Barclays but also the framework within which British banking has been operating. Take Barclays first. Those culpable range from senior managers who authorised the lending to a board which allowed them to dash for market share. Institutional investors could also have taken a firmer line. They complained in private about the 1988 capital increase and extracted promises of future good behaviour, but voted in the end - by 95m votes to 11m - in favour of the issue. Against this background, yesterday's cut in the final dividend is an appropriate response: it is right to keep available funds to strengthen capital, rather than pay it out to shareholders. It would also be appropriate for directors to reflect on their own roles in this story. Now turn to the banking system as a whole. The loan losses at Barclays differ only in degree from those suffered elsewhere. Even the most prudent, well-managed banks have recently found themselves making disconcertingly high bad debt provisions. Bankers argue that, though there was some boom-time relaxation of lending standards, the real cause of the disaster lay in the economic policy of the late 1980s. Yet this is a somewhat circular argument. The boom was fuelled not by an irresponsible surge of government money-creation, but by a failure on the government's part to curb the breakneck credit expansion of the banks. True, ministers revelled in the false prosperity the credit surge created. True, the Bank of England could have warned more fiercely and insistently about the risks of property lending. The crucial decisions which created the boom, however, were not imposed on the banks from outside; they were made internally, by managers hoping for higher profits in a newly deregulated financial services market. The lessons of the banking losses of the past two years, therefore, involve the constraints and incentives for those managers. Deregulating banks' assets while maintaining an implicit guarantee of their liabilities has proved a recipe for managerial irresponsibility. Those managers, in turn, have been egged on by shareholders unwilling to offer a corresponding proprietorial discipline. Bankers, politicians, supervisors and shareholders are all chastened now. Yet nothing has changed. The imbalances in the banking framework and in corporate governance remain. It will happen again.</p>

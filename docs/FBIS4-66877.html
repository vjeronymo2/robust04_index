			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Zolotov report: ``No Reduction in Secrecy''] </F>   [Text] ``Moskon' 94,'' the Second International Conference  on Chemical Disarmament, ended yesterday in Moscow. It had been  opened by Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who only two weeks  ago headed the Russian president's Committee for the  Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons.    As expected, the organizers did everything possible to  exclude critics of official chemical disarmament programs from  the forum. However, three dissident scientists--namely Lev  Fedorov, Vladimir Uglev, and Vladimir Petrenko--managed to get  in, in the capacity of unofficial guests. But only  representatives of the press were able to discover their point  of view: All three were refused a place on the rostrum.  Vladimir Uglev said in conversation with TRUD's correspondent  that this was dictated by the Russian authorities' wish to dodge  a decision on fundamental questions. In his words, whereas our  American partners are attentively monitoring the quantitative  indicators of the destruction of toxic substances, the methods  of destroying these substances, which themselves present a  serious threat to human beings, are still being kept secret and  are monitored by no one.    The reasons for Kuntsevich's dismissal from the chairmanship  of the president's committee are still unknown. Many link it to  the fact that the academician's stance on chemical disarmament  questions had started to encroach on Defense Ministry interests.  His approaches required additional expenditure, and this  displeased many people. As for Kuntsevich himself, he said in  conversation with TRUD's correspondent:    ``I do not know why I was fired. As an ex-military man, I  refuse to comment on the fact.''</p>

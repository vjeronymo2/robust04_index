			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: TransAtlantic seeks fresh capital and London listing TRANSATLANTIC, the holding company for the offshore interests of Liberty Life, the South African insurance group, is to raise Pounds 149m (Dollars 259.2m) through a one-for-four rights issue, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of both companies, also announced yesterday that Luxembourg-listed TransAtlantic would seek an 'early' listing in London - since Sun Life, the UK insurer, is now its main investment and is itself no longer listed. A long-mooted UK listing for London-based TransAtlantic will make future capital raising easier, not least by making for a more liquid market in its shares. TransAtlantic said that a listing would necessitate 'an acceptable spread of shareholders' in TransAtlantic 'and some rationalisation' of the structure of Capital &amp; Counties, its UK property subsidiary. TransAtlantic owns 82.6 per cent of Capital &amp; Counties' ordinary shares and 31.4 per cent of its convertible preference shares. Analysts believe a buy-out of minority shareholders is likely. Capital &amp; Counties shares closed up 12p at 178p yesterday.</p>

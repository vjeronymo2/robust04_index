			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Over-stretched Orange turns into a lemon - County's bankruptcy shock raises the ugly spectre of recession / Wall Street Is Wall Street predicting a recession, and could the Orange County investment debacle bring such an eventuality nearer? This might seem an odd question given that the US economy is growing at an impressive 4 per cent a year; that corporate earnings are strong; that the labour market is as close to full employment as it is ever likely to get; and that Orange County's problems, serious as they are, are likely to be confined to the once-prosperous municipality which occupies a few thousand square miles of southern California. Yet, judging from the performance of financial markets this week, traders and investors appear to be anticipating a sharp slowdown in economic growth early next year, and quite possibly a slide into recession before the end of 1995. Also, some commentators on Wall Street believe the Orange County crisis could inflict serious damage on both investor and consumer confidence, hastening the onset of recession. To take the markets' economic forecast first. One of the most revealing developments of the past few weeks has been the flattening of the yield curve. The curve, a graphical depiction of the yields on securities with varying maturities, has been flattening rapidly because yields on short-term government paper have been rising, while yields on long-term paper have been falling. In the past week alone, the difference (or 'spread') between yields on two-year notes and 30-year bonds has narrowed from 60 basis points (each basis point is one hundredth of a per cent) to 35 basis points, its lowest level since mid-1990. The curve is flattening because investors are buying long-term government securities in the belief that the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy this year will keep inflationary pressures in check by engineering a sharp deceleration in economic growth in 1995. At the same time, investors are selling short-term securities because they are worried about the possibility that the Fed will initiate another increase in short-term interest rates soon, If the trend of selling at the short end of the bond market and buying at the long end continues, the yield curve will be flat before the end of the year - and a flat yield curve, as analysts have been quick to point out, occurs typically when the bond market sees recession ahead. None of this has escaped the attention of the stock market, where share prices remain under pressure as investors increasingly become concerned about the outlook for economic and corporate earnings growth. In the first 4 1/2 trading days of this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 75 points, or 2 per cent, and broader measures of the market - particularly the indices of small-capitalisation stocks - suffered even larger losses. The traditional December rally in share prices now looks more unlikely than ever. Adding to the market's tribulations has been the bankruptcy of Orange County, California, the fifth largest county in the US and - until this week, at least - one of the wealthiest. In the strictest terms, the county's woes are not the stock market's problem. Orange's finances are in a mess because it borrowed billions of dollars and invested them in a range of fixed-income securities (and some derivatives) in the expectation that interest rates would remain low. The sharp rise in rates destroyed that strategy. Now, the value of the county's portfolio has fallen sharply and it cannot meet its debt obligations. This week, Wall Street firms which had lent money to Orange rushed to sell more than Dollars 7bn in securities which they had held as collateral against the loans. Although this fire sale created considerable unrest in the bond market - and, in some cases, depressed prices and raised yields - there was no direct impact on share prices. The crisis, however, had a noticeable impact on investor sentiment. The bankruptcy filing by Orange was by far the largest of its kind in the history of local government in the US. Concern has grown on Wall Street that other counties or cities may have pursued similar highly-leveraged investment strategies which could lead to further bankruptcies. A meltdown of municipal finances would hit local economies hard and worsen the expected nation-wide slowdown in business activity next year. The Orange County debacle is likely to overshadow the market into the new year and at least one leading Wall Street economist, Michael Metz of Oppenheimer, believes it is a watershed, the beginning of the end of what he called 'financial buccaneering' in America. By buccaneering, he means the excessive use of leverage, the use of complex derivatives for speculation, and the high-risk strategies of hedge funds. While an end to these activities may not necessarily be bad for the stock market, or even the economy, Wall Street has made a lot of money from them, and would be loath to let them go.  ------------------------------------------------- Dow Jones Ind Average  ------------------------------------------------- Monday       3,741.92      -3.70 Tuesday      3,745.95      +4.03 Wednesday    3,735.52      -10.43 Thursday     3,685.73      -49.79 Friday       3,691.11      +5.38  -------------------------------------------------</p>

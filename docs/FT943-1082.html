			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Charles Church refinanced Banks which led the financial rescue of housebuilder Charles Church three years ago have agreed to write off a further Pounds 50.7m of debt to aid the company's recuperation and eventually allow it to be floated. They have also provided Pounds 10m of new loans to enable the company to buy land in the home counties and increase its building programme as the housing market recovers. In a letter to shareholders Dr John Roberts, chairman, said the independent directors had been advised by NatWest Markets that 'a future flotation of Charles Church Group is most likely to maximise returns to shareholders and subject to favourable economic and market conditions is a realistic prospect'. The latest refinancing involves a complex share restructure. Banks which provided the original rescue package and have agreed the further debt reduction have increased their stake in the group from 42 to 80 per cent. Preference shareholders and other banks which provided mezzanine finance in 1989 have had their stake reduced from about 40 per cent to 10 per cent. Charles Church management have retained their 10 per cent holding. The continuing high level of Charles Church borrowings meant that the group recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.5m last year even though it moved back into the black at operating level. Trading profit was Pounds 332,000 compared with a loss of Pounds 17.67m the previous year. Mr Stewart Baseley, Charles Church chief executive, said: 'The company's fortunes have improved significantly and the business is now performing well. As a consequence our banks did not need to do anything, but based on our recent track record have demonstrated their confidence and support in the management by investing further into our profitable growth and expansion.' Dr Roberts said that the company had been due to repay banks about Pounds 14.2m of debt and accrued interest in August next year, with similar amounts due in 1996 and 1997. The independent directors believed it would not be able to meet these obligations and supported the restructuring as 'the only way by which shareholders as a whole may achieve any meaningful future value for their shareholdings'. Borrowings following the restructuring have been reduced from Pounds 90.7m to Pounds 50.5m, including the new Pounds 10m loan for land purchases. Shareholders' funds, which previously were in deficit, are now back in the black, enabling the company to pay dividends in the future.</p>

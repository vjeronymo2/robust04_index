			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Grand restaurant with a past - Giles MacDonogh traces the eventful history of Horchers, now in Madrid but once of Berlin TO THE unsuspecting diner, Horchers could be just about any grand Madrid restaurant. Closer examination, however, might give some indication of its long and eventful past: the Meissen figurine on the table representing a Prussian dragoon from Frederick the Great's time; some German prints on the walls; and, better still, the menu with its smattering of dishes of Germanic origin. There is lots of game, but game is game. What about matjes herrings in cream with apples? Or wiener schnitzel? Or baumkuchen? Horchers' story begins in 1905, not in Madrid but in the west end of Berlin. The original premises were at 21 Luther (now Martin Luther) Strasse. At first, Gustav Horcher's wine restaurant was overshadowed by the great hotels and Borchardt in the Franzosische Strasse. It was not until 1923 that it made its first appearance in the English-language edition of Baedecker's famous guide. It failed to merit a star. All this had changed, though, by the time the next German edition appeared in 1936. 'Belongs to the top category,' enthused Baedecker. 'Excellent.' And a star was awarded. Horchers also had a protector. Indeed, from the first years of the movement in Berlin, Horchers might be said to have marched in step with the Nazi party. Four frustrating years after the failure of the Munich putsch in 1923, Hermann Goering arrived in Berlin at the end of 1927. Money was short until the former air ace was elected to the Reichstag in the spring of the following year. When Hitler agreed to his candidature, it was to Horchers that Goering went to celebrate. By July 1934, Goering was already Prussian minister president and the second most powerful man in Germany. That month, he held a second, and far more sinister, celebration in the restaurant in the Luther Strasse. It was there that he threw a dinner to thank his managers for their help in the bloody Night of the Long Knives when a 100 or so political opponents were butchered. Crab was the order of the day. Goering's continued protection must have been valued highly by Gustav Horcher and his son, Otto. Once the war had started, the Luftwaffe chief had Horchers' staff exempted from military service and tripled the petrol allowance for restaurant vehicles. When Otto Horcher discovered a hoard of 70,000 bottles of port, Goering ensured that the bulk of the wine was acquired for the Luftwaffe - but only after creaming off 10,000 bottles for Horchers and a few cases for himself. Horchers' rise under the Nazis was to have a European dimension, and one which became linked closely to the subjugation of mainland Europe by the soldiers of the Wehrmacht. As journalist Hans Georg von Studnitz wrote in the autumn of 1943: 'As the favourite chef of Hermann Goering, Horcher has risen to become the foremost restaurateur of the Third Reich . . .' With Germany occupying half of Europe, Horcher's sphere of activity broadened. He took over Die Drei Husaren in Vienna from Count Paly Palffy. Then he moved to Maxim's in Paris and opened branches in Oslo and Belgrade. Before the second world war, he held the concession for the German restaurant in London's Mayfair. The intimate, leather-hung restaurant in the Luther Strasse received its share of famous guests. In 1937, Nazi chiefs Heinrich Himmler and Joachim von Ribbentrop entertained the Duke of Windsor there. It was a regular favourite of the chief of German military intelligence, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. But Horchers was never Nazi. Most of the anti-Nazi frondeurs ate there and the Gestapo was not welcome. An English journalist, Ian Colvin, who had known Horchers well from his days as a Berlin correspondent before the war, noted: 'Horcher's food was excellent, brought in from Denmark, and his French wines were bought with occupation francs at controlled prices.' But as the danger from bombing became more acute, the Luther Strasse premises were 'abandoned for a safer villa in Wannsee suburb standing among trees on a sand ridge above the lake'. The Nazi defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943 dealt a lethal blow to the few remaining grand restaurants in Berlin. At Horchers, though, the manager tried to make up for the occasional gap in the menu with his old-world charm. This did not work on Josef Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda supremo, who mentioned Horchers specifically when he announced new austerity measures to accompany 'total war'. Goering was not amused by the order to close a restaurant which had been supplying him with food for years. In a 45-minute telephone conversation, he told the gauleiter of Berlin: 'If you close Horchers today, I shall open it tomorrow as a Luftwaffe club]' Goebbels responded by staging a 'spontaneous demonstration' in which one of the restaurant's big windows was smashed. When Goebbels' men returned the next day, they found it guarded by Luftwaffe sentries. With Goering's help, Horchers limped on in Berlin for a few more months. But after the massive Allied raid on the city on November 23 1943, Otto Horcher must have seen that there was little point in hanging on. Diners who turned up at Horchers in January 1944 found it shut. By that time, however, the restaurant had opened its doors in Madrid - on November 11 1943. Gustav Horcher died three years later but Otto lived until 1977. The restaurant is now owned by another Gustav, Otto's son, who was only three when he left Germany. Horchers was one of several German restaurants in the Spanish capital, but it was always the best. And visitors to Madrid after the war remember seeing the SS daredevil Otto Skorzeny, holding court there. At that time, he boasted he was in charge of the Odessa operation which helped SS men escape the justice of the courts.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: State of US healthcare no threat to Canadians Sir, Mr Fredric Steinberg of Atlanta, Georgia (Letters, October 24), expresses great concern that Canadians will have nowhere to go for treatment 'if US healthcare goes down the socialised road to medical oblivion'. Do please let me allay Mr Steinberg's fears: in spite of all the American-based propaganda he may have heard to the contrary, Canada's health system, like the Canadians who use it, is alive, well and thriving. Yes, we are working to improve elements of our health system and we are certainly faced with cutbacks in publicly-funded health programmes. However, Canadian governments, healthcare providers and the general public remain firmly committed to the principle of financially unimpeded access to healthcare as a building block for the continued well-being of our population. Irrespective of the future state of our American neighbour's health system, Canadians can continue to look forward to first-rate care within our own borders without regard to an individual's ability to pay. We sympathise with the uninsured Americans who do not now seem likely to share that privilege and security in their own country. Carol Clemenhagen, president, Canadian Hospital Association, 17 York, Suite 100, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 9J6, Canada</p>

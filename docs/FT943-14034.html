			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Storms in a coffee cup: The effect of severe frost in Brazil Coffee drinkers in Europe and the US may find the prospect of up to 50 per cent rises in the price of a packet of ground beans a little galling. For Brazilian coffee farmers who have lost some or all of their plantations, the frosts that have sent the coffee market into a frenzy this week have been little short of disastrous. Both farmers and consumers are losers on the coffee market's wheel of fortune. On the winning side are commodity speculators who have made millions of dollars as prices surged, and coffee growers unaffected by the frost whose future profits may be helped. The combination of last weekend's severe frost with another a fortnight earlier is believed to have been unprecedented in Brazil, the world's largest producer. The damage to the crop that will be harvested this time next year is expected to be the worst since a bitter frost in 1975 destroyed more than two-thirds of Brazil's production. The prospect of a squeeze on supplies sent prices soaring; in London, robusta beans for delivery in September rose to Dollars 4,000 a tonne, 230 per cent higher than at the end of last year. Even before the frosts, however, the market had climbed nearly 100 per cent this year, driven by supply shortages, dwindling consumer stocks and speculative interest. The rise has been all the more remarkable because prices have been depressed for the past four years. Last October the main producing countries began withholding supplies to try to revive the market. The agreement gave the market an initial boost, and it then gained fresh momentum this year. US investment funds provided some of the impetus, though Mr Robert MacArthur, head of trading in tropical products at Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, in London, says many took profits at the end of May, when New York arabica futures became volatile. He estimates their well-timed flirtation with the market netted between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn - even though they missed the frost-driven rally. Coffee drinkers have not been so fortunate. The latest surge in world prices signalled the end of a period when self-induced insomnia was cheap, though retail price changes tend to lag behind world bean prices because manufacturers buy stocks four or more months in advance. Continental European drinkers, who usually prefer ground coffee, should see the biggest price jump: raw beans account for a lower proportion of the cost of instant coffee, where production and advertising outweigh the price of the beans in a jar (see graphic). Nestle this week raised ground coffee prices in the US by 13 per cent, and instant coffee by 10 per cent. In Germany some roasters marked up ground coffee prices by 28 per cent and forecast the total increase in coming months could be 50 per cent. Douwe Egberts, the leading brand in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, has raised the price of a 250g pack of ground coffee by 26 per cent since January and further rises are possible. Mr Herman Bouwman, director of corporate communications, says this year's increases have had no impact on sales and points out that retail prices are rising from a low point. A pack of medium-quality Douwe Egberts coffee in the Netherlands today costs Fl 3.40, compared with Fl 6.50 in 1977, two years after the devastating frost in Brazil. In the UK, where the market is dominated by instant coffee, prices are forecast by the industry to rise by a further 15 per cent to 20 per cent in the autumn after increases of more than 10 per cent so far this year. Nestle, which has 58 per cent of the UK instant coffee market, points out that the average price of a 100g jar of Nescafe had remained at Pounds 1.39 for four years until January. The price had fallen by 13 per cent when world prices plummeted 60 per cent following the breakdown in 1989 of an export quota pact between producer and consumer countries. Not surprisingly, Nestle does not think the latest increases will kill the UK taste for coffee. 'Ten to 15 years ago, we drank four cups of tea for every cup of coffee,' said Mr Mick Casey, a Nestle spokesman. 'Now for every cup of coffee, it's just over two cups of tea.' He adds there was 'no consumer resistance' to the 12 1/2 per cent rise in the price of Nescafe in January - though producers are not so sanguine about consumers' response in emerging markets such as eastern Europe. Moreover, the upward pressure on prices may not last. World coffee producers could be tempted by high prices to expand output and improve productivity, which some producers fear would lead to a repeat of the 'boom and bust' cycle. New plants take about three years to produce a crop, so farmers planting now may have only a couple of years before overproduction pushes prices down again. 'The farmers lose in the short term as most have already sold their crops for this year. In the long term they lose because of the short-lived nature of the price rises,' said Mr Richard Hide, coffee buyer for Cafedirect, a fair trading organisation which guarantees its farmers a minimum price. Cafedirect is backing calls from producer countries for a revival of an international agreement to stabilise the market by setting target prices and operating supply controls. But consumer countries, led by the US, have shown no eagerness to discuss such proposals. Trade negotiators argue international pacts bring pressure for higher prices for producers rather than stable prices for consumers. The coffee market's roller-coaster looks set to hurtle on.  -------------------------------------------- Nescafe Gold Blend  -------------------------------------------- Retail price:                154 pence Raw coffee                    30p (19%) Production &amp; packaging        32p (21%) Marketing &amp; administration    46p (30%) Retail margin                 15p (10%) Profit before tax &amp; interest  31p (20%)  -------------------------------------------- Estimates are before Brazilian frost spells  -------------------------------------------- Source: Maarten Slendebroek, Smith New Court  --------------------------------------------</p>

He noted: This action  is not linked politically with the Papoulias-Vance meeting; the  wagons were in Greek territory before 16 February.    Responding to a question, Mr. Venizelos said that this was  not a relaxation of the Greek measures and noted it is a matter  of 4,500 tons of oil, which is only sufficient for the Skopje  refinery's operation for half a day.</p>

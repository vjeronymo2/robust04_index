			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Du Pont hoists payout despite 18.3% reverse DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company that last week agreed to buy the nylon business of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday disclosed an 18.3 per cent slump in its first-quarter net profit, to Dollars 482m. The decline, which translates into 71 cents per share, against 88 cents a year ago, was struck on revenues 5.2 per cent lower at Dollars 9.2bn. The company blamed the sales drop on lower worldwide prices for crude oil and refined products, and to the exclusion of sales from its coal business - now part of a joint venture. Nonetheless it decided to boost the dividend from 42 to 44 cents a share. Mr Edgar Wollard, chairman, said he was encouraged by indications of a broader economic improvement, as reflected in stronger earnings for non-petroleum businesses such as fibres and polymers. The petroleum division's earnings slumped 63 per cent. Fibre division earnings were 45 per cent higher while polymer earnings were 56 per cent up on 1991's depressed level. Chemical earnings fell by 25 per cent, because of lower sales of intermediates and higher costs associated with the company's expansion of its white pigment capacity in the US. Diversified business earnings were 29 per cent higher.</p>

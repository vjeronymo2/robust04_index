			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Market minnow with a touch of individuality  -How the benefits of a restructuring programme are showing through at Linread LINREAD, the Midlands-based maker of fasteners largely for the motor and aerospace industries, is restructuring to create the robustness which the Bank of England has found to be a characteristic of UK manufacturers as they come out of recession. It is in the middle of a programme which is already having a marked effect on the speed and cost at which fasteners come out of its plants in Birmingham, Redditch, Leicester and, in north-east England, Peterlee. The programme is typical of what has been taking place in the Midlands manufacturing sector. Increases in productivity at big and small companies alike have fed the market hope that engineering companies are good recovery stocks. Hence the rise in the FT-A Metals and Metal Forming Index from the year's low point last January of 319.37 to current levels of about 460. Hence too, at 2.38 per cent, the relatively low dividend yield for the sector. Within the sector, Linread's share price has been trading latterly within reach of its 1993 high of 128p. But, with a market value of just over Pounds 14m, it is a market minnow. The price is of general interest only because it reflects a trend: Glynwed, with a market value 45 times greater, has also seen its price near its 1993 high and has the highest p/e in the sector at 29. Although Linread's programme is typical in its objectives and does not claim to be original in content, its timing is individual. Glynwed started responding to recession in 1990, when it began to reduce its payroll. The full force of the Linread programme became apparent only last year and will not be fully effective until the end of 1993. It is, then, late in the economic cycle. This reflected internal circumstances. Linread seemed just like any moderately successful small manufacturer until 1991, when a breakdown in stock controls led not only to losses but also to a management shakeout which saw the arrival in early 1992 of Mr Peter Harrisson as chief executive. Mr Harrisson then set off his own changes. There will be two new managing directors for the main operating divisions by September. New people have come in to the tier underneath, making immediate impact at the operational level. Such changes have become a general phenomenon as managements have sought to tweak the processes, manage the cash, to do more with less. Responsibilities have generally been more closely defined. Glynwed has already done what Linread is now doing: a new generation of executives has been put in place at the top of its main operating divisions. Although, at Linread, detailed practice differs from plant to plant, its internal changes have broad similarities. Factory lay-outs are changing from a division of space by function - all the grinding machines together, for example - to a division of space according to product. Manufacturing teams are being set up. The old system meant that there was always a large amount of work in progress and that management found it difficult to trace bottlenecks. Lead times were long. The biggest problem for the group was the traditional British bugbear: an inability to deliver on time. At North Bridge Fasteners, a Leicester subsidiary specialising in aero engine bolts, the average lead time for production was 10 weeks, much of which was taken up by half-made products queueing up, waiting for attention. The lead time has been reduced now to three weeks, the work in progress has been cut by 65 per cent and the distance a part travels around the shop has been cut by 70 per cent. Group pre-tax profits have returned: Pounds 1.3m in 1992. There was a quick effect on the balance sheet once stock and work in progress came out of the system. 'We took cash out of the factories and put it into the bank balance,' said Mr Harrisson. The Bank of England noted that companies entered the 1990s recession with a higher level of indebtedness than they had had in the 1980s downturn. Linread has been no exception in the recent attention it has given to gearing. During 1992, it halved gearing from 59 to 29 per cent and it is now reducing further. Companies are seeking the greater financial flexibility which comes from higher productivity. Just as Glynwed's sales per employee have risen since the end of 1991 from Pounds 75,000 to over Pounds 80,000, so at Linread's Redditch plant, where team working is most developed in the group and output per employee has risen from Pounds 30,500 in 1987 to Pounds 60,000. Until demand recovers, such productivity gains are likely to be the main source of increased profits. When Glynwed last week announced higher interim profits it made the point that they came more from internal change than external demand. Equally, Linread is coping with sluggish demand on the aerospace side and uncertain demand on the automotive side. But on both sides of the business its selling prices are under pressure. Coping with its own costs is the only immediate way to financial stability. The problem is general. As the CBI-BSL regional trends survey said yesterday, 'West Midlands manufacturers report falls in both unit costs and selling prices.'</p>

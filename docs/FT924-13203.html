			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / German industry gloomy on prospects for growth WESTERN German industry expects output to stagnate in 1993, after a 1 per cent fall this year. Leading companies expect the worst of the downturn to be over by year-end, according to the Ifo economics institute in Munich. Meanwhile, the German engineering industry is labouring in depressed international markets. Many companies, including machine-tool makers, will record losses this year, Mr Berthold Leidinger, president of the VDMA industry association, said yesterday. The average net return on capital had fallen to an all-time low of less than 1.2 per cent. The industry, which has annual turnover of DM250bn (Pounds 100bn), would have to cut costs by up to 30 per cent to remain competitive, Mr Leidinger added. The 40 per cent appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar and a revaluation of 20 per cent against the yen over the past three years was a heavy burden. The motor industry has also warned of the need for cost reductions which could trim 200,000 jobs in coming years. Germany's Lufthansa airline plans to cut about 400 pilot jobs in 1993, as part of its cost reduction efforts, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Lufthansa employs about 3,200 pilots.</p>

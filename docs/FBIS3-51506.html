			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jan (EFE) -- The rebels who staged  an armed uprising in Chiapas State on 1 January can benefit from  an amnesty that was approved today by a plenum of the Mexican  Chamber of Deputies, as long as they suspend their violent  actions as of today. They will only benefit from the amnesty if  they surrender their weapons and release the hostages they are  holding, and they must adhere to the terms established by the  commission that is going to implement the law.    In addition to sending the amnesty bill to the National  Congress, President Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho Solis as  the special commissioner to negotiate peace and to establish  contact with the rebels in the Zapatist Army of National  Liberation. The Amnesty Law suspends penal sactions against  individuals who participated in the violent occupation of  several towns in Chiapas and in later clashes with the Mexican  Army.    The Chamber of Deputies received the bill and modified  certain articles to make the deadline for the surrender of  weapons more flexible and to establish that one condition for  the surrender of weapons would be a willingness to enter  negotiations. The bill originally established that the sole  beneficiaries of the amnesty would be those people who  participated in violent incidents between 1 January and 1100 on  16 January if they surrendered their weapons and adhered to the  benefits of this law.    The deputies added to the draft law an article that calls on  the executive branch to create a commission that will coordinate  the implementation of the law to strengthen legal procedures and  to prevent setting deadlines that hinder the implementation of  the law. The application of benefits of the amnesty will go into  effect the moment the commission declares a definitive end to  hostile actions.    Another change made to the draft law was the elimination of  a  30-day deadline and the inclusion of the delivery of hostages.  Also, it emphasized that the people receiving benefits of the  law will not be interrogated, investigated, summoned, or  bothered, inasmuch as amnesty includes a respect for human  rights.    The ruling explains that the Amnesty Law must be made public  and disseminated in Spanish and in the nine indian dialects that  are spoken in the area so that it will be learned as best  possible by those for whom it is intended.    The armed conflict in Chiapas began on 1 January with the  violent takeover of San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo,  Altamirano, Oxchuc, and Las Margaritas, from where the Armed  Forces expelled the rebels who remain entrenched in the  community of Guadalupe Tepeyac near the border with Guatemala.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow back on upgrade after a cautious start Wall Street AFTER AN uneasy start, Wall Street posted modest gains yesterday as investors put aside their concern over inflation and instead focused on signs of more robust economic growth, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 4.47 firmer at 3,647.90. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 0.64 at 460.21, while the American SE composite rose 1.27 to 476.60. The Nasdaq composite showed a solid gain of 3.22 at 766.21. New York SE volume totalled 234m shares and rises outnumbered falls by 1,174 to 896. The mood was decidedly cautious at the opening, as Wall Street looked ahead to this week's reports on producer and retail prices for October. With data expected to show a significant uptick in inflation, many investors were sitting on the sidelines, bracing themselves for a further increase in long-term interest rates later in the week, after the big sell-off last week. In the bond market, activity was light and prices drifted higher as traders anxiously awaited the inflation data. After early declines, the benchmark 30-year issue was trading  5/32 ahead at 100 23/32 , to yield 6.189 per cent. Prices at the short end of the maturity range were modestly firmer. In spite of concern over the October prices data, equity investors managed to regain their nerve near midsession, with cyclical stocks, which are most sensitive to changes in the economy, showing particular strength. In the automobile sector, Chrysler moved up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 5/8 , Ford Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 and General Motors Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 48 5/8 . In heavy equipment, Cummins Engine showed a Dollars 2 1/2 advance to Dollars 99 1/8 , while Caterpillar was Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 91 3/8 . One of the session's most heavily traded issues was RJR Nabisco, which softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 6 3/8 even though Bear Stearns upgraded the stock to a 'speculative buy'. Tobacco shares had surged on Friday on hopes of higher cigarette prices. Philip Morris also gave back some of last week's gain, shedding Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 . Paramount Communications climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 81 7/8 . At the weekend, Viacom sweetened its takeover offer for the entertainment company to Dollars 80 a share, or Dollars 10.4bn. On the American SE, Viacom class 'A' shares were down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 57 3/4 but the 'B' stock advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 48 1/2 . QVC, which is under pressure to raise its competing bid, eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52 7/8 on the Nasdaq market. In the pharmaceuticals sector, Medco Containment Services rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 after the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would not challenge Merck's Dollars 6m merger with the drug-distribution concern. Merck dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32. Canada AN EASING of prime lending rates to 5.5 per cent from 5.75 per cent by the major Canadian banks helped the Toronto market to break a three-day losing streak, rallying in heavy but reduced turnover. The TSE 300 index closed 14.4 better at 4,216.4 and rises outpaced declines by 416 to 350 after volume of 68.7m shares. Transportation recorded the day's biggest advance, 2.17 per cent. Golds eased slightly.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN  </P> <P> I suspect that Brown has spent the past years doing fundamental social research  and, like many of us who have taken a good, long look at where the United  States is going, has found that the 1990s will see a strong return to values,  ethics, the family and productivity. And so, Brown is back with a new image of  values, ethics, the family and productivity.  </P> <P> It is all an act, and if we are not willing to see through it, we'll have to  put up with his same old weaknesses and phony social programs.  </P> <P> JOE M.

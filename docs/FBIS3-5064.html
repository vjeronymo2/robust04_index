			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Thursday [3 March] suggested a cut in the size of  Japan's ground forces as part of a planned revision of the  country's basic defense policy that was formulated during the  Cold War, government officials said.    In a meeting with Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi, Hosokawa  reportedly said the revision of the 1976 national defense  program outline will inevitably focus on the size of the Ground  Self-Defense Force (GSDF).    Hosokawa's remark implies that the strength of the GSDF as  laid out in the outline could be reduced from 180,000 to less  than 150,000, the officials said.    Hosokawa instructed Aichi to take the lead in revising the  basic defense policy but do it in such a way as not to cause a  sense of insecurity among members of the GSDF, the officials  said.    Aichi reported to the prime minister the setting-up of a  defense agency panel to help review the national defense program  outline, adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Takeo Miki in  1976.    The program calls for the government to maintain Japan-U.S.  security arrangements to defend Japan against large-scale  attacks and also to build up Japan's own defense capabilities to  repel limited-scale invasions.    A numerical defense table attached to the outline sets the  size of the GSDF at 180,000 troops, but the actual number of  personnel is 152,000, chiefly because of difficulty in  recruiting volunteers.    Apart from the Defense Agency's panel, Hosokawa established  a  nine-member consultative council last month to review Japan's  basic defense policies.    The Defense Agency panel will give advice to the prime  minister's advisory body, officials said.</p>

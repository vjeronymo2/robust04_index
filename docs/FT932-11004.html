			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Berio's 'Epiphanies' - Music in New York Several out-of-town orchestras have brought new pieces to Carnegie Hall this spring: the San Francisco Symphony were here with John Harbison's Oboe Concerto just before their European tour, and the Baltimore Symphony brought George Perle's Adagio, a Carnegie commission. The Philadelphia Orchestra's contribution last week to this parade was a work both old and new, Luciano Berio's Epiphanies, which he promises is the final version of his Epifanie, begun in the 1950s. Epifanie always was a mutable score: a set of a dozen orchestral songs and interludes that could, in the fashion of the time, be put together in different ways to create different trajectories through the wide sky of musical voicing, from song to speech or vice versa, with visits to rhapsodic lyricism and stringent declamation. Epiphanies freezes the action. Now there is only one permitted ordering, which is, with one minor switch, the arrangement Berio had always preferred, taking the soloist from Proust's hesitant reverie to Brecht's bitter disillusionment, with Joyce's vision of a girl on the Liffey strand as the ecstatic centrepiece. Berio's elimination of the work's mobility seems to have had an essentially practical intent, like his reduction of its orchestral extravagance (there are now four trombones, not seven). But he has taken the opportunity of the single course to introduce links between what were previously isolated movements - most conspicuously a discreet reference to the 'Miserere' from Il Trovatore shortly before the Joyce day-dream, giving the impression of a distant orchestral murmuring that something important is about to arrive. Other differences between the 1991 and 1965 versions will no doubt emerge more clearly when the two scores are available for study. The impression from a first hearing of Epiphanies is that the orchestra now, besides being more compact, is more effective in conveying the impression of speaker-less speech, of vowels and consonants, coughs and grunts and shrieks rolling round the platform, right from the beginning, where the ensemble begins to find its voice in soft drum rolls and tremolos on flute and violins. However, this strikingly positive sensation may have been produced simply by the expert beauty and address of the playing. As for the singing, one big problem is that the work was written for the voice and the personality of Cathy Berberian, and it still sounds that way even in this posthumous revision. Charlotte Hellekant sang her part from memory, and with a fetching richness of tone in the contralto register, but Berberian's exhilaration was missing. It was also a mistake of theatre, in what is incipiently a theatrical piece, for her to sit down between items: the soloist ought to be poised and waiting to take her next opportunity to fly or swim or march with the orchestra, or to be drowned in the clamour.</p>

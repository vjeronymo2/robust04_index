			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Observer: Less majeste How times change. The first British TV documentary on the Royal family in 1969 was watched by an estimated 23m people, a good 40 per cent more than watched Coronation Street, the most popular TV soap opera at that time. By contrast, the latest audience research estimates show that 17.9m watched Elizabeth R, the most ambitious documentary yet to be made about the Queen's life. This was 2.5m fewer than watched Coronation Street and means that the Queen also trailed behind EastEnders and Jeremy Beadle's You've been framed. Since 1969 the number of TV licences has increased from 15.5m to 19.5m.</p>

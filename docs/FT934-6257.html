			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (7): Industry prepares to lobby on tariff cuts - Businesses are worried as the customs union deadline approaches In Turkey, Euro-sceptics were once a rare breed. Not any longer, it seems. With the government preparing to cross the the historic threshold and enter a customs union with the European Union in 1995, many Turkish businesses are awaking to the fact that Turkey's trade policy will very soon be determined by the grey men in Brussels. Europe is vital to the Turkish economy. The EU already accounts for 50 per cent of Turkey's exports. In turn, Turkey takes close to 40 per cent of its imported goods from the EU. Total trade between Turkey and the EU is expected to exceed Dollars 20bn in 1993. The EU accounts for more than half of Turkey's total foreign investment. Under the terms of the additional protocol of the 1963 Ankara Association Agreement with the EU, Turkey will reduce its high tariff wall. That is expected to result in increased capital flows to Turkey. The broader impact is that competition from EU imports will encourage greater efficiencies and force companies to upgrade their technologies. Turkey will also be required to introduce legislation to harmonise Turkish trade and commercial policies with the EU countries. In parallel with the customs union negotiations, convergence in services is proceeding apace. Under a new law, the banking industry recently saw changes in capital ratios which bring it more in line with European standards. One of the remaining restrictions on foreign banks is a requirement that paid-up capital is converted into Turkish lira. Foreign banks are thus required repeatedly to inject new capital, as inflation takes its toll. New rules have been recently introduced for the insurance sector. The two sides have also outlined a raft of legislative changes which should be in place to complement the customs union. The issues cover intellectual property rights, state aid and competition policy. This might seem like a heavy workload for Turkish legislators, given the current snail's pace with which bills secure passage through parliament. However, officials point out that should there be an agreement of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Turkey would have to comply with many of these pieces of legislation to meet its Gatt obligations. Commission officials make clear that the implementation of a customs union is a technical exercise which does not require any further treaty negotiations. It does not even have to be ratified by the European parliament. To meet the deadline, Turkey will have to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers to zero, while adopting the EU's common commercial tariff for third countries. Turkey would, in addition, be required to assume the EU's preferential trade policies and defensive measures such as anti-dumping towards third countries. This would apply to the voluntary restraints with Japanese car imports, as well as preferential trade arrangements with the Maghreb and other Middle East countries including Israel and Jordan. Customs union will have a sectoral impact on Turkish industry, as well as budgetary ramifications for the government. On the budgetary side, the government calculates the loss of import duties at about Dollars 3bn, including the scrapping of the Mass Housing Fund, now levied on a range of luxury goods imports. This figure would be offset by an increase in import volumes which would add an estimated Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn to Turkey's already large trade deficit. The EU is now understood to be considering ways to provide the Turks with some form of financial assistance, which avoids being blocked by the use of the Greek veto. For many Turkish industries, the tariff cuts represent a considerable loss of protection. Today, according to EU calculations, the average protection rates for a sample of 501 industrial products are still around 15 per cent, despite a reduction of 6 per cent at the start of 1993. The Treasury is now compiling the details of the import regime for 1994. 'There will have to be a strong signal that the government is going ahead with customs union,' said one European Commission official. The Commission's concern is that some powerful industries are preparing to lobby to see protection retained beyond the deadline. The sectors - motor vehicles, white goods and packaged foods - are seen as particularly vulnerable. Commission officials are adamant that this would be in contravention of a customs union. They also warn that some member states may use this as a pretext to retain the current quotas on Turkish textile imports to the Community. With around Dollars 5bn of exports in 1992, the textiles industry is Turkey's largest exporter, accounting for 36 per cent of the country's total export earnings. Turkey is already the biggest supplier to the EU despite the quotas, accounting for 10 per cent of EU textile imports. The removal of quotas would provide a welcome boost to the industry. The motor vehicle sector, on the other hand, is bracing itself for an cold blast of competition. The industry is dominated by the local operations of Fiat of Italy and Renault of France. Local producers currently enjoy very high protection. On passenger vehicles less than 2,000cc, import taxes are charged at 39 per cent. The car sector is now rushing to reinvest in new lines, and introduce new models to compete against imports. The threat to market share is not so much from EU manufacturers, who already account for the top end of the market. The main concern is over increased shipments of Skodas and Ladas from eastern Europe, once Turkey adopts the EU's common external tariff of 10 per cent. Car imports are already growing at 80 per cent, compared with an increase in domestic production of around 25 per cent. Foreign investors, too, are expected to have to rethink their strategies in Turkey. For foreign companies already manufacturing in Turkey, it will make sense to source more of their industrial inputs to EC countries. Philip Morris, the US cigarette producer, going one step further, now argues it will be cheaper to import finished products from one of its EC subsidiaries than manufacture at the newly installed Dollars 400m investment near Izmir. The broader impact is that Turkey will no longer be attractive for companies seeking to get behind high tariff barriers. The trend will be to sectors where Turkish production offers cost-competitiveness, economies of scale and suitable levels of technology. One area that is now attracting interest is the food processing and food retail and distribution sectors.</p>

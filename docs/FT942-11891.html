			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Hungarian Socialists attract mixed bag of supporters For a party that once believed in monolithic dictatorship of the proletariat, Hungary's Socialists attract a surprising social mix, writes Nicholas Denton. State employees, pensioners and the unemployed, the losers in the transition to a market economy, are their natural and most numerous supporters. But opinion polls show the Socialists command the most concentrated support among 'top leaders'. 'If the new Hungarian bourgeoisie have a party at all, it is the Socialist party,' says Mr Peter Tolgyessy, a liberal politician. 'The Socialist party has two wings: one is like the British Tories and one like Labour in the 1950s.' For Hungary's business elite did not spring into life instantaneously when the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1990. In Hungary economic liberalisation began as far back as 1968 and the nomenklatura, leading communists, had time to translate political power into economic weight. The Socialists have a constituency that stretches from the new rich to the unemployed coalminer. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialists' former and perhaps future finance minister, matches any conservative or neo-liberal for fiscal orthodoxy. Socialist campaign posters promise to 'get the expertise back into government'. The line has broad electoral appeal, says Mr Gaspar Miklos Tamas, a liberal commentator. 'Voters see the Socialists as the aristocrats.' At the same time, however, Mr Gyula Horn, the Socialist leader, has led pensioners and state employees to believe he can halt the deterioration of living standards.</p>

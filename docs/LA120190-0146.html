			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> BIG NIGHT IS JUST RIGHT FOR POLTL;  </P> <P> DIVISION II: THE CAPISTRANO VALLEY RECEIVER SET A CAREER RECEPTIONS RECORD  WHILE PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN VICTORY.  </P> <P> From the day the football season began, Capistrano Valley High School wide  receiver Dave Poltl has been chasing the Orange County career record for  receptions. He needed 80 to pass the 169 caught by Rick Parma (Kennedy,  1973-75).  </P> <P> Well, No. 80 finally came Friday night. With 6 minutes 8 seconds left in the  game between the Cougars and Mission Viejo, Poltl caught a 15-yard pass in the  flat to surpass Parma.  </P> <P> But No. 81 -- for a 72-yard touchdown -- was even more important. It gave the  Cougars a two-touchdown lead and helped advance them to the Southern Section  Division II title game.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley held on to defeat Mission Viejo, 26-24, with much of credit  belonging to Poltl, who now has 173 career receptions.  </P> <P> For the game, he had six catches for 142 yards and one touchdown. As it has  been for the past three seasons, many of his catches came in clutch situations.  </P> <P> "There's no better receiver in the county than Dave," Capistrano Valley Coach  Eric Patton said.  </P> <P> The Cougars avenged a 28-13 loss to the Diablos on Oct. 26. In that game, Poltl  had seven receptions for 126 yards but did not score.  </P> <P> In the first half Friday, it looked like he might again be kept out of the end  zone. The Cougars relied on their running game, so Poltl had only two  receptions for 20 yards.  </P> <P> The second gave him the record.  </P> <P> "The record has been one of my goals this season, but winning the championship  is the bigger goal," said Poltl, who has 84 catches for 1,312 yards. "I was  glad to get the record out of the way early so I could concentrate on the  game."  </P> <P> Whether or not Poltl's concentration improved in the second half, his  productivity certainly did.  </P> <P> On the first play after halftime, Tony Solliday audibilized and hit Poltl on  the fly. Poltl outran everyone for the 72-yard score.  </P> <P> "I saw that they didn't have a free safety back there," Solliday said. "You  can't cover Dave one-on-one."  </P> <P> The Diablos learned their lesson. For the rest of the game, Poltl was shadowed  by at least two defenders. On one play, he was followed by four -- two  defensive backs and two linebackers.  </P> <P> But the extra attention didn't slow Poltl. He went on to catch four passes for  122 yards in the second half.  </P> <P> Poltl made two key receptions during a third-quarter drive that ended in a  37-yard field goal.  </P> <P> On fourth and three, Poltl made a six-yard reception. On third-and-four, he  made another six-yard catch.  </P> <P> "I told the coach that I wanted the ball," Poltl said. "I knew I could make the  plays. I wanted this victory."  </P> <P> He got it, and, the record, too.  </P> <P> "I glad that's over," he said.  </P></p>

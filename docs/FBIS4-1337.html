			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on  24 April carries five full-page advertisements from the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] on pages 14, 16, 18, 20 and 21. The bottom  of each page is identical, with a box on the left stating: "If  you want to help us build a better future, you can do do by  supporting us financially. Our account details are:    "First National Bank, Greyville    Branch number 22 27 26    Account Number 6000040444    Account name: IFP Election Fund"    The bottom of each ad also contains three small squares on  the right containing the IFP logo, a picture of Buthelezi and a  large X with "VOTE IFP" above the squares in large white letters  and "A Power for Good" below.    The ad on page 14 depicts a large IFP logo in the center of  the page with "SOUTH AFRICA WE DID IT FOR YOU" above the logo in  large white letters, with "YOU" in the largest letters. Below  the logo "YOUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE" in large white letters.    The ad on page 16 also has the large IFP logo in the center  of the page with "FREEDON, FEDERALISM, FREE ENTERPRISE" in large  white letters above the logo, with "FREEDOM" printed in the  largest letters, "FEDERALISM" in smaller letters, and "FREE  ENTERPRISE" in the smallest letters. Below the logo, in grey  letters are the words: "Collusion, Capitulation, Communism" with  a large black-lettered "NEVER" stamped over them. Then follows  in large white letters: "YOU CAN TRUST THE IFP."    The ad on page 16 has a smaller IFP logo in the middle of  the  page with a hugh "WHO --" in white letters, followed by:     -  "helped release Mandela?    -  "fought against sanctions?    -  "refused to be intimidated?    -  " resisted the armed struggle?    -  "never compromised on principle?    -  "opposed the tri-cameral parliament?    -  "opposed liberation before education?"

The advertisement on page 20 is a duplicate of the ad run in  the Johnannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 23 April.    The ad on page 21, facing page 20, shows at the center of  the  page part of the ballot from the PAC listing to the IFP listing  at the end of the ballot, with a large X next to the IFP. Above  the ballot, in large white letters: "`So the last shall be  first' -- Matthew 20:16."

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> PLEA BARGAIN ENDS MAN'S MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> A Santa Ana man on trial for murder in the shooting death of his brother has  pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter instead.  </P> <P> Tomas Bustos Valadez, 33, agreed to the plea Monday after Superior Court Judge  Leonard H. McBride indicated in chambers that he would probably give Valadez a  three-year sentence in exchange for the guilty plea.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Jennifer Keller said she is convinced, especially after  talking to jurors who heard the prosecution's case, that her client probably  would have been convicted of no more than involuntary manslaughter. The  sentence for that is two to six years. "It was a difficult decision. I don't  feel good about having a client plead guilty to something I know he didn't do,"  Keller said. "But this was probably best for him."  </P> <P> Voluntary manslaughter, under California law, means that a defendant  deliberately killed someone, but the shooting was not premeditated and did not  include malice. Involuntary manslaughter indicates a reckless act that was  unintentional.  </P> <P> Valadez has admitted the fatal shooting of his brother, Joaquin Valadez, 28, at  their Santa Ana home on New Year's Eve, 1988. But his defense was that the gun  went off by accident after Joaquin rushed at him. Witnesses said Joaquin  Valadez had been drinking and already attacked another brother before he was  shot. Keller said her client picked up a rifle in an attempt to calm Joaquin.  </P> <P> Though Valadez pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, Keller said she  attached a legal statement to the guilty plea that Valadez does not admit to  the crime.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr. declined to comment on why he agreed  during the trial to the plea bargain. "Sometimes that's just how these things  work out," Gannon said.  </P> <P> The judge will formally sentence Valadez, who has been in custody since the  shooting, on May 18. JERRY HICKS  </P></p>

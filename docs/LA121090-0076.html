			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORONADO'S BID TO BAR TOUR BUSES GETS STRANDED ON THE BEACH  </P> <P> If diesel smoke was all that tour buses spewed, Coronado residents might  consider backing down. It's the annoying patter that they say they're sick to  death of -- the running commentary, blared over the buses' public address  systems, lecturing paying passengers about one of San Diego County's most  exclusive communities.  </P> <P> "They slow down and they say, 'Now look. This is where all the rich folks live.  Well, now this is where the Duchess of Windsor lived. Now you see in the  driveway the Jaguars or the Mercedeses or the BMWs,' " said Doris Pray, a  grandmother whose 27 years in Coronado have made her an expert on tour bus  prattle.  </P> <P> Such gawking is harassment, Pray and other Coronadans say. And these days -- at  least since September, when the Coronado City Council passed an ordinance to  bar tour buses from most streets except state highways -- it is against the  law. At least, technically.  </P> <P> Other cities, like Beverly Hills, for example, have laws limiting tour bus  routes. But Coronado's attempt has a peculiar wrinkle.  </P> <P> The state Coastal Commission is concerned that in limiting tour bus routes the  city also has inadvertently limited coastal access in violation of the state  Coastal Act. Until a ruling is obtained on that question, the Coastal  Commission has stopped Coronado from enforcing its law.  </P> <P> But Coastal Commissioner David Malcolm says he already has made up his mind.  </P> <P> "You have a basically white community saying, Stay out!" said Malcolm, who has  earned the enmity of some Coronadans by opposing several proposals he finds  "exclusionary." Malcolm, who is also a councilman in the largely Latino city of  Chula Vista, says the Coronado sensibility goes something like this: "God  forbid someone from out of town and from a minority race would come into our  city."  </P> <P> Coronado's civic leaders deny that racism has tainted their policy-making. But  they admit that ever since the tiny 6-square-mile island city seceded from San  Diego in 1891, it has struggled to keep its distance from its larger mainland  neighbor. Especially since 1969, when the elegant 2.23-mile San Diego-Coronado  Bay Bridge linked the two cities for the first time, residents have chafed at  the resulting surge in traffic -- and, some say, crime -- on their orderly,  tree-lined streets.  </P> <P> In recent months, Malcolm says, city leaders seem to be working harder than  ever to keep out-of-towners at bay.  </P> <P> This fall, when the California Transportation Commission considered scrapping  the $1 toll on the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, Coronado Mayor Mary Herron  successfully lobbied to extend the toll until 1995. While it had more than met  its original goal -- paying back nearly $48 million in construction bonds --  the toll had other merits, Herron argued. By discouraging sightseers, she said,  it kept Coronado's traffic in check.  </P> <P> Then the city came up with a plan to create residents-only decal parking zones  on a section of shoreline near the North Island Naval Air Station. The city  said it needed the zones because Navy employees' vehicles often block residents  from parking near their homes. But Malcolm and Coastal Commission Chairman  Thomas W. Gwyn cried foul and are appealing the ordinance on the basis that it  limits beach access.  </P> <P> Then came the tour bus ordinance, which would keep most commercial buses from  traveling the city's most scenic coastal routes. In addition, the ordinance  would force buses that drop passengers at the area's biggest tourist  attraction, the historic Hotel del Coronado, to travel five extra miles down  the Silver Strand peninsula simply to turn around.  </P> <P> Coronado is not the first California city to try to regulate tour bus traffic.  In 1976, sick of being overrun by star-gazers, Beverly Hills banned commercial  sightseeing vehicles weighing three tons or more from traveling on most  residential streets.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which withstood challenges in the state Supreme Court, sought to  eliminate what it called "all nature of nuisances . . . such as trespassing,  knocking on doors, littering, trampling on shrubbery and flower beds, using the  shrubbery for toilet purposes, making loud and raucous noises, removing items  as souvenirs and generally disturbing the peace and privacy of the residents,  most of whom are not celebrities."  </P> <P> When Malcolm heard that Coronado was going to follow suit, he says he could  only wonder what would come next. "A wall around the city? A drawbridge?"  </P> <P> "What gives Coronado the right to say people can't go up and down the  waterfront?" he asked, rejecting as absurd the charge, leveled by some  Coronadans, that he is a shill for the tour bus industry.  </P> <P> Pray, who has made the anti-bus fight a personal crusade, says it is a matter  of human decency. Given the buses' long history of wrongdoing, she said,  something has to change.  </P> <P> At a public hearing last week, tour bus operators said the ordinance will  create an economic hardship, adding 15 minutes to their routes and forcing  passengers to endure repetitive views. But when Coronado's mayor suggested to  her constituents that they increase their chances of winning Coastal Commission  approval by considering alternatives to the ordinance, 11 residents rose, one  by one, to say no.  </P> <P> For now, the buses continue to roll unrestricted through town, gushing  well-rehearsed flackery as they go. Among the highlights: a church with Tiffany  windows, the house where Wallace Simpson lived before she married the duke, and  the spot where Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis filmed "Some Like It  Hot" at the grand Hotel Del.  </P> <P> "It was the inspiration for the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz," said Old  Town Trolley tour bus driver Midge Crockett as she turned off the highway,  hurtled down a quiet residential street and parked at a shorefront bus stop  that the ordinance would abolish.  </P> <P> "And this," she said, "is the most beautiful beach in California."  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Equity Issues: Reliance offering a test case INVESTORS in the emerging markets will be keeping a close eye on the Dollars 100m international equity offering from Reliance, the Indian petrochemical company, as a handful of other Indian companies prepare to raise funds in the international markets. The Reliance equity offering was due to be priced either late last night or in the next couple of days. The shares are expected to be priced at about Rs250, (the lower end of the pricing range) compared with the closing price of Rs300 in Bombay yesterday. The Reliance equity offering marks the first time that foreign investors have been allowed to invest in a share offering by an Indian company. However, there are three other Indian companies hoping to launch international offerings within the next couple of months. Grasim, a cement and fibre producer controlled by the Birla family, is expected to launch its Dollars 100m offering around the middle of June, with Citicorp and Merrill Lynch as the joint lead managers. Also in the pipeline are share offerings of about Dollars 100m each from Essar Gujarat, an iron company, and Tata Iron and Steel (TISCO), India's largest private steel manufacturer. Merrill Lynch is lead manager for Essar Gujarat, and Credit Suisse First Boston has been appointed lead manager for the Tisco deal. The Reliance issue has attracted strong interest, particularly from Asian funds, despite the current stock market scandal in India. 'Fund managers don't want to miss out on this issue,' said one London banker. 'People will be learning about the Indian market with Reliance.' However, some investment bankers warn that India could suffer if it ends up as the latest 'vogue' emerging market. 'Investors have been so country-of-the-week oriented,' complained one US banker. 'The foreign investors just want to be first-in and first-out.' While bankers expect the Reliance issue to be a success and comfortably over-subscribed, most will be watching to see whether investors hold the shares long-term in their portfolios or whether they simply take their profits and run.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: A tribute to Gary Glitter / Review of 'Leader' at the Arts Theatre Leader] is billed as an 'affectionate' tribute by the Gang to Gary Glitter - and that's the problem. 'Affectionate' is much too mealy-mouthed an approach to Paul Dadd, the 50-year-old egomaniac who, after trying on as many personalities as Rory Bremner, hit the world as Gary Glitter, the Bacofoil Kid. Supported by platform shoes of vertiginous height, and costumes that pushed camp excess beyond the imagination of Julian Cleary, in 1972 Glitter changed glam rock from a smile into a joke. He was also supported by the heftiest drumbeat in the business. Outrageous; ridiculous; surreal; pathetic - these are better words for Glitter. Of course Glitter had the last laugh. He went through all the career moves expected of a pop star - divorce, drug abuse, bankruptcy, teenage girls - but kept coming back for more doses of fame. In the 1980s he discovered the university circuit and students who remembered being awed by him as infants were now ready to laugh with him in maturity. Little of the enormity of the man and his durability comes out in Steve Furst and M. Simon Leigh's portrait. It is as pedestrian, and self-censored, as This is Your Life (suicide attempts are 'cries for help'), and starts with a wall chart of the Glitter career and ends with the inevitable communal choruses. There is one good joke: Leigh looks nothing like Glitter and so that bewildered, what-am-I-doing-here, stare, which was Gary's permanent on-stage expression, is doubly effective coming from Leigh. But the set and costumes are reminiscent of the troughs of Glitter's career when he played the chicken-in-the-basket circuit - although I'm sure he never appeared at La Rue's Codpiece, Didcot, as the script suggests. Paul Putner plays one of Glitter's many managers and Furst everyone from Andrew Lloyd Webber to Elvis Presley. The problem is you cannot be more blatant than Glitter. He sends himself up so high that no satirists can reach him. But once a member of the Gang you are hooked for life, and there will be enough loyal members happy to honour the Leader at these meretricious entertainments. After all, there is nothing wrong with a little affection.</p>

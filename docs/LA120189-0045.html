			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT ARE THEY EATING TO MAKE THEM CRAZY?  </P> <P> According to historian Mary Matossian, contaminated food may have played a key  role in important historical events ("Rye Explanation for Past Craziness," Nov.  24). For example, food poisoning brought on by a fungus that grows on rye grain  produces a natural form of the hallucinogen LSD, and this may have been  responsible for massive peasant outbreaks before the French Revolution and  symptoms synonymous with witchery.  </P> <P> Her theory seems very interesting. Now if only I could determine what  contaminated food heavy metal rockers, TV evangelists and most politicians have  been eating, I think I could make the world a better place. I guess we are  indeed what we eat.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

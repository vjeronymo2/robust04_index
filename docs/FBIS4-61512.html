			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Beloivan] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 6 TASS -- "Russo-Chinese border's  demarcation will allow us to normalise the situation in the  border areas, where passions are now very high," roving  ambassador of the Russian Foreign Ministry Genrikh Kireyev, head  of the Russian part of the demarcation commission, told a  briefing here today.    He said that an expedition would go to the Ussuri District  this month to prove Russia's sovereignty over ten square  kilometres of hunting grounds, now claimed by China.    The ambassador said that an early demarcation of the border  would meet the interests of both sides, while the ratification  of agreements on the revised borderline would "rule out the  possibility of mutual territorial claims in the future".    The members of the demarcation commission especially  stressed  that the interests of the local population should by no means be  jeopardised during the demarcation. According to Kireyev, the  possibility of jointly using of some of the disputed areas was  now being discussed. Moreover, both China and Russia are ready  to make mutual concessions concerning small border strips. For  instance, China is ready to transfer to Russian jurisdiction a  part of the territory in Khasan district. Soviet borderguards,  killed during the conflict near Lake Khasan, are buried there.    On the whole, it is planned to end the demarcation work on  the Russo-Chinese border in 1997.</p>

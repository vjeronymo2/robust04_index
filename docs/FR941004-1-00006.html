			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the Commission review of the revision of Appendix G published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final on May 27, 1983 (48 FR 24009), the requirement to ``design to permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annealing'' was criticized because licensee response to the requirement was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perfunctory and staff review of the responses was cursory, as detailed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SECY&hyph;83&hyph;254 (June 27, 1983). Further, there were no criteria to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a design would permit annealing. An additional problem cited with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement was that it was misinterpreted to mean that plant operation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an RT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  greater than 200 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F or a Charpy upper-shelf energy below 50 ft-lb was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsafe. The Commission indicated that it would seek public comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed deletion of the requirement, and this was done concurrently with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of the proposed PTS rule on February 4, 1984 (49 FR 4498). All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sixteen of the commenters on this item recommended deletion of the paragraph,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although eight of them urged that the deletion should not in any way imply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that annealing is no longer an option to increase safety margins. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of final rulemaking for the PTS rule published on July 23, 1985  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (50 FR 29944), the ``Supplementary Information'' noted that the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planned a separate rulemaking action to delete Section IV.B. That planned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deletion was delayed so that it could be combined with other amendments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Changes in the fracture toughness properties of the RPV beltline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials due to irradiation embrittlement are monitored using a surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, as required in Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50, ``Reactor Vessel Material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surveillance Program Requirements''. Appendix H references American Society  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard E 185 (``Standard Practice for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conducting Surveillance Tests for Light-Water Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vessels'') for many of the detailed requirements of surveillance programs, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits the use of integrated surveillance programs, wherein surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program capsules for one reactor are irradiated in another reactor. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed amendment would make the following changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1. End the provision for ``reducing the amount of testing'' for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrated surveillance programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Restructure the section on requirements for integrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance programs (Section II.C), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Clarify the version of ASTM Standard E 185 that applies to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Integrated surveillance programs are permitted under Section II.C of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50. One provision of this section is that ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of testing may be reduced if the initial results agree with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predictions.'' It is proposed to discontinue this provision as of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the Appendix, although previous authorizations granted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, would continue in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second proposed change to Appendix H restructures Section II.C to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify the requirements for integrated surveillance programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other principal change to Appendix H clarifies the version of ASTM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard E 185 that applies to the various portions of the surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. Appendix H recognizes the need to separate surveillance programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into two essential parts, specifically the design of the program, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent testing and reporting of results from the surveillance capsules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the design of the surveillance program cannot be changed once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is in place, the requirements for design of the surveillance program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are static for each plant. However, the testing and reporting requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are updated along with technical improvements made to ASTM standard E 185.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clarification proposed in this revision indicates that the design of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and the withdrawal schedule must meet the requirements of ASTM E 185&hyph;73, or the edition of ASTM E 185 that is current on the issue date of the ASME  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code to which the reactor vessel was purchased, whichever is latest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Licensees could choose to comply with later editions of ASTM E 185, up through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1982 edition. Further, specimen test procedures and reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements must meet the requirements of ASTM E 185&hyph;82 ``to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable for the configuration of the specimens in the capsule.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff intended that this proposed amendment to Appendix H would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate by reference a version of ASTM standard E 185 updated from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently available 1982 version. However, that standardization process has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been completed, and it was decided to proceed with this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment. A subsequent amendment to Appendix H will be considered after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC staff has reviewed the updated ASTM standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 13, 1994 (SECY&hyph;94&hyph;163) the staff requested Commission approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to publish for public comment these proposed revisions and provided a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of options for public participation related to thermal annealing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission approved issuance of the proposed revisions but directed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the staff to (1) include with the proposed rule package a discussion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options the staff has considered for structuring of the regulatory process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed thermal annealing rule (10 CFR 50.66), which is included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following section, and (2) request comments on the following issues related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulation on thermal annealing:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The technical adequacy of the staff's guidance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The sufficiency of the guidance and criteria to support a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification that if satisfied, a plant with an annealed vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can safely resume operation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Whether health and safety concerns are best served by approval of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the thermal annealing plan or of readiness for restart;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The preferred regulatory process (including opportunities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public participation) and the commenter's basis for recommending a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular process; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Whether there are health and safety issues concerning thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annealing that cannot be addressed generically and would warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant-specific consideration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Options the Staff Has Considered for Structuring of the Regulatory Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Related to Public Participation in Thermal Annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A significant issue with respect to thermal annealing, identified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SECY&hyph;92&hyph;283 (August 14, 1992), is the nature and timing of public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation related to the NRC's review and approval of a licensee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal for thermal annealing. The proposed rule does not address public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation per se, but instead provides the performance requirements that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee would have to meet to gain NRC approval of a thermal annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application and to permit subsequent operation. Under the proposed rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are three circumstances that arguably require an opportunity for hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to Section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) in connection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with NRC review and approval of thermal annealing. First, a licensee seeking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to anneal its reactor vessel must obtain NRC approval of the content of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal annealing plan prior to implementing the plan (see &sect;50.66(a) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule). Second, and apart from the NRC approval required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;50.66(a), the thermal annealing process as described in the licensee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan may necessitate license amendments (including technical specification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes). License amendments may be required if the licensee's final safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis report (FSAR) needs to be revised to reflect the thermal annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, and the licensee is unable to conclude that such FSAR changes do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute ``unreviewed safety questions'' under 10 CFR 50.59. Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the thermal annealing plan may also violate existing technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications, necessitating requests for changes to technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications. Any license amendment and technical specification change must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be approved by the NRC before the licensee may implement the thermal annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan. Finally, after the licensee implements the annealing plan, if he  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that he cannot meet the criteria specified in &sect;50.66(c)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule, then NRC approval is needed in order for the licensee to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resume operation (see &sect;50.66(c)(2) of the proposed rule).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

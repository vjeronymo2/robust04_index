			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE FAMILY HAS STAKE WITH JAPANESE OWNERS  </P> <P> Until Kirin Brewery Co. came along, foreign firms purchasing American wineries  have done so lock, stock and barrels.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, when the Raymond Vineyard Winery announced completion of the  deal in which Kirin, the brewing giant, became the owner of this Napa Valley  jewel, a line in the press announcement noted that Raymond "will retain an  ownership interest in the winery and will continue to operate and manage the  business."  </P> <P> Other Japanese buyers of wineries have left Americans in charge. When Otsuka  Pharmaceutical bought Ridge Vineyards in Cupertino in 1986, it left Paul Draper  and the late David Benion to run it. Sanraku and Sapporo left intact the staffs  at Markham and St. Clement, respectively, two other Napa Valley wineries they  acquired.  </P> <P> But in previous cases, the wineries were sold 100% -- all land, buildings,  inventory, and stock. This makes the Raymond deal unusual.  </P> <P> "We are committed here (by contract) for at least the next three years," said  Roy Raymond Jr., president of the winery and the man who handles viticultural  and marketing.  </P> <P> "And if things go well, and we expect them to, there are plans to stay on  beyond five years," said Walt Raymond, Roy's brother and the wine maker. He  declined to give specifics of the deal, but a source close to the winery  estimated that the family retained about 15% of the stock in the winery.  </P> <P> The key to retaining a portion of the winery, according to both sides in the  deal, was the incentive factor. Kirin executives knew they needed to keep the  Raymonds around to operate the winery and maintain the same high quality of  wines produced since the winery was founded in 1974. And the Raymonds were  prepared to stay.  </P> <P> "Where you have very talented and long-term management that you want to keep  intact, structuring a deal this way gives them (the Raymonds) an inducement,"  said Joel Marcus, the attorney who worked with Kirin on arranging the deal.  "This way, the Raymonds have a continuing stake in the enterprise.  </P> <P> "This accomplished several things," added Marcus, a partner in the law firm  Pettit &amp; Martin in Los Angeles. "It keeps the founding managers as your  business partners, and I think that assures stronger management. And it gives  them (the Raymonds) a great incentive to stay active in the business."  </P> <P> Roy Ramond added, "The way the deal is structured, our stock (in the company)  will appreciate in value based on increasing (case) sales and profits."  </P> <P> Walt Raymond said Kirin told the family the acquisition was "for investment  purposes only. They take the long-term view, and they look at the Napa Valley  as a quality region and Raymond as a quality property."  </P> <P> Marcus pointed out that "some of the past deals (in which Japanese companies  have bought American businesses) haven't been as creative as they might have  been, and I think the reason is that they forget the essential ingredient of  operations. But from the perspective of Kirin, I think you may see more of  these kind of deals from now on from companies that see the long-term potential  of inducements to the managers."  </P> <P> The first and to date the largest Japanese purchase of a California winery was  in 1984 when Suntory Ltd. bought Chateau St. Jean in Sonoma County for an  estimated $40 million. Although management of that company initially didn't  change, none of the former owners of Chateau St. Jean retained any percentage  in the company.  </P> <P> In the intervening five years, however, most of the former executives of  Chateau St. Jean have left, including the president, the national sales  director and the head of viticulture. The key remaining employee is Richard  Arrowood, the wine maker. Many of those who left say they couldn't adapt to the  Japanese corporate style.  </P> <P> However, the Raymonds say that under their agreement with Kirin, family members  will call all the shots. "They (Kirin) gave us every assurance that we will be  the managing people -- we will be the ones making all the decisions," said  Walt.  </P> <P> When it was first reported last October that Kirin and the Raymonds had struck  a deal, estimated by sources at about $18 million, it surprised many in the  Napa Valley who felt that Raymond was the least likely winery to sell. Case  production had risen in the past few years by about 20% annually and by 1989  was projected at near 140,000 cases.  </P> <P> And the company was not hurting financially. Its wines were highly regarded in  the marketplace, both at restaurant and retail levels, and it was competing  successfully in four different price levels with its chardonnays, which  represent 57% of its production.  </P> <P> "We didn't have a winery for sale," Roy said. He said the property had never  been listed with an agent, and the family wasn't even thinking of taking  offers.  </P> <P> "But Kirin had looked around, looking to buy a Napa Valley winery, and they had  found a lot of them that were for sale and looked into them and found things  that were wrong," Roy added. "Then they looked at us and after a while made us  an offer."  </P> <P> It apparently wasn't the only offer. Insiders say Hiram Walker, the  British-based drinks company that recently paid a reported $38 million to  acquire Clos du Bois winery in Sonoma County, also bid for Raymond. The  Raymonds declined to discuss any other offers that may have been made.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR HECKLED;  </P> <P> ATLANTA OPENS UNDERGROUND TOURIST AREA  </P> <P> Thousands of curious well-wishers braved driving rain and hecklers Thursday to  see the new Underground Atlanta tourist complex, a $142-million attempt to  bring night life back to the downtown business district.  </P> <P> "We thought the rain would keep everyone away, but look who's here," said art  gallery manager Charmain Guzman as customers streamed into the three-tiered,  12-acre complex of restaurants and stores that is built partly under the city's  downtown streets.  </P> <P> Mayor Andrew Young was heckled by advocates for the homeless when he took the  stage to officially open the project. But the protesters, who handed out  leaflets questioning the city's spending priorities, were booed into silence by  the crowd.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aimed at Suburbanites  </P> <P> Atlanta hopes the complex, which was funded by the city through development  bonds and private investment, will not only bring suburban residents back to  downtown after dark but also be an incentive to tourists and convention-goers.  </P> <P> The original Underground Atlanta opened under the city's viaducts in 1969 but  was closed in 1982 because of the perception that it was riddled with crime.  </P> <P> Eventually, the new complex, which contains 100 retail shops and 22 restaurants  and nightclubs, will be the site of a Coca-Cola museum honoring the city's  best-known product, a museum on Atlanta history and an antique railroad.  </P> <P> Officials had planned to release 3,000 balloons during Thursday's opening  ceremonies, which were to feature marching bands and dance troupes. But  downpours forced festivities indoors, where children were handed balloons and  bands marched in place instead.  </P></p>

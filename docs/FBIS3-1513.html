It said in  Pretoria, however, these centres would not necessarily be the  provincial capitals.    The cities are: Cape Town for the Western Cape; Johannesburg  for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region;  Bloemfontein for the [Orange] Free State; Mmabatho for the North  West Region; Kimberley for the Northern Cape; Pietermaritzburg  for kwaZulu/Natal; and Nelspruit for the Eastern Transvaal.    It suggested both King William's Town and Bisho for the  Eastern Cape and both Pietersburg and Lebowakgomo for the  Northern Transvaal.</p>

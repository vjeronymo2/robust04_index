			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RTD GIVES IN, COMPROMISES ON CONTROL OF METRO RAIL PROJECT  </P> <P> After weeks of bickering, the Southern California Rapid Transit District Board  of Directors on Thursday agreed to a compromise plan that resolves its dispute  with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission over which agency will  control Metro Rail construction.  </P> <P> The 6-4 vote came after some intense behind-the-scenes negotiating convinced a  majority of the RTD board that it would lose all control over development of  the 17.2-mile subway unless the compromise was approved.  </P> <P> The agreement -- which still must be ratified by the commission -- turns all  Metro Rail design and construction over to a new third agency, the Rail  Construction Corp. This nonprofit corporation was created by the commission to  supervise building of all rail transit projects in the county.  </P> <P> Commission officials hailed the RTD board's vote as a significant step toward  resolving differences between the two agencies.  </P> <P> "I am very pleased that the RTD has finally agreed to join the (Rail  Construction Corp.)," said Commission Chairwoman Christine E. Reed. She said  the agreement is "a step in the right direction," and suggested it will help  "bring together, under one agency, the management of all transportation  programs in the county."  </P> <P> Although the Metro Rail project was initiated by the RTD, the state Legislature  subsequently created the commission to oversee all rail construction in the  county. This authority also gives the commission control over the Metro Rail  purse strings. The project is being built with federal, state and local money.  </P> <P> The RTD is building the $1.4-billion first phase of Metro Rail, tunneling 4.4  miles from Union Station to MacArthur Park. That part of the project is over  budget and behind schedule, according to a commission audit.  </P> <P> In addition, the RTD had contracted with the commission to design and build the  project's second phase, extending the line 6.8 miles from MacArthur Park to  Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. It was assumed that the district would  also be in charge of building the final leg into North Hollywood sometime in  the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> If Thursday's RTD action is accepted by the commission, as expected, the RTD  board will no longer be directly in charge of design and construction. That  authority will go to the Rail Construction Corp.'s board.  </P> <P> According to the compromise, the RTD will be able to fill three of the six  seats on the new corporation's board. A seventh, tie-breaking board member will  be selected jointly by the six members. Board members must all be experienced  in developing big transit projects, according to the agreement.  </P> <P> Thursday's vote was a defeat for RTD board President Gordana Swanson, who had  fought to retain exclusive control of Metro Rail construction. She and her  supporters feel the Rail Construction Corp. was formed by the commission to  further its Metro Rail takeover plans.  </P> <P> "This is not a peace offering . . . it's an abomination," Swanson said of the  compromise.  </P> <P> She accused the majority of caving in to bludgeoning tactics of the commission  and warned that the compromise agreement is illegal because it does not have  the approval of the city of Los Angeles and the federal government.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden sided with Swanson in testimony before  the vote was taken. He told the RTD directors that the proposed agreement  violates the existing agreements between the city and the commission and warned  that "this illegal agreement" could stall the project and result in more cost  overruns.  </P> <P> It was cost overruns and project delays in the first phase of construction that  prompted the commission to step in and take more control over Metro Rail,  commission officials said. When the RTD board initially refused to participate  in these efforts, the commission voted to oust the RTD and take over the job.  </P> <P> Thursday's action by the RTD board headed off that total takeover by the  commission.  </P> <P> Under terms of the agreement, the RTD will not only have three seats on the  Rail Construction Corp. board but also will continue to have a role in building  the subway. The RTD's Metro Rail staff will continue to work on design and  construction of the project's next phases, as contract employees assigned to  the Rail Construction Corp., commission officials said.  </P> <P> The agreement calls for the new corporation to take over completion of the  4.4-mile first phase, as well as design and construction of the final stages of  the project, Commission Executive Director Neil Peterson said.  </P> <P> The actions of the commission and the RTD must still be approved by the federal  Urban Mass Transit Administration, which pays half of the project costs. UMTA  officials have refused to take sides in the dispute, saying that the issue must  be settled by the two agencies before second-phase construction money can be  released.  </P> <P> While the immediate conflict over Metro Rail construction may be resolved by  Thursday's compromise, both agencies indicated that their basic disagreements  are so deeply rooted that they can only be resolved by the Legislature.  </P></p>

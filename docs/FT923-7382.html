			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Personal View: Clintonomics, a clear sense of deja vu Governor Bill Clinton's economic plan, Putting People First, is a comprehensive proposal for a significant shift in economic policy in the US. The programme is not lacking in details, nor is it timid. But will it work? Over the next four years, Clinton has proposed a total of Dollars 514bn (Pounds 267bn) in changes on the revenue and spending sides of the federal budget, combined. Of that amount, a little more than 40 per cent represents new spending initiatives and slightly less than 60 per cent reflects proposals to boost revenues. Thus, over this four-year period, the revenue enhancers are expected to exceed the cost of new programmes by only Dollars 75bn, or a little less than Dollars 20bn a year. In a world of outsized budget deficits, this hardly qualifies as a miraculous breakthrough. Indeed, relative to the current estimates of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the Clinton plan would result in only a 7 1/2 per cent direct reduction of the cumulative budget deficit projected over the 1993 to 1996 period. At the same time, Clinton's proposal claims that it will 'cut the deficit in half' over the next four years. This result rests on the critical premise that the plan will boost economic growth sufficiently to provide a large windfall of incremental revenue. Clinton offers two possible growth paths, each with a set of deficit projections. In the 'moderate growth' scenario (presumably about 3 per cent real GDP growth), the deficit is estimated to be Dollars 141bn in 1996 - about 25 per cent below current estimates. Only under the 'strong growth' scenario (probably 4 to 5 per cent GDP growth) would deficit reduction conform to Clinton's heroic aspirations of cutting the deficit in half; in this case the deficit is estimated to be Dollars 76bn in 1996 - 60 per cent below the latest Budget Office estimates. This arithmetic is troubling. Four years from now, only 22 per cent of Clinton's targeted deficit reduction comes from the plan's direct effects (that is, annual cuts of about Dollars 20bn). That means fully 78 per cent of the presumed halving of the federal budget deficit is expected to show up as a fiscal dividend from accelerated economic growth. To its credit, there is far more to Clinton's plan than evaluating its fiscal potential. Its most noteworthy attribute is to set a bold agenda for a reordering of economic priorities. There are three broad objectives. The first involves significant shifts in the mix of federal spending over the next four years - changes that account for a little more than half the total Dollars 514bn of proposed policy initiatives. The centrepiece of the new spending initiatives is the Rebuild America Fund  - Dollars 20bn annually dedicated to infrastructure improvements, a national information network, environmental technologies and defence conversion. This is the controversial aspect of the programme that most closely resembles an 'industrial policy' - complete with a new civilian research agency charged with funding support for a list of critical technologies. Clinton's plan attempts to pay for these initiatives with a detailed schedule of spending reductions - focusing particularly on defence, where outlays have already been slashed. Indeed defence reductions account for about 40 per cent of all spending cuts proposed over the next four years. The balance of the proposed spending reductions runs the gamut from administrative savings and federal employment cuts to the ending of subsidies to honey producers. In short, the plan is not without its fair share of seemingly dubious proposals for trimming spending. A second objective pertains to income distribution - changes in the tax code that account for about 33 per cent of the entire Dollars 514bn four-year package. The plan is quite clear as to who foots the bill. It calls for Dollars 22bn in middle-income tax cuts - countered by Dollars 92bn in upper-income tax increases and another Dollars 58bn in corporate tax rises, with the latter largely attained through closing loopholes on foreign business taxes. All in all, over the next four years, the revenue gained from proposed tax increases is likely to outweigh that lost from tax cuts by a factor of about 6 1/2 to one. A third objective is human capital enhancement, highlighted by a variety of educational reform proposals. This summary hardly does the plan full justice. In addition, the Clinton proposal also gives considerable emphasis to a variety of measures directed at the pressing problems of healthcare reform, foreign trade frictions, crime, urban decay and a bloated governmental bureaucracy. While few stones are left unturned, the question is: how does the plan stack up against the macro imperatives facing the US economy? Its strengths lie in the powerful growth initiatives aimed at capital formation. Incentives for business capital spending are provided by the combination of a targeted investment tax credit, a permanent research and development tax credit, and a capital gains tax cut for small company start-ups. The programme also offers strong incentives for two other neglected areas - infrastructure and human capital. In my view, reversing course after a decade of anaemic capital formation is critical - especially in sustaining the productivity increases essential for improving America's standard of living. Clinton's proposal, however, is not without its weaknesses. The most glaring is the credibility of the so-called deficit-reduction plan. Certainly, the last thing America needs is an even wider budget deficit. Moreover, the programme fails to provide a more concrete assessment of the great jobs issue of the 1990s. Much is said about creating 'millions of high-wage jobs' but little is said about who will do the hiring. Do the strengths of the plan outweigh its weaknesses? Sadly, the answer is probably no. Despite the programme's appreciation of the imperatives of capital formation and productivity enhancement, the lack of a credible strategy of deficit reduction is most disturbing. The fiscal quagmire of the 1980s was Washington's gravest economic policy blunder of the post-second world war era - sapping the vitality of a savings-short economy through a quantum leap in real interest rates. And yet the rhetoric of deficit reduction under Clintonomics smacks clearly of deja vu. America can ill afford to ignore the painful legacy of the past 12 years - namely, that growth incentives will be forever undermined by a nation struggling against the headwind of high real interest rates. Unfortunately, that is the critical lesson the governor has failed to appreciate. The author is principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co, New York</p>

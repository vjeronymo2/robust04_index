			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, June 14 (AFP) -- Zaire's transitional  parliament named moderate opposition leader Joseph Kengo Wa  Dondo Tuesday [14 June] as prime minister.    The vote was 332 in favor and 133 against.    He was appointed after two other candidates who also oppose  longtime military ruler Mobutu Sese Seko dropped out and threw  their support behind Wa Dondo.</p>

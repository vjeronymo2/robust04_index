			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: North America free trade deal could be initialled next month AGREEMENT on a North American free trade area (Nafta) could be initialled as early as next month as a result of significant headway made by negotiators last week in Mexico City. 'It is within the art of the possible to have an agreement this summer,' Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said in Washington yesterday. 'But I'm not betting my next paycheck on it.' It is understood that several chapters of the negotiating text were 'locked up' last week. These include customs regulations, standards, principles for services, intellectual property, textiles food safety regulations, and land transport. Close to agreement were tariffs, rules of origin, safeguards, and financial services and insurance and telecommunications. There appears to have been a breakthrough on Canadian reservations concerning local-content rules for car production. The main problem areas remain farm trade, especially Canada's supply management and subsidy regimes, government procurement and energy. On the question of Mexico's reluctance to open its energy sector to foreign investment, advisers to the negotiators say Mexico has signalled a willingness to compromise by opening its petrochemical sector, pipelines and petrol stations to foreign investment. Last week's surge in progress came after a disappointing ministerial meeting in Montreal in early April, when some participants said talks had moved backwards. A visit to Washington by Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's commerce secretary, after Easter apparently revived the momentum. 'It was a very productive week,' said Mr Jules Katz, deputy trade representative. He predicted a ministerial meeting would be scheduled later this month 'depending on progress made'.</p>

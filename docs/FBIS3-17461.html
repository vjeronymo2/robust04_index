			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kazys Bobelis, member of the Lithuanian Seimas  delegation in the Council of Europe [CE] was against privileges  for Russia in admitting it to that international organization.    At a meeting of the Human Rights Committee of the Council of  Europe in Paris last week, Bobelis, together with many  representatives of other countries, voted against the initiative  of Great Britain to admit Russia without some essential  preliminary conditions. According to the Lithuanian  representative, Russia's admission to the Council of Europe is  so far being hindered for several reasons, the most important of  them being the deployment of the Army in foreign countries.    At the meeting of the committee, Bobelis, together with the  Romanian, Polish, and Turkish representatives, did not support  the Swedish initiative to abolish the death sentence in all  states of the European Council. Although, according to him,  Lithuania does not have an official policy on this issue, in his  opinion, it is too early for the Lithuanians to assume such  responsibility.    Bobelis, who is chairman of the Seimas Foreign Affairs  Committee, complained at a news conference on Friday [25 March]  of poor relations with the foreign policy planners at the  presidential office. He stated that the Foreign Affairs  Committee was not supporting the policy of Justas Paleckis, the  presidential adviser on foreign policy. He called this policy  isolationist.</p>

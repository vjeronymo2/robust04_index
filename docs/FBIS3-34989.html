While the leadership of the coalition has and continues to  exert intensive efforts to contain the negative impact of the  partitioning decision Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, member of the  YSP Political Bureau and prime minister, made appointing a  governor for the Abyan governorate, thus exceeding the  constitutional prerogatives that are granted to the Presidential  Council and the Council of ministers in this respect, the YSP  and the influential people within it in the Aden governorate  today further exacerbated the crisis. Salih Munassir al-Siyali,  Aden governor, and member of the political bureau, summoned the  commander of the Central Security Units in Aden and informed him  that the party leadership has decided to quickly move the  Central Security Units from their locations in the Radfan camp  in (Kurmaksal) to the al-Mashari' area in Dar Sa'd, thus  violating the military security committee's decision and the  decisions of the dialogue committee of not carrying out any  transfer or change in any of the forces, giving a 12-hour  ultimatum to carry out the order. Otherwise, deterring measures  will be taken to force them to move.    Contacts were made to convince the YSP to avoid such an  escalation. However, the contacts were unsuccessful, and water  and electricity were cut from the camp today as a prelude to a  bloody confrontation.    Denouncing these provocations by the YSP and its military  command, the GPC holds the YSP responsible for the consequences  of this measure. It appeals to the brothers in the YSP  leadership to show deference for their people and their unity.    The GPC also urges all political organizations and forces,  at  the forefront of which is the dialogue committee, to denounce  and condemn such measures. The GPC also affirms that these  provocations will not weaken its determination to sign the  pledge and accord document, which is the only way out of the  political crisis. Nor will such measures weaken the GPC  determination to reunite the coalition to implement the articles  of the document, since this is a joint responsibility.    It is God who grants success.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: After the shock wears off . . . - Some ways in which drivers can cut those ever-growing car insurance premiums MOTOR insurance premiums have risen rapidly since the mid-1980s as claims have grown more frequent and more expensive. The insurance companies have been losing money so, inevitably, consumers are picking up the bill. Premiums are not uniformly high, though. Some insurers have bigger losses to recoup than others, and companies' ratings of different risk factors do vary. If you are shocked by the figure on your latest renewal notice, you need not grit your teeth and pay up. By shopping around for quotes - as an increasing number of motorists are doing - you could halve your premium. And if you are one of the 400,000 people expected to get a new car this month, it could be worth taking some time to find the best insurance deal. The past few years have seen the rapid expansion of direct insurers - companies which operate entirely over the telephone and, because of their low overheads and choosy underwriters, can offer lower premiums to motorists seen as good risks. This usually means drivers over 25 with ordinary cars who live in the suburbs or rural areas and have no convictions or recent crashes. If you fit this description, you might get a very good deal from Direct Line, Churchill, GA 1-2-1, the Insurance Service, or one of the many other direct insurers springing up around the telephone network. They now take about 15 per cent of motor insurance business and are expanding into other lines, such as household cover. Most are open beyond normal office hours and at the weekend and some use free 0800 numbers, so they have the advantage of convenience, too. If, however, you are young, drive a hot hatch, or have a record tarnished with motoring convictions or accidents, the direct insurers may well either reject you or quote astronomical premiums. If you go to an insurance broker, you could stand a better chance of finding a reasonably-priced policy. Traditional high street brokers still account for almost half of motor insurance business but, in line with the direct insurance trend, a number of telephone broking services were launched recently. These use computer systems to access many different insurers and find the most competitive quote. Select Direct, Telesure and CGA are among them. Another variation is OneQuote, a company which will find the best quote from 65 insurance schemes and then direct callers to a local broker who is an agent for that particular insurer. It charges for the service by using a premium rate phone number. Other companies - such as the AA, which deals with a selected panel of insurers - will quote from high street branches or over the telephone. The main factors on which your premium will be based are the same as ever: age, sex, occupation, address and driving record, and the make, model and age of your car. But other factors over which you have more influence could help cut the cost of your insurance. The easiest way is by opting for third party rather than comprehensive cover. This means that only damage to other people, cars or property is covered, not damage to your own vehicle. If it is not worth much, this could be a sensible option. But if an accident is your fault, or you are unlucky enough have a collision with someone driving illegally without insurance (as prices rise, an increasing number of drivers have no insurance), you will have no one to claim from. Also, some third-party policies will not pay out for a car damaged by thieves. Most policies specify that you must pay a standard excess - the first Pounds 50 or Pounds 100 of any claim. If you agree to a larger excess - say, Pounds 200 or Pounds 300 - this will cut your premium. But you should be sure that, when you make a claim, you can afford the sum to which you have agreed. When you get a quote from a broker or insurance company, ask if it offers any discounts - such as for keeping the car in a garage or fitting a security device. The AA is promoting a new Tracker system which allows stolen cars to be tracked electronically, and several insurers have agreed to give 10 per cent discounts for vehicles with these. Certain jobs or membership of some organisations can also carry the added benefit of a discount with some insurers; Frizzell does special deals for civil servants or those belonging to the National Trust. Your habits can make a difference, too; members of the Institute of Insurance Brokers can offer a special policy to non-smokers, as some research has indicated smokers are more likely to be involved in accidents. If you use the car only to go shopping, let your insurer know. Drivers running up low annual mileages sometimes attract discounts because insurers reason that the less time you spend on the road, the lower your chances of crashing. And if you have an old car, you could ask about a 'classic' policy. These usually are based on limited mileage, but can work out substantially cheaper than standard policies. Price is bound to be one of your main considerations when picking car insurance but beware of small companies offering suspiciously good deals, particularly if you are in a high-risk category such as a young driver of a hot hatch or a convicted drink-driver. The Department of Trade and Industry warned that a number of bogus car insurers were operating in the UK. They attract business with low premiums for difficult-to-insure drivers, but are not authorised to sell insurance and their policies are worthless. Victims may discover they have bought a dud policy only when they try to make a claim, or are asked for their insurance documents by the police. They could even be prosecuted for driving without valid insurance. If you are suspicious of a motor insurance policy, ask for the name of the underwriter  -then ring the DTI on 071-215 3165 to check if the company is legitimate.</p>

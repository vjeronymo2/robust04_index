			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Boxers need mandatory health and safety standards established through federal  legislation to protect them from injury and exploitation in an industry unable  to regulate itself, a congressional panel was told.  </P> <P> "The sport has had more than 100 years to attempt self-regulation. The decision  is in; boxing lost the decision," said Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), co-sponsor  of a bill to establish a nonprofit, Washington-based federal corporation to  govern the sport.  </P> <P> Specifically, the proposed United States Boxing Corp. and its 12-member board  of directors would establish uniform regulations and assist states in  implementing them; create a computerized national registry to track boxers,  their records and injuries; and establish uniform minimum safety and health  standards.  </P></p>

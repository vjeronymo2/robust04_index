			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Societies braced for legislation: A regulator who would welcome a permissive system Building societies could soon be required to set up committees to represent members' views to their boards under proposals to be floated by the Treasury as part of its review of societies' legislation. A consultation paper to be published early next month will set out options for strengthening the voice of members in societies and encouraging them to play a more active role. The paper will also look at ways of enabling societies to offer a wider range of activities, allowing them to compete more effectively in personal financial services. Ms Rosalind Gilmore, head of the sector's regulator, the Building Societies Commission, believes that the Treasury review will lead to legislation. She said that the most likely outcome was a decision to shift from a system which specifies the activities that societies can undertake to one in which a society is clearly defined, but can then carry out any line of activity not expressly forbidden. 'The most likely next piece of legislation is the one that establishes an identified building-society sector - which recognises what they are but makes the move from a prescriptive to a permissive system. That would be a good outcome.' This would enable societies to respond more flexibly to competition from the banks and others, reinforcing the confidence in mutuality expressed by society chief executives. A survey from stockbrokers UBS, due out tomorrow, shows that fewer society chief executives expect the large societies to convert to PLC status, compared with five years ago. At that time, as Abbey National converted, there were widespread predictions that the other large societies would follow, leaving just small, relatively insignificant societies in mutual ownership. Instead, Abbey has remained the only one to convert and the Pounds 1.8bn cash offer by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester seems, in spite of growing bank interest, unlikely to set an immediate trend. Some of the credit for the continuing future of the sector should go to the commission. It has maintained a fine balance between preventing societies from expanding into areas for which they are unsuited without hampering their ability to diversify around their core business. However the greater flexibility which is contributing to the sector's prospects is also adding to the debate about the commission's future. It is argued that as societies become more like banks the need for a separate regulator from the the Bank of England is reduced. Ms Gilmore is not convinced. 'I think we have a sensible, contained remit, and a cost-effective form of regulation. I think we'll be there in the 21st century.' There may be grounds for this optimism in the Treasury's reluctance to tackle how changes to societies' legislation would affect regulatory arrangements. Although Ms Gilmore supports a more permissive system, she is cooler about the idea of mutual-bank status in which Halifax building society, the UK's largest, has expressed particular interest. She said: 'I can see why Halifax would like to be seen as a bank in special circumstances - like overseas markets where building societies are not so easily recognised. But it's only fair to the public here that they should be able to understand what a building society is.' On greater involvement by society members she sounds more positive than some society chief executives: 'The interesting question is how in a mutual, or very diffused, ownership you actually get the members taking a bit more direct part in what happens.' Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said when he announced the first stage of the review that ministers felt members should be able to hold society directors to account more effectively. One proposal he mentioned was reserving places for member representatives on the board of a society. Another way of increasing member activity would be to set up a national 'members' council', funded by societies, to act as a voice for the 33m society members. The Treasury may also seek to recognise the differing interests of investing members and borrowing members. Many building society boards are likely to resist moves to create new channels of member representation, arguing that they are already accountable to their members. However they, like Ms Gilmore, are likely to welcome an enhancement of their powers, although many contrasts have been drawn - to societies' disadvantage - between structures in a mutual organisation and a limited company. Two weeks ago Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association, called for improvements in societies' accountability, saying that they should be required to consult members on changes in strategy. Ms Gilmore described his assessment as 'broadly not right'. He added: 'Already new powers are adoptable, new ventures would routinely be the subject of comment in the report and accounts. 'Like any board, the rules may be very wide - the board is there to manage the business and there are a lot of things which, under the rules, it can do. I don't see a vast difference between the two situations.' Whatever the future for large societies and the commission, Ms Gilmore will have departed. She has announced her intention to stand down towards the end of the year and her successor is expected to be announced later this month. Her advice to her successor is typically pragmatic: 'Get out and about - go to lots of review meetings with societies and listen. Decide it's going to be a pleasure, because it's sure going to be hard work.'</p>

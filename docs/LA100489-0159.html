			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW EXTENDS ITS RALLY, SURGES 16.34 TO 2,770.9  </P> <P> The stock market climbed to record highs for the second straight session today,  following through on Tuesday's sharp gain.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.34 to 2,770.90, stretching  its gain since the start of the week to 78.08 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 812 up, 652 down and 507 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 194.59 million shares, up from 182.55 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose 1.14 to 197.98.  </P> <P> Analysts noted some "catch-up" buying by investors who were caught off guard by  the market's revived rally this week.  </P> <P> The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure to persistent  strength in the dollar and declining interest rates.  </P> <P> Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that the Federal  Reserve might soon find room to further relax its credit policy, prompted by  slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable inflation news.  </P> <P> Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today. But after hesitating  for the first two hours of the session, stocks began forging ahead again.  </P> <P> Bond prices inched lower in early dealings today in the wake of three  consecutive advances.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 3/32 point, or nearly $1 for  every $1,000 in face amount, at midday. Its yield edged up to 8.17% from 8.16%  late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Martin Morrow, a money market economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said  traders were awaiting Friday's planned release of employment figures from  September for an indication of the economy's strength.  </P> <P> He said traders were also looking toward the West German central bank to see if  it raises a key lending rate later this week in an effort to reinforce its  efforts to curb the dollar's rise.  </P> <P> Bond prices have benefited in recent days from a rise in the dollar, making  U.S. Treasury notes and bonds more attractive to foreign investors.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  slipped 1/16 point, intermediate maturities were off 1/8 point and long-term  issues were down by between 1/32 point and 3/32 point, the Telerate Inc.  financial information service said.  </P> <P> The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a  $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  lost 0.88 to 1,173.89.  </P> <P> Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a  portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up  0.52 to 330.30.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.04% as the discount gained 3  basis points to 7.78%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.30% as the discount  advanced 4 basis points to 7.87%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.39% as the  discount rose 3 basis points to 7.80%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9 1/16%, up from 9% late Tuesday.  </P></p>

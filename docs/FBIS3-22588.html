			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Yves Nau: ``The New Cholera Strain Has </F> Reached Thailand and China'']    [Text] The cholera strain known as 0139 (or ``Bengal''),  responsible for a new type of epidemic in south and east India,  then in Bangladesh (LE MONDE 15-16 August), is progressing very  rapidly over the Asiatic continent, where it has already  affected thousands of persons and has caused several hundred  deaths. It has now reached Thailand and China.    Isolated a short time ago, Vibrio cholerae 0139  appears particularly toxic and virulent. Unlike the other  colonies, it threatens the population as a whole, and in  particular, adults from Asiatic countries where cholera is  endemically rampant. The French General Directorate of Health's  weekly epidemiologic bulletin's prediction that the new strain  would probably spread among the ``most indigent'' populations,  has in fact materialized. On Monday 16 August, according to the  AFP, Chinese health authorities reported some 100 cholera cases  due to Vibrio cholerae 0139 in Sinkiang, in the  western part of the country. As of last month, the Chinese  minister of health had already reported atypical cases of  cholera in the southern part of the country. The emergence of  this new strain and its rapid spread worry international  epidemiologists. In a commentary published in the British weekly  THE LANCET dated 14 August, Doctors David L. Swerdlow of Boston,  and Allen A. Ries of Atlanta, fear that this phenomenon will  result in the eighth pandemic of cholera. Each of the previous  pandemics resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality  rates, notably in Africa and Latin America. [passage omitted]    ``Although we may not be able to foretell where and how fast  this new strain will spread, countries must surveil it closely  and permanently,'' the American specialists stress in THE  LANCET. This surveillance requires, in particular, that the  third world's health officials in their entirety institute  indispensable hygienic measures as soon as possible by supplying  the populations at risk with only high-quality water and with  covered sewage systems, without which the undertaking of a fight  against cholera remains but a dramatic utopia.

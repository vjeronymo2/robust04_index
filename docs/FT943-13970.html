			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: For good returns, dive Down Under Australia is forecast by broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd to produce one of the highest equity returns of any geographical area over the next 12 months. BZW expects returns of more than 22 per cent in local currency terms over the period. It does, moreover, see the Australian dollar recovering from being one of the cheapest currencies around relative to the pound - thus, the return equates to about 38 per cent in sterling terms. This return projection is bettered only by Canada. BZW believes the industrial sector is particularly attractive and estimates that it is 15 per cent below valuation. For those wanting exposure to Australia, the choice among UK single country funds is limited. There are only three unit trusts: Barclays Unicorn Australia, M&amp;G Australasian and General, and NM Australia. Last December, NM also launched a Smaller Australian Companies investment trust; this is trading at a premium to its net asset value, reflecting a high degree of demand. NM was the UK arm of the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia until it was bought by Friends Provident at the end of last year. NM Australian is the largest of the three trusts, with about Pounds 36m under management, and is top of the Australasian sector over five, seven and 10 years to July 1. But it has slipped more recently to second position over three years, according to HSW (offer to bid, net income re-invested). Growth over 10 years is 455 per cent and 85 per cent over five years. It is the only one of the three trusts to be included in the Unit Trust Analysis Guide produced by Fund Research. This measures the performance of funds in terms of consistency and fund management experience, as well as quantitatively. Unit Trust Analysis selects consistently high-performing funds for the guide. The NM unit trust contains 40 to 50 stocks, with the top 20 holdings accounting for about 75 to 80 per cent of the investment. The fund manager, Victor de Lorenzo, also manages the NM Gold fund and the NM Smaller Australian Companies trust, as well as NM's Australian retail trusts. Another way of gaining exposure to the Australian market is to invest in a commodities fund, which will have exposure not only to Australia but also to other mineral-rich countries, such as South Africa. But the spread across continents does not mean these are any less volatile than a single country fund - which means that it is not a good idea to have much more than 5 per cent of your overall growth portfolio in these funds. Mercury's Gold &amp; General unit trust has a consistently high performance record in the commodity and energy sector over five years to July 1 (source: HSW); about 30 per cent of the portfolio is invested in Australia. Waverley Australasian Gold is a fund that is targeted more regionally; but while it would have turned Pounds 100 invested two years ago into Pounds 315 today, the same amount invested seven years ago would be worth only Pounds 57 now.</p>

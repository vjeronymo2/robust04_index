			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mario Espinosa] </F>   [Excerpts] The report and conclusions handed down by the  Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, to the Constitution  Commission of the Chamber of Deputies contain very serious  charges. Although the report exempts former President Jaime Paz  Zamora from any link to drug trafficking, it clearly indicates  that Paz Zamora's closest assistants--including Susana Seleme  and Oscar Eid Franco--have been linked to drug trafficking or  have concealed this sort of crime. The report, which the FELCN  handed to the congressional commission at 2300 last night, also  contains a series of other names.    The report clearly establishes that there is evidence that  Oscar Eid Franco, current Movement of the Revolutionary Left  (MIR) president; former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco;  Susana Seleme, former government palace private secretary;  former Santa Cruz Mayor Rolando Arostegui; Carlos Valverde,  former Santa Cruz Department intelligence chief; and other less  important MIR leaders have been linked to drug trafficking.  [passage omitted]    More than 10 MIR leaders are being charged with involvement  in drug trafficking. The FELCN establishes three groups of  allegedly guilty people. The first group is charged with links  to a drug trafficking gang responsible for processing, selling,  and trafficking in cocaine. In the second group are Oscar Eid,  Susana Seleme, Carlos Valverde, and other MIR members who are  charged with alleged dubious scheming and unlawful association  with Chavarria. It is also said that they concealed drug  trafficking crimes. The third group includes Guillermo  Capobianco and Rolando Arostegui, MIR leaders who have had  special privileges. In this regard the Constitution Commission  members have stated that although they committed the same crimes  as the aforementioned people, the crimes will be studied by a  congressional commission.    Jaime Paz Zamora was not mentioned in this report sent to  the  Constitution Commission. [passage omitted]    The FELCN is also pressing charges against the Colombian  Guido Arce; Elmer Saucedo, former national chief of the  department of goods seized from drug traffickers; Army Colonel  Jorge Velazquez, who was former President Jaime Paz Zamora's  aide-de-camp and head of the aides-de-camp; and Fernando  Canelas; in addition to Susana Seleme; Oscar Eid; Carlos  Valverde; Guillermo Capobianco; and former Mayor Arostegui. All  of them are MIR leaders or people closely related to the  previous administration. We repeat that these people have all  been mentioned in the report handed by the FELCN to the  Constitution Commission. [passage omitted]</p>

Tomorrow Mr Kajo Neukirchen, brought in last December as chief executive of the troubled metals, mining and industrial group, will hold his first press conference since he took over. Renowned as a no-nonsense restructuring expert, he is expected to announce big job-cuts as well as the sale of some of the group's 258 subsidiaries. On Thursday the company will hold a special shareholders' meeting at which Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is also MG's supervisory board chairman, is likely to explain the background to the near-collapse of the company.

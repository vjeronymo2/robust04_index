			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sergio Crivelli -- copyright LA PRENSA]--FOR </F> OFFICIAL USE ONLY    [Text] According to a report that was circulated widely  over the weekend, President Carlos Menem assumed a commitment to  U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor in connection with the  approval of the patents law. According to the report, which the  government has not denied, Menem assured Kantor of two things:  a) that the government has the "unanimous support of  pro-government legislators," and b) that he expects to approve  the bill "before mid-1994." Despite the president's optimism,  the future of the bill does not seem very clear, if regarded  from the viewpoint of Congress.  <H5>  Threats and "Advantages" </H5>   In order to exert pressure for the passage of the patents  law, Washington has recently resorted to two weapons: commercial  sanctions, and exclusion from NAFTA. In Chile, a little more  than two weeks ago, Kantor explained to Menem that if there is  no news on the subject by 30 April our country will be included  on the list of countries that do not protect intellectual  property, something that will, fatally, entail serious sanctions.    Ten days later, Argentine Ambassador to the United States  Raul Granillo Ocampo informed LA PRENSA that the Menem  administration has decided to promote a patents bill with  features identical to those demanded by the United States, which  is the only possibility for joining NAFTA.    Even though Congress is not working because of the electoral  campaign, the news has reached the Senate, in whose hands  remains this bill whose approval Washington has awaited in vain  for years. Yet the reaction of the few pro-government lawmakers  who could be found did not seem favorable to the expectations of  U.S. medicine manufacturers, despite the intense lobbying that  top White House officials have been doing in their favor.    Why? First, because the possibility of being included on the  list of "sanctionable" countries has not caused too much  concern. For example, Brazil was at one time included on the  list, and was excluded when it signaled that it had began to  look into the matter. On the other hand, most of Argentina's  enormous commercial deficit comes from its trade with the United  States. This means that in order to defend some hundreds of  millions of dollars for its pharmaceutical industry, the  Democratic administration will expose several billions to the  risk of a bilateral short circuit.    As for joining NAFTA, the situation is also complex. All  legislators are aware that if the bill is approved the way it  was submitted by the executive branch -- that is, the way  Washington wants it -- a cash prize will be given to the U.S.  pharmaceutical industry, without an immediate matching benefit  for our country. In fact, becoming a member of NAFTA -- a  common market made up of the United States, Canada, and Mexico  -- might be possible only in the medium term.  <H5>  The Balance of Power Within the Government </H5>   However, the reasons, arguments, rebuttals, and  counter-arguments -- no matter how convincing -- have little  weight at the time Congress makes decisions, when votes are the  really important matter. And those votes, at least in the  Peronist Party, are tied to a balance of power within the  government, in which there are some who support the patents law  and others who have so far successfully tried to delay it.  Those who claim to know the events behind the scene at Casa  Rosada make assurances that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo  belongs to the first group, while Presidential Secretary Eduardo  Bauza is in the second.    What is the lesson of this situation? That the majority  want to delay the bill. There is tangible evidence. For a long  period the bill was retained by the Commission of Industry in  the Chamber of Deputies. When ex-Deputy Jorge Yoma took up the  task of expediting the study of the bill, he had smooth  relations with Terence Todman, then U.S. ambassador to Argentina.    Whenever he was consulted off the record, Yoma predicted:  "One of these days we will go to the Olivos residence with the  congressional bloc leaders, Carlos will tell them `go ahead,  boys,' and we will rapidly approve the bill." But this meeting  never took place. Finally, one afternoon, at the Hall of Lost  Steps in government house, Yoma confessed: "No, brother, I gave  up the patents issue. No one paid any attention to me, and I  went to see Bauza and I told him: "Please, fellow, do not send  him (Todman) to me any more."    Shortly afterward, Alberto Iribarne -- currently the deputy  interior minister and at that time the chairman of the  Commission of Industry -- had a surprise. The opposition was  pushing a bill to abstain from debating on the patents law  unless the United States and the European Economic Community  [EEC] eliminate the agricultural subsidies that are harming  Argentina. At the time of the vote, Iribarne was practically  alone, because the Peronists supported the opposition  initiative. Even the ultraliberal Federico Zamora agreed to put  aside the unrestricted property rights issue, in the face of the  need to defend the agricultural sector. The United States and  the EEC never eliminated the subsidies.    After this experience, the government submitted the bill to  the Senate, where it was once again shelved. The Peronists put  the subject in the hands of Radical Civic Union member Jose  Genoud, and this made it clear that the executive branch was  exerting no pressure to have the bill approved. The situation  seems to have changed now, but nothing seems to indicate that  the law will be approved the way the U.S. pharmaceutical  industry wants it. On the contrary, based on the available  signals, the text of the law might follow not the government  model but the GATT agreement, a position that is supported by  local laboratories but is rejected by foreign manufacturers.</p>

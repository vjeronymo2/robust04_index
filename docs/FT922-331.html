			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The lessons of Mr Horton's exit SO FAR as the board of British Petroleum is concerned, the Bob Horton affair is over. The blazing hulk of the company's former chairman and chief executive has slipped beneath the icy waters of corporate consensus so that hardly a ripple remains. It is not satisfactory for the BP board to say only that its decision to force out Mr Horton arose from an assessment of his personal style and the fact that too much power was concentrated in one man's hands. BP's strategy, the board insists, will be unaffected by this latest change at the top. At the very least, the board might have added a note of contrition at the double error this dramatic departure reveals: the decision not much more than two years earlier to combine the role of chairman and chief executive and the view that Mr Horton was the right man for the job. Mr Horton's personality and style, on vivid display inside BP for over three decades, was hardly an unknown quantity. The overwhelming lesson of this sorry affair is that for big companies to combine the role of chairman and chief executive in one individual is almost always a mistake. When the chief executive is a person of strong temperament, the sounding board and guiding hand of an independent chairman is more or less indispensable. At the age of 50, taking over the leadership of a large and stumbling oil company, the impetuous Mr Horton should never have been given sole custody. With the backing of the right chairman, there is every reason to believe that his considerable talents could have been channeled to successful effect and that this latest act of self-mutilation by an important British company could have been avoided. The BP board has implicitly recognised the force of this argument by naming Mr David Simon, a career BP man, as chief executive, and Lord Ashburton, an investment banker, as chairman. Palace coup On the brighter side, BP's palace coup also underscores another important corporate governance issue: that the boards of big companies should contain a majority of non-executive directors capable of effective and independent action. At least in its actions last week, the BP board demonstrated that, as with the murder of Scottish kings, so with the ousting of corporate chiefs, 'if it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.' None of these observations, however, will be of much comfort to Mr Horton as he re-assembles his shattered career. It would be surprising if his ambitions did not now leap to the other side of the Atlantic, where during the late 1980s he enjoyed considerable success, both in public esteem and the financial performance of BP's then US subsidiary, Standard Oil of Ohio. Swift decisions Mr Horton's experience in the US reinforced his natural penchant for a high profile leadership style, the virtues of which include more openness and plain-speaking than is the norm in British business. This style was combined with a commitment to 'delayer' BP, sweeping away tiers of committees and executive control in favour of managers 'empowered' to take swift decisions and accept responsibility for their outcome. Although encumbered with a disagreeable surfeit of business school jargon, this approach to revitalising old and complex multinational corporations has commended itself to several important companies, including General Electric and IBM. It may well be that Mr Horton lacked the subtlety and patience to apply this philosophy to BP. That, presumably, is the judgment of the board. The danger is that the board has reacted in panic to the cries of pain which inevitably arise when entrenched interests are made to face new realities. In appointing Mr Horton in 1990, the then BP board judged that only a hard-nosed, self-confident revolutionary would be able to transform the culture of an organisation still suffering from post-imperial illusions about its natural place in the global order. For the sake of the British oil industry and BP shareholders, it is to be hoped that the ousting of Mr Horton does not indicate a lack of corporate stomach for confronting the consequences of change. In 1992, the quiet life is even less an option for BP than it was in 1990.</p>

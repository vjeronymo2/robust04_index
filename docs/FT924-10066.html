			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / PM warns Maastricht rebels: Cabinet battle over spending cuts adds to pressure on government MR JOHN MAJOR'S government yesterday delivered a stark warning that a vote against the Maastricht treaty on European union in tomorrow's crucial Commons debate could wreck the prospects for British economic recovery. With the prime minister leading personally a frantic campaign to win back Tory Euro-sceptics, there were signs last night that the arithmetic of the vote was shifting slightly in his favour. But amid claims and counter-claims from both sides the outcome still looked perilously close. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, sought to maximise the chances of a government defeat by tabling an amendment to tomorrow's motion which would halt progress on ratification of Maastricht until after next month's Edinburgh summit. The threat that a defeat would provoke a renewed economic crisis was reinforced by a sharp fall in the value of the pound on foreign exchange markets. Dealers cited the political uncertainty as a central factor in sterling's fall to a record low of 77.7 on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies. The precarious economic outlook dominated a four and a half hour cabinet session last night called to share out the deep cuts in Whitehall spending programmes needed to meet the Treasury's target for next week's Autumn Statement. The cabinet will meet again this morning to continue the discussion. Ministers sought to lift some of the gloom by hinting again that the statement would be accompanied by a cut in interest rates, and by promising that important capital projects would be protected by combined private and public sector money. Downing Street officials said there was no question of the cabinet breaking the Pounds 244.5bn ceiling imposed on spending next year. But there were suggestions elsewhere in Whitehall that the Treasury might find ways to 'circumvent' the target with creative accounting. There were also signs that the government was working on an emergency package to help the housing market, including the release of the frozen capital receipts held by local authorities. But the special cabinet session confirmed that a fierce squeeze on public sector pay, unpopular cuts in social security benefits, and deep reductions in defence spending would be at the heart of the public spending package. Despite the threat of a backbench Tory rebellion over the council tax, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, seemed set to win only limited resources to cushion the impact next year of the poll tax replacement. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, acknowledged that the coincidence of the revolt on Maastricht with the cabinet battle over spending cuts meant a critical week for the government. The strongest warning of a slump in economic confidence if the Maastricht vote was lost came from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. He told BBC radio that Maastricht was 'at the centre of restoring confidence to this country's trading economy'. He added ominously: 'If you vote against the prime minister and against the government on Wednesday, on Thursday you have got a policy vacuum at the centre of British decision-making of incalculable destructiveness.' Mr Major, whose personal authority would be gravely undermined by a defeat, made the same point in a private meeting with about 20 Tory MPs in his office at the Commons. But as his opponents claimed that 40 Tories  - enough to defeat the government  - were determined to vote against Maastricht, Mr Major found his authority under attack from Lord Parkinson, a former Tory chairman. Speaking on BBC television's Panorama programme, he suggested the government had 'lost control', adding 'the buck stops at No 10'.

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Analysts unhappy with BA BRITAIN'S flag-carrier airline, British Airways, had a volatile and busy session as the market digested the company's third-quarter results. Profits for the three-month period to December 1992 dropped by Pounds 80m to Pounds 20m, but were at the top end of analysts forecasts. The initial reaction was favourable and the shares moved ahead, with dealers also cheered by the absence of the feared rights issue announcement. However, closer examination of the accompanying statements and discussions with the company, which pointed to a poor trading outlook, later brought a change of view in the City. The shares retreated as analysts cut year-end pre-dictions. Smith New Court reduced its forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 230m, Lehman Brothers came back by Pounds 15m to Pounds 225m, and James Capel by Pounds 20m to Pounds 200m. At the day's worst, the shares were down 9 at 270p, but afternoon buying, mainly by US houses, prompted a rally for a close of 3 off at 276p after heavy turnover of 10m. Bowater firm Paper and packaging group Bowater ignored both overall market weakness and a potentially dilutive rights issue. The shares climbed to 497p at one stage and survived the later pressure on UK stocks imposed by sharp falls in the US to close 8 ahead at 493p. The company announced a one-for-six cash call at 400p per share to raise Pounds 295m and finance the Dollars 434m (Pounds 305.6m) acquisition of US group Specialty Coatings. Mr Tim Rothwell, media analyst with investment bank BZW, said: 'It is a cracking deal. It is an excellent fit for their current Rexham business and seems to be a reasonably fair price.' Bowater also announced a 48 per cent rise in profits in 1992. Glaxo hit again Drugs group Glaxo fell sharply in early trading yesterday as the bears latched on to news that the company is to cut the ex-factory price of its migraine drug Imigran in the Netherlands by 15 per cent. There were also recurrent worries that Glaxo is poised to announce a big rights issue to finance an acquisition. Finally, there was position-taking ahead of the announcement of Glaxo's results tomorrow and reaction to US President Bill Clinton's address last Monday which could herald a tightening of federal health spending. However, Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett argues that the stock has become a hostage to fortune. 'Glaxo is out of favour but the arguments are misinformed,' he said. The slide, which continued through the day to leave the stock 32 down at 667p on turnover of 6.7m, spearheaded more general weakness in the sector. When Wall Street opened down, Wellcome lost 24 to 900p and SmithKline Beecham fell 15 1/2 to 449p in the 'A's and 21 1/2 to 391p in the Units on joint turnover of 9.6m. Hanson easier Conglomerate Hanson eased 4 to 250p after announcing first-quarter profits of Pounds 236m. SG Warburg Securities said that even though the figure included a Pounds 20m sale it still came in at the house forecast, which was at the low end of market predictions and had excluded any extras. Renewed hints of a bid for TSB rumbled on and the shares added 1 1/2 at 173p. Lloyds Bank, the favoured candidate, fell 8 to 505p. Insurer Legal &amp; General improved 4 to 456p on the back of a bear squeeze. Oil issues dipped as a full ministerial session at the Vienna Opec meeting, expected to agree production cuts, was delayed. Opec had been due to hold a full session which analysts said was expected merely to rubber stamp an agreed cut in production quotas to a total 23.6m barrels. BP lost 5 to 262p, Shell Transport 14 to 576p and Enterprise 10 to 458p. Oil and gas exploration company Pittencrieff jumped 28 to 351p on news that it plans to make its mobile communications unit an independently financed corporation and will raise its final dividend. The company added that it had successfully completed share placings of just over 2.1m shares at 312p per share. Aviva Petroleum closed 3 higher at 54p on positive drilling news. Shares in GKN bucked the poor market trend, adding 8 at 465p, with James Capel said to have been recommending the stock. Confirmation by Lucas Industries that it is to shed 510 jobs at its diesel operations in Kent led to renewed bid speculation and the shares rose 3 to 146p, although the company said the move was part of its restructuring programme. Both British Aerospace and TI Group continued to suffer from reports that American Airlines may return some of its 34 Airbus aircraft. The former gave up 7 to 243p, while the latter lost 12 to 283p. A squeeze in VSEL caused the shares to advance 8 to 591p. Leisure conglomerate Pearson moved ahead 9 to 388p after a UK investment bank turned buyer on the shares. BZW shifted its recommendation from a sell, arguing that recent cost reductions would prompt analysts to reverse their recent trend and begin to raise forecasts. The house said Pearson will also benefit from the strengthening dollar - BZW has dollar/sterling averages of Dollars 1.50 for this year and Dollars 1.30 for next. Finally it is looking for UK cyclical recovery. Selling of the BT partly-paid shares continued ahead of the payment deadline next month and they closed 3 1/2 adrift at 297 1/2 p. The fully-paid shed 3 to 403p. Chubb Security added a penny at 264p ahead of planned presentations to UK analysts next week. Investors searching for second liner bargains in the food manufacturing sector picked out Dalepak Foods and the shares rose 12 to 274p. Old rights issue talk descended on Cadbury Schweppes, 7 adrift at 462p. Profit-takers took the wind from Unilever's sails, the stock tumbling 17 to 1144p. Positive press comment supported United Biscuits, steady at 348p. Continued bid talk in Alexon was counterbalanced by speculation that the recovery story was becoming more credible and the shares rose 6 to 89p. Concern over the US drugs market hurt Boots, off 3 at 485p. US economic worries also impacted on Dixons, the high street electricals retailer, which finished 5 off at 211p. Other stores stocks responded to a more positive CBI retail survey. WH Smith rose 4 to 419p, Storehouse was steady at 185p, Sears gained a penny at 100p and Marks and Spencer lost a penny at 332p. Furniture sales fared less well in the report and MFI weakened 5 to 121p. Several leading leisure stocks were in demand as Smith New Court renewed its recommendation that investors go overweight in the sector. Sentiment continued to improve in Forte following its recent financing deal and renewed talk of acquisitions. The shares rose 2 to 192p. Granada Group found itself in demand, with several securities houses, including Hoare Govett and Smith New Court, recommending the stock. The shares gained 7 at 370p. International drinks stocks stood out, with Grand Metropolitan the best performer for a second session as more brokers expressed enthusiasm for the stock. Among these, BZW reiterated its positive stance, emphasising the deflationary pressures on food costs and the attractions of the group's mixture of businesses. In particular, the weak North American food market was thought to be improving. GrandMet was boosted on Monday by inclusion in NatWest Securities' Top Ten Buy list, and the house continued yesterday to recommend a switch out of Whitbread. The latter fell 17 to 457p. Other domestic brewers also weakened, Courage's figures from Monday again casting a pall. Scottish &amp; Newcastle lost 9 to 414p and Bass 6 to 567p. GrandMet, 17 ahead at one stage, closed a net 8 up at 446p. Allied-Lyons rose 4 to 584p and Guinness 8 to 465p. Building group Wolseley advanced 8 to 553p on talk that SG Warburg had reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. Meanwhile, Ibstock Johnsen shed 2 to 47p on the announcement of Pounds 28m restructuring costs. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (136).

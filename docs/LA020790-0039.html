			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDER OFFERS TO DELAY CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT  </P> <P> The developer of a proposed affordable housing development in Hidden Hills has  offered to hold the property for a year to give city officials time to resolve  a controversy over the project.  </P> <P> Danny Howard made the offer Monday night at a meeting of the Hidden Hills City  Council.  </P> <P> He also said he would consider selling the 2 1/2-acre parcel to the city for  $1.2 million.  </P> <P> Howard's entire project would encompass 25 acres, with nine luxury houses built  on 20 acres inside the town's gates. The remaining five acres would be outside  the gates and would be split between a commercial building and the City  Council's proposed 46-unit affordable apartment or condominium building for  senior citizens.  </P> <P> The affordable housing portion of the project has generated controversy among  some Hidden Hills residents. City officials have said the housing would settle  a lawsuit by Los Angeles County and an attorney over Hidden Hills' use of a  redevelopment agency. But in a poll conducted last month by the council, about  two-thirds of the respondents opposed the council's plan. Hidden Hills is a  community made up almost exclusively of single-family houses.  </P> <P> Under the offer Howard made Monday, the council would continue to hold public  hearings on the luxury houses and the commercial building, but Howard would  agree not to oppose a 12-month delay in the council's decision on what to do  with the low-cost housing parcel.  </P> <P> The council took Howard's proposal under advisement, along with suggestions by  Councilman H. Brian Herdeg that the city consider buying the parcel for a new  city hall site.  </P></p>

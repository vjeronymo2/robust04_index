			<p>BFN     [Text] The higher committee charged with preparing for the  festivals marking the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni Republic  met this morning under brother Deputy Prime Minister  'Abd-al-Wahhab al- Anisi. During this meeting, the conferees  discussed the timetable for the celebrations of the Republic's  national day, the fourth anniversary of unity and the  establishment of the Yemen Republic.    Despite the difficult circumstances brought about by the  gang  of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party, the committee  decided to hold festivals to mark this dear anniversary in all  governorates in the country; the anniversary of the day on which  our people's dream and great goal -- the restoration of unity  and the establishment of the Yemeni Republic -- was achieved on  22 May 1990.</p>

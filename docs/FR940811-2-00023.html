Transco states that the proposed replacements will restore the long-term integrity of its transmission system at the Neches River and the Village River crossings and that the capacity will remain at the existing 624 MMcf per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transco states that the abandonment of the portions of the Main Line A at the Neches River crossing will be completed in two separate projects. Transco proposes to remove approximately 260 feet of the existing 30-inch line from the point of tie-in on the west side of the river and approximately 80 feet of the existing 30-inch line from the point of tie-in on the east side of the river in 1994, at the time of the pipeline replacement construction. The abandonment of the remaining facilities at the Neches River crossing will be completed in 1995, as a separate project, after necessary permits are obtained. Transco proposes to remove, in 1994, approximately 240 feet of its Main Line A at the Village Creek crossing after the replacement line is constructed and tied in. Transco also requests temporary authorization to complete the river crossing replacements if permanent authorization is not issued by August 19, 1994, for security of gas service during the upcoming heating season. The estimated cost of construction is $4,694,455 with abandonment cost estimated at $972,000. The cost will be initially financed by Transco by funds on hand and short-term loans which will be rolled into permanent financing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> August 19, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

National Fuel estimates that the total cost of constructing the delivery point is $1,525,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Fuel notes that it has previously applied for approval under Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for the acquisition and construction of certain facilities, including construction of the Grand Island delivery point, and received conditional approval by order issued June 1, 1994, in Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;112&hyph;000 and CP88&hyph;94&hyph;008 (67 FERC &para; 61,270 (1994)). National Fuel states that it has been unable to commence acquisition and construction because National Fuel cannot satisfy all the conditions included in the June 1 order. National Fuel contends that it urgently needs to commence construction of the Grand Island station in September, in order to have the station in operation by November 1. National Fuel asserts that the new station is necessary to relieve some of the load which currently must be satisfied from gas fed into the eastern end of Line U because Line U operates at its absolute peak capacity on a cold day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> September 19, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

DOMAC also requests, pursuant to Section 157.17 of the Regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission), a temporary certificate authorizing the installation and use, on a temporary basis, of leased air injection equipment, pending the installation and operation of the requested permanent equipment, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Longer-dated US Treasuries recover earlier losses LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices bounced back yesterday afternoon from the pressure of mixed economic news and the increased supply in the market following this week's two-year and five-year note auctions. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was  1/32 higher at 106 5/8 , yielding 7.435 per cent after sliding to 105 31/32 earlier in the day. Among shorter-dated maturities, the two-year note was off 3/32 to yield 4.316 per cent. Larger losses were posted by intermediate issues. The market was jolted by jobless claims for the week to July 18, which dropped 21,000. The market had expected a fall of 11,000. In addition, new home sales for June were higher than expected, advancing 7.9 per cent instead of the anticipated 3.8 per cent. Second-quarter gross domestic product data showed real GDP advancing at an annualised rate of 1.4 per cent compared with expectations of 1.8 per cent, and the inflation components indicated that inflation was under control. The Federal Reserve addressed a soft Fed Funds rate by arranging overnight matched sales in the open market when Fed Funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were trading at about 3 1/16 per cent. The draining manoeuvre did not come as a surprise with Fed Funds trading below the Fed's perceived target of 3 1/4 per cent. EUROPE'S main government bond markets tumbled yesterday mainly on worries about the prospects for lower interest rates and European economic and monetary union. Furthermore, a fall in the US Treasury bond market overnight and during the day added to the markets' weak tone. ITALIAN government bonds plunged as soon as the market opened following Wednesday's resignation of Mr Vicenzo Scotti, the foreign minister. Mr Scotti was strongly criticised yesterday for undermining the month-old coalition by leaving over a party row. The futures contract, which opened at 92.01, fell to a low of 91.30 before stabilising at around the 91.45-91.60 level. Dealers noted selling of cash bonds out of Tokyo as soon as the market opened, and substantial selling by domestic investors during the day. SPAIN, one of the other traditionally high-yielding European bond markets, witnessed a marked fall in bond prices. The Spanish Treasury decided not to allocate any three-, five-, or 10-year bonds at its regular auction yesterday due to the steady fall in Spanish bond prices. At the Treasury auction on April 30, 10-year bonds were sold at a yield of 10.91 per cent. However, since the Danish vote against the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union, the Spanish market has dropped sharply and yields on 10-year bonds were 12.21 per cent, against 12.09 per cent the previous day. Dealers had expected Spanish bond prices to pick up slightly on news that the Treasury was not going to issue any bonds at auction. But the market fell back, taking its cue from the other European markets. FEARS about the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty in September sent French government bonds sharply lower yesterday, with foreign investors seen as particularly heavy sellers. The market is likely to focus on next Wednesday's opinion poll concerning EC union to see whether there has been a swing against ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. The most recent polls showed about 55 per cent in favour of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty, with up to 40 per cent undecided. However, dealers said market sentiment had not been helped by the government's poor showing in the opinion polls and the fact that unemployment has reached a record level, with 10.3 per cent out of work according to figures released yesterday. The Matif futures contract closed 70 basis points lower at 104.76, its lowest since August 1991, and fell further in after-hours trade to 104.62. GERMAN government bonds plunged through their resistance levels to end sharply lower yesterday on concern about the prospects for lower interest rates. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 87.38, breached the 87.22 resistance level to end the day at 86.97. Dealers said the weak tone in the US and other European markets did not help sentiment, but that the market had chosen to focus on comments in the press by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, that interest rates will not come down soon. Elsewhere in the D-Mark bloc, the Dutch central bank surprised the markets by increasing its special advances money market rate from 9.50 per cent to 9.60 per cent. The move was intended to support the Dutch guilder against the D-Mark, and was not seen as a significant tightening in policy. Dutch bonds fell back in line with Germany and closed lower on the day. UK government bonds fell by nearly a percentage point yesterday as jitters over the French referendum on Maastricht upset the gilt market, adding to existing concerns. The gilt futures contract fell to 97.11 from 98.5 on a heavy volume of 51,420 contracts. JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly weaker. The benchmark No 129 JGB, which opened with a yield of 4.90 per cent, closed at 4.91 per cent in Tokyo and moved to 4.94 per cent in the London trading session as European investors took profits. The futures contract traded in a range of 104.93-105.06 and closed at 104.98.</p>

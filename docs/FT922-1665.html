			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Some MCC businesses to be sold OFFICIAL Airline Guides, bought by Robert Maxwell for Dollars 750m in 1988, is to be sold to meet some of the debts of Maxwell Communication Corporation. OAG, a provider of airline schedule and fare information, along with a number of other MCC information businesses will go by trade sale or public offering. Price Waterhouse, the administrator, has divided the main MCC assets in the US into two parts: the Macmillan publishing businesses, which are to be retained; and the information businesses, which will be sold. Macmillan Publishing, which includes college, trade and reference books, is likely to be floated next year. The sale of the US businesses is expected to raise a total of between Dollars 700m (Pounds 375.2m) and Dollars 1.1bn, as well as about Pounds 100m from UK businesses, net of tax and other costs. The proposals for Macmillan and OAG do not cover the group's 56 per cent shareholding in Berlitz International, which is the subject of legal action. Ownership is contested between Macmillan and a number of financial institutions, to which the shares were allegedly pledged by private Maxwell companies as security for loans. No agreed list of creditors has yet been drawn up, but the total sum owed is estimated at about Pounds 1.6bn. The administrators say the Macmillan and OAG businesses are well managed and profitable, and will be held as long as necessary to achieve full value. MCC is in administration in the UK and under Chapter 11 protection in the US. Administrators in both countries have been trying to find common legal ground between the different requirements of UK and US bankruptcy law. Apart from OAG, the administrators plan to sell: Standard Rate &amp; Data Service, which compiles and distributes media and marketing information to US advertising agencies. Molecular Design, the supplier of information management systems for pharmaceutical and chemical research. PF Collier, which publishes and markets the Collier Encyclopedia.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH BENEFITS  </P> <P> Thank you for your article about Grayce Aul, who suddenly lost her health  benefits when Allstate Life Insurance Co. decided to withdraw from the group  insurance market and terminated her policy (Metro, July 15). Now needing  expensive medical treatment, Aul finds that she can't get adequate insurance  because of her pre-existing condition. This frightening tale should send a  cautionary message to people who now take their own medical coverage for  granted.  </P> <P> To those of us associated with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society,  insurance problems due to pre-existing medical conditions are all too familiar.  Time and time again, the California Legislature has considered measures that  would spread the risk among many insurers while making health coverage  available to those who are medically uninsurable. Only last year, the  Legislature approved such a plan, only to have it vetoed by the governor.  </P> <P> Three measures in the current legislative session -- SB 6 (Robbins), AB 60  (Isenberg) and AB 328 (Margolin) -- would make health insurance available to  those with pre-existing medical conditions. We urge the Legislature and the  governor to take appropriate action promptly. Otherwise, there will be many  more stories like Grayce Aul's.  </P> <P> LAURA REMSON MITCHELL  </P> <P> Government Issues Coordinator  </P> <P> National Multiple Sclerosis Society  </P> <P> Southern California Chapter  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha, 20 Apr (WAKH) -- Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic,  foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has criticized the  performance of the United Nations in Gorazde and its failure to  take appropriate measures in the besieged enclave. UN values  have broken down, he said.    Speaking on his arrival in Doha this morning, Dr.  Ljubijankic  said he was amazed by the UN approach to Bosnia. The United  Nations, he said, had designated Gorazde as a safe area and  pledged to protect it against attack. Yet, the shooting down of  an aircraft by the Serbs has had no reaction.    The Bosnian minister said the reaction of the international  community to what is happening in his country is disgraceful.  His country was prepared to defend itself, despite an estimated  200,000 casualties over the past two years.    In remarks carried by the QATARI NEWS AGENCY, Ljubijankic  said Russia's attitude toward the Gorazde siege was disgraceful.  He said the solutions proposed by Russia are mere tactics to  buy time for the Serbs to overrun the city.    He called on the Muslim world to lend political support to  Bosnia at the United Nations and other international forums and  urged the lifting of the international arms embargo on Bosnia.    Ljubijankic said that with the exception of certain states,  Europe was acting stupidly toward the Bosnian question. Europe,  he said, had nothing to fear from an Islamic state in its midst,  since Islam has a more significant presence in other European  nations than in Bosnia.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Champagne Remy Cointreau's results this week were enough to make even the best champagne go flat. Its margins on the bubbly drink fell to just 7 per cent from 15 per cent and, due to the continuing pressure of high grape prices, there is unlikely to be much relief this year. Remy, of course, is not alone. Margins at LVMH, in which Guinness has a 24 per cent stake, fell 9 points to 15 per cent last year and are still headed down. The producers say the problem is basically cyclical. Margins should eventually recover as grape prices come down, surplus stocks are sold and economic recovery encourages consumers to trade up. Such optimism is based on past experience of the notoriously cyclical industry, but it may not be so easy to put the fizz back in the bottle this time round. Whereas spirits producers can raise margins by exploiting new markets in the developing world, champagne is traditionally a first world drink. Sluggish growth and low inflation in industrial countries may cause consumers to remain more careful about what they spend. Nor, despite their dastardly onslaught on elderflower cordial, have champagne producers done much to protect their brand. Price cutting and the launch of cut-price petits champagnes do not enhance its image. Producers may assume this can be corrected as the surplus disappears. Given the growing market for high quality methode traditionelle sparkling wines, though, they risk creating a permanent reduction in the base from which premium brands are priced. The cachet of champagne could then waft away like the once-expensive smoke of a Marlboro cigarette.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Lifting the lid on liberalisation: Andrew Adonis and Andrew Hill examine European Commission plans to open up the telecommunications market When European Community telecommunications ministers sit down today in Brussels for their first discussion of plans to open all EC telephone calls to competition, they will agree on one thing: liberalisation of the Ecu110bn (Pounds 87bn) market for telecoms services is inevitable. Technological advances, pressure from powerful non-EC operators, the advent of the single market, the influence of privatisation and other measures to distance telecoms monopolies from governments are making the process virtually irresistible. Acceptance of the goal of liberalisation is already a great change of heart for many governments and state telecoms monopolies, nervous about the destabilising forces such a move might unleash. Only two years ago, France, Belgium, Spain and Italy were mounting unsuccessful challenges to the Commission's powers to liberalise the markets for telecoms equipment and specialised services in the European Court of Justice. Mr Michel Carpentier, head of the Commission's telecoms directorate, says even those early achievements would have been inconceivable when he took over the department in 1983. Now, those same countries are looking sympathetically at a Commission plan which would allow private operators - including non-EC operators, provided they open their own markets to competition - to compete within EC states on equal terms with the former telecoms monopolies. Although the goal of open competition is all but agreed, the path ahead is littered with obstacles. As Mr Carpentier says: 'I don't know a member state or an operator which has said we shouldn't liberalise. The question is when, and how.' For the Commission, the answer to the first part of the question is relatively simple: January 1 1998. That is the date set in its recent communication to telecoms ministers for full liberalisation of all telecoms services, including international and domestic telephone calls. Talks with 130 companies, regulators, national governments and users convinced the Commission that an intermediate step - opening all EC cross-border calls to competition - would be superfluous. Instead, over the next three years the Commission wants to: accelerate adoption of existing technical proposals, which would liberalise satellite communications and lay the groundwork for licensing and granting fair access to new telecoms operators; study how alternative networks, such as cable television, railways, or electricity grids, could be used for telecoms services; study the thorny issue of allowing companies to establish their own networks to compete with the existing infrastructure. These measures should open the way, over the following two years, for the Commission to press for full liberalisation of the market for 'voice' traffic using existing infrastructure. Further liberalisation would then depend on the outcome of the Commission's studies, but rapid expansion and diversification of the telecoms market will provide a momentum of its own. A recent survey of the industry by Daiwa Institute of Research predicted that telecoms would be 'Europe's fastest growing major industry in the 1990s', with annual growth averaging 8.5 per cent and the sector constituting 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product by 2000 - twice the 1991 figure. It is too early for a stand-off over the proposals in today's council. But when the scrapping begins, as it is bound to, the UK will be the most pro-liberal party, gleaning some support from Denmark and the Netherlands. The Danes, who should begin to liberalise their telecoms services next year and hold the EC's presidency until July, are keen to push the legislative process along. They have already scheduled a second meeting of telecoms ministers for June 16, at which they hope a formal resolution can be adopted backing the Commission's framework plans. France, Belgium and Germany are more cautious and will undoubtedly voice fears that the Commission is moving too fast. For these more sceptical governments, the priority is to implement existing legislation which lays the foundation for further liberalisation. As one French official says: 'Liberalise, yes, but only on condition that it benefits the European operators. If we go too quickly, it isn't European operators who will draw the advantages but private outsiders such as AT&amp;T (of the US).' Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian socialist in charge of competition at the Commission, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, are anxious to avoid being labelled uncompromising liberals, sacrificing standards and financial stability to the free market. They will urge telecoms ministers to make the safeguarding of a reliable and affordable universal service a prerequisite for liberalisation; and they will propose that countries with less developed networks get an extra two years at least to catch up with their wealthier partners. That concession will be welcomed by the poorer member states, which stand to gain from EC funding to upgrade their telephone networks. Mr Carpentier regards the Commission's 1998 timetable as ambitious, noting that five years is 'not long' for state telecoms companies to adjust; but he sees the Commission's proposals as at least a signal of what could be done if operators, users and governments co-operate. 'The machine has been started up and it's started under the best conditions because the consultations have produced a great political and technical consensus.' The main worry of the state-owned operators is that even if they are ready to face fiercer competition from 1998, they will not be adequately compensated, through charges for access to their public networks, for having to maintain a service for all comers. Deutsche Telekom, for example, is committed to completing a DM60bn (Pounds 24.3bn) programme of infrastructure investment in eastern Germany over the next four years. It believes early competition on international and long-distance calls could undermine the traditional cross-subsidisation of local calls. France Telecom, in spite of its own lead in the liberalisation of specialised services, argues that the public operators must be given sufficient time to adapt their tariff structures to the rigours of a free market, and be able to fix realistic access charges. British Telecom and Cable and Wireless, the UK's leading operators, are the most ardent advocates of liberalisation among EC operators. They criticise the Commission for timidity: in particular, they want to see competition extended from voice traffic to infrastructure, enhancing the capacity of companies to compete on service range and quality. Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, says: 'Telecommunications monopolies are a dangerous anachronism in the fast-moving and increasingly world-scale markets of the 1990s. Urgent remedial action is required.' BT's stance is a marriage of consumer and self-interest. A decade after privatisation, the UK company is no stranger to the market, or to regulators seeking to mimic market pressures. Oftel, Britain's telecoms watchdog, is the UK's prototype independent utility regulator, assertive from the outset; while Cable and Wireless, a long-time international operator licensed in 1984 to compete against BT at home, swiftly established Mercury in the UK business market. It now claims a 10 per cent share of the business and residential market, combined with a network able to reach most of the country. Hard on its heels are cable TV companies offering local data and telephony services. Barely a year after the cable companies entered the field, 30 suppliers have nearly 150,000 lines installed between them. Following liberalisation, BT is confident it could win market share from its European counterparts. But it is not only targetting their existing business. It has ambitious plans to use leased lines, new technology and its own network to make itself a leader in 'global outsourcing' - offering international companies 'one-stop' contracts for phone, data, maintenance and other value-added network services. BT has a fledgling network management company, Syncordia, and is battling with AT&amp;T for direct access to the US public network. The UK's experience begs the question: does privatisation - or, at least, the conversion of telecoms companies to autonomous entities within the state structure - itself act as a motor for liberalisation? The question is pertinent, for the demise of Europe's old-style, state-run posts and telecoms operators (PTOs) is nigh. Just four years ago almost all Europe's PTOs were run by government departments, their operations and finances under direct ministerial supervision. Since then, most have been - or are being - converted into state-owned limited companies. Pressure for full privatisation is mounting. Political economists generally regard the two as linked. Once governments stop treating PTOs as pots of gold and start putting their managers at arm's length, goes the argument, they more readily perceive the wider benefits of competition. The Spanish case - where privately-owned Telefonica has retained a monopoly over basic voice services - does not easily fit this mould. But other recent experience tends to do so. Not just in Britain and the US; radical changes currently under way in Finland also show liberalisation going hand in hand with a determined loosening of government ties. Since Finland's reforms could result in Europe's most competitive market in fixed-line 'voice' services, they will be followed closely in the EC. Six years ago the Finnish government separated the regulatory and operational functions of its communications ministry and liberalised the equipment and value-added sectors of its telecoms industry. In 1990, the country's PTO was turned into a 'state enterprise', its finances separated from the state budget. Legislation is now before the Finnish parliament to convert the PTO into a limited company. Initially it will be wholly state-owned, but privatisation is likely before long. From next January, Finland will have a fully functioning duopoly in local and trunk calls. Its 49 private regional companies, which service local calls for about two-thirds of Finnish subscribers, have formed a single company which has been licensed to compete with Telecom Finland (TF) on trunk routes on its own network. Last week it applied to compete on international calls too. For its part, TF has been licensed to compete on local calls throughout the country. To reduce cross-subsidisation, it is likely for the first time to start adjusting tariffs between regions to reflect costs, as do the private operators at the moment. Is that politically controversial? (The Commission's communication, note, talks of 'special arrangements and transitional periods for the peripheral regions and countries with small and less developed networks'). 'The government has taken the risk, and they will have to provide subsidies if they are unhappy - we are not going to do so,' says Mr Mikko Pirinen, TF's consumer services director. The past three years have also seen TF expand overseas in unprecedented fashion. It is part of a consortium to establish a new fixed network for Estonia, and is engaged in numerous joint ventures in other Baltic states and north-western Russia. Such cross-border activity will flourish across Europe as privatisation advances. Since most governments remain opposed to their telecoms companies falling into foreign hands, it will mainly take the form of partnerships and joint ventures. The Greek government, for instance, is keen to sell up to 49 per cent of its state telecom company's equity, most of it to an overseas operator prepared to provide management skills and substantial investment. There and elsewhere, even in rich states such as Germany, the need for investment is the motor behind privatisation. It is already happening in the Asia Pacific region, where Salomon brothers estimate that companies with a total capitalisation in excess of Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33bn) are likely to seek equity flotations within the next three years, initially yielding more than Pounds 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in new investment. Analysts talk of a telecoms industry by 2,000 in which five or so 'super carriers' provide network management for global business, with fierce competition, especially in the local loop, between mobile, fixed-wire and cable carriers. Sir John Hicks, the Nobel economics laureate, famously remarked that the greatest monopoly profit is the quiet life. For Europe's telecoms monopolists, there will be no more peace.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   EC/SCANDINAVIAN TELECOMS OPERATORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- QUOTED        STATE-OWNED                 AUTONOMOUS ENTITIES COMPANIES     CORPORATIONS                WITHIN STATE STRUCTURE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK            Sweden (from July 93)       Germany Spain         Denmark                     Belgium Italy*        Greece                      France               Ireland                     Luxembourg               Holland                     Norway               Finland**               Portugal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Controlling stake held by government **Legislation pending to change status  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  TELECOMS COMPETITION: PROGRESS COMPARED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       PERCENT OF   SHARE      PERCENT OF    SHARE HELD                       REVENUES     HELD       REVENUES       BY COMPE-                       EXPOSED TO   BY COMPE-  EXPOSED TO      TITORS                       COMPETITION  TITORS     COMPETITION (all services)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Percent                    Percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK (BT)                   100         10         100             22 Germany                   6-8       negl          30              3 France                    6-8       negl          30              4 Belgium                   6-8       negl          30              1 Sweden                     80          5         100             20 Japan (KDD)               100         17         100             25 Japan (NTT)                50          7          50             15 US (AT&amp;T long distance)   100         38         100             45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Best estimate  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The current situation is really not too clear and definite.  The Supreme Council is awaiting its own reelection. Perhaps  those 194 deputies who proposed their own candidacies for a new  term are exactly the ones who constitute its capable nucleus.  Because those who want to be reelected have the best chances of  this today: It is not so much that people are yearning for  changes for the better as that they are afraid that things might  get worse. In the event the elections are not held, the old  staff will hardly be able to work for several reasons: as  morally antiquated, the continuous lack of a quorum, and in  connection with inadequate representative political forces.    There should be no place for illusions regarding its  participation and the current composition of the government that  is headed by a temporarily acting premier. Finally, after Leonid  Kravchuk's announcement, serious doubts have surfaced about the  reliability of and prospects for the president's vertical chain  of command. State authority in its full structure attested to  its temporariness, which is analogous to an acknowledgment of  its ineffectiveness already today.    The impression is being created that all the participants of  the long and exhaustive struggle for the real levers of control  that was waged from the day of acquisition of independence have  simultaneously become deathly sick of each other and of  themselves and, therefore, have said in typical Ukrainian  philosophical manner: "Go to hell!"    As a matter of fact, moral fatigue is truly a dominating  factor at all stages of Ukrainian post-Soviet society. But  according to physical and metaphysical laws, the obvious  cessation of the struggle and movement denotes only their  transition to new forms. Thus, the present political entropy  which, it seems, even the political campaign is not in a  condition to stop, may, in our opinion, have two explanations.    It is possible we are observing the last stage in the  building of a national state in the style of the well-known  anecdote about how it was recommended that a Ukrainian be a  tsar: He ate one goody after another, loaded up on goodies,  stole 100 rubles [R], and ran away. That this happens with an  inexperienced and dispirited elite was shown to me not only by  our historical experience, but also by a parade of objections to  sovereignty that started in Minsk, the capital of the CIS. It is  difficult to judge how much the Ukrainian nomenklatura and  directorate matured before returning under the influence of the  Moscow boss, but the program provisions of the Kuchma-Grinev  bloc talk of a readiness to go the Belarusian way. Under these  conditions, Kravchuk should take the lessons of Shushkevich into  account and be concerned that catapulting from a doomed aircraft  should occur with the necessary solemnity and caution.    The second version of that which prompted Kravchuk to make a  "move with the knight" lies in the recognition that the domestic  political factor and not the foreign factor is decisive. The  struggle for the Ukrainian mace is not ending, but it is  undergoing a certain transformation. New rules in this case are  being written for new players.    The popularity rating of Ukrainian politicians "tolls" the  collapse of the political system. When not one of them is able  to count on the trust of at least a fifth of the population, it  becomes understandable why there is no elementary order in the  country. The existing situation is a consequence, first of all,  of the defeat of the old nomenklatura, which in the person of  the president received exceptionally authoritative powers two  years ago. The fact that Leonid Kravchuk in the matter of trust  actually was the equivalent of his primary competitor,  Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the people's Rukh [Ukrainian  People's Movement for Perestroyka], and former Prime Minister  Leonid Kuchma is a very alarming symptom for the "party in  power" that he heads. This means that the categories of national  intelligentsia and economic managers of the middle echelon that  are traditionally under control are coming out from under the  heel of the nomenklatura and, very likely, will seek an  alternative source of power.    It is interesting that the one and same nomenklatura in an  almost unchanged personnel structure has already suffered defeat  twice before our eyes--first under the guise of the communists,  and later also under the sign of the national-democrats.    In addition, the righteous anger of the "fathers of the  nation," who in both cases consecrated the ruling structure with  their lyrical-epic talent, looks rather comical. The  participants of the so-called Assembly of the Intelligentsia of  the City of Kiev held on 26 February frequently drew an analogy  with the first Rukh congress, which occurred in the very same  House of the Cinema four years ago. The former passion returned  to the leaders of national-democracy (chairmen were Ivan Drach,  Les Tanyuk, and Levko Lukyanenko), and once again one could hear  summons for a decisive struggle with the "occupying  administration," but the populist audience did not bring this  out of a state of deep inertness.    There are other attitudes and other problems in the  corridors  of power. President Leonid Kravchuk and Chairman of the Supreme  Council Ivan Plyushch cannot cope with their competitors in a  direct sense. They only represent different administrative  models. Kravchuk tried to conduct a strict executive vertical  chain of command that would possess the public levers of  influence and rely on the authority of the nationally elected  president. However, it is difficult to impart the norms of an  open society to our society, and especially to the officialdom  of the lower and middle echelons.    But this is exactly the sphere of Ivan Plyushch's  competence,  the master of the apparatus game and concealed control levers.  The amorphous system of the representative organs is the best  ground for the nomenklatura coverup, with which the idea of  state power is traditionally identified in our country.    However, this is by no means a reason for quarrels between  Leonid Makarovych and Ivan Stepanovych. They have common  corporate interests and different spheres of realization of  personal ambitions. This means that common decisions are not  only possible, but also natural. It is precisely this that the  statement of the president should indicate. It is difficult to  guess what his true intentions are now.    In the logic of events, both the new membership of  parliament  and the new president, who could be elected in the current  situation, should win authority with a sharp negation of the  existing regime. Therefore, both these and other elections for  the "party in power," let us put it this way, are not opportune.  At the same time, it is impossible to disrupt them openly, as  this puts the cards in the hands of the opposition. It is better  to "let it drop."    All of this evoked a new wave of emotions and a new stream  of  reproaches. This time Kravchuk is accused by all sides of a lack  of political will and betrayal of national interests. But at the  same time public opinion, imperceptibly to itself, is already  beginning to perceive the far from indisputable claims of the  president as an objective reality, and the problem of elections  falls by itself...    Kravchuk's statement literally has forced everyone to look  into the abyss: By it the chaos and fragility of the political  situation have been brought to a culmination. And this is an  ideal condition for the appearance of a savior of the fatherland.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bradford Property The directors of Harborne Tenants, the property investment company, yesterday advised shareholders to reject the offer from Bradford Property Trust. The value of the offer was 'too low', the board said. Harborne's shares were worth 345p, against the 260p offered by Bradford, they added. An evaluation report had valued Harborne's property portfolio at Pounds 16.1m at November 11, the board said, up Pounds 8.7m over its value in the company's accounts last year.</p>

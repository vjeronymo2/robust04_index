			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S BEST HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYERS ON DISPLAY TONIGHT  </P> <P> The top boys' and girls' senior basketball players in San Diego County will  make their final local appearances in high school games tonight at Serra High  School.  </P> <P> County girls will play a team of city players at 5:30, and Division 2-A boys'  all-stars will play a 3-A team at 7:30.  </P> <P> The games, which traditionally have been played in June, have been moved closer  to the end of the basketball season to generate more interest. Admission is $4  for adults, $3 for students.  </P> <P> The 2-A boys defeated the 3-A team, 116-101, last year. It was the first 2-A  victory since the format was changed from city playing county in 1986. The  county girls easily defeated the city, 72-56.  </P> <P> This season's boys' game features a couple of interesting matchups. Torrey  Pines forward Courtie Miller, two-time San Diego Section player of the year,  and teammate Kevin Flanagan (a center) will play for the 3-A team, and swingman  Joe Temple and center Aaron Wilhite of Lincoln are expected to play for 2-A.  Torrey Pines was ranked No. 1 in the county and Lincoln No. 2, but the teams  never met during the regular season.  </P> <P> Also eligible are All-County players Robby Robinson of Madison and Will Tate of  Southwest for the 3-A team and Ray McDavid of Clairemont for the 2-A.  </P> <P> Bill Pederson of Kearny and Dennis Kane of San Diego will coach the 2-A boys,  and David Ybarra of Sweetwater and John Farrell of Torrey Pines will coach 3-A.  </P> <P> The county girls include four All-County players, led by center Chris Enger of  Vista. Others include Dana Christofferson of Vista, San Marcos guard Susie  O'Brien (the county's leading scorer with a 29.9-point average) and Mesega  Johnson, a forward from Southwest.  </P> <P> The city team will be led by Point Loma guard Monica Filer, section player of  the year.  </P> <P> The county girls are coached by Vista's Joe DeMaria and Bob Kellison of San  Marcos, the city by Lori Schwalbach of La Jolla and Mira Mesa's Gary Blevins.  </P></p>

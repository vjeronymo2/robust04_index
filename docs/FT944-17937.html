			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Rock's leader questions British motives Mr Joe Bossano, the pugnacious chief minister of the British crown colony of Gibraltar, believes that London, either by neglect or through fear of upsetting the Madrid government, is undermining his attempts to achieve self-sufficiency for the Rock by transforming it into an offshore finance centre. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Gibraltar Socialist Labour party leader, who in 1992 was overwhelmingly re-elected to power by the colony's 31,000 inhabitants, said the UK was failing in its duty responsibly to handle the colony's external affairs. He also accused the UK Foreign Office of 'bad faith' for suggesting that he had been reprimanded by the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, at a meeting in London last month. 'I think (the UK) is hampering us. It could be a long-term strategy to make Gibraltar look to Spain for its future,' Mr Bossano said. 'There is no absolute proof of this but the circumstantial evidence makes it difficult to believe that there could be such a level of incompetence over the decisions that are concerning us.' Mr Bossano's tough talk is in character with his single-minded promotion of self-determination for the Gibraltarians - an option that has been ruled out by the UK as well as by Spain, which demands Gibraltar's decolonisation and its return. His bluntness could also complicate bilateral talks between Spain and the UK that were set up in 1987 to discuss the future of Gibraltar. Spanish diplomats believe that Britain is failing to exert 'effective tutelage' over Gibraltar. 'We are coming round to thinking that London cannot deliver anything on Gibraltar,' said one diplomat who questioned the usefulness of the negotiations. Spain is viewed as holding the key to Gibraltar's ability to emerge from a damaging recession but Mr Bossano says that relations with Madrid are 'in a cul-de-sac'. However, reversing his previous total opposition to talks with Spain, Mr Bossano said: 'I am prepared to negotiate directly with Spain, although constitutionally I cannot do it unless I have London's sanction.' In August tensions with Britain came to a head when the colony's attorney-general, who is appointed by London and advises the Gibraltar government, resigned 11 months before completing his three-year term in office, citing differences of opinion between himself and the colony's governor. The UK, which answers for Gibraltar in the European Union, is understood to be concerned about the implementation of Brussels directives on the Rock, particularly those concerning the finance sector, and it is increasingly worried over Madrid's complaints that the colony, at the southern tip of Spain, has added drug smuggling to its traditional tobacco smuggling activities. The chief minister centres his criticism on the UK's insistence on stepping up its regulatory powers over Gibraltar's financial sector and thereby, in his view, effectively preventing the colony from developing tax efficient services for the EU, similar to those in Luxembourg. He wants Gibraltar, for example, to set its own rules on the independent auditing of the 35,000 companies registered on the Rock in order to maintain the secrecy of asset-holding companies owned by individuals. Should London insist on comprehensive auditing, he said, 'I might finish up with no companies to audit because they will have all gone somewhere else in the Union, to our competition such as Luxembourg'.</p>

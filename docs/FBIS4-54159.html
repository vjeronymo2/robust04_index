			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Japan and the United States have agreed to resume  the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The Hata  government, which is charged with the important task of patching  up the sour Japan-U.S. relations, is expected to be able to  avoid facing a crisis situation for the time being. The Clinton  administration has dropped part of its trade demands on Japan  largely because of the U.S. domestic situation, giving the  impression that Japan has benefited from a faulty policy on the  part of the United States. It is indispensable for the Hata  government to frame a new macroeconomic policy, including  reforming the current tax system, to make the July round of  Japan-U.S. summit talks a success, but the Hata government will  run into the difficult task of coordinating domestic views.  Doubts have been raised about Prime Minister Hata's ability to  handle Japan-U.S. relations because his government is a fragile  minority government, and his ability will be tested from now on.    The prime minister intends to come to grips with reforming  the current tax system with the aim of dealing with tax cuts and  tax increases as a package on the political front, while  watching progress in Japan-U.S. working-level trade talks on  individual sectors for the time being. The February Japan-U.S.  summit talks were broken off in the wake of former Prime  Minister Hosokawa's failure to push for the "national welfare  tax," causing the Clinton administration to distrust the  Hosokawa government. The prime minister, therefore, has seen  the macroeconomic policy as a trump card to break the deadlock  in Japan-U.S. relations.    Opposition parties, including the Social Democratic Party of  Japan, however, will undoubtedly resist raising the rate of  consumption tax as a means of securing financial resources to  make up for the fiscal shortfall resulting from continued tax  cuts. If legislators move against raising the rate of  consumption tax for fear of a backlash from voters at a time  when the political situation is moving toward dissolving the  House of Representative and holding general elections, this  would make it even harder for the prime minister to decide on  "raising the rate of consumption tax."    Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry is vehemently opposed to  cutting the income tax prior to raising the rate of consumption  tax. If the prime minister intends to stimulate the economy by  adding the planned amount for the public investment prior to the  Naples Summit, he would face even more difficulty.    The prime minister has repeatedly expressed his intention of  working out plans for revamping the current tax system and  relaxing bureaucratic regulations by the end of June, but the  current Diet ordinary session will end in late June. The  opposition Liberal Democratic Party and other parties are taking  the offensive against the Hata government by suggesting that  they will submit a nonconfidence motion against the Hata  government to the Diet, and there is a possibility that their  offensive against the Hata government can heighten tensions in  the political situation. Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai once  stated, "With regard to the macroeconomic policy, it is possible  to break a deadlock over the policy only by making a decision  affecting the entire political situation." How far will the  prime minister be able to exercise his leadership in  coordinating domestic views on the policy amid the political  turmoil? The prime minister has no reason to feel at ease  although the United States has softened its trade stance on  Japan.</p>

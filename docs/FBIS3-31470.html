The Serbian president's office has announced that they  discussed the current situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  especially the crisis concerning Sarajevo, which is obstructing  the peace process. They decided that steps should be taken to  discourage the supporters of the war option and encourage the  forces of peace in solving the crisis. The calming of war  tensions in the Sarajevo area is undoubtedly of great importance  for ending the conflict.    President Milosevic asked Vitaly Churkin to convey his  greetings to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whom he thanks for  the assistance given in overcoming the greatest crisis so far in  the peace process and in reducing the danger of the war  escalating.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tax worries undermine Etam's advance SHARES IN Etam yesterday fell 11p to 258p in spite of doubled interim profits as the women's wear retailer warned that uncertainty over tax increases in the November Budget could affect trading in the second half. 'We are really quite cautious,' said Mr Keith Miles, finance director. 'November is the peak trading period for us and we have no idea how the consumer is going to behave with the government making noises about tax increases,' he said. Etam is heavily weighted towards the second half. Last year it made some Pounds 10m of its total Pounds 11m profit in the second six months. On a brighter note, Mr Miles said the Pounds 1.21m rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.41m for the 28 weeks to August 14 reflected steady progress in the restructuring programme begun some three years ago and better margins through tight control of costs. Pre-tax profits were also helped by the absence of a Pounds 461,000 charge for withdrawing from lossmaking shops. Sales were 2 per cent higher at Pounds 108.2m. 'Holding to our strategy is beginning to pay dividends,' Mr Miles said. Two years ago management fought a fierce battle to retain control of that strategy by opposing a hostile Pounds 121m bid from Oceana, a vehicle for Foschini, the South African fashion retailer. The group's three divisions enjoyed mixed fortunes. Snob, which targets younger, more fashion conscious women, incurred a small loss. Mr Miles hoped it would be back in the black for the full year after restructuring and management changes. The core Etam business, which caters for the 20 to 55 year old age range, had shown progress, while Tammy, the children's wear operation, had done 'extremely well'. The interim dividend goes up 6 per cent, from 1.65p to 1.75p, payable from earnings ahead from 0.52p to 2p per share.</p>

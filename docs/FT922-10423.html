			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / British Gas faces drop in profits THE COMMITMENT by British Gas to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995 could cut the company's profits by Pounds 100m a year, Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said yesterday. That would mean a reduction of 10 per cent in its overall income, he added. He said the company had developed strategies - agreed with the Office of Fair Trading - to compensate for the drop in its UK business. Mr Evans added that British Gas was on target to earn 40 per cent of its profit from international exploration and production with 20 per cent coming from its Global Gas unit by the end of the decade. Other development projects include opportunities in power generation and exploration of the market for gas-powered vehicles, Mr Evans said. He stressed that the price formula imposed by the OFT was a tough one. It is to last five years and limits price increases to five percentage points below the rate of inflation. Mr Evans added that changes in the company after its deal with the OFT meant it had a strong case for a mid-term review of the formula.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.Y. MAYORAL RIVALS SPAR IN DEBATE AS VOTE NEARS  </P> <P> Democrat David N. Dinkins clashed in campaign debate with New York mayoral  rival Rudolph W. Giuliani on Sunday while gubernatorial contenders sought  support in Virginia and New Jersey in the final days of an off-year election  season focusing on race and abortion.  </P> <P> Weekend polls pointed to a possible Democratic sweep on Tuesday in the three  most closely watched races -- L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia in his bid to  become the nation's first elected black governor, Dinkins in his drive to  become his city's first black mayor and Rep. James J. Florio to become governor  of New Jersey.  </P> <P> The underdog Republicans in those three races have been thrown on the defensive  by their pro-choice opponents on the issue of abortion. The subject has emerged  as a potent issue in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling permitting  restrictions.  </P> <P> The New York mayoral race featured harsh personal attacks lobbed by former U.S.  Atty. Giuliani against Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president. The two locked  horns Sunday in an angry second televised debate that featured Giuliani's  continued focus on financial problems surrounding Dinkins.  </P> <P> "The people of our town don't want a prosecutor. They want a mayor," Dinkins  said.  </P> <P> "They want a mayor who doesn't have to fear a prosecutor," Giuliani shot back.  </P> <P> Giuliani told reporters after the debate that Dinkins "needs to be  investigated."  </P> <P> In Virginia, Wilder, buoyed by a Richmond Times-Dispatch poll reporting a  9-point edge, was campaigning Sunday in the state's coal mining region.  </P> <P> His opponent, J. Marshall Coleman, was in the northwestern part of the state to  conclude a weekend in which he charged his rival with privately pledging to  coal miners that he would "sabotage" the state's right-to-work law by  permitting unions to collect dues from non-union workers covered by union  contracts. Wilder says he supports the right-to-work law.  </P> <P> In New Jersey, Florio, with a poll showing him with a lead of 24 points, called  for the election of Democratic candidates to the State Assembly, where  Republicans have a two-seat majority.  </P> <P> Republican Rep. Jim Courter dismissed the newspaper poll as he made his way  around the state.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Mexico's intellectuals win back tax breaks MEXICO'S intellectuals have won a remarkable victory over the hardline technocrats in the finance ministry by gaining exemption from taxes on their artistic work. President Carlos Salinas ruled in favour of the intellectuals on the eve of the US congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement, doubtless hoping that Mexico's cultural elite would support him in his continuing quest to integrate Mexico with the US.

The writers objected not just to paying the government money, but to filling in long and complicated tax forms. 'It will help my mental stability,' said Mr Carlos Monsivais, a leading left-wing essayist. 'I live in fear of the tax collectors. I spent one year trying to understand my forms and could not. I could not sleep.' A presidential aide sympathised, and said Mexican writers were not meant to understand tax forms.

'The creators and authors have to steal time from nowhere to produce a poem, a work of history, a novel,' said Mr Enrique Krauze, the conservative historian who usually supports free market economics. 'As an editor, or if I give a conference, I pay taxes. But if my work sells a book, I will not pay taxes, as has historically and traditionally occurred in Mexico.'</p>

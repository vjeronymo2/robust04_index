			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) For SDAs, SSGs and subrecipients, the awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; for States, the noncompetitive proposal is approved through the State's normal sole source approval process;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pass Throughs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The procurement rules do not apply to pass throughs of monies from any unit of State or local government (or SDA or SSG administrative entities) to other such units, such as a local educational agency or public housing authority. To qualify as a pass through, the receiving entity must either further pass through the monies to another such entity or procure services in accordance with the procurement rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost or price analysis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) Each recipient, in accordance with the minimum requirements established in this section, shall establish standards on the performance of cost or price analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each recipient and subrecipient shall perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action, including modifications (except for modifications where a determination has been made that they do not have a monetary impact). The method and degree of analysis depends on the facts surrounding the particular procurement and pricing situation. At a minimum, the awarding agency shall make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis is necessary when the offeror is required to submit the elements of the estimated cost ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as in the case of subrecipient relationships), when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements, including modifications or change orders. A price analysis shall be used when price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation (including situations involving inadequate price competition and sole source procurements where a price analysis may be used in lieu of a cost analysis). When a cost analysis is necessary and there is inadequate price competition, the offeror shall certify that to the best of its knowledge and belief, the cost data are accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price. Awards or modifications negotiated in reliance on such data should provide the awarding agency a right to a price adjustment to exclude any significant sum by which the price was increased because the awardee had knowingly submitted data that were not accurate, complete, or current as certified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) JTPA procurements shall not permit excess program income (for nonprofit and governmental entities) or excess profit (for private for-profit entities). If profit or program income is included in the price, the awarding agency shall negotiate profit or program income as a separate element of the price for each procurement in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit or program income, consideration shall be given to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The complexity of the work to be performed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The risk borne by the awardee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The offeror's investment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The amount of subcontracting/subgranting;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The quality of the offeror's record of past performance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Market conditions in the surrounding geographical area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Each recipient and subrecipient may charge to the agreement only those costs which are consistent with the allowable cost provisions of &sect;627.435 of this part, including the guidelines issued by the Governor, as required at &sect;627.435(i) of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The cost plus a percentage of cost method shall not be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oversight <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) Each recipient and subrecipient shall conduct and document oversight to ensure compliance with the procurement standards, in accordance with the requirements of &sect;627.475 of this part, Oversight and monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each recipient and subrecipient shall maintain an administration system which ensures that vendors and subrecipients perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transactions between units of government <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, procurement transactions between units of State or local governments, or any other entities organized principally as the administrative entity for service delivery areas or substate areas, shall be conducted on a cost reimbursable basis. Cost plus type awards are not allowable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the case of procurement transactions with schools that are a part of these entities, such as State universities and secondary schools, when tuition charges or entrance fees are not more than the educational institution's catalogue price, necessary to receive specific training, charged to the general public to receive the same training, and for training of participants, the tuition and/ or entrance fee does not have to be broken out by items of cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Award provisions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Each recipient and subrecipient agreement shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Clearly specify deliverables and the basis for payment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the case of awards to subrecipients, contain clauses that provide for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

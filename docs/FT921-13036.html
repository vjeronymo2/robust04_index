			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Channel tunnel builders win right to halt work BRITISH and French contractors building the Channel tunnel were yesterday given permission by the British Court of Appeal to renew their threat to stop work on part of the Pounds 8bn project unless they are paid more money. Lord Justices Neill, Woolf and Staughton said they would not grant an injunction preventing the contractors from halting work on installing a cooling system in the twin rail tunnels. They also released the construction companies from a High Court undertaking not to halt work without giving 14 days' warning to Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator. Eurotunnel said last night it was considering seeking leave to appeal to the Lords. Transmanche, a consortium of five British and five French construction groups, issued its threat to stop work last October after a disagreement with Eurotunnel over who should pay for a huge increase in the cost of the project. Costs had risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to Pounds 8.05bn. The two sides are at present involved in negotiations to resolve the dispute. A stoppage is unlikely while talks continue. Members of the consortium have indicated that discussions have been going well, although a gap still exists between the two sides. Lord Staughton said an English court should not grant an interim injunction in a disagreement that all the parties had agreed ought to go to arbitration abroad. The Channel tunnel contract, which is subject to both British and French law, provides for disputes to be referred first to a panel of three independent experts and then to arbitration in Brussels. Any application for an injunction, therefore, should be made to Brussels, Lord Staughton said. Transmanche had told the court it was entitled to suspend work because of alleged breaches of contract by Eurotunnel in funding the installation of the cooling system. Lord Staughton said that if the contract had been subject simply to English law, that argument would have faced some difficulty.</p>

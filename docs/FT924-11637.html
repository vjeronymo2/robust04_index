			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Lower mortage rates filter through - Lenders are trying to entice first-time buyers Banks and building societies offered a flood of lower mortgage rates this week, the markets having finally digested last week's base rate cut. It followed the trickle from Abbey National and a few others last week. None matched the Bank of England's one percentage point cut. Most lowered rates by around 0.7 of a point. Since Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester already had one of the lowest standard variable rates on the market, its 0.7 point cut pushed its new rate down to 9.05 per cent, undercutting the competition. Norwich &amp; Peterborough lowered its rate to 9.2 per cent while lenders which cut rates to 9.25 per cent this week included National Westminster, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Chelsea, Confederation bank, First Direct, Midland, TSB, West Bromwich and Yorkshire building society. Most are with immediate effect for new borrowers and from December 1 for existing customers. Midland's rate is available from Monday for new borrowers and TSB is applying the new rate to all borrowers from December 1. Nationwide, Halifax, Barclays and Alliance &amp; Leicester lowered rates to 9.29 per cent immediately for new borrowers with existing customers having to wait until December 1. Lloyds Bank and Woolwich building society settled on a cut to 9.3 per cent, with Lloyds new rate available on November 30 for all borrowers and Woolwich's rate on offer immediately for new borrowers and December 1 for existing customers. Scarborough reduced its rate to 9.35 per cent. Most lenders are offering discounted rates to entice first-buyers. Those of particular note include Woolwich's rate of 6.95 per cent held for one year for new buyers on loans of over Pounds 60,000. There is no arrangement fee but the rate is only available on pension or endowment mortgages and buildings and contents insurance has to be taken out with the society. Barclays is offering a one-year capped rate of 6.99 per cent for new buyers with an arrangement fee of Pounds 250 and the obligation to take out a full-term life policy if the mortgage is on a repayment basis. National &amp; Provincial has a guaranteed rate until January 1 1995 of between 7.5 per cent and 7.99 per cent for new borrowers depending on the size of the loan. The arrangement fee is Pounds 150 and buildings and contents insurance has to be taken through N&amp;P. New fixed rate mortgages include 7.5 per cent for two years and 7.99 per cent for three years from Yorkshire building society, available on all types of mortgages. Borrowers will have to pay a Pounds 175 arrangement fee and take out the society's buildings and contents insurance. The early redemption penalty is three months interest within the fixed rate period. A fixed rate of 6.2 per cent on all types of mortgages of Pounds 60,000 and over is being offered by Norwich and Peterborough but the rate is only held until May 1 1993. There is a Pounds 95 fee and buildings insurance has to be taken out with the society. TSB has brought out a two-year mortgage capped at 7.5 per cent for two years, available on endowment loans with a Pounds 250 fee and two fixed rate mortgages - a three year rate fixed at 7.85 per cent and a five year fixed rate of 8.25 per cent, which can be taken out on both repayment and endowment mortgages. The fixed-rate loans carry an arrangement fee of Pounds 195. Halifax is also offering a longer term fixed rate mortgage of 8.25 per cent held until January 1 1997 on all types of mortgages with an arrangement fee of Pounds 250 and early redemption penalties. Chelsea's rate of 7.95 per cent fixed until December 31 1994 is not tied to the sale of insurance related products and is available on all types of mortgage. The arrangement fee is Pounds 195. The early redemption penalty is three months interest in the period of the fixed rate; otherwise it is one month. Northern Rock has brought out a two-year stepped fixed rate mortgage. The rate is pegged at 6.99 per cent until November 1 1993 and then at 7.99 per cent until January 1 1995. The arrangement fee is Pounds 150, buildings and contents insurance has to be taken out with the society and there is an early redemption penalty of three months' interest.

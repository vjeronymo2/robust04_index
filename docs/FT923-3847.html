			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Accountants look to managers to survive NEARLY half Britain's accountancy firms would like to employ a manager from business to help them survive the recession, according to a survey published yesterday. Most are concerned about cashflow and property and staff costs. They also expect profits to fall in the coming year. The analysis of 587 small and medium-sized accountancy firms (with up to 20 partners) was conducted by Inform Corporation, a London information technology consultancy. In spite of their role as business advisers to companies, 45 per cent of the firms said appointing an experienced business manager would make the biggest single contribution to resolving their own trading and development difficulties. The admission contrasts strongly with the traditional hold that qualified accountants have kept on management of their practices. The survey showed that 52 per cent of firms expected partners' pay - and thus profits - to fall in the coming year.</p>

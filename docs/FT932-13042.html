			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Turn gunmen into taxmen - EBRD THE COUNTRIES of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union should retrain military personnel and surplus civil servants as tax collectors, to strengthen fiscal reform in the former Communist states, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development says. In its latest quarterly economic review, the bank identifies tax administration and legislation as two areas where the former communist countries must make improvements in their efforts to build market-oriented economies. They 'need to get their tax structures right early on. Otherwise it will be difficult to tackle tax evasion later,' says Mr Mario Sarcinelli, EBRD vice president responsible for development banking. The EBRD says present tax systems are 'particularly unsatisfactory' in their treatment of corporate profits, with accounting rules often resulting in an excessive tax burden. The EBRD says the tax burden is excessive in many eastern and central European countries, and says the need to encourage entrepreneurship and capital accumulation in the new market economies argues for a low level of tax. Although the EBRD report gives clear advice on the need to improve the tax gathering system, it is less explicit about the need for lower state spending. This reflects a lively debate within the bank over the merits and demerits of sharp spending cuts in the former Communist states. While the EBRD says efforts should be made to reduce state spending and taxes in parallel, it also notes that countries in central and eastern Europe have large elderly populations and rapidly growing unemployment that create a need for big social transfers. Although cuts in social security and welfare payments might be achieved by a better targeting of benefits, it warns it would be difficult to reduce tax rates in the new market economies.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: SG Warburg launches Indo-China warrants SG Warburg has launched an issue of 'Indo-China' warrants on a basket of seven Asian stocks designed to give investors exposure to the expanding economy of Vietnam. All seven companies have a large investment in or substantial trade with Vietnam, although none are based there. The companies are Accor Asia Pacific, an Australian- based hotel management company; Singapore-based Asia Pacific Breweries, which has a brewery in Vietnam; Fraser &amp; Neave which, among other interests, runs the Coca-Cola franchise in Vietnam; Liang Court Holdings, a Singapore-based property company with several projects in Vietnam; Luks Industrial, the Hong Kong-listed company which has invested some Dollars 80m in projects in Vietnam, and Meiwa Trading, part of the Mitsubishi group. The warrants are structured in this way because Vietnamese stocks are not available to foreign investors. In addition, all the companies have a broad exposure to south-east Asia, so the warrants may perform well, even if the Vietnamese market does not live up to expectations.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Whisky exports increase by 12% SCOTCH whisky exports increased almost 12 per cent in value during the first half of the year to a record Pounds 870.7m. The world's thirst for Scotch raised overseas consumption during the six months by 6 per cent to 325m bottles - 20m bottles more than in the same period last year. Mr James Bruxner, chairman of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: 'At a time when recession is affecting many countries around the world, the sales increase is very encouraging.' Sales in the UK were less encouraging. The 12 months to the end of May showed a 9 per cent decrease. Exports to the rest of the European Community, however, rose 10 per cent during the January-June period to Pounds 344.2m and accounted for 40 per cent of total exports. Spain, where demand was boosted by visitors to Expo 92 and the Olympic Games, led the European growth. Exports in June were worth Pounds 23.5m, 188 per cent higher than in the same month last year. The half-year total showed an increase of 49 per cent to Pounds 89.9m. Sales to Greece rose 29 per cent during the six months to Pounds 36.3m; and France recorded a 15 per cent rise to Pounds 98m. The figures underlined the importance of EC markets for the industry, said Mr Bruxner. The threat of higher taxes on Scotch in southern Europe had been averted largely by the recent EC agreement on a minimum duty level of Pounds 1.10 a bottle. Mr Bruxner said the industry would continue to campaign against the discriminatory rate of taxation on whisky and other spirits compared with beer and wine. A review of the rates by the European Commission is to be completed by the end of 1994. Buoyant exports to South America also contributed to the first-half growth. Sales to Brazil were 87 per cent higher at Pounds 13.95m, while Venezuela recorded a 36 per cent increase to Pounds 20.2m. A surge in exports to the US during June, which may have been fuelled by fears of an increase in import tariffs, lifted the six-month total 10 per cent higher to Pounds 111m. Sales to Japan slowed, growing only 6 per cent to Pounds 87m. Over the past 12 months, Japan has been overtaken by Spain as the third-largest market for Scotch exports.</p>

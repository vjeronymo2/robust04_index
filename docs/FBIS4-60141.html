			<p>BFN     [Text] On the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha,  spiritual leaders delivered several sermons today. They  explained the significance of the 'Id and stressed the need for  unity and adherence to national principles.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan, deputy chairman of the Higher  Shiite Islamic Council and chief Ja'farite mufti, called for  national unity to confront conspiracies. He stressed the  importance of resistance as long as the Israeli occupation  continues. He said: The south and Western al-Biqa' continue to  be the chief concern, and suffering is growing as a result of  the Israeli acts of aggression, which burn the land, threaten  the infrastructure, and displace the people. This is a recording  of an excerpt from Mufti Qabalan's speech:    [Begin recording] What kind of solutions does Israel want?  It wants us to surrender. It is asking us for the Israeli  corporal [navigator Ron Arad], so why do we not ask it for  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd? It is asking us for the corpses of  the Israeli soldiers, so why do we not ask it for our live  detainees in its prisons? It is demanding that we stop  resistance, so why do we not demand that it withdraw from the  south and Western al-Biqa'? Israel wants everything, and if it  wants to give something it does so through a dispenser, drop by  drop. Therefore, we tell the kin and brothers that we have to  demonstrate solidarity and deal with each other honestly,  sincerely, amicably, and respectfully. We tell them to avoid  hatred and tension. Israel does not differentiate between a  fighter and a non-fighter, between the inhabitants of the border  strip and the inhabitants of al-Biqa', or between northerners  and southerners. It views every Arab and Muslim as an enemy  that must be annihilated. [end recording]</p>

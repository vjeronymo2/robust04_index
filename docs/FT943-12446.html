			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Economics Notebook: Likelihood of SDR issue If anybody deserves a prize for persistence in global economic policy making, it is Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. For as long as anyone can remember, he has been popping up at international meetings to urge an issue of special drawing rights, the IMF's own reserve asset. He has prosecuted his campaign with a passion that contrasts starkly with the apparent dryness of the subject. Now after many set-backs, Mr Camdessus' hopes are high that he will win the backing of the Fund's 179 members for an SDR issue at the IMF's annual meeting in Madrid in early October. If he does, it will not be without a fight. For there is one institution that cares as much as Mr Camdessus about the SDR. So far, the Bundesbank has been implacable in its opposition to a general allocation of SDRs to all IMF members to boost the world's monetary reserves. But most of the Group of Seven large industrial countries now seem inclined to give Mr Camdessus at least part of what he wants and will work for a compromise in Madrid. In so doing, they will signal that the IMF should stay in the business of providing financial support to countries with long-term economic problems rather than focus on stability in the international monetary system and short-term assistance to economies in difficulty, as recommended by the recent report of the Bretton Woods Commission. The special drawing right, or SDR, is a prime example of the IMF's talent for cloaking its activities and achievements in bland phrases and obscure acronyms. It sounds boring: an artificial 'basket' currency, at present composed of the dollar, D-Mark, yen, French franc and sterling and worth about Dollars 1.46. Yet when IMF members agree an SDR allocation they give the Fund the power to create its own money. IMF members agreed to establish SDRs in the late 1960s after years of growing concern over a potential shortage of international liquidity and fears that this would stifle global economic growth. SDRs were initially issued to all IMF members in 1970 according to the size of their holdings in the Fund. By 1972 they accounted for 8.4 per cent of world non-gold reserves. But early hopes that the SDR might supplant the dollar at the centre of the world monetary system have faded. The last SDR issue was in 1981 and, as the chart shows, its importance as a reserve asset has declined since. The reluctance of IMF members to allow new SDRs has reflected the great changes in the global economy since the early 1970s. Instead of dealing with a liquidity shortage, policy makers soon had to contend with excess liquidity caused by inflationary US financing of the Vietnam War. Global capital markets have been liberalised over the past two decades making it possible for most countries to supplement their reserves by borrowing. Nor does global liquidity seem to be lacking at present. Many monetary officials argue that the dollar's recent weakness has been a symptom of excess liquidity rather than shortage. But while the monetary case for an SDR allocation seems feeble, the political reasons have strengthened. Communism has collapsed and the Cold War has ended since the last SDR allocation in 1981. IMF membership increased rapidly as former Soviet satellites and republics joined the Fund, leaving nearly 40 IMF members without SDRs and raising a question of equity. Against this background, Mr Camdessus has been campaigning for an allocation of SDR36bn (about Dollars 52.5bn) to all Fund members. This, he says, would help newcomers such as Russia and other former communist states, many of which are starved of reserves. New SDRs would not be inflationary in today's economic environment, he says. Unfortunately, a general SDR increase would benefit wealthy industrialised countries more than the disadvantaged. However, it would be easier to agree than a selective SDR increase that would require a change in IMF rules and the support of 85 per cent of the membership. So far the US and other G7 countries have rejected his arguments. But the prospect of helping Russia at no cost to itself has proven too tempting for the US Treasury. At the recent Naples G7 summit, aides of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, were touting the idea of a selective increase of SDR4.5bn to satisfy the newcomers' desire for finance and salve the industrial powers' conscience about unfair treatment. However, no-one expects the long-standing developing country members of the IMF to allow the newcomers to boost their reserves without obtaining something for themselves. Almost certainly, there would have to be a general SDR increase to win the necessary 85 per cent support for a selective SDR increase. Last week, Mr Bentsen admitted that a general SDR increase was discussed in Naples. The way seems open for a compromise that would include a small selective SDR allocation for new IMF members, a rather larger general issue and, perhaps, increased access for countries in trouble to IMF resources that are subject to economic policy conditions. Mr Camdessus would then be able to enjoy a triumph in Madrid and declare that the IMF has received a ringing endorsement from members in the 50th anniversary year of the Bretton Woods agreement that created it. The risk is that he will have established a precedent for unnecessary liquidity expansion, weakening the IMF's counter inflationary credentials.</p>

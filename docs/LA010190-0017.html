			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> The Bride Wore Black: Jeff Clayton, 26-year-old lead singer with the punk rock  band Anti-Seen, exchanged wedding vows Saturday with 20-year-old Dee Dazis in a  Charlotte, N.C., nightclub.  </P> <P> The bride wore black, as did almost all the guests. The best man was a woman  and the flower girl was a grown man. Clayton and his bride promised "to love  and obey, to have and to hold, to rock 'n' roll until death do us part." As  soon as the vows were pronounced, Clayton left his bride at the bar and  performed songs from Anti-Seen's latest album, "Noise for the Sake of Noise."  Observed one guest: "Rock 'n' roll is, like, forever." SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

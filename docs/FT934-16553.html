			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Elderly cheer Clinton health reforms PRESIDENT Bill Clinton won applause yesterday for his healthcare reform plan from one of the US's most potent lobbying groups: the elderly. Mr Clinton was repeatedly cheered as he promised a meeting of the American Association of Retired Persons in Culver City, California, that his proposed reforms would preserve and make better the existing Medicare system under which the government provides health coverage to the elderly. 'There's one thing I want to say over and over again to the AARP membership of this nation, and that is that our plan maintains the Medicare programme,' Mr Clinton said. The president also won warm applause for two elements of the plan which have been crucial in winning the support of the AARP: the inclusion of the cost of prescription drugs in Medicare coverage, and an expansion of coverage for long-term care. The long-term care benefit, which is intended to allow elderly people to receive nursing care at home, would be phased in between the years 1996 and 2000, Mr Clinton said. 'We're not going to be able to do all of this at once. We have to work in the system and make sure we have the funding before we undertake programmes we can't pay for,' he cautioned.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Rouble falls against dollar The rouble fell sharply against the dollar yesterday on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange with the change in the chairmanship of the Russian central bank being blamed by the Itar-Tass news agency, Reuter reports from Moscow. The currency fell to 151.1 to the dollar from 135.4 roubles the previous week, Tass said. Tass said the fall was due to the naming of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, former head of the defunct Soviet Gosbank, as Russia's central bank head. Mr Gerashchenko has said money spent defending the rouble could have been better used elsewhere.</p>

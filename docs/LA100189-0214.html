			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAVA SPEWS FROM NEW ETNA CRATER  </P> <P> Fountains of lava spewed Saturday from a new crater on Mt. Etna and sent a  red-hot river of lava flowing down the eastern slope of Europe's most active  volcano.  </P> <P> Scientists said the lava gushed from a 500-foot crater that opened 8,500 feet  up the mountain after a series of tremors on Thursday.  </P> <P> News reports said the river of lava was 15 yards wide and had snaked down to  the 4,500-foot level, still oozing forward at about 10 yards an hour.  </P> <P> Mt. Etna began its latest eruption on Sept. 11.  </P></p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: Comic with rage beyond the laughs - Television Unless today's programme is utterly different from the first nine in the series, Channel 4 will screen the funniest and sharpest programme of the week at 10.05 tonight: Rory Bremner - Who Else? It has not been possible to watch a preview tape because the programme was still being put together last night, topicality being an important element. But a flop at this stage would be astonishing. Between them, Bremner and his producers Geoff Atkinson and Elaine Morris and, very importantly, John Bird and John Fortune, have now developed a formula and a tone of voice which induces not only laughter but cheering. For too long in those few television comedy programmes where topicality plays a part, it has been fashionable to be flippant; to give the impression that, while you understand everything that means anything in the world today  -the information superhighway, Take That, Michael Portillo - it is all really too, too boring and the sooner this awful layer of pancake is removed and the cheques dished out, the sooner we can all get back to the things that really matter . . . soap commercials, corporate videos, that sort of thing. Of course there have been laughs in Knowing Me Knowing You, Clive Anderson Talks Back and Have I Got News For You, even a few in Spitting Image, and a lot in Drop The Dead Donkey. But it is difficult to imagine anybody in any of those shows ever allowing honest-to-god anger, or even passionate enthusiasm, to show through the pose of ennui and knowingness. When a tub of lard was substituted for Roy Hattersley on Have I Got News For You it was certainly funny, but there was no feeling that anybody really wanted to offend poor old Roy. Sure enough they welcomed him onto the show a few weeks later. The loudest and longest laughs in Rory Bremner - Who Else? are prompted by Bremner's stand-up sessions at the start and, most of all, the end of the show when he delivers tour-de-force medleys of impressions. Last week he segued through Victor Meldrew, Lloyd Grossman, Clive Anderson, Ronnie Corbett, Barry Norman, Ian Paisley, Prince Philip, Lynne Faulds Wood and Anne Robinson to Peter O'Sullevan - I may have missed one or two. The talent of impressionists is currently out of fashion for some reason, but Bremner has two strengths that put him above fashion: first, all his characters are instantly recognisable and, second, he delivers good jokes. Sometimes his own sketches are political, the government being his target more often than not, which is proper enough since it is the government which enacts legislation and affects our lives. Evidence suggests that Bremner's personal beliefs lean left, so it is hardly surprising that in this series he has developed a gormlessly grinning Tony Blair who avoids ever saying anything definite, and a fine line in ridicule for the entire shadow cabinet. They were recently shown smiling, drinking, and sailing to the tune 'Busy Doing Nothing'. The significant point is that there is frequently a sense of anger, even fury, behind the political content of the programme (which means much of it) the greatest scorn often occurring in the material delivered by guest performers. Sheila Hancock proclaimed a scathing revision of Margaret Thatcher's quote from the prayer of St Francis: 'Where there is hatred let me sow division; where there is injury, a reduced disability allowance . . . where there is darkness let there be VAT on fuel; where there is sadness, a telethon . . .' There is nothing flippant about that, nor about the dialogues of the two Johns which have become such a powerful element in the show. The fictional interviews with politicians, civil servants, and especially chairmen of privatised industries provide some of the funniest moments of the week: the important difference between the chief executives of BT and the Post Office? 'Well his basic salary is Pounds 663,000 and mine is only Pounds 150,000. Have you ever tried to live on Pounds 150,000 a year? Next door to impossible'. Beyond the laughs there is unmistakable rage at the way we continue to allow greed and sleaze to flourish alongside pain and poverty. This series stands head, shoulders, and torso above the other topical comedy programmes.</p>

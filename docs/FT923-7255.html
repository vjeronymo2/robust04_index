			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Observer: Sinking market If confirmation were needed that the bottom has fallen out of the market for ex-tycoons' luxury yachts, then the sad saga of Aristotle Onassis's old flagship, Christina, is the final word. Only two buyers turned up at yesterday's auction and neither was prepared to match the Dollars 4.2m starting price. The Christina is nearly twice as long as the late Robert Maxwell's Lady Ghislaine, and has been used by everyone from Marlon Brando and Sir Winston Churchill, to Maria Callas, Jackie Kennedy and members of the British royal family. It is very much a luxury item. Named after Onassis' late daughter, the yacht was given to the Greek government in 1978 in the hope that it might serve as a presidential yacht. However, the authorities could not afford the Dollars 1.5m a year maintenance bills. When it was first put up for sale at the end of 1990, the sellers were looking for Dollars 15m. Now the price is to be reduced again. Pity that Peter Clowes is out of circulation. The price is getting down towards the Dollars 2.5m he paid for Boukephalis, one of Christina Onassis's other old yachts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "They Waited Until the </F> Russian Bear Awoke"]    [Text] "Since you are so smart, where is your money?"  Kurt Vonnegut, "Slaughterhouse Five, or The Children's  Crusade"    A cool front has blown in from the West. That is, it is not  so much that there has been a bone-chilling draft, but the cold  spell has dragged on for quite some time. Calls for a freezing  of aid to Russia--for 60 days--such being, evidently, the  initial auction price of the damage done to America's security  by the Ames spies--have been heard in the U.S. Congress from  Republicans and Democrats alike. The White House is giving  assurances as yet that it will resist in every possible way a  winding down of assistance to Russia. But judging by the fact  that the row in connection with this business is becoming louder  by the hour--despite Moscow's more than limp response,  Washington is working the bellows with enviable persistence--the  bargaining will continue.    Not only the Americans, but other Western "auction  attendees"  would like to take part in it, most likely, also. And accord  here is the sure way to success. Bill Clinton was recently paid  a call by John Major, who attempted with might and main to  reassure the president. He even spent a night at the White House  (which, prior to him, had not been the case with any foreign  visitor). The prime minister and the president agreed that the  intelligence services of Britain and the United States would  cooperate (as has not been the case since the times of World War  II) to nullify the damage from the "Ames case." What its final  price will be, Russia will soon find out--Moscow will resume  negotiations with the West after the government reshuffle, which  has finally been completed. New consultations with the European  Union on a partnership agreement, casuistical procedures for  Russia's affiliation to the GATT, and the completion of  negotiations with the IMF and creditors are in the offing. Some  visible outlines of the relations with the potential "auction  attendees" will be manifested tomorrow, even--on the completion  of the meeting of the finance ministers of the Seven. They will  now be dealing with a somewhat different Russia, for that  matter. The term "great power," which had been farmed out to  historians, is being enshrined officially in the Russian  political vocabulary, evidently--to judge by Boris Yeltsin's  report to parliament, at least. And the West's delay in  expressing some in any way definite response to it may be seen  as a timeout for reflection. But some UN wits have already let  fall: "The Russian bear has awoken." Not original, of course,  but it is, in fact, impossible to sleep permanently.    Just some six months ago, relations between Russia and the  West seemed all but idyllic. And pure, as in any idyll, that is,  clouded by virtually no mercantilism. The partners were true to  one another: They promised us assistance, we, them, a constant  intensification of the reforms. And what promises these were!  Moscow literally became muddled over these billions--now $24  billion, now $43.4 billion. The West, on the other hand, was  exultant at the prospects of so-called "shock therapy," which,  as has now transpired, has simply not occurred.    And all would have gone splendidly had it not been for  Russia's Higher Destiny--the October crisis had once again shown  the world "how not to live." According to the observations of  certain Russian participants in the negotiations, embarrassment  flickered in the eyes of their Western colleagues even then: How  can this happen--firing from tanks at the parliament building.  But the tension--at the level of the former promises, at  least--was lifted: Moscow even managed to "squeeze through"  preliminary arrangements with the European Union, which were  greatly to its advantage. The situation was complicated somewhat  by the subsequent mass foray of Russia's ministers among the  ranks of members of parliament, which fairly set them at odds.  This dirty Russian linen was quite often washed before Western  eyes, which did little to strengthen the positions of Moscow  officialdom there. And as a result of the enervating process of  formation of the new cabinet, which culminated in the departure  from it of persons sympathetic to the West, a pregnant pause  arose in the East-West dialogue. Russia's neighbors hastened to  fill it--in the wake of the former Warsaw Pact allies, the  Baltic countries and fraternal Ukraine got in line for NATO  admittance, and no less fraternal Kazakhstan expressed a  preference for the United States when it came to use of the  Baykonur Cosmodrome--symbol of the sovereign pride of the USSR.    The change in the Western participants' attitude toward the  negotiations with Russia could until recently have been judged  only by individual nuances. The London Club of creditor-banks,  which had consented at the end of last year to all of Moscow's  conditions, for example, recently notified its Russian  colleagues that it would insist on its former  demands--renunciation of "sovereign immunity," which is  disadvantageous to Russia. In the event of its violating the  payments' format, this threatened pretrial investigations and  the attachment of all assets of Russia and the Central Bank. The  Paris Club, on the other hand, has confined itself thus far  merely to a hint of a possible tightening of the rules of the  game. Reefs show through in its offer to extend the agreement  with Russia for 1993 a further four months: Moscow would have to  pay for the restructuring of the debt not 40 percent, as  earlier, but all 100 percent. The negotiations with the European  Union are clearly being dragged out also--to flashing smiles and  toasts to partnership. Although in the course of the November  Russian-European summit Boris Yeltsin and Jacques Delors  affirmed that all obstacles to the signing of a broad-based  agreement on partnership had been removed and that it remained  merely to work out purely technical trifles, pronounced progress  in the working-out process is not in sight as yet--and the  mutual hope of initialing an agreement "in the very near future"  had been expressed at the summit. Nor are things any better with  the GATT, the desire to join which Russia officially stated in  July 1993, obtaining at that time the warmest assurances from  the head thereof, Peter Sutherland, that all the procedures  connected with this would be completed by the end of the year,  just about. The same Mr. Sutherland, who recently no less warmly  greeted Russian minister Oleg Davydov (see the material on page  3), is still promising a speed-up in the same fashion.    The essence of the change, which had only just become  apparent, was summed up by FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the  process of preparation of the meeting of ministers of finance of  the Seven, which opened today in Frankfurt, Herr Kohl observed  while the debate on the subject of whether to invite  representatives of Russia was still under way that it would be  far better to draw a demarcation line between the political and  economic spheres of cooperation with Russia. That is, as a  political partner (as long as there is the infamous nuclear  button), Moscow could perfectly well become the "eighth," but in  the economic plane it would have to rest content with the role  of "manservant."    Not forcing as yet the development of economic topics, it  was  on the political front that Moscow dealt the West a powerful  diplomatic blow--right in the "soft underbelly of  Europe"--Bosnia--forcing the world to recall that it was the  Balkan question that in the 19th century had raised Russia  without any of your tedious economics to the level of Great  Power. And judging by the fact that Boris Yeltsin's proposal  concerning the convening of a summit on the Bosnia issue has yet  to meet with a response in a single Western capital, the  irritation with "upstart Russia" can no longer be concealed  there. How are we not to surmise here that the United States  timed the premiere of the drama of the Ames spy couple, which  according to certain information had been rehearsed in  Washington for several months (and Clinton knew about  everything), to coincide with the moment when it was necessary  to apply the "brakes" to Moscow in earnest. There have been many  rows between the special services of Russia and the United  States--they are commonplace--but they have assumed a political  nature when the parties have categorically wanted to play a  dirty trick on each other manifestly unrelated to the field of  espionage. At this time, on the eve of a new round of  negotiations on questions of assistance to the Russian reforms,  the United States evidently deemed it convenient to "correct"  the Russian image somewhat. And, as a matter of fact: The West  is striving with might and main to render Moscow assistance, but  it is paying spies and, yes, murderers (they have betrayed CIA  agents, who in Russia are usually executed) and traitors. Quite  an idea. It is put thus far at the $2.5 billion promised Russia  this year by the United States. Who else is there? What is  striking at first glance is the dissonance of the speeches on  both sides of the ocean. With us everyone, to a man, is saying  that there is nothing so bad about this--we have spied, we are  spying now, and we will continue to spy. But Clinton pouted,  hinting that his grievance was sincere--there had been hints  given to him of something or other in Moscow in January, but  they had not kept their word.    The bear generally is, as we all know, a phlegmatic  creature,  albeit powerful. It does not react to trifling matters.  Specifically, the CIA delegation that came to Moscow, although  having attempted to discuss the subject of espionage at the  highest level, has received no response as yet. This response  may, evidently, be read between the lines of Boris Yeltsin's  report to parliament. It is, meanwhile, being read.</p>

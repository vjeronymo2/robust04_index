			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dragoljub Stankic] </F>   [Text] At a regular news conference of the Democratic Party  of Serbia, party leader Vojislav Kostunica spoke about the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dragoljub Stankic reports:    [Stankic] It is positive that the truce is being observed,  but many issues remain open, Vojislav Kostunica said. The  acceptance of the proposed delineation and the 51-49 percent  division is connected with other formulas, above all the quality  of the territory that is being offered. According to Kostunica,  the issue of the Serbian access to the sea, the width of the  so-called corridor through the Sava basin region, the gray  zones, and so forth are still contentious.    Kostunica said that despite all this there are many reasons  for optimism while waiting for the final denouement. If the  future of the Muslim-Croatian federation is seen in a joint  state with Croatia, then, Kostunica said, many contentious  issues on the Serbian side will be solved much faster if the  Srpska republic and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia become  one state.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Labour attacks Major's 'corrupt' No 10 dinners Labour last night accused Mr John Major of misusing Downing Street to raise money for the Conservative party after the prime minister hosted the fourth in a series of private dinners for leading businessmen. Mr Nigel Griffiths, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, called the dinners 'an old-fashioned, corrupt shake-down where desperate and tainted politicians wine and dine businessmen and induce them to make large contributions, often in secret.' A senior government official said the prime minister had 'made very clear that he does not use Number 10 for fundraising purposes'. But Conservative Central Office confirmed that Thursday night's dinner was 'a private event' paid for by the party. Officials refused to release the guest list for the dinner, which is part of a confidential series intended to help reduce the party's overdraft. It is known that about 20 senior executives were invited from the banking, manufacturing and service industries. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of the British Midland airline group, said the prime minister gave a 'bravura performance' as he discussed the 'upbeat' business outlook. Other guests included Lord Rothschild, chairman of St James's Place Capital, the financial group; Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer; and Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of furniture retailer MFI. Guests contacted by the FT said there was no discussion of fundraising during the evening. 'It was a private meeting. No one mentioned money,' said Mr David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers, the investment bank. Senior officials have confirmed that there is never any direct discussion of contributions. The dinners are billed as an opportunity for guests to put their views directly to the prime minister. Guests would be contacted later by party treasurers.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH WOMEN AGAIN ARE BEST IN BIG WEST, 91-77  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach clinched the Big West Conference women's basketball  championship Monday night. Again. They beat Nevada Las Vegas. Again.  </P> <P> A sellout crowd of 2,001 in the University Gym cheered wildly as the 49ers  wrapped up the title with a 91-77 victory.  </P> <P> The 49ers (22-4 overall, 15-0 in the Big West) have dominated the conference  since they joined it, which has made them few fans among their competitors.  Least friendly is UNLV.  </P> <P> "You could say they are our toughest rivalry," Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini  said.  </P> <P> Some rivals: Long Beach is 16-1 in its series against Las Vegas.  </P> <P> It is the fourth consecutive conference championship for Long Beach. The 49ers  have lost only one conference game since joining the conference in 1985.  </P> <P> Las Vegas (20-5, 10-5) allowed the game to get out of control in the first  half, when Long Beach led by as many as 28 points. With its fast break fed by  Rebel turnovers -- they committed 49 in the game -- the 49ers turned up the  tempo.  </P> <P> "They are like a train," Las Vegas assistant coach Rick Glenn said. "You can't  stop 'em."  </P> <P> Traci Waites scored 21 of her 29 points in the first half for Long Beach,  making four of six shots from three-point range.  </P> <P> "Traci Waites was on fire," Bonvicini said. "I don't know if I've seen her  shoot like that in a long time."  </P> <P> Certainly not the last time Long Beach played UNLV, when Waites severely  sprained her right ankle and had to be carried off the floor.  </P> <P> "I'm just blessed that I can still be playing after that injury," Waites said.  </P> <P> The Rebels lead the nation in rebounding and crushed Long Beach in the game at  Las Vegas. Tuesday night the roles were reversed as the 49ers outrebounded the  Rebels, 49-40.  </P> <P> "It may not have shown up in the stats, by Cheryl Dowell really helped us,  especially in the first half," Bonvicini said.  </P> <P> Dowell was assigned to Pauline Jordan, UNLV's leading rebounder with 13.5 per  game, who had 6 points and 7 rebounds at halftime.  </P> <P> Long Beach led, 52-24, at the half. The Rebels whittled down the lead as Jordan  had 21 points and 8 rebounds in the second half, but Las Vegas could come no  closer than the 14-point margin at the end.  </P></p>

"Our purpose in  sending the (announcement) out is to notify people that these letters are  stolen," Rothstein said. "We're saying, 'yes it is for real, and yes they are  stolen, and if somebody decides to publish them, then down the road they'll  have to deal with the repercussions.' " Barr's public relations firm had  received inquiries from several publishers who had been contacted by someone  who was offering to sell the letters. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

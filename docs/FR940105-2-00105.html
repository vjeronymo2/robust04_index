			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contrary to the above, on January 21, 1993, the authorized user physician failed to follow the quality management program in that during a brachytherapy patient treatment with a high dose rate remote afterloader, the treatment site was not confirmed by the authorized user physician, causing the patient to receive 700 rads to the rectum, instead of the vagina, as prescribed in the written directive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These violations are classified in the aggregate as a Severity Level III problem (Supplement VI). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=3 --> Civil Penalty_$7,500 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of Licensee Response to Violations in Section II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its response, the Licensee denies that it violated the requirement to establish and maintain a written QMP, noting that it established a written QMP based upon the NRC's own guidance published in Regulatory Guide 8.33 on January 27, 1992, and as required by 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4). The Licensee further states that the written quality management policy and procedures were distributed to all authorized users for comment on January 21, 1992, and no comments were received from the authorized users on this final version, and the same version was presented to NRC Region I in a letter dated January 27, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Licensee also notes that in addition to giving each authorized user a copy of the written quality management policy and procedures, the radiation safety officer conducted formal training for the members of the radiation therapy staff on March 5, 1992, detailing the requirements of the QMP, and both physicians involved in the alleged violations attended this presentation. The Licensee further states that both physicians understood that the written directive needed to be verified during the application process. Nonetheless, despite the existence of a comprehensive QMP and related training, these events occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the first incident, the Licensee also states that the resident physician followed the established procedures and, therefore, reasonably concluded that he had successfully placed the sources in the applicator during the loading process, and he and the dosimetrist identified the correct sources as they were moved from the transportation shield. The Licensee stated that in the process of moving one of the four sources and its applicator to the patient, the source inadvertently slipped unnoticed from the applicator, and that since the resident missed the source in its fall under the patient, he had no opportunity to identify the error once the applicator was placed into the Fletcher Suit Device (FSD). Since the resident wholly believed he had fulfilled the written directive, the Licensee submits that he had satisfied the requirements of the QMP regardless of his error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the second incident involving the High Dose Rate Afterloading (HDR) device, the Licensee states that the physician who prepared the written directive was the same physician who placed the applicator in error. Since he was the prescribing physician, the Licensee contends that there is no doubt that he understood the intent of the written directive. The Licensee states that while the physician did not visually confirm or verify the placement, he fully believed that he had correctly placed the applicator, based on his sense of touch during the physical examination, knowledge of anatomy, the feel and depth of the applicator insertion, and by asking the patient if she felt comfortable after the placement. Since the physician fully believed that he had carried out the written directive, the Licensee submits that it had fulfilled the requirements of the QMP notwithstanding his error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Evaluation of Licensee Response to Violations in Section II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC does not dispute, in general, that the Licensee established and maintained a QMP, or that it provided training to authorized users. However, with respect to the first incident, the NRC maintains that the Licensee's QMP did not include written policies and procedures to provide high confidence that the QMP would meet the objective that each brachytherapy administration is in accordance with the written directive. 10 CFR 35.32(a) requires, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain these written policies and procedures to provide high confidence that the radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized user. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Licensee to establish written procedures that provide high confidence in the delivery process of therapeutic radiation and the accurate administration of the prescribed dose. In this case, the Licensee did not establish adequate written procedures, as required, to effectively implement their QMP and procedures to verify whether brachytherapy sources were properly inserted in accordance with the written directive. In particular, the QMP was inadequate in that it did not require visual or other verification of proper insertion of the sources while they were being inserted. The Licensee stated that it established a QMP based on requirements in 10 CFR 35.32. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4) requires that each administration be in accordance with the written directive. The licensee's QMP did require that a means be employed of verifying sources are positioned properly. However, the licensee had not established such a procedure to meet this objective by directing the physician to verify proper insertion of the source or sources (e.g., by visual inspection). In this instance, visual verification of the sources in the applicator would have been an acceptable means. The QMP did not have any procedure to ensure, nor did the physician confirm, that the administration of the dose was in accordance with the written directive. Therefore, the QMP did not provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material would be administered as directed pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the second incident, although the authorized user fully understood the intent of the written directive, the individual did not confirm or verify the proper placement of the applicator, which had not been placed into the correct organ, with the treatment site specified in the written directive and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  treatment plan. The Licensee stated that it established a QMP based on requirements in 10 CFR 35.32. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4) requires that each administration be in accordance with the written directive but did not describe how this should be done. The licensee's QMP did require the treatment site be confirmed with the written directive. Visual verification of the source insertion into the proper organ would have been an acceptable means. As in violation IIA, the QMP appears inadequate in that it did not require visual or another specific procedure for verification of proper insertion of the sources while they were being inserted. The QMP did not have any specific procedure to ensure, nor did the physician confirm, that the administration of the dose was in accordance with the written directive. Therefore, the QMP did not provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material would be administered as directed pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC realizes that confirmation of a treatment site by the Licensee may be accomplished in a number of ways. However, it is the responsibility of the Licensee to establish effective procedures to meet the performance-based objective of the QMP required by 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4), and provide high confidence that the intended therapeutic radiation is administered to the designated treatment site as prescribed by the physician authorized user. In this case, simple visual confirmation could have prevented the error and would have provided higher confidence than the physician's method of feeling to locate the treatment site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

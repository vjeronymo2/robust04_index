			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Cash call at Australian mining group PANCONTINENTAL Mining, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a one-for-three rights issue to raise ADollars 42m (USDollars 31.80). The issue is intended to finance exploration and strengthen the company's balance sheet by retiring debt. Mr Lindsay MacAlister, managing director, said Pancontinental wanted to strengthen its overall position before deciding whether to increase capacity at its Kunwarara magnesite operation in Queensland. The proposed expansion would increase capacity for deadburn magnesia to 150,000 tonnes a year from 100,000, and boost production of electrofused magnesia to 25,000 tonnes from 15,000. Mr MacAlister said Pancontinental would require ADollars 20m over three years for increased exploration and evaluation of mineral prospects and a further ADollars 20m to optimise capacity at the mines and associated facilities. Pancontinental said it would concentrate expenditure on the Paddington/Kundana gold mines in Western Australia, the Thalanga base metals operation in Queensland, and the tantalum mine at Wodgina in Western Australia. The company said about 55.52m shares would be issued with acceptances closing on July 3.</p>

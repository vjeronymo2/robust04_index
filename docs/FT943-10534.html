			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Rival may join funeral bid battle Great Southern Group, the UK funeral company under siege from Service Corporation International, of the US, is talking to a potential white knight  -understood to be one of SCI's US rivals. Great Southern's share price rose 28p to 708p after it revealed the discussions. Analysts said a new offer would have to exceed 700p, compared with SCI's increased bid of 680p. The potential counter-bidder is one of SCI's two largest competitors in the US, Vancouver-based Loewen Group and New Orleans-based Stewart Enterprises, according to sources close to Great Southern. Both are US listed and have mirrored SCI's acquisitive trail, with Loewen spending Dollars 165m on purchases last year and Stewart investing close to Dollars 100m. The latest turn in the battle is a blow to SCI, which yesterday increased its stake in Great Southern to 30 per cent of the fully diluted share capital (upon conversion of the preference shares). But SCI is not permitted to buy at above 680p. In addition, it has been unable to achieve any serious dialogue with JD Field &amp; Sons, the private company which controls 56 per cent of Great Southern's ordinary shares. Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI president, said: 'If there is any real substance around this statement, then clearly the Field family have decided to sell. But, as we own 30 per cent of the stock, what sort of credence can be placed on the offeror.' Given Great Southern's move to attract a counter bidder, the announcement appears to herald the end of the Field family's 300-year history of running an independent funeral group. SCI has the right to increase its final offer.</p>

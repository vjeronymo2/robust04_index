This was stated at the work meeting of Shanghai overseas  enterprises, which ended here yesterday.    As the representative of Shanghai municipal government for  overseas investment and headquarters of all Shanghai's  enterprises and companies in foreign countries, the Shanghai  Overseas Company has decide to center its efforts on  establishment of more overseas group companies this year.    By now, more than 420 enterprises belonging to Shanghai's  Foreign Trade, Industry, Agriculture and Science Departments  have been set up in 60-plus countries and regions of the world,  managing to increase exports and primarily form an overseas  marketing network.    To better organize these diverse enterprises and increase  their competitiveness in international markets, Shanghai  Overseas Company is now determined to shift them toward  multi-functional transnational group companies.    Apart from the existing five overseas group companies in  Oceania, America, CIS, Japan and Hong Kong, a new one will be  set up in Europe. Branches will also be added in Singapore, the  Republic of Korea, Africa and South-East Asia.    These group companies will carry out varied transnational  business through share-purchasing, share-holding, annexing and  joint management and marketing.    International standards will be adopted in the management of  these group companies and decision-making powers in many aspects  will be granted to the overseas companies themselves.    It is also expected that by taking advantage of existing  overseas marketing networks, specialized talents, management  experience and information on demand, the new group companies to  be established will stimulate exports and foreign trade of  domestic enterprises.    Shanghai Overseas Company also aims to establish a domestic  trade network based on the 9,000-plus foreign trade enterprises  in Shanghai to match its overseas network.</p>

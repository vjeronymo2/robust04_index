			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Prey to scandals they deserve: A spate of resignations and inquiries is rocking Germany's political establishment There seems to be no stopping the blood-letting in the German body politic. Another minister resigned yesterday, not a very important one, but still another scalp for the scandal-mongers. Ms Heidi Pfarr, the Social Democrat minister for women's affairs in the state government of Hesse, quit because she had claimed DM60,000 (Pounds 24,400) from the state coffers to pay for removal costs and redecoration of her home when she took up her post. Along with most of the other scandals plaguing the political establishment, it scarcely ranks as a serious crime. It is not even clear it was against the rules. But in the current supercharged atmosphere, it was enough of an embarrassment to force her resignation. Every leading political party has now been hit by similar scandals with resounding consequences. This week, Mr Max Streibl, the Bavarian premier from the conservative Christian Social Union, has agreed to step down before the end of the summer. He was accused of taking free holidays to Kenya and Brazil from a businessman friend. Last week Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister, was obliged to resign by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his party leader in the Christian Democratic Union. His misdeeds included claiming social security subsidies for employing a maid at his east German home. Two days before, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the respected leader of the opposition Social Democrats, stepped down after admitting that he misled a parliamentary inquiry in 1987. Ironically, the inquiry was into a dirty tricks campaign against him, but he lied about the moment when he first heard of it. The implication was that he was no longer the innocent victim, but rather a cynical politician who manipulated the media. It destroyed his reputation as a scrupulous Mr Clean. First to go this year, almost as the new year was ushered in, was Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister and candidate for leadership of the Free Democrats in the ruling coalition. He quit after denying, and then admitting, that he wrote a letter to the country's leading supermarket chains, promoting a plastic security device for supermarket trolleys manufactured by a cousin of his wife's. There are currently more than 20 parliamentary inquiries under way into political scandals. The mayor of Bremen is accused of getting his electricity at half price from the city power station. The premier of Hesse is charged with obtaining designer furniture for his official residence. The premier of the Saarland (the irrepressible Mr Oskar Lafontaine) is accused of consorting with members of the underworld. The rash of petty speculation seems scarcely explicable in a country with such a normally ponderous press. Nor does the apparent loss of nerve by the politicians, traditionally a thick-skinned bunch. As for the public, it responds by demonstrating an ever-declining respect for the political establishment. Just a year before Germany faces no fewer than 19 separate polls at local authority, state, federal and European level - not to mention the election of a new federal president - it is a disturbing state of affairs. There is a growing tendency of voters to stay at home - 39 per cent said they would not vote, in a recent opinion poll. Others are drifting to the fringes, represented by the Greens and the far-right-wing Republicans. And yet it is precisely that coincidence of elections which has been a contributory factor in the sudden spate of resignations. The parties are cleaning out their stables in a desperate effort to prepare themselves for the fray. That is not all. It is the very awareness of a growing contempt for the political establishment, known as Politikverdrossenheit, that has inspired the politicians to try to clean up their act. A further factor is the upsurge in media competition, particularly in the heavyweight field of political weekly magazines trying to muscle in on the market traditionally dominated by Der Spiegel. That is compounded by a rash of new television stations. All are seeking to outdo one another in political scoops. Finally, there is a fundamental problem which all the political parties face, of coming to terms with the transformed world both within Germany, and outside it. They have yet to adapt to the new post-unification Germany, facing fundamental structural problems as well as recession. They lack any coherent security policy to deal with the post-cold war external environment. The result is a sense of drift in the government and the opposition. When Mr Engholm addressed the press conference in Bonn at which he announced his resignation, he was asked if his move would not aggravate the current malaise. He said he hoped it would have the opposite effect. 'I hope most people will draw the conclusion that people in politics are ready to take responsibility for their actions.' Few outside observers believe him. He was one of the few respected men in the political leadership, and his departure certainly leaves his party in embarrassing disarray. The latest opinion polls, to be published today, will show Mr Kohl's CDU taking a narrow lead - in spite of the recession, strikes in east Germany, and the chancellor's low public standing. According to a close confidant of the former SPD leader, Mr Engholm quit for three reasons. First, he underestimated the determination of the press to expose his own political scandal, and also misjudged the importance of his own mistake. Second, he was made brutally aware of the lack of solidarity among his immediate colleagues in the SPD leadership. The third, and perhaps the most fundamental reason, was that he was daunted by the difficulty of making his fellow Social Democrats face up to the policy changes necessary to make them 'electable' in a unified Germany. He faced a tremendous battle to push through a compromise policy on controlling the flow of asylum seekers - the single most explosive issue in western Germany. He failed to win a second struggle to persuade the party to adopt a new policy allowing German troops to participate in international peace-keeping operations. He was depressed and exhausted by the effort. Mr Engholm felt betrayed by his party colleagues. As in the other resignations there was a strong suspicion that fellow party members had fuelled, and perhaps initiated, the scandals. Mr Mollemann was an embarrassment as a candidate for FDP party leader. He was a lightweight, and the party establishment had decided they wanted Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, instead. So Mr Mollemann had to go. Mr Streibl is in a similar position. With him as Bavarian premier, the CSU would be in serious danger of losing its absolute majority in next year's state elections. For a brief moment, Mr Theo Waigel, the easy-going federal finance minister in Bonn, thought he would replace him. It now looks far more likely that Mr Edmund Stoiber, the hard-line Bavarian interior minister, will step in instead. 'The Bavarians have had enough of nice guys, like Streibl and Waigel,' according to one close observer. 'They are looking for a tough guy more in the image of Franz-Josef Strauss to stand up to both Bonn and the Republicans.' Messrs Mollemann, Streibl and Krause were all an embarrassment to their parties. Getting rid of them may well help them in the polls. Mr Engholm was not a liability. He was a positive bonus for the SPD. Now the opposition faces a prolonged period of bickering over the leadership which is likely to leave it electorally lame. Whether the whole political establishment can recover quickly from the current period of contempt is also questionable. 'If people had the impression that the political establishment was dealing with the important problems in a competent manner, they would not pay attention to petty scandals,' according to Mr Matthias Jung, of the Wahlen opinion research institute. Or as one leading political correspondent put it: 'The quality of these scandals reflects the quality of German politics. The politicians get the scandals they deserve.'</p>

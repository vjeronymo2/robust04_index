			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Fears over inflation surface again in US US producer prices rose 0.6 per cent between March and April, reigniting fears that inflationary pressures are growing in the US economy in spite of sluggish growth of output and jobs, official figures indicated yesterday. The rise in wholesale prices - three times the consensus forecast on Wall Street - prompted a sharp retreat of bond prices as traders discounted lingering hopes that the Federal Reserve might respond to signs of flagging growth with another cut in short-term interest rates. An early tightening of monetary policy, however, remains highly improbable. A surge in vegetable prices following severe winter storms accounted for much of the increase in producer prices: the food price index rose 1.4 per cent between March and April. However, the 'core' producer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4 per cent last month, a larger increase than expected. Producer prices have risen more than expected for three months in a row. The increase relative to April last year was only 2.4 per cent but the annualised rate of increase for the last four months is 4.7 per cent against 1.6 per cent in all of last year. Consumer prices and various indices of commodity prices have also risen faster than expected, prompting sporadic concern about inflation trends in markets. Most economists believe recent price figures have been distorted. The relatively sluggish domestic US recovery coupled with weak labour markets and recession in many overseas markets is expected to keep inflationary pressures in check this year and next. However, the unexpectedly poor price figures have undermined the bond market rally earlier this year by hinting that consumer price increases of 3 per cent last year marked the low point of inflation in this business cycle. Hopes that inflation might continue to decline to about 2 per cent, justifying much lower long-term bond yields, have largely evaporated. With the inflation trend still uncertain, the markets are anxiously awaiting the release of consumer prices figures out today.</p>

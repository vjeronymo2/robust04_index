			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Herzogenaurach (DPA) -- Bavarian Minister President  Edmund Stoiber, Christian Social Union [CSU], once again called  for a "very strict delineation" toward right-wing radical and  right-wing extremist parties. When the leader of a right-wing  radical party says that he has been chosen by fate to save  Germany, this is "fascist thinking par excellence," Stoiber said  on Saturday [19 February] at an event organized by the Franken  association of the Young Union in Herzogenaurach. Republikaner  chief Franz Schoenhuber had made a statement to this effect at  his party's Ash Wednesday rally.    There was trouble in the CSU last week after it became known  that former Minister President Max Streibl had met Schoenhuber  in his private home last November. CSU Chairman Theo Waigel  said subsequently that the meeting had been a purely personal  conversation.    In Stoiber's view, there is currently "an enormous  challenge"  posed by right-wing extremism, which is slightly more dangerous  than left-wing extremism. The CSU must also be a party of the  democratic right, but not exclusively so: "The CSU must not be  small but noble."</p>

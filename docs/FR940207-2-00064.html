Users of the P&hyph;DP transmission system include customers for (1) P&hyph;DP wholesale firm energy, (2) P&hyph;DP firm transmission service, (3) firm transmission service for SLCA/IP, and (4) project use. Commitments under transmission service contracts are assigned to transmission while commitments under electric service contracts and project use are assigned to power production. Western believes this is an equitable way of allocating power and transmission costs among the customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Allowance for Interest in Western's Apportionment of Cost Study does not conform to Western's PRS. We understand that Western is aware of this discrepancy, and we recommend that the proper correction be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western has corrected the Allowance for Interest in the Apportionment of Cost Study so that it conforms to the PRS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Irrigation investment in the amount of $26.8 million has been assigned by Western to transmission, but should be assigned to power. The irrigation investment represents an assignment of certain hydraulic plants to irrigation and has no relationship to transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Apportionment of Cost Study uses Western's and Reclamation's FY 1992 financial statements, budget documents, and the Engineering Ten-Year Plan to determine the investments that are allocated to power and the investments that are allocated to transmission. Investments stated in Western's financial statement and Engineering Ten-Year Plan are considered transmission investments, and investments stated in Reclamation's financial statement and FY 1993 budget are considered power investments. Irrigation investment is in Reclamation's financial statement. Therefore, the irrigation investment in the amount of $26.8 million is already assigned to power in the Apportionment of Cost Study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An investment in FY 1990 of $3.4 million in account 331 (Hydraulic Production_Structures and Improvements) was assigned by Western to transmission, but should be assigned to power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The investment in FY 1990 of $3.4 million in account 331 (Hydraulic Production_Structures and Improvements) is shown in the P&hyph;DP replacement study. The P&hyph;DP replacement study incorporates both Western's and Reclamation's investments as stated in each of the agencies' financial statements. Western has made the assumption that investments appearing in Reclamation's financial statements would be allocated to power and investments appearing in Western's financial statements would be allocated to transmission. The replacement study was not used as a source document for the Apportionment of Cost Study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Existing and future investments in communication facilities have been assigned entirely to transmission. A more proper assignment would be 50 percent to transmission and 50 percent to power as is done by Western for the CRSP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western has researched the possibility of assigning communication equipment equally between power and transmission. Communication equipment includes supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), microwave system, and the joint use system. In the Phoenix area, Reclamation and Western separately budget for microwave systems and joint use systems. Western has determined that SCADA is a unique investment because it has major benefits to both power and transmission customers and it is being funded through Western's FY 1993 congressional budget. The SCADA system is, among other uses, used to regulate power flows on the transmission lines. Because SCADA benefits both power and transmission customers, Western has decided that 50 percent of the costs should be apportioned to power and 50 percent of the costs consistency should be apportioned to transmission. Therefore, the Apportionment of Cost Study has been changed to reflect the 50/50 split of the SCADA investment and associated interest expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western's new PAO has been assigned entirely to transmission. As this office is involved in both power marketing and transmission, the cost of these facilities should be borne by both power and transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This comment is incorrect in that the costs associated with the new PAO facility have been allocated to both power and transmission, with power being allocated approximately 16 percent of the costs of said facility. While this may not readily be apparent at first glance, analysis of the Apportionment of Cost Study will verify this allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Apportionment of Cost Study, Western first determines whether the expenditure was funded by Western or Reclamation. All expenditures funded by Reclamation are allocated to power. Expenditures by Western are further analyzed to determine if they benefit only the transmission customers or if they also benefit the power customers (from a powerplant or power generation standpoint). To the extent the facilities have a direct benefit to the power customers from a power generation standpoint, a portion of the costs are allocated to power. Western's SCADA system is an example of one of these facilities in that although the expenditure is funded totally by Western, both the power customers and transmission customers receive benefits from the system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council today  submitted two proposals to the Seventh Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, requesting  it to examine the draft PRC Law Governing the Management of  Urban Real Estate, and the draft supplementary regulations to  the PRC Regulations for Controlling and Punishing Public  Offenses.    In the proposal requesting the session to examine the draft  law governing the management of urban real estate, Premier Li  Peng said the objectives of this law are to improve the  management of urban real estate, maintain the real estate  market's order, protect the legitimate rights and interests of  real estate owners, and bring about a healthy development in the  real estate business.    In the motion requesting the session to examine the  supplementary regulations to the PRC Regulations for Controlling  and Punishing Public Offenses, Li Peng says that, since their  promulgation on 1 January 1987, the regulations have played an  important role in maintaining public order and safeguarding  social stability. However, because of the changes in public  order and the appearance of certain new situations and problems,  the regulations should be supplemented.    Premier Li Peng added that the State Council's executive  meetings have discussed and adopted the two drafts.    At this morning's session, Vice Construction Minister Ye  Rutang and Public Security Minister Tao Siju respectively  explained these two drafts at the State Council's request.    Ye Rutang said: The real estate business is a basic business  preceding economic development, and it is one of the national  economy's pillar industries. The real estate business'  development not only provides the basic material foundation and  precondition for economic development, but also can help improve  city dwellers' living conditions and create an important avenue  of financial resources for the state. Because of the important  role the real estate business plays in the national economic and  social development, it is objectively essential to regulate,  guide, promote, and protect it by law.    He said: China's real estate business has been developing  rapidly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, and especially since the systems governing the  compensatory use of state-owned urban land and the comprehensive  development and construction of real estate. In 1992 after  Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his important talks during his  inspection in southern China and after the 14th CPC Congress was  convened, both reform and construction have expedited, and  development of the real estate business entered a new stage.  Meanwhile, following the rapid development of the real estate  business, certain problems badly needing a solution have  appeared. The main problems are: loss of control in the total  supply of construction land and loss of the state's land  resources as a result of the craze in leasing land and building  development zones; irrational investment in real estate  development and excessive establishment of real estate  developing businesses; and unregulated trade, chaotic prices,  serious land and real estate speculation, and loss of incomes  from state-owned land as result of defective mechanisms  governing the real estate market. Fundamental solutions to  these problems lie in codifying real estate management.    On the guidelines for drawing up the law governing urban  real estate management, Ye Rutang said: 1) In accordance with  the decision made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, the law should provide that the state will  monopolize the primary market of urban land so as to prevent the  loss of land resources; and that mechanisms ensuring a normal  real estate market should be established so that real estate  development and trade can be managed more efficiently. 2)  Attention should be paid to establishing a basic system for  managing real estate, to coordinating the relationship between  this law and other relevant laws and administrative regulations,  and to reflecting the principle that the subjects [zhu ti 0031  7555] having the right to use state-owned land in cities and the  right to own the houses on the land should be the same [yi zhi  0001 5268]. 3) The law's scientific attributes and its  practicality should be integrated. On the basis of reviewing  the experiences and lessons gained and learned from recent  years' real estate development, we have codified the experiences  of success and measures that can be put into practice with some  efforts; deferred writing into the law those measures which are  unlikely to be carried out today and in the time to come; and  stipulated in principle those measures which conform to the  policy for reform and development, but which cannot be carried  out now owing to a lack of experience. In such a way we will  have room for change and these principles can be reinforced and  improved when conditions are ripe.    Ye Rutang also elaborated on what and where the law will  make  adjustments, land for real estate development, real estate  development businesses, regulation in the real estate market,  and real estate registration and licensing.    Tao Siju said in his explanation that the Regulations for  Controlling and Punishing Public Offenses have played an  important role in maintaining social security and order and  safeguarding social stability since they became effective.  However, he said, owing to changes in public security and the  appearance of certain new situations and problems, certain acts  that disturb social order, jeopardize public safety, and are  detrimental to public interests cannot be handled because the  regulations have no provisions for handling these acts. He  said: The draft supplementary regulations have prescribed 18  additional punishable public offenses. The types of these  offenses and the principles for punishing them are the same as  those in the original regulations. Punishing these offenses  which exist in real life and which jeopardize social security  are absolutely essential for intensifying control of public  order; for safeguarding social order, public safety, and public  interests; for protecting citizens' legitimate rights and  interests; and for safeguarding the progress of reform, opening  up, and socialist modernization.</p>

"The change in the U.S.  counternarcotics policy confirms that this policy did not yield  the expected results." Although "billions of dollars were  spent, nothing was attained," he said.    Fujimori made the remark in a news conference at the Narino  Presidential Palace at the end of a two-day official visit.  Fujimori said that, in view of the failure of the U.S.  counternarcotics policy, the governments of the coca-producing  countries, including Peru and Colombia, should outline joint  strategies and insist that consumption is the reason for the  persistence of drug trafficking.    According to Fujimori, "it is necessary to reassess" the  alleged reduction in drug use, a crime "that has distorted our  economies." He insisted that the problem "should be tackled by  everyone involved" and that "imaginative solutions" should be  sought. He said the war on drugs as it has been waged, "should  not continue this way without offering alternatives to coca  planters." He also said that his country cannot repress "200,000  poor coca planters" without offering them other ways out.    He pointed out that drug trafficking must be attacked by  "hitting the big ones, not the poor ones." He insisted that  drug trafficking could end "when there is economic development."    The end of drug trafficking, without setting any deadlines,  "does not depend on us, but on consumers," Fujimori concluded.</p>

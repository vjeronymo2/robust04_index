			<p>BFN     [Text] Aldomiro Vaz da Conceicao, spokesman for the  Presidency of the Republic, said in Luanda today that power  sharing must not be applied in Angola. Aldomiro Vaz da  Conceicao said this when commenting on the instructions the  president of the Republic gave the government negotiating team  to respond positively to proposals made by the mediators in the  peace talks in Lusaka.    The spokesman of the Presidency of the Republic said peace  accords will allow UNITA elements to hold government posts, but  that will not mean power sharing.    [Begin Conceicao recording] We can only speak of power  sharing when there is a coalition government where all political  forces are on an equal footing and charged with the task of  implementing a joint political and economic program, resulting  from an agreement between the various forces. That is not the  case here in Angola and as such that situation will not be  observed. UNITA elements will hold government posts at the  central and local levels, but they will have to implement the  program of the government of the party that won legislative  elections.

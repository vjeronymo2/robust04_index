			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] leader, addressing his first and last election rally at  Orlando stadium in Soweto on Sunday [24 April], said his party  would demonstrate its power at the polls this week in spite of  his short election campaign. Addressing up to 15,000 supporters  at a colourful election gathering complete with flags, badges  and posters, Mr Buthelezi said his party remained the only party  with support across South Africa.    "My supporters stretch across the nation and the politics my  party endorses has not only remained consistent and pragmatic,  but has a universal appeal of which no other South African party  can boast," Mr Buthelezi said.    He urged people "to go for the bottom", a reference to the  IFP's place at the bottom of the ballot.    He accused the African National Congress and SA Communist  Party [SACP] of raising expectations. "What the ANC/SACP  alliance has failed to take into account are the obvious  problems which flow from inflated expectations, especially when  faced with the inequalities of the present and our country's  restrained resources.    "I am absolutely convinced that the ANC has neither the will  nor the power to put right in this country what the decades of  apartheid have made so terribly wrong. The ANC has specialisd in  the politics of deceit.    "My message to the people of South Africa is that the deep  wounds in our society are as much produced by the ANC's grossly  wrong responses to the needs of the people that apartheid has  inflicted upon them," Mr Buthelezi said.    He said the car bomb blast in central Johannesburg did not  augur well for the future. He hoped it was an isolated incident.    He also criticised the ANC for having shot Zulu marchers in  Johannesburg on March 28, saying it would not be forgotten.    He said the ANC and the National Party had become "the  strangest bedfellows the history of mankind has ever seen".    He said the ANC was pulling out all stops to make IFP  strongholds ungovernable. "They would rather wipe the IFP off  the face of this earth than face our formidable opposition in  next week's elections," he said.    He said there were irreconcilable differences between black  political groups. He said the ANC/SACP would never represent all  South Africa's blacks.    For the April elections to succeed in establishing a secure  and stable interim government, the prime political antagonists  would have to exercise greater control over their followers. A  culture of political tolerance had to be entrenched.    "While the IFP recognises that both the ANC and the NP  [National Party] are two major political parties in South  Africa, we are equally aware that these parties are rejected by  a large proportion of South Africa's electorate. "Any efforts by  either of these parties to wrest control over a central party  dictatorship after the elections will be the death knell for the  people of South Africa."    He said the IFP had rejected the notion of the ANC and NP  deciding bilaterally about the future of South Africa. "The  people of South Africa need the protection and strength of the  IFP to secure a democratic settlement."    As Mr Buthelezi finished his speech, hundreds of his  supporters armed with sticks and assegais streamed out of the  stadium. Police on the scene said there were no incidents.</p>

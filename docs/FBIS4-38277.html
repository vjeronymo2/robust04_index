			<p>BFN     [Text] For the first time since the Yemeni battles started,  representatives of the conflicting sides met in New York  yesterday. AFP reports that the two sides could not set a date  for a cease-fire. The talks, which were held in the presence of  Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's special envoy for  Yemeni affairs, were attended by 'Abd al-Karim al-Iryani,  Yemen's planning and development minister, representing the  northern forces, and Haydar Abu Bakr al-'Attas, representing the  southern forces.    The official Yemeni news agency has reported that 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, who was living in al-Mukalla in east Aden, was wounded  and has gone to an Arab country for treatment. The news agency  has not revealed the name of the Arab country.    Another report citing the official Yemeni news agency states  that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has accused the  southerners of trying to internationalize the Yemeni war.  Speaking with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak on the phone  yesterday, he said the southerners are thus trying to achieve  their expansionist objectives.</p>

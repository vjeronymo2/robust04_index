The MSRB filed the proposal to adopt rules relating to political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. The Commission published notice to the proposal in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on January 21, 1994. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  On February 4, 1994, the Commission extended the comment period for the proposal by 30 days, to March 11, 1994. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  On March 29, 1994, the MSRB filed an Amendment to the proposal relating to the proposal's effective date and contribution date. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33482 (January 14, 1994), 59 FR 3389. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33583 (February 4, 1994), 59 FR 6320.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As originally submitted, the proposal's prohibitions on municipal securities business would arise from contributions made on or after April 1, 1994. The MSRB filed an amendment to change the April 1, 1994 date to a date 10 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  of the Commission order approving the proposal.

Twenty-four commentators favor the proposal and 33 oppose the proposal. Several commentators raise concerns without expressly favoring or opposing the proposal. Several commentators that favor the proposal make recommendations to better enable municipal securities dealers to comply with the proposal. The Commission has determined, for the reasons discussed below, to approve the proposed rule change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Executive Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MSRB's proposed rule change relating to political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business is intended to address practices known as ``pay to play.'' These practices typically involve payments in the form of political contributions to help finance election campaigns of state or local officials or similar arrangements with these officials. Widespread reports regarding the existence of such practices has fueled industry and regulatory concerns. These practices directly affect municipal securities markets by increasing costs borne by issuers, dealers and ultimately investors, by creating artificial barriers to competition, and by undermining underwriter and market integrity. In 1993, state and local governments awarded negotiated underwriting contracts for the sale of more than $250 billion of municipal bonds, approximately 80% of all municipal securities underwritings, to facilitate the construction of schools, highways, hospitals, public housing, bridges, water and sewer systems, and other infrastructure projects needed to serve public needs and spur local and regional economic growth. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  As of December 31, 1993, private investors, including households and mutual and money market funds, held more than $850 billion in municipal securities, representing approximately 70% of outstanding municipal securities. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  While it is difficult to quantify the cost of fraudulent, unethical, and manipulative dealer selection practices, at a minimum, these practices substantially undermine the integrity of the municipal securities market. Congress recognized the importance of integrity in municipal securities financing when it directed the formation of the MSRB, as part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, and authorized the MSRB to regulate the conduct of municipal securities dealers to, among other things, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to free and open trade, and protect investors and the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Public Securities Association,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Review of Studies of Competitive and Negotiated Financing of Municipal and Corporate Securities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (March 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Flow of Funds Accounts, Flows and Outstandings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Fourth Quarter 1993 (March 9, 1994) (``Flow of Funds Accounts'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

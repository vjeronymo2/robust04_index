			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa, UAL confirm agreement on partnership LUFTHANSA yesterday signed a wide-ranging commercial partnership with United Airlines, the biggest US international carrier. The deal is expected to intensify competition on international routes, especially across the north Atlantic, and speed up the privatisation of the German national carrier. Although the two sides said the agreement did not involve any equity swap, they did not rule out eventual equity investments once Lufthansa was privatised. Lufthansa said the foundations for the United partnership had been laid by the agreement reached 10 days ago between Germany and the US on a new bilateral air pact between the two countries. 'The new aviation agreement and the co-operative alliance between Lufthansa and United are important prerequisites for early moves towards Lufthansa's privatisation,' the German airline added. The partnership with United would help reduce Lufthansa's heavy losses on the north Atlantic and return the company into the black, Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, said. The German airline, which has embarked on a restructuring programme, expects to halve its annual losses this year compared to 1992. Lufthansa said it may return to profitability in 1994. It posted a 1992 group net loss of DM391m (Dollars 230m). The company said that it had eliminated 5,500 jobs by last June and it expected to cut another 2,900 jobs by the beginning of 1994. The Lufthansa-United deal is primarily designed to increase the two airlines' worldwide revenues, but the two carriers expect it to provide cost-cutting opportunities. Mr Weber hoped the United deal would help swing Austrian Airlines to co-operate with Lufthansa rather than join the European four-airline merger being negotiated between SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian. The Austrian carrier is expected to decide later this month whether to opt for Lufthansa or for the four-airline merger. The Lufthansa-United deal and the proposed four-airline merger reflect the scramble for alliances and partnerships engulfing an industry facing growing deregulation and increasingly global competition. The United alliance is likely to face stiff opposition from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the two other big US carriers. American had sought to negotiate a deal with Lufthansa and is the only big US carrier without a leading European partner. Delta, which has equity links with Swissair, sees its position as the biggest US carrier at Frankfurt threatened by yesterday's deal. However, Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, said he was confident the agreement would win the necessary US government approval.</p>

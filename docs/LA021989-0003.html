			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> Brandon Tartikoff is the most powerful man in television. He has used that  power this season to bring viewers kinky bondage scenes in two major films,  "Favorite Son" and "Full Exposure: The Sex Tapes Scandal," as well as Geraldo  Rivera's lurid and lavishly illustrated special on satanism.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, is now taking a  shellacking in the press for his excessive bad taste. His reaction: "Why am I  being picked on?"  </P> <P> CBS puts on sleazy shows, too, but that network also has taken the high road  with the magnificent Western miniseries "Lonesome Dove." ABC has had many  lowly, squalid moments but also invested millions of dollars and 30 hours of  prime time in the monumental miniseries "War and Remembrance."  </P> <P> "It's such a soft ball, it really is," Tartikoff says of the charge that NBC  puts on trash while the other networks offer quality. "Sex Tapes" aired  opposite the first night of "Lonesome Dove."  </P> <P> Tartikoff says it would have been foolish to put an expensive, prestige item  opposite "Lonesome Dove." He says "Sex Tapes" was just good counterprogramming.  But no, he is not proud of the film.  </P> <P> "The only sin I think 'Sex Tapes' was guilty of is that it was a rather  pathetic movie," Tartikoff says. "I think the thing should have been fully  sponsored by Sominex." But the film's sex scenes did not cause a major protest,  Tartikoff says. "We got only 45 phone calls on 'Sex Tapes,' and I think 10 of  those were people complaining about bad reception."  </P> <P> As for "Favorite Son," which included such scenes as a woman tying a man to a  bed with lavender ribbons, Tartikoff is more remorseful. "If I had it to do all  over again, I certainly would have excised the three scenes in 'Favorite Son'  that got all the attention," he says.  </P> <P> One could look on the bright side and say that at least Tartikoff feels a  certain embarrassment over the subterranean depths to which NBC has stooped. Of  the "Sex Tapes" show he says, "It's over and it's done with. People write as if  this kind of thing were never done before, and as if we're the only ones doing  it."  </P> <P> After all, he says, one night's episode of "Lonesome Dove" had rapes and  scalpings. "I've got to do it in Western garb. That's what I've got to do," he  concludes.  </P> <P> If you really want to tick off Tartikoff (and why not?, the money he makes),  just suggest to him that NBC, while still first in the ratings, has surrendered  the mantle of "quality network" to ABC, which is doing more ambitious and  unusual shows this year.  </P> <P> "I know that's what they're saying," says Tartikoff. "I look around and I give  them (ABC) 'Roseanne,' but that's it. What else is there? It's like Steve  Allen. He's written 1,000 songs -- name one. Then I see the stuff they have  that isn't working: 'A Man Called Hawk,' 'Murphy's Law,' 'A Fine Romance,'  'Studio 5-B,' and so on.  </P> <P> "They did 'Roseanne' and now they've taken my mantle? How did they get my  mantle with that?"  </P> <P> But, it is pointed out to Tartikoff, ABC also offers viewers such challenging  shows as "China Beach" and "thirty-something." He is not impressed. "I don't  think 'China Beach' is a good television show," he says. " 'thirtysomething' is  a very narrow show."  </P> <P> Tartikoff is asked why NBC hasn't done a movie or miniseries in a league with  "War and Remembrance" or "Lonesome Dove." He says the forthcoming miniseries  remake of "Around the World in 80 Days" will be "all-family entertainment," if  hardly revolutionary.  </P> <P> "Is it breakthrough television? It will probably be as slow as 'War and  Remembrance,' " he jokes. "Is it 'Shogun' or 'Roots' or 'Holocaust'? No, but I  don't think 'War and Remembrance' or 'Lonesome Dove' were as good as those  either. In terms of sheer weight, I suppose you have to credit 'War and  Remembrance.' "  </P> <P> Tartikoff says NBC has quality programming ahead, including a new prime-time  effort from the tirelessly imaginative Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets. It  will air at the beginning of April. NBC's "Dream Street," a new series about  life in blue-collar New Jersey, will air in March; it was created by the  producers of that "narrow" show, "thirtysomething."  </P> <P> Obviously sensitive to the charge that he's bringing more trash than class to  television, Tartikoff says last year's writers' strike has made this a freak  among television seasons. "We do some good things around here," Tartikoff says  defensively.  </P> <P> So far, though, not enough of them.  </P></p>

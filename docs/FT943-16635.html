			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / North Yemen oil output halted North Yemen's 190,000 barrel a day oil production has been halted by a south Yemeni air raid, a north Yemeni oil official said at the weekend. The attack deprives the Sanaa government of its chief source of hard currency until the damage is repaired. Northern forces, meanwhile, kept up artillery and rocket attacks on the southern city of Aden as the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that people in the city would soon be dying of thirst unless its shelled water treatment plant was repaired. Witnesses and hospital officials said 17 people were killed yesterday in the shelling of Aden's residential areas, including nine who were digging a well for water. Up to 23 people were injured. North Yemeni officials last night said the northern government would let the ICRC send water trucks to Aden and has promised safe passage to engineers to repair installations. Mr Ismail al-Dailami, oil ministry manager at Marib, told Reuters that a raid by southern jets last week had destroyed two vital water coolers at the crude oil pumping station feeding the pipeline to Ras Isa, the north's oil export terminal. He said that the damage could be repaired 'in a few days'. But it was unclear if replacements for the two wrecked coolers were available in Yemen or would have to be flown into the country. The Marib operation is the mainstay of north Yemen's oil industry, pumping almost 190,000 b/d of crude. Production is continuing in the south, where Canadian Occidental is producing up to 160,000 b/d from its Masila field, but the company has been paying Yemen's share of the oil revenues into a trust account since the outbreak of civil war in early May.</p>

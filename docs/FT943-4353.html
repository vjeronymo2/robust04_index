			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Softer stance to trench digging Ground containing buried electrical cables or gas pipes is usually dug up by hand to avoid damage by the hard-cutting teeth of conventional excavators. Concept Engineering Group, a Pittsburgh-based engineering company, has designed a trench-digging machine that avoids damaging cables and pipes by using supersonic jets of air to crumble the soil, after which the soil is scooped up using a vacuum system. The system, which was designed for the Electric Power Research Institute of California, is now being modified in the hope that it can be used for environmental waste clean-ups and bulk material handling.

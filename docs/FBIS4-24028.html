			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] After a break in the peace talks at the request of  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA],  everything indicates that the negotiating teams will resume  talks tomorrow. Over the weekend, Alioune Blondin Beye, special  representative of the UN secretary general in Angola and  mediator in the peace talks, was in Huambo and Luanda, where he  held contacts at the highest level. He returned to Lusaka last  evening.    The UNITA negotiating team returned this afternoon from  Huambo, where it held talks with its leader, Jonas Savimbi, and  its leadership. The government negotiating team, which used the  break to go to Luanda, also returned to Lusaka early this  evening. All the people involved in the peace talks are here in  Lusaka, but it is still not known what the negotiating teams  will discuss tomorrow.    Before the peace talks were interrupted, the negotiating  teams from the government and UNITA were discussing the  involvement of UNITA and its senior leaders in the government.    Meanwhile, on the occasion of Africa Refugee Day today,  Angolan refugees here in Zambia called on the government and  UNITA to speed up the present talks with a view to establishing  peace in Angola, because they are tired of living as refugees.  There are 50,000 Angolan refugees in Zambia.</p>

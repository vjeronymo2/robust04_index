			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wilhelm Hadler: "Billions for European Transport"] </F>   [Text] Corfu -- Jacques Delors' White Book on Growth,  Competitiveness, and Employment continues to be the major  guideline for the European Union's [EU] economic policy. At the  summit in Corfu at the weekend, the heads of state and  government confirmed their view that the growth in production  achieved up to the turn of the millennium must mainly be used  for investments and for creating new jobs.    The emerging economic recovery must not lessen efforts  towards achieving structural adjustments. This aim, the  summit's conclusion statements say, should "be realized in the  spirit of solidarity and taking particular account of the  weakest members of society."    As expected, the "heads" agreed on a list of 11 priority  traffic projects that are to be started or completed with the  EU's support. These include high-speed train connections like  the planned Brenner Axis, Verona-Munich going on to  Nuremberg-Erfurt-Leipzig, and Berlin, as well as the western  connection linking Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam-London. The  EU Commission estimates the required investment at 130 billion  German marks.    The member countries concerned have been asked to start  immediately all the traffic projects whose preparation has  progressed far enough and to begin all the others in 1996 at the  latest. In the course of this, it will also be examined whether  the "trans-European networks" can be extended to the Central and  East European countries and the Mediterranean regions.    Funding of the networks is to be decided on a case-by-case  basis. "If necessary, measures will have to be adopted to make  sure that priority projects do not face financial obstacles that  might endanger their coming into existence."    Should a project be threatened due to insufficient  profitability, the Council, together with the Commission and the  European Investment Bank (EIB), will immediately examine  "suitable solutions" within the EU's financial planning  possibilities.    In the heads of governments' view, the challenges in the  field of new information and communications technologies must,  however, be created by private industry alone. But a permanent  coordination body shall ensure that public and private agencies  work in the same direction.</p>

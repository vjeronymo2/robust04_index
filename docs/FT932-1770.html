			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Mixed response to partly-paid structure of Tesco Pounds 200m deal TESCO, the UK supermarket chain, launched a Pounds 200m issue with an unusual partly-paid structure more typically seen in the gilts market, which met a mixed reaction. Some dealers said the structure proved a deterrent to some investors, particularly foreign investors who expect sterling to appreciate. But lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston argued that the structure appealed to foreign investors who do not want to take a view on the currency and to retail investors. The structure of the deal suited Tesco, which does not need the proceeds immediately, but wished to take advantage of favourable market conditions. The 9 1/2 -year deal was launched at a yield spread of 68 basis points over the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 (or 50 basis points, if the partly paid feature were stripped out). Dealers said that there was still strong demand for sterling bonds following the recent spate of new issues, but investor demand is drawn to either very high quality paper, or high-yielding paper. Some said that Tesco, rated Aa3 by Moody's, fell into neither of these categories. But CSFB said that with Eurosterling spreads at historically tight levels, investor interest was piqued by bonds offering a spread of 50 basis points or more over gilts. In the dollar market, two companies issued bonds under newly created Euro medium-term note programmes. Energie Beheer Nederland, the Dutch state-owned gas production company, launched a Dollars 300m seven-year deal under its new Dollars 1.5bn programme, at a spread of 24 basis points. The deal was considered a touch aggressive, but the borrower's AAA rating and rarity value helped fuel demand. A Dollars 250m three-year deal for Sony Capital, the US arm of the Japanese electronics giant, issued under its new Dollars 1bn Euro MTN programme, was considered tightly priced at 50 basis points over the comparable Treasury yield. The company's debt is rated Aa3 by Moody's, but was recently downgraded by S&amp;P to A. However, lead manager Goldman Sachs said the name appeals to retail investors. The spread widened to 52 basis points.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OREL IS CRITICIZED FOR ORAL EXAMINATION  </P> <P> The comments from Orel (the Oracle) Hershiser were revealing, saying that the  Dodgers need "better chemistry" (through research?) and someone to "pull us  together" (perhaps Billy Graham for Tom Lasorda?)  </P> <P> Hershiser should get his priorities straight. He is well paid for pitching, not  public speaking, but both need improvement.  </P> <P> BILL RETCHIN  </P> <P> La Quinta  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BILL MAY CURB CREDIT REPORTING ABUSES;  </P> <P> PRIVACY: FIRMS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING HIGH ERROR RATES, FAILING TO PROVIDE  CREDIT HISTORIES TO CONSUMERS AND SELLING DATA TO DIRECT-MAIL MARKETERS.  </P> <P> A House subcommittee and the Bush Administration appeared to be moving closer  to agreement Tuesday on legislation that would put greater limits on the  private data banks -- including Orange-based TRW Credit Data -- that keep  computerized credit records on millions of Americans.  </P> <P> An Administration representative, the Federal Trade Commission and public  interest groups backed many of the major provisions of a compromise bill. It is  one of three competing bills before the House consumer affairs subcommittee  that are aimed at overhauling the Fair Credit Reporting Act's provisions on  credit reporting agencies.  </P> <P> The act has come under fire in recent years as being riddled with loopholes  that have allowed abuses in the credit data industry. The "credit bureaus," as  the information storehouses are commonly called, have been accused of having  high error rates that result in denial of credit, failing to provide complete  copies of credit histories to consumers and invading personal privacy by  selling some of their information to direct-mail marketers.  </P> <P> While hundreds of credit bureaus exist around the nation, the industry is  dominated by three giants -- Equifax Inc., TRW Credit Data and Trans Union  Corp. The agencies tell merchants whether prospective customers pay their bills  in a timely fashion.  </P> <P> Bonnie Guiton, director of the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs and a special  assistant to President Bush, praised some major points in the compromise bill.  Among them was a provision to allow individuals to prevent credit bureaus from  adding their names to junk mailing lists that are sold to marketers.  </P> <P> The compromise bill offered by the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Richard H.  Lehman (D-Sanger), represents a softer approach to the mailing list issue. Two  other measures before the subcommittee would ban the practice altogether.  </P> <P> Guiton said Administration opposition to the Lehman bill centers on provisions  that would require credit bureaus to give consumers one free credit report a  year and offer updates for no more than $8 each. She said credit bureaus should  be allowed to charge a fee that will cover their actual costs of providing the  reports.  </P> <P> Representatives of the three major credit bureaus and their trade organization  said they believe that the legislation is unnecessary. They said the  subcommittee should not pass a bill based simply on a handful of highly  publicized complaints about allegations of wrongdoing and illegal taps into  credit bureau computers.  </P> <P> "We do not believe that is prudent to alter radically a law and a system that  has served both consumers and the credit granting community on the basis of a  few horror stories," said Walter R. Kurth, president of the trade association,  Associated Credit Bureaus Inc.  </P></p>

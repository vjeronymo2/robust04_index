			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' CAST PROTEST  </P> <P> It is time to take a stand against the eroding of values, and the entertainment  industry is perhaps the worst offender. Clay has a right to say what he feels,  but I disagree with TV executives who allow him to reach a mammoth audience.  </P> <P> Why is this country so eager to make itself look, in the eyes of the world,  like bunch of foul-mouthed morons? Don't our politicians make us look bad  enough?  </P> <P> STEPHEN A. GEARY, Los Angeles  </P></p>

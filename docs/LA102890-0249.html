			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD HOPEFULS STRESS THEIR EXPERIENCE  </P> <P> Candidates for the Alhambra City and High School Districts board are stressing  educational experience and business expertise as they campaign for two open  seats.  </P> <P> Five candidates, including 12-year incumbent Dora Padilla, are running in the  Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Padilla, 56, a homemaker and school board member since 1978, is running for her  fourth term. "The condition of California schools, especially Alhambra, calls  for knowledgeable, experienced leadership," Padilla says. She wants to see  through several projects that began during her tenure, including the  installation of a districtwide computer system and renovation of the district's  three high schools.  </P> <P> Ronald Hirosawa, 46, an assistant principal at Hollenbeck Junior High in Boyle  Heights, says he wants to bring basic values to education.  </P> <P> "I believe everybody has to study and work hard in order to learn," Hirosawa  says. If elected, the L.A. Unified administrator also wants to work with the  state to introduce a more equitable way of funding local school districts.  </P> <P> Charles Ling, 52, a director of admissions at Poly Languages Institute in  Pasadena and its international student adviser, says that, if elected, he would  bring 15 years of business experience to the school board.  </P> <P> "My experience in financial management may be useful to the Alhambra district,  which is experiencing budget cuts," says Ling, who earned an MBA from  Pepperdine University.  </P> <P> Sophie C. Wong, 53, is a businesswoman who co-owns a real estate company and an  Alhambra thrift and loan. She is on the board of directors for the United Way  West San Gabriel Valley region, the San Gabriel Valley Red Cross and the  Alhambra YMCA. She is also on the Salvation Army Advisory Board and is a past  president of the Monterey Park Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> She also co-founded a women's scholarship fund for Cal State L.A. and has  served on advisory boards for the university and for East L.A. Community  College.  </P> <P> If elected, "my primary goal will be to link our community and business  resources together to support our schools," Wong says. "Only by forming a  community-business-school team can we ensure a bright future for . . . our  children."  </P> <P> The fifth candidate is Jeffrey Schwartz, 36, an independent contractor and  business manager.  </P> <P> Schwartz, who attended Alhambra schools, said he was prompted to run for office  when he concluded that his son wasn't receiving the same quality of education  he had as a child.  </P> <P> If elected, Schwartz wants to make the board more accessible to teachers and  parents. He would form a volunteer committee to write grant proposals and would  attempt to resurrect "Opportunity Room," an Alhambra district program that  gives problem students a second chance at educational success.  </P> <P> Schwartz says he would also draw on his business experience to encourage more  local firms to participate in Alhambra's "Adopt-A-School" program and would  attempt to regain federal funding for an education program aimed at refugees.  </P> <P> The Alhambra districts serve about 20,000 students in kindergarten through high  school and covers all of Alhambra and portions of Monterey Park, Rosemead and  San Gabriel. Candidates are elected at large to four-year terms.  </P> <P> Charles C. Scanlon, the other member whose term is expiring, is not running for  reelection. He has served 16 years on the board.  </P></p>

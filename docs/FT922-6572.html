			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Smith Barney in Kidder talks SMITH BARNEY, the New York broking house, said yesterday it had held discussions with General Electric, the parent of securities firm Kidder Peabody, about buying all or part of Kidder in what would amount to a significant consolidation of Wall Street strength. However, Mr Frank Zarb, chief executive of Smith Barney, told staff that the firm was not now pursuing the discussions. He was responding to a report in The Wall Street Journal that GE, which bought Kidder in 1986, had decided to sell the company and that Primerica, the financial services group which owns Smith Barney, was the front-runner to buy it. GE refused to comment on 'rumours' but insisted it was 'extremely pleased' with Kidder's performance. Suggestions that GE might dispose of Kidder have circulated for years, but yesterday's Smith Barney comments provide the firmest evidence yet that it might be prepared to do so.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OIL SLICK 30 MILES OFF OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> A slow-moving oil slick was seen Friday morning about 30 miles from the  Oceanside shore, officials said.  </P> <P> The slick was noticed by a U. S. Coast Guard helicopter about 10:30 a.m.  between San Clemente Island and Oceanside and was moving north, Coast Guard  Petty Officer Charles Cowan said.  </P> <P> It appeared to be about 25 miles long and 25 yards wide, he said.  </P> <P> Officials were not sure of the source of the slick and were monitoring it, but  as of late Friday the oil was not moving ashore.  </P> <P> "We're keeping an eye on it," Cowan said. "It is so far from shore there is not  much we can do right now."  </P> <P> If the slick remains at its current distance from shore, Cowan said, wind and  wave action will break it up.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lutz Beukert and Peter Heinacher: "Little Hope </F> for Net Reduction of Taxes on Companies"]    [Excerpts] Hannover -- With their demand for a 7.5-percent  allowance on equipment investments, the Gesamtmetall employers'  association and the IG-Metall trade union are quite alone. At  the 1994 HANDELSBLATT economic forum on the occasion of the  Hannover fair, which was held under the heading "Ways Out of the  Crisis," the demand met with rejection by FRG Economics Minister  Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany); Wolfgang  Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union Bundestag group; and Saarland Minister President  Oskar Lafontaine (Social Democratic Party of Germany);  Federation of German Industry [BDI] President Tyll Necker; and  Eberhard von Koerber, chairman of the Asea Brown Boveri AG board  of directors. IG-Metall Chief Klaus Zwickel announced that in  the 1995 wage negotiations the working people cannot be expected  to accept any further losses in income.    FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt objected to the  demands of Gesamtmetall and IG-Metall with particular vehemence.  "We are already very intensively subsidizing investments, in  particular those of small and medium-sized companies." There  subsidies are appropriate for structural reasons. They are  based on the idea that these companies function as an engine for  the overall economy. "However, if a general allowance for  investments is under discussion, I clearly say no."    In Rexrodt's view, an investment allowance would require an  extended period to have any effect at all. At the moment there  is the danger that the companies would adopt a wait-and-see  attitude. It is very likely that already existing plans for  investments would be relegated to the back burner. For this  reason the demanded investment allowance would have a  counterproductive effect at the moment. [passage omitted]    Rexrodt admitted that, despite the economic upswing,  considerable problems on the labor market are still to be  expected in 1994. This development is, however, primarily due  to structural problems. Among the positive factors of the  economic development is the fact that the inflation rate is  declining and that the interest level in Germany is at a  historically low level, Rexrodt added. Foreign orders are  rising, and the minister also believes that a slight recovery  can be felt regarding domestic demand. "The situation is more  favorable than many people predicted just a few weeks ago."    BDI President Tyll Necker compared the economic development  with a multistage rocket. The first stage, which is foreign  demand, has been sparked, the second state, which is domestic  demand for investments, is not yet working with full thrust.  Only in individual fields some improvement can be seen, Necker  noted. There are not yet any positive effects on consumption  and on the creation of new jobs, which used to improve only  later in all economic cycles of the past, too. [passage omitted]</p>

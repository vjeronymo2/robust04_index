Its Drafting Now Hampered by the  Russia-West Problem of Nuclear Commodities Export"]    [Text] An important part of Andrey Kozyrev's talks with  his counterparts from three European countries -- the former,  present, and future EC chairmen from Belgium, Greece, and  Germany -- is the drafting of an Agreement on Partnership and  Cooperation with the European Union [EU] based on the eponymous  declaration signed by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin  with EU leaders in Brussels last December. At present, stressed  Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian foreign  minister, it is necessary to specify the principles incorporated  in the declaration.    There are a number of obstacles along this road, however.  One moot point in the drafting of an agreement is the export of  nuclear materials; another is the problem of Russian legislation  in the banking sphere. According to G. Sidorova, Russia is  assuring its Western partners that the second moot point could  be resolved in the nearest future.    The problem of selling nuclear materials appears more  difficult. There are a number of states fearing Russian import  in this sphere. They want to assign to Moscow rather low quotas  although this item of export is one of the most profitable for  it. Russia is naturally unhappy with this, and is arguing for  the removal of any restrictions in this area of trade,  proceeding from the fact that other countries trading in nuclear  materials are not restricted by quotas either under GATT or  other international trade agreements. The West still continues  to fear competing with Russia on the nuclear products market.  Moscow, however, is hoping to sign an agreement with the EU in  this sphere in the coming six months, even before the  termination of the chairmanship of Greece, which has assured  Russia that it would facilitate this in every way, something  that was stated by Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou when  he received Kozyrev in Athens.    During the talks in Athens, the Russian minister and his  Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias discussed, in addition to  international questions, those of bilateral cooperation.  Kozyrev invited Papoulias to visit Moscow this coming April.  It is perhaps then that a number of Russo-Greek documents  regulating, among other things, consular relationships will be  signed.</p>

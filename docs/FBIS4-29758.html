			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's economy has stopped  weakening and is headed for recovery on the back of gradual  recovery in personal consumption, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said  Tuesday [21 June] in a monthly report on monetary and economic  trends.    Among factors behind the central bank's views were strong  investment in the housing and public sectors, bottoming out of  industrial production and steady progress in inventory  adjustment, as well as recovering personal consumption, the  report said.    The report, however, noted corporate capital spending  continues to decline in the manufacturing sector as a whole,  while that in the nonmanufacturing sector remains stagnant.    In the labor market, growth in the number of employees  continues to slow due to limited recruitment of new graduates,  though the ratio of job offers to job applicants has stopped  decreasing, the report said.    As to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the  January-March quarter, just released by the Economic Planning  Agency, Kagehide Kaku, research and statistics director at the  central bank, told reporters the figures are within expectations  and in line with the bank's judgments.    Asked about the possible impact of the yen's recent  strengthening against the dollar on a burgeoning economic  recovery, Kaku only said, "we are paying significant attention"  to the yen's appreciation.    In this regard, Kaku reiterated the bank's view that the  economy seems to have taken one step forward toward recovery,  but ups and downs are expected amid remaining risks such as the  yen's resurgence.</p>

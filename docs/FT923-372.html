			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Bombay scandal 'cost Rs5bn' THE net loss to the Indian banking system from the Bombay securities scandal is expected to be about Rs5bn (Pounds 103.5m), according to Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of Reserve Bank of India, the central bank. The scandal involved some Rs35bn of fraudulent dealings but Mr Venkitaramanan's new estimate is for money which, after investigations and legal proceedings, will prove irrecoverable. Standard Chartered of the UK, the worst-hit foreign bank, has provided Pounds 100m against potential losses from the scandal. Mr Venkitaramanan, speaking in New York after attending the International Monetary Fund annual meeting, also said financial sector reform was being resumed after being delayed by the scandal, which surfaced in April. The Indian authorities have announced a decision in principle to allow the Indian private sector to enter commercial banking, the central bank governor said. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has asked for a Dollars 500m loan from the World Bank to back financial sector reforms this year, to be used partly to help set up an asset reconstruction fund for banks saddled with bad debts on their balance sheets. The Asian Development Bank plans a Dollars 400m loan to help meet an 8 per cent capital adequacy requirement imposed on banks by the Reserve Bank. It also emerged in Washington that the government has asked the IMF for a Dollars 5bn extended fund facility to replace the present standby arrangement, which runs out in April. The new three-year facility would include the Dollars 1.2bn unused portion of the existing Dollars 2.2bn standby, and an enhanced structural adjustment facility bearing lower interest rates.</p>

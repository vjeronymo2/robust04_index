			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku, March 12 (AZERTAC)--A trial for an attempt on  President Aliyev's life was finished at the High Court of  Azerbaijan today. The defendants guilt was established. The  court sentenced Aydin Gassimov as an organizer and Abil Babayev  as an accomplice to 12 years imprisonment. However they did not  plead guilty.    A student from Turkey Hassan Toku, whom conspirators planned  to be the assassin, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The  court, giving this judgment, took into consideration his honest  confession and the fact that he had been a help with  investigation. Cases of the other two defendants--Nariman  Mamedov and Ali Askerov--were sent to additional inquiry because  of inadequate evidence. Additional inquiry is also necessary  because the two accomplices of the conspiracy aimed at attempt  on president's life went into hiding.</p>

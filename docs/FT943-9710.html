			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Barclays profits soar to Pounds 1.04bn as bad debts fall: Results provoke protests from consumers Barclays, the UK's largest bank, yesterday surprised the stock market, and provoked protests from consumer groups and unions, by reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04bn for the first half of the year after a Pounds 680m fall in bad debt provisions. The bank's interim profits trebled from Pounds 335m in the first half of last year, helped by a sharp fall in bad debts in its UK retail bank and an Pounds 85m profit in US operations, which lost Pounds 221m in the same period of 1993. It signalled a return to health for Barclays, which cut its dividend in 1992 when it lost Pounds 242m because of poor lending - particularly to large property and construction companies - and appointed a new chief executive. However, unions criticised the bank for having reduced its UK staff by 2,500 this year, and the Consumers' Association said that the profits 'added insult to injury for thousands of customers who have suffered poor service'. Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, who joined the bank full-time this year from Courtaulds Textiles, insisted that it had to make a higher return on capital than in the past to reward its shareholders. Mr Taylor said Barclays had made 'lousy returns' in the past few years. 'The problem is not that these figures are very high, although that is true. It is that people have got used to very poor returns in this business,' he said. Barclays is the latest bank to show a return to strong profits following problems in the early 1990s. National Westminster last week reported first half pre-tax profits of Pounds 767m, while Lloyds raised profits to Pounds 605m. However, banks are finding it hard to generate new income because of low demand for loans and competitive pressures. Barclays' operating profits before bad debt provisions fell to Pounds 1.23bn from Pounds 1.34bn in the first half of last year. The bank said it had made an undisclosed provision against having to compensate customers of its life insurance subsidiary Barclays Life to whom it may have sold products such as personal pensions inappropriately. Barclays Life was publicly rebuked by the Securities and Investments Board last month over lax training of its 1,100 sales force and management standards. Mr Taylor said that it regarded the rebuke as 'an extremely serious matter'. Profits at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Barclays' investment bank, fell from Pounds 254m to Pounds 194m because of turbulence in global bond and equity markets. Securities trading income fell to Pounds 50m from Pounds 126m, although foreign exchange income rose to Pounds 75m from Pounds 71m. The bank's loans and advances to customers fell by Pounds 10bn to Pounds 86.4bn, because of a reduction in low-yielding assets and slack demand. Mr Taylor said it would be unwise for Barclays to lend at a faster rate than growth in the economy. The bank's earnings per share rose to 40.6p, compared with 11.7p, and it raised its interim dividend by 23 per cent from 6.5p to 8p. Net asset value per share rose to 362p from 330p, and the shares closed 4p up at 568p. Lex Page 16 No coasting now easy gains are over Page 17 Barclays may reduce capital Page 18</p>

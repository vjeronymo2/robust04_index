			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE ROLLS UP SIXES AND A WIN, 66-14;  </P> <P> AZTECS: POINT TOTAL AGAINST UTAH IS BIGGEST SINCE 1968. MCGWIRE PASSES FOR FOUR  TOUCHDOWNS.  </P> <P> A well-rested San Diego State turned three weeks worth of frustration into 60  minutes of fury Saturday night in a 66-14 Western Athletic Conference rout of  Utah before a homecoming crowd of 25,504 at Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> San Diego State had not played a game since Oct. 13 and not one at home since  Sept. 29.  </P> <P> And no one, including their coach, knew how the Aztecs, 3-4 overall and 2-2 in  the conference, would react to nothing but three weeks of practice in the  middle of the season.  </P> <P> The Aztecs answered in the affirmative. The 66 points were the most for the  Aztecs since they defeated Southern Mississippi, 68-7, in 1968.  </P> <P> Quarterback Dan McGwire moved into second place on the San Diego State career  passing list, completing 22 of 33 passes for 286 yards and four touchdowns  before getting a chance to rest almost the entire fourth quarter.  </P> <P> McGwire moved ahead of Brian Sipe, who finished with 5,707 yards, when he  completed a 35-yard pass to Dennis Arey two minutes into the second quarter.  McGwire's 5,858 yards trail only Todd Santos, but by a lot. Santos had 11,425  yards, the NCAA record.  </P> <P> But second-place all-time at SDSU isn't bad for someone who hasn't even  completed his second full season. The Utah game was his 19th at SDSU after  transferring from Iowa.  </P> <P> With still about 11 minutes to play in the second quarter, this is what McGwire  had accomplished: 13 completions in 15 attempts for 181 yards.  </P> <P> The Aztecs outscored the Utes 28-0 in the second quarter and led 42-7 at  halftime.  </P> <P> Patrick Rowe and Arey each caught two touchdown passes. Rowe, who came into the  game leading the nation in receiving with a 120.5-yard average, had seven  catches for 120 yards as he passed the 100-yard mark for the fifth straight  game. Arey also caught seven passes for 102 yards.  </P> <P> Utah (3-6, 1-5) lost for the sixth time in its last seven games.  </P> <P> Utah's Jason Woods completed 10 of 25 passes for 147 yards. His only touchdown  pass came late in the third quarter on a 13-yard throw to Mike Anglesey.  </P> <P> San Diego State became the last Division I-A team to intercept a pass as Johnny  Walker intercepted Woods twice in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> San Diego State scored 24 points in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

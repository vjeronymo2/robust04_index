			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong made its decision to demolish Rennie's  Mill [Village] under pressure from Beijing a senior Taiwan  official in charge of overseas Chinese affairs alleges.    Chang Hsiao-yen, chairman of Taiwan's cabinet-level Overseas  Chinese Affairs Commission, told a delegation of Hong Kong  journalists last week that Beijing was behind the government's  decision to reclaim the village where many Kuomintang soldiers  have lived since the communists took over the mainland in 1949.    He said Taiwan was dissatisfied with compensation made by  the  British Hong Kong Government for those forced out of their  homes. "I believe Beijing has given very heavy pressure to the  Hong Kong Government," said Mr Chang, a son of former Taiwan  strongman and president Chiang Ching-kuo and grandson of  Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.    He said Beijing would not tolerate a sea of Taiwan's  national  flags flying on the territory after 1997. However, he said  Taiwan would not retreat from Hong Kong after 1997 despite its  reversion to mainland rule. Mr Chiang vowed to continue  Taiwan's presence. "To think that the government is retreating  from Hong Kong is absolutely wrong," he said. "Instead, we are  considering expanding and strengthening our presence and our  services to our compatriots there but we should make some  changes in our approach to business."    Mr Chiang said the Taiwan Government would not make any  changes to its policy towards Hong Kong after 1997 and would  continue its economic, trade, cultural, and educational  exchanges with the territory. "We will not make changes to any  of our policies concerning relations with Hong Kong and we will  spare no effort to continue to assist the territory to maintain  the present conditions after Beijing's takeover," he said.    Mr Chiang said freedom and democracy were two of the most  important and basic elements that the territory should be  allowed to preserve, adding that that was the ruling  Kuomintang's basic policy towards Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong  affairs would be under the jurisdiction of another cabinet-level  ministry instead of under Mr Chiang's commission after 1997.</p>

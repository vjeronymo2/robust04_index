			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Topical Commentary" by military observer Vladimir Klimov: </F> "Ministry's Green Shoulder Boards"]    [Text] Border guards have always been the people's  blue-eyed boys. I have not seen a single movie or read a single  book that has been disparaging about the guys in green service  caps. I have not heard them being accused of links with the  criminal world, of cruelty, of bullying.... Even when the KGB  was being abused, they did not touch the border guards, although  structurally they came under the committee.    The nationwide esteem for them is understandable: The guys  protect the fatherland's borders, the threshold of our home.  Relations in military collectives there are always normal  because the border guards fulfill a combat task even in  peacetime. The service is specific, and they shoulder a  tremendous responsibility. Their independence was virtually  predetermined. They have secured it: An edict of the Russian  Federation president has created the Federal Border Service  [FBS]-High Command of the Border Troops with the rights of a  federal ministry. It is headed by the commander in chief of the  Border Troops. He is Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev.    Much is demanded of him to whom much is given. The FBS-High  Command directs the official combat, operational,  financial-economic, and other activities of the Border Troops.  Not all the former links are being broken. The Federal  Counterintelligence Service is the coordinating organ for border  guards in questions of operational-investigative activity. The  previously developed system of supply and material-technical  backup for both services is not being destroyed either.    As previously, the border guards' tasks are immense and on a  par with Russia's expanses.    The new ministry's functions are largely traditional, but  new  responsibilities have also appeared -- for example,  participation in the fulfillment of federal programs for  ensuring the safety of the individual. The FBS will live not  only for the present day. On the basis of long-term forecasts of  the development of the operational situation on the border the  service elaborates the concept of its protection, conducts  long-term planning, and organizes information-analytical  activity.    Operational-investigative activity and the ensuring of one's  own safety will require extensive specialized knowledge and  painstaking work. Without going into details, I will single out  just one of the points of interest to the reader at large:  Henceforth the FBS organizes the conclusion of contracts on the  performance of military service by border guards.    Further. In the edict I have counted 27 points directly  concerning the commander in chief. Incidentally, each of the  tasks set before him may be broken down into hundreds more. So  Gen. Andrey Nikolayev's categorical response to my request for  an interview became clear to me: "It is not necessary to comment  on the edict but to carry it out...."</p>

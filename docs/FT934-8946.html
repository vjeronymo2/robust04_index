			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Unilever acquires Bertolli UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, is to acquire Bertolli, the Italian olive oil and vinegar business formerly owned by the state-controlled SME group. Last month, SME, which is being dismembered via sales to the private sector, sold its Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (CBD) canned foods, edible oils and milk division to Fisvi, an Italian agro-industrial holding company. Fisvi has now sold Bertolli, Italy's second-biggest olive oils group, to Unilever. The disposals follow an unsuccessful bid by Unilever to purchase the entire CBD division directly from SME's parent, the IRI state holding company. Unilever has now achieved its aim of just acquiring the olive oil business, its target from the beginning. The deal, which encompasses the Bertolli olive oil brand, production and marketing operations in Italy, and foreign sales channels, will add Dollars 150m to Unilever's worldwide turnover in olive oil.</p>

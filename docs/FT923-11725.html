			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexican exchange to offer warrant trading MEXICO is to introduce a market of listed warrants in the second half of August, according to the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV). The warrants will be listed and traded on the Mexican stock exchange, and issued by brokers, banks and companies on which the warrants are traded. Warrants will be based on either individual stocks or baskets of stocks. The authorities hope the warrants will boost the underlying stock market's liquidity, and stem the growing tide of warrants business being conducted offshore. Merrill Lynch, Nomura and Banamex all offer warrants listed in Luxembourg on baskets of Mexican stocks, while the listed options on Telmex, the telephone monopoly, are traded in New York. CNV plans to offer a listed options market in the near future and a financial futures market later. The warrants and options market will let investors protect themselves from price changes, and better control the risk of buying into the volatile Mexican market. The options and warrants market in Mexico is unlikely to take off while restrictions remain on margin trading and short selling in the underlying market, and while brokerage fees stay higher than in the US. Such obstacles inhibit the arbitrage between the underlying and derivative market, thus making it difficult to use options and warrants as efficient hedges.</p>

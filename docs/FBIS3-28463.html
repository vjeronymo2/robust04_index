			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korean supreme  leader Kim Il-song, reiterating that his country will not  develop nuclear weapons, called for better bilateral relations  in a message delivered to U.S. President Bill Clinton, a Foreign  Ministry official said Monday.    The message was carried to the White House by American  evangelist Billy Graham, who visited North Korea from Jan.  27-Feb. 1, according to Chang Chae-ryong, director-general of  American affairs. The evangelist had gone to Pyongyang once  before, also carrying a verbal message from a U.S. President.  Chang was briefed on the message by U.S. Embassy officials in  Seoul.    The message was not in the form of a personal letter from  Kim  Il-song to Clinton nor was it written by North Korean officials,  according to Chang. Graham simply recorded Kim's reaction to  Clinton's verbal message urging an early conclusion to the North  Korean nuclear problem and wrote down the message himself, he  said.    Kim was quoted as noting that he has said in the past North  Korea will not develop nuclear weapons and that he wants to  improve relations with Washington.    Graham added his own personal observations after talks with  Kim Il-song which pictured the North Korean leader as being in  comparatively "good health." He also noted that Kim was "in  charge" of North Korea's relations with the United States, Chang  said.</p>

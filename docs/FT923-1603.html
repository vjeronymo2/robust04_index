			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: CS Holding falls 11% to SFr534m at halfway CS HOLDING, the holding company for Credit Suisse and other financial and industrial companies, suffered an 11 per cent decline in consolidated net earnings to SFr534m (Dollars 407.60m) in the first half, mainly because of increased provisions for bad debts. Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said the group's aim was to maintain earnings at last year's level, a downward revision from his last statement in April anticipating 'further improvement' this year. Gross income for the first half jumped 13 per cent to SFr4.5bn, due mainly to a 36 per cent rise in commission income. Trading income was up 6 per cent to SFr1.26bn and interest income was flat at SFr1.36bn. Pre-tax profit was up 5 per cent to SFr1.8bn but provisions for bad debts, arising from the weak Swiss economy and the Canary Wharf bankruptcy in London, rose 11 per cent to SFr827m. The group tax bill jumped 30 per cent to SFr351m after the elimination of tax losses carried forward at CS First Boston.</p>

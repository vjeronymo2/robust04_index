			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Management: Health Check - Put the stress on self-preservation There is no such thing as executive stress. At least that is what many of you seem to think as you ignore the warning signs that could eventually spoil your job prospects and damage your health. Stress in itself is neither good nor bad. It occurs when the body and the mind are in a state of extreme alert because of some new demand or challenge. A limited amount of stress can actually be good for you and your company. But once the stress becomes intense it overwhelms your ability to cope. Your performance starts to suffer, as does the quality of your life. Fighting stress to convert it into a healthy experience can be difficult, as it means changing your lifestyle and your priorities. Where to begin then? The first step is to broaden your definition of success to include self-preservation (for the family and friends) and self-fulfilment. Do not exchange precious years of your life, your marriage or your health for one more rung on the career ladder. Secondly, listen carefully to your body and your mind. Start to decipher individual signs and symptoms, not as something to anaesthetize, but as red flags warning of a potentially serious problem. The symptoms that I frequently encounter in multinational executives include: high blood pressure, chronic fatigue, nervous eating-drinking, sleeplessness, peptic ulcers, emotional problems, tension headaches, obesity and depression. Our nervous system has evolved much more slowly than our lifestyles. What may have been a perfectly appropriate response for our cave-dwelling ancestors to a physical stress no longer serves the 20th century business person. During the stressful moment, the adrenal glands secrete two powerful 'stress-hormones': adrenalin and corticoids, which will provide the energy to meet the new demand through either fight or flight. Both actions help consume these stress hormones but neither are appropriate in today's offices. Instead, the executive is left stewing in his or her own stress juices in front of the computer. A new strategy is called for to decompress this situation. At the moment when the body and the mind scream for something as basic as oxygen (for the proper functioning of the brain, heart and other vital organs) or water (to cool an otherwise overheated system), modern managers reach for alcohol (which depresses lucidity and forces the body to lose precious water) or cigarettes (which decreases oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood). Sometimes the response to stress is more dangerous than the stress itself. Ask yourself: is this part of the solution or part of the problem? After deciphering your symptoms, you must go for the long-term treatment ticket, the 'cure'. In doing so, you may or may not find alliances in the medical community. To treat an acute, short burst of stress with tranquillisers, 'sleepers', ulcer and headache medications may be entirely appropriate. However, to treat long term, chronic stress with medications simply silences the alarms that the symptoms are sending out. The real cure may be something relatively simple like losing weight, stopping smoking, taking regular exercise, drinking less, or going on holiday. It may be something more complex involving psycho-therapy. Either way, nature is unforgiving to us when we ignore its messages. Lastly, have the courage to talk about it. Seek help from a friend, your spouse, a member of the clergy, or a professional therapist. Stress already has a long and illustrious cortege of victims. With an honest and rational approach, stress can be converted from a serial killer of international managers to an opportunity for self-knowledge and growth. Don't forget: life is the real career, not just business. The author is medical director of INSEAD's business-health course.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The planned summit of the Council of the heads of  CIS member-states was held on Friday in Moscow. Leaders of all  CIS member-countries attended the sitting with the exception of  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev who was not able to come  to Moscow due to his illness. Kazakhstan's Vice President Erik  Asanbayev represented the republic at the summit. Russian  President Boris Yeltsin addressed the plenary sitting of the  Council of the Heads of States and Council of the Heads of CIS  Governments. The whole text of his speech is presented below.    "First of all, let me congratulate the Republic of Moldova  on  joining the Commonwealth of Independent States. The  corresponding documents have been signed just before the  beginning of this sitting. I also want to congratulate Chairman  of Belarus' Supreme Soviet Mechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb on his first  participation in the sitting of the Council of the heads of CIS  states.    Today we are due to discuss a wide spectrum of issues. What  primarily concerns us is a package of decisions aimed at the  practical implementation of the treaty on economic union.  Economic union is the basis of the Commonwealth. The level of  integration of CIS countries in general will finally depend upon  our advances in this direction.    Today the sitting of the heads of states has approved two  decisions of principal significance. The first one concerns the  creation of a commission for the economic union. It should  become a working instrument to ensure the efficient activity of  the economic union of the Commonwealth's countries.    Another decision gives "a green light" to the creation of a  free trade zone. In accordance with this decision all customs  tariffs, taxes, and non-tariff restrictions in mutual trade  between CIS countries will be gradually abolished. Thanks to  this we shall prepare the ground for a stage-by-stage transfer  to the customs union.    These moves are not the conclusion but the beginning of  economic integration. We must think over how to prevent a dual  threat--an uncontrolled industrial recession, on the one hand,  and hyperinflation, on the other. Today we have great  opportunities for this.    We have also given our backing to Ukraine's joining the  economic union as an associate member. I believe that given  Ukraine's economic potential this decision will be of great  importance both for this republic and for other members of the  economic union.    I'd like to specially mention the documents on the  unification of Russia's and Belarus' monetary systems signed  several days ago. For the first time integration has risen to a  qualitatively new level in the framework of the Commonwealth. I  think that this way is acceptable not only for  Russian-Belarusian relations but for relations between other  states of the Commonwealth as well. If they demonstrate their  readiness then we shall find appropriate practical solutions.    To speak about Russia and Belarus, I'd like to stress that  we  act in strict correspondence with the will of our peoples aimed  at a maximum closening of our states.    We are ready to transfer to a combination of various forms  of  integration. Russia is ready to determine legal dimensions of  mutual relations with those who are interested in closer  interaction. It will cooperate on another basis with those who  adhere to another position.    We put forward one major provision--any agreement should be  fulfilled. Russia is ready to make certain concessions minding  the pressing interests of our partners. However, any  concessions should be mutual. Otherwise, we shall not be able  to gain a mutually beneficial cooperations.    Strengthening of economic union necessitates a close  interaction in other spheres as well.    First of all we must care about a reliable guarding of the  Commonwealth's external borders, strengthening of stability  inside our countries and their defense from any outside threat.  In addition, any economic community inevitably has common  interests in the foreign economic sphere too.    The Council of the heads of states discussed these issues  and  came to a common point of view.    The head of states have confirmed a new provision on the  Council of Defense Ministers. It takes into consideration  structural changes which happened over the last time in the  field of military cooperation. The Council heard the  information of the Chairman of the CIS frontier forces  commanders on the state of cooperation in the sphere of CIS  external borders' guarding. We have reached principal  agreements on this issue. The parties have signed a memorandum  on the participation of the Commonwealth's states in the  guarding of the external border in the Central-Asian region.    When we understood that there are certain threats to the  Commonwealth's security in the Caucuses, we reached agreements  with the Republic of Georgia and Republic of Armenia on Russia's  participation in the guarding of their external borders. While  discussing this issue, we expressed the hope that Azerbaijan  would join our joint efforts aimed at guarding the  Commonwealth's external border.    The memorandum on join measures providing for guarding  external borders of CIS states with Ukraine and Belarus is also  of great importance. The documents is ready for signing.  [sentence as received]    We are also ready to cooperate with Moldova on this issue.    We have discussed such acute problems as the settlement of  the Karabakh and Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and adopted  documents of political nature in order to give a serious impetus  to the settlement process. Today the heads of CIS states also  paid attention to the situation in Tajikistan. The sitting  passed a resolution to conclude the development of a constituent  agreement and charter of the Aid Fund to the republic of  Tajikistan, this decision expresses our common support to the  inter-Tajik political dialogue.    Simultaneously the heads of states agreed to the proposals  prepared by the Foreign and Defense Ministers on additional  measures aimed at the stabilization of the situation on the  Tajik-Afghan border. The term of the collective peacekeeping  forces' staying in Tajikistan has been prolonged till the end of  1994.    In response to Kyrgyzstan's address the Council of the heads  of states also passed a decision to render assistance to this  country which seriously suffered from natural disasters early  this year.    On the whole we think that we have reached a new stage in  the  development of the Commonwealth. The integration strives of CIS  states start to be implemented by practical deeds. Russia will  not oppose the creation of inter-state structures, however, we  need to precisely determine their prerogatives.    The Commonwealth is getting stronger and stronger as an  efficient regional association of states which is interested in  a close cooperation with the UN, CSCE, and other international  organizations. Currently we see the need to coordinate our  foreign policy as well. The Commonwealth is able to actively  collaborate with our partners in the West, in the South, and in  the East. The main thing is to actively defend joint interests  of the Commonwealth and to participate in global and regional  political problems.    This is the way along which we should go forward in the  interests of the peoples of our countries, in the interests of  the Commonwealth as a whole.    Paraphrasing the old saying, we say now the following: "Let  us take as much cooperation as meets the interest of each of our  states."    On the eve of the summit the majority of the leaders  stressed  the priority of the economic block of the agenda which includes  15 issues (sees Presidential Bulletin No 72). According to many  heads of the states, in particular, Eduard Shevardnadze  (Georgia), Askar Akayev (Kyrgyzstan), Mircea Snegur (Moldova),  Emomali Rakhmonov (Tajikistan), the Inter-state Economic  Committee of the Economic Union of CIS countries can play a  special role in the strengthening of the integration processes.    On the conclusion of the meeting the head of the Belarussian  government Vyacheslav Kebich expressed dissatisfaction with the  fact that instead of signing documents on the creation of an  inter-state economic committee in charge of coordination of  economic work of CIS countries and adoption of decisions in this  sphere, the summit has created "an amorphous" body under the  coordinating-consultative committee-commission of the economic  union which has purely consultative functions.    Kebich believes that under the absence of the inter-state  economic committee CIS economic union "has not worked and will  not work."</p>

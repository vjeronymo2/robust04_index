			<p>CSO     [Text] The president and the vice president of the Chamber  of Deputies, Jorge Schausohn (PPD [Party for Democracy]) and  Alberto Ospina (RN [expansion not available]), respectively,  were in agreement in stating that the new government, in its  first phase, should give priority to social issues in order to  reduce poverty in the country.    The deputies expressed the conviction, separately, that the  time has come to begin to resolve social problems, leaving  political issues for a later phase.    Schaulsohn said that it is time to launch important programs  in the social area and to insist on a substantial reform of the  Isapres [Institute of Public Health and Preventive Medicine]  Law. He also supported the need for a basic study of the social  security system.    However, he said that while the Pension Fund Administration  system has many advantages, it has the great defect that it will  not provide decent pensions to persons of low and medium  incomes, who represent the majority of the population.    He advocated correcting the system, and proposed that the  Chamber of Deputies designate a special commission to make  proposals to restructure, correct, and improve Chile's social  security system, which should be among the top priorities of the  government that, since last Saturday, is headed by President  Frei.    Meanwhile, referring to reforms of existing institutions,  Deputy Alberto Espina said that the opposition is prepared to  approve those constitutional reforms that restore Congress's  investigative powers and facilitate the passage of proposed laws  through Congress.    But the opposition is not disposed to approve those  constitutional reforms, supported by Concertation, aimed at  ending the permanency of the commanders in chief, and other  reforms proposed by the outgoing government, which were included  in the program of Eduardo Frei's administration.    Espina thought it would be advisable, with the presidential  and congressional elections over, to study the binomial  electoral system in order to perfect it, but not to do away with  it.    Asked about the position expressed by Interior Minister  German Correa in favor of preparing a draft bill which would  permit the direct election of mayors, he said that it showed  there was absolute agreement between opposition and government.    He said that the right is in favor of ending the system of  indirect election of mayors, as long as there is no repetition  of the phenomenon that councilmen with 6 percent of the votes  end up running the municipalities, without any kind of  representativity. He repeated that the opposition supports the  passage of that kind of law, emphasizing that "the government  will be able to count on our strongest support for a law of that  kind."    In supporting this initiative, his colleague Schaulsohn said  that it is important that all officeholders be elected by direct  vote, especially mayors, because they have a great  responsibility and because it would prevent maneuvers by  political parties, such as what occurred "with the famous  mayors' protocol," that allowed the placement of persons as  mayors who had not the slightest popular support.    Alberto Espina said that the right is prepared to maintain  close and strict checks on the government, as is appropriate to  a good opposition. But he was also certain, he remarked, that  President Frei would be very rigorous, as he had promised, in  assuring that officials did not abuse their power and that there  would be no symptoms of corruption.    The opposition leader said that, in the social sphere, he is  convinced that if there is good will on the part of the  government and the opposition, decisive steps can be taken to  achieve the social goals that have been laid down.    In Espina's opinion, the government of Eduardo Frei has a  great opportunity to take advantage of the country's current  situation to carry out social programs, especially as there are  no elections on the horizon. Therefore, he believed it crucial  that an immediate start be made to resolve problems in health  and education, and in confronting the problem of poverty.    Otherwise, he said, the recently begun administration will  waste a great opportunity for the country. "I am convinced--he  repeated--that if there is good will on the part of the  government and the opposition, decisive steps can be taken to  achieve the social goals that have been set."    Asked whether that meant the opposition is prepared to  approve more financing to fight poverty, he replied that the  opposition has always been prepared to give the government all  of the facilities really needed to fight poverty, not with words  or demagoguery, recalling that the leadership of the RN said  that it desired the greatest success for the government "because  the government's success is Chile's success."    The vice president of the Chamber of Deputies said yesterday  that the binomial electoral system must be carefully studied, in  order to reveal its strengths and its defects, for the purpose  of correcting and perfecting it, but not of changing it for the  corrected proportional system.</p>

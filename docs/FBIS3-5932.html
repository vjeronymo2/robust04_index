That is common knowledge in Nagata-cho. The  ruling and opposition parties are divided over whether they are  pro-Ozawa or anti-Ozawa. Factions and groups are being sorted  out even within the coalition parties and the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP]. An incredible person whose name is  listed among the top 10 "men disliked" and "men liked." He  turns out to have played a lead role also in the course of  events leading up to the rejection of the bills on political  reform.    Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, supreme power-wielder in the Hosokawa  regime and acting director of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  enjoys the game of chess His skill there is between that of a  beginner and a second-class amateur. In Nagata-cho that puts him  into the category of "strong man."    Chess is a "game of decisions. "Should I gamble here, or  should I wait patiently for my next chance? -- one is constantly  being pressed to decide. A weak person is frequently defensive  when he should take the offensive and fades into a loss.    Mr. Ozawa is different in that respect. One who has gone up  against him rates Mr. Ozawa's chess this way: "He's the type who  initiates offensive moves. He's not good at closely watching his  opponent's moves. He tries to cut the way open on his own.  There's no `defense' in Mr. Ozawa's moves. Another  characteristic is that, when the situation is unfavorable, he  doesn't struggle fruitlessly. Before really getting into a bind,  he accepts defeat. I don't know if you'd call that gallant, but  he's a man more embarrassed by a vain struggle than by defeat."    Such a tendency can be glimpsed also in his politicking.    "He has the image of a schemer; but his tactic is the  tactless method of frontal attack. He's the direct opposite of  former premier Noboru Takeshita, who would just wait for the  ripe fruit to fall. Seeking `a frontal breakthrough' by force,  he has often failed."    So said an LDP leader, referring to the Tokyo gubernatorial  election of three years ago, on 21 January [1994] after the  political reform bills were rejected in the upper house plenary  session.    The LDP secretary general at that time, Mr. Ozawa had former  Japan Broadcasting Corporation newscaster Hisanori Isomura run  so as to topple the incumbent governor, Shunichi Suzuki.  Conversely, however, that had angered Mr. Suzuki and led to an  election splitting the conservatives. With Mr. Isomura's  crushing defeat, Mr. Ozawa said, "I accept full blame for the  outcome. It is enough for me alone to take responsibility." And  he just resigned from his position as secretary general.    The recent rejection of the political reform bills may be an  even greater failure than the earlier defeat. Mr. Ozawa seem to  have misread the outlook; he shows the sign of being disturbed.    During the week before the vote in the upper house plenary  session, Mr. Ozawa was acting quite energetic. On the 14th, he  showed enthusiasm when the LDP side secretly approached him with  the compromise proposals that 1) a proportional allocation be  made of 280 single-seat constituencies and 230 seats for  proportional representation; 2) proportional representation  would be done by totaling votes for nationwide units, and those  successfully elected would be determined for each of seven blocs  nationwide; and 3) corporate and organizational donations to  individual politicians would be allowed only for politicians in  local constituencies.    He met successively with Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary  general,  on the 15th; with Wataru Kubo, general secretary of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], on the 16th; and with Takeshi  Noda, LDP director of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on  Political Reform, on the 17th. In the meeting with Mr. Kubo, he  said, "We counted the votes, but it's close (whether it will  pass), isn't it." While up to that time he had raced ahead with  his strong course for handling the Diet, he may have become  perplexed because the chance of a rejection had emerged.    It had seemed that his talks with the ruling and opposition  parties, other than the Communist Party, might pull it together;  but the situation changed after newspapers reported the floating  of the compromise proposals as the front-page lead story in  their morning editions on the 19th. By pushing secret  negotiations over the heads of upper house members, he had  angered all the upper house LDP members.    It is even said that a memo in which Mr. Noda leaked the  contents of his talks with Mr. Ozawa was copied and circulated  among upper house LDP officers. In it was detailed the  arrangements for presenting a compromise plan by LDP Secretary  General Mori, then negotiating between the opposition and ruling  parties in the upper house, next having a summit meeting between  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono,  and then agreeing.    It is no wonder the upper house side was angered; it was as  though, before negotiations on a wage increase, an agreed figure  had come out.    On the evening of the 19th, Mr. Ozawa made a phone call to  an  LDP Diet member to whom he had a pipeline and asked, "How is it  going with the upper house LDP members? Now we've led the horse  to the water trough, it'll be bad if we can't make it drink."  After that, Mr. Kono made an intercessory phone call to Mr.  Ozawa, but two hours later Mr. Ozawa again called his LDP Diet  member contact and made this parting shot: "We've decided on  adoption. Tell Kono."    This means Mr. Ozawa had again switched to a hard line. Had  something happened during this two-hour interval? Had he seen  the LDP in the upper house not pulling together, or had he  recovered his confidence in the outcome of a vote which he once  had viewed as uncertain?    But the outcome was rejection. The SDPJ rebels were more  numerous than expected--20 (17 opposing the bills and three  abstaining) -- while the LDP rebels numbered five--less than he  had expected.  <H5>  Ozawa Repeated "Not Yet" Three Times </H5>   Beaming after the rejection, Mr. Kono said, "The style of  managing the Diet by force brought on a reaction," implicitly  criticizing Mr. Ozawa. At the time of the Kaifu cabinet, while  he was a candidate for cabinet and party official posts, he was  opposed by the "Kono- hating" Mr. Ozawa and lost out in both  cases, so the grudge he holds toward Mr. Ozawa is especially  deep. When Mr. Ozawa professed himself to be in "the reform  faction" and raised the banner of Shinseito, Mr. Kono snapped  at him sharply, saying, "What needs to be reformed first of all  are the very dispositions of those men."    Criticism of the Ozawa line is swirling about Nagata-cho.  LDP  upper house Secretary General Tomio Yamamoto says, "It was an  antifascist struggle," while coalition officials also offer the  analysis that "Mr. Ozawa's forceful style invited the outcome of  increasing the number of SDPJ rebels."    If it were chess, Mr. Ozawa would quickly admit defeat at  this point. However, it is no longer so-called era of  "Kon-Chiku-Sho" [Kanemaru, Takeshita, and Ozawa -- also, a  common Japanese curse, "Damn it"] when Ozawa was LDP secretary  general and had the backing of Takeshita and Shin Kanemaru,  former LDP vice president; things have changed and Ozawa faces  with a fierce power struggle.    An SDPJ official says, "Mr. Ozawa appears to have been  defeated, but actually has not. Hereafter, if the governing  coalition parties swallow the LDP's demands whole, within both  the LDP and the SDPJ internal struggles will begin between  pro-reform group and the go-slow group over whether to accept  them. His real aim probably is to induce the breakup of both  the LDP and SDPJ."    However, the LDP plan was once rejected and killed in the  lower house. The , SDPJ will also find it hard to concede to  regulations barring corporate and organizational donations. Even  if the Executive Department decides on a concession, if more  rebels emerge and lead to a party rupture, the coalition regime  will collapse.    If the political reform bills are killed, would Prime  Minister Hosokawa dissolve the lower house and call for general  elections or have the cabinet resign en bloc since he has said  that he "will take political responsibility?    With this recession, could he dissolve the Diet without  having drawn up a budget for this fiscal year? Even Komeito, a  coalition partner of Shinseito , strongly opposes.    Calling for an en-bloc resignation, however, if it were just  to replace the prime minister with deputy prime minister,  Tsutomu Hata, or the foreign minister, for example, would  scarcely win the understanding of the nation.    It indeed appears that Mr.Ozawa is now in a fix and is truly  waging a fruitless struggle that will embarrass himself. At the  government-ruling parties leadership meeting, the night of the  21st, when the draft bills had been rejected, he said, exposing  the details of his compromise maneuvers with the LDP, "I had an  agreement with the LDP Executive Department, but they broke  their promises," thus trying to pin responsibility on the LDP.  It was unusual for Mr. Ozawa, who is known for being  tight-lipped. That might very well be an indication of his sense  of defeat and frustration.    When the bills were rejected, Mr. Ozawa said as if to rouse  himself to action, "Well then, it's one more round." To the  reporters' question, "Is it a plan gone awry?" he answered three  times, "Not yet, not yet, not yet."    About the same time, the leaders who had gathered in the  LDP's lower house secretary general's office broke out in  cheers when they saw the rejection on television. But, just one  person, Chairman Ryotaro Hashimoto of the Policy Affairs  Research Council, rebuked them all, saying, "Don't whoop it up!"  Mr. Ozawa's rival knows well what his "next move" will be.</p>

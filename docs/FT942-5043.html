			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Finance house lending shows dip during April UK consumers borrowed less money through finance houses to buy items such as cars, large household goods and DIY items in April, official statistics showed yesterday. But the level of credit-card purchases continued to rise. Net lending to UK consumers through finance houses, bank credit cards and building society loans fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 413m during April, down from Pounds 518m the previous month, the Central Statistical Office said. The figure was stronger than the markets had expected, with most analysts previously predicting a fall to Pounds 300m net credit. Indeed, economists yesterday played down the monthly dip, insisting that the underlying trend of consumer spending was still relatively strong. Measured on a three-monthly basis - a more accurate indicator of the underlying trend - net consumer lending rose to Pounds 1,282m in the three months to April, up from Pounds 1,079m in the previous three months. Nevertheless, the breakdown of the monthly figures suggests some slowdown in the use of credit for the purchase of large retail items such as cars or white goods, analysts said. Although this is at odds with the recent strong retail sales data, the figures tally with recent surveys pointing to continuing low levels of consumer confidence. They may also suggest that consumers have become more cautious about taking on medium-term credit. Overall, the amount of new credit advanced to consumers fell sharply from Pounds 5.214bn in March to Pounds 4.848bn in April. Net lending by finance houses - a category which covers credit for cars and most large retail store items - fell to Pounds 300m, down from Pounds 431m in March. Meanwhile, the level of new credit advanced by finance houses fell to Pounds 1,864bn, down from Pounds 1.993bn in March. A drop in lending for car sales accounted for much of this dip. Net new credit for car purchases, which represents about half of finance-house lending, fell to Pounds 871m, down from Pounds 968m the previous month. This drop appears to be at odds with May's car sales figures, which indicated a pick-up in car purchases. Analysts yesterday suggested car fleet purchases may have distorted the figures, pointing out that the trend in car sales earlier this year had been down.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Civil jurisdiction is clarified - European Court The European Court has clarified the extent to which the 1968 Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters applies to judgments given in non-contracting states. The ECJ said the convention, and in particular rules on lis pendens (actions pending in other courts) and related actions, do not apply to proceedings, or issues arising in proceedings, in contracting states concerning the recognition and enforcement of judgments given in civil and commercial matters in non-contracting states. The Court gave its ruling in response to questions of interpretation referred to it by the House of Lords in the context of enforcement proceedings relating to a judgment of the High Court of Saint Vincent. That court had ordered the defendants, Bracco Industria Chimica, and its chairman and managing director, Fulvio Bracco, both domiciled in Italy, to repay a cash loan of SFr9m claimed to have been made by the plaintiffs, Owens Bank Ltd, in 1979. The defendants denied the existence of any loan and alleged Owens Bank relied on forged documents and false testimony. When Owens applied to enforce the Saint Vincent order in Italy in July 1989, the defendants claimed the order had been obtained by fraud. When Owens Bank later applied to an English Court for a declaration under the Administration of Justice Act 1920 that the Saint Vincent order was enforceable in England, the defendants again said the order had been obtained by fraud. They also argued that the English Court should decline jurisdiction or stay the proceedings pending conclusion of the Italian enforcement proceedings, relying on the provisions of the Convention relating to lis pendens and related actions. In particular, they contended the question whether Owens Bank had obtained judgment by fraud was an issue which would be examined in both English and Italian enforcement proceedings. The ECJ noted that the procedure under section 9 of the Administration of Justice Act 1920 involved the registration of the foreign judgment so that it could be enforced in the same way as a judgment given by an English court. The Court also took into account that section 9 provides that a judgment may not be registered if obtained by fraud or if it concerns a cause of action excluded from the jurisdiction of the English court for reasons of public policy. If such a judgment is registered, it is open to challenge in legal proceedings and the court dealing with the matter may consequently order the issue to be determined by a trial between the parties. The ECJ, thus, defined the context in which the House of Lords asked it to interpret the Convention as proceedings intended to pave the way in one of the states party to Convention to the execution of a judgment given in a civil and commercial matter in a non-contracting state. The Court ruled the Convention does not apply to proceedings for the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters in non-contracting states nor to an issue arising in such proceedings, such as the question whether the judgment in question was obtained by fraud. It said the express wording of Title III of the Convention showed the procedures for recognition and enforcement apply only to decisions given by a contracting state. The Court also rejected the defendants' arguments that decisions relating to an issue arising in enforcement proceedings, such as the fraud issue, were independent of the enforcement proceedings and should be recognised in other contracting States. C-129//92, Owens Bank v Bracco, ECJ 6CH, January 20 1994. Eurocontrol escapes EC rules In the context of Belgian proceedings in which the German airline SAT relied on an alleged abuse of a dominant position as a defence to claims by Eurocontrol for payment of air traffic control fees, the ECJ held Eurocontrol was not an 'undertaking' in the meaning of EC competition rules. C-364/92, SAT v Eurocontrol, ECJ FC, January 19 1994. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Maryukha: "Social Protection for the </F> Military Is Primarily Necessary To Protect Russia's Interests"]    [Text] While the military budget is being "shaken up" in  an attempt to save 18 trillion [rubles] at the Army's expense  the mass media are raking up fusty arguments and saying that "we  are all hostages of the military-industrial complex." Even the  government's ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, lobbying for a reduction in  defense spending, writes about the "occupation regime of the  Russian military-industrial complex." And says that there is no  need to intimidate people with the sociopolitical consequences  of underfunding of the defense sphere since that is just a case  of shenanigans on the part of "military-industrial complex  bigwigs" and generals opposed to army reform.    The unprecedentedly involved "case of the 18 trillion on  defense," where everyone seems to be "in favor" and there is  still no money for the military, by no means constitutes an  attack by military-industrial complex hawks on the limited state  budget. The minimum figure requested by the Defense Ministry  has been decided in accordance with the following principle:  "Think about the Motherland first and then about yourselves."  Therefore the list of defense spending that has been submitted  for ratification is a balanced combination of spending on  maintaining the troops' combat capability ("undiluted" state  interest, so to speak) and on social protection for servicemen,  which -- albeit indirectly -- also affects the state's defense  capability. Thus the argument over whether or not to provide  the money has long since changed from being a financial  "wrangle" to being the subject of political speculation that may  explode the situation around and within the Army.    However, these "explosions" are already regrettably becoming  a reality instead of just projections. In particular, an acute  conflict situation has arisen among the Northern Fleet's  military construction workers. A kind of protest action akin to  a strike has even been held here. Needless to say, that is  quite intolerable in army conditions. Although the demands do  not go beyond what they were promised by the state -- the  military are asking for their debts to be repaid. Yet the state  owes money not only to the men of the Northern Fleet and not  only for pay, which is commonly paid two or three months late in  the Army and the Navy.    When this edition has been signed to press, the State Duma  will start discussing the question of social guarantees for  servicemen. It is not worth speculating how the discussion will  go, whether the State Duma's Defense Committee will succeed in  persuading the government and deputies that playing financial  games with the Army is intolerable, just as it is intolerable to  reduce its standard of living below the lower limit beyond which  chaos sets in. It is better to turn once again to the facts and  figures, which, incidentally, were collected by parliamentarians  themselves at the Northern Fleet. This trip took place in  mid-May, but since then there has been no change for the better  and the Duma has not had time to examine the submitted  documents. However, the report sent to State Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin and addressed to all deputies deals with not so much the  military aspect of the Northern Fleet's problems, on which  servicemen themselves usually focus, as the social aspect. And  this is even more dispiriting than the situation as regards  combat training or shipments of new arms and manning of units.    Thus, as of 1 March just 40.5 percent of the required sum  had  been allocated for the upkeep of the Northern Fleet as a whole.  At the same time there are now 1,487 families without  apartments in the Northern Fleet, and the number of such  families will rise while the number of apartments in the fleet's  housing stock will drop owing to the impossibility of evicting  people discharged into the reserve from closed garrisons.  Around 2,500 families will lose their ties with the Navy this  year and they are to be allocated, in line with current  legislation, money to build housing outside garrisons. Nor is  there enough money to look after those who are serving. The  money allocated last year was barely enough to build just 242  apartments, of which Northern Fleet servicemen have only  received 169.    Or take medical support. Navy garrisons have half as many  medics as the Murmansk Oblast average. Things are even worse  with regard to hospitals and the prevention of disease among  children. Some 90 percent of children under 16 have been  deprived of the triple course of multivitamin treatment  prescribed for polar regions, and naval families are beset by  illnesses that are unthinkable for children of this age --  anemia, diabetes. Over a third of schoolchildren study on a  second shift -- there is barely 50 percent of the required  number of schools -- and sometimes classes are held in unfit  buildings. Thus we are not even talking about the military  themselves, who are accustomed to "burdens and privations"; the  trillions, if they appear on a platter, will be used to revive  Russia's gene pool. And for the social readjustment of the  quite able-bodied citizens who have been discharged from the  service. And to implement articles of laws that have been  announced but are not in force, thus undermining faith in the  foundations of the state.    Regrettably, judging by the way in which the holey blanket  of  the state budget is being "pulled" this way and that, you have  to see all this for yourself, wear uniform, and serve the  Fatherland not out of fear but out of conscience in order to  realize that the Army is not asking for anything unnecessary.  It needs firm social guarantees with financial backup rather  than laments that everyone is having a hard time of it today.  The requested minimum sum will not ensure that servicemen have  an easy life, it only guarantees Russia's security, for which  men in uniform are accountable.</p>

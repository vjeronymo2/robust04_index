			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI recovery Shares in ICI recovered from recent weakness, improving 16 to 802p, as some of the gloomier analysts appeared to be taking a more benign view of the company. Hoare Govett, a former company broker which has been consistently bearish, argued that stabilisation in mainland Europe and a firmer base to the sector might render ICI slightly more attractive. Although he stressed he was not yet changing his stance, Mr Martin Evans of Hoare said: 'Given anecdotal comments from the European chemical industry. . . (ICI could) . . . surprise both internal and external observers by the magnitude and momentum of the response to better trading conditions.' Encouragement from a strong overnight performance on Wall Street fuelled interest in the high profile debut of House of Fraser. The confidence that fed into the UK market from New York encouraged institutions to take larger positions in the new stock. The shares closed at a premium of 6 1/2 to their issue price of 180p and turnover of 22m shares was the second heaviest in London. However, the initial performance of the largest flotation this year did no more than match market expectations considering the favourable trading conditions. And some analysts were slightly disappointed at the volume traded. Much of the business was conducted by SG Warburg, the company broker, and most of the buying came from UK institutions. Anticipation that Boots would sell its pharmaceutical division prompted active trading in the stock. Interest was sharpened by Boots' appointment of Credit Suisse to handle a future unbundling of the drugs arm. UBS was a keen buyer of the stock. The shares added 12 at 519p in a turnover of 3.5m. Confirmation by Associated British Foods that it was in talks to sell its Baker's Oven chain of bakery outlets to Greggs pushed the AB Foods shares up 6 to 583p in thin turnover. Greggs was unchanged at 743p. International conglomerate Hanson slipped 4 to 265p, with one US brokerage said to have been an active seller. Pharmaceutical group Glaxo improved 12 to 618p after recent underperformance as the shares responded to earlier strength on Wall Street and the company confirmed that Serevent, its anti-asthma treatment, went on sale in the US. Media and leisure conglomerate Pearson languished after one investor sold a block of 1.8m shares at 621p, well below the market price. Analysts said the shares had outperformed the FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share Index by more than 40 per cent over the past year in spite of recent falls, and investors had used last week's purchase of Software Toolworks as an opportunity to take profits. Pearson closed 7 easier at 631p with 5.2m shares traded, unusually high for the stock. The oil sector passed what one specialist described as its first real post-Opec test, with most oil issues moving ahead strongly after a resilient performance by crude oil prices, which held comfortably above the Dollars 14 a barrel level. Oil major British Petroleum rose 7 to 357p on turnover of 14m amid talk of good US demand, while Shell Transport, after Hoare Govett reaffirmed its positive stance on the stock, gained 9 at 671p. Lasmo continued recent good performance, the shares adding 5 at 129p on 10m dealt, after support from the UK and US. Retail bank National Westminster, the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 relative to the FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share Index during the last quarter, improved 7 to 476p amid talk of substantial switching out of Barclays. The latter settled 3 firmer at 536p. SG Warburg spearheaded a general advance by the merchant banks, closing 21 ahead at 778p, helped by the rally in markets in recent sessions. Engineering group GKN put on 14 at 555p after Kleinwort Benson turned positive on the stock. Several other brokers also bought the stock on a view that the acquisition of Westland Group will enhance earnings. Volume in aerospace and motor components group Lucas Industries jumped to 8.1m and the shares moved 4 ahead to 193p after Credit Lyonnais Laing reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker was also a buyer of British Steel -  3/4 up at 141 3/4 p on turnover of 9.3m - following a visit to the company. Hard hit Fisons rose 3 to 132p with the help of a buy recommendation from BZW. Bid speculation returned to Brent International as the shares gained 3 at 118 1/2 p. The improvement marked a 20 per cent rise in the troubled chemical company's share price since its low just after announcing a reduced dividend and profits in early March. Good results off the field for Manchester United made up for recently lost ground. The shares rallied 15 to 675p. Hotel group City Centre added 3 at 82p on well-received figures. Elsewhere, Stakis was heavily traded as nil-paid stock from the recent rights issue came on to the market. There were rumours that the Stakis family had unloaded large blocks of equity, with one lump of 5.6m shares said to have been placed at 80 1/4 p. The ordinary shares finished the day firmer at 80 1/2 p in volume of 6.5m. Turnover in the nil-paid soared to 20m, with the price adding  1/2 at 8 1/2 p. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bounced 4 to 509p as market watchers pondered the implications of a reported tussle over certain aspects of the underwriting of its impending rights issue.</p>

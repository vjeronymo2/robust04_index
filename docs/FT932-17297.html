			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: William Baird shares dip as earnings fall to 14p HEAVY restructuring costs at textiles and engineering group William Baird pushed earnings per share for 1992 down to 14.1p from 16.5p. The shares fell 22p to 266p. The company has not yet implemented the FRS3 accounting standard so restructuring costs did not reduce the pre-tax profit figure of Pounds 23.4m, compared with Pounds 25.1m. Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 439.8m (Pounds 419.8m). There is a second interim dividend in lieu of a final of 5.35p, making an unchanged total of 8.9p. The early payment is to allow low non-taxpaying shareholders, such as pension funds, to benefit from current rules on advance corporation tax. Profits at the company's textiles operations rose slightly to Pounds 23.7m from Pounds 23.2m. The outlook for the current year was promising given two acquisitions last year of Berkertex and Van Gils, said Mr Donald Parr, chairman. However, he said that the fall in the value of sterling against the dollar, which has been widely welcomed by textiles companies, would not be felt until the second half of 1993 when existing currency hedging arrangements expired. Profits at Darchem, the engineering division fell from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 5.2m as disposals and closures continued to shrink the business. The reorganisation of Darchem had been completed at a cost shown as an extraordinary item, of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 3.9m).</p>

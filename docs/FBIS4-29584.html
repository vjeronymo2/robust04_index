			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 KYODO -- Former Japanese Defense  Minister Taku Yamasaki said Saturday that North Korea hopes to  set up diplomatic ties with Japan, but will seek revenge if  Tokyo supports economic sanctions against Pyongyang.    Yamasaki arrived in Beijing on Saturday after holding four  days of discussions on the nuclear issue in North Korea with Kim  Yong-son and Hwang Chang-yop, both secretaries of the Workers'  Party, and Kim Chang-kon, vice director of the party's  international department, he told reporters at Beijing airport.    Although the North Korean officials said Pyongyang hopes "to  establish formal diplomatic ties with Japan as soon as  possible," they warned Japan that revenge would be taken if  Tokyo supports pending U.N. Security council economic sanctions,  he said.    The North Korean leaders also reiterated that economic  sanctions against Pyongyang would be regarded as "a declaration  of war," said Yamasaki, a member of Japan's main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party.    Yamasaki, a House of Representatives member who formerly  headed the Defense Agency, said the North Koreans renewed a  pledge to freeze their nuclear program, including abolishing  their radiochemical laboratory, if their present graphite-based  nuclear reactor is replaced by a light-water reactor.    North Korea is now developing a graphite reactor capable of  producing weapons-grade plutonium, while a light-water reactor  does not produce such plutonium.    Kim Yong-son told Yamasaki that International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspectors would not be allowed to inspect two  suspected nuclear sites which North Korea has not declared to  the IAEA because the "facilities are military facilities," he  said.    Yamasaki said he did not meet former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter during his stay in Pyongyang. Carter also left North  Korea on Saturday following a four-day visit.</p>

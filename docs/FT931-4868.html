			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker down 22% CORNWELL PARKER, the furniture and fabrics group, blamed recession for a 22 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to January 31. Profits fell from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 2.92m on reduced sales of Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 44.1m). The furniture division started the year with low order books resulting in a fall in revenue in the first six months. Margins, however, were maintained and a trading profit of Pounds 2.23m was earned on turnover of Pounds 24.8m. Fabrics made a trading profit of Pounds 882,000 on sales of Pounds 18.4m. The operation has been affected by the 50 per cent fall in the number of people moving house since 1989. Borrowings rose from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 4.7m, reflecting the acquisition of Fardis, the French furnishing fabric business, giving gearing of 10 per cent. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p, payable from earnings per share of 4.6p (6.2p).</p>

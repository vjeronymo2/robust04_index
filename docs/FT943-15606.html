			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Technology: Changes in store at the grocery - Hugh Carnegy looks at how two Swedish groups have streamlined their supply and distribution services, in a series on electronic retailing When ICA Retailers, Sweden's largest retail group, was considering upgrading the technology backing supply and distribution in one of its three geographic divisions four years ago, it found itself confronting some glaring inefficiencies. The three divisions operated with a large degree of autonomy, had their own supply and distribution systems and often had differing marketing strategies. Meanwhile, the environment within which ICA was operating was changing fast. A spate of deregulation during the 1980s had sharply increased competitive pressures and was set to continue as Sweden applied to join the European Union. A looming recession threatened to hone competition even more keenly. The advent of commercial television networks meant that an organisation such as ICA could, for the first time, run effective nationwide marketing campaigns. So ICA, a co-operative group with turnover last year of SKr60bn (Pounds 5bn) and a 35 per cent share of Sweden's retail grocery market, decided in 1990 to scrap its three-pronged structure and combine its operations throughout the country, underpinned by an integrated information technology system. Three years and SKr500m later, ICA makes the bold claim to have one of the world's most advanced systems for the grocery wholesale industry and in-store back-office operations. At much the same time, ICA's biggest competitor, the Swedish Co-operative Union (KF), was also preparing for change. The sprawling conglomerate has since 1992 embarked on a strategy of shedding its myriad industrial interests to concentrate on the retail sector. In the process, KF last year signed what was then described as Europe's biggest IT services contract when it brought in Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the General Motors subsidiary, to handle its IT needs. A key part of the deal, to be worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 666m) over 10 years, is the upgrading of KF's retail supply and distribution services. While KF continues to wrestle with its vast restructuring project, ICA has already largely transformed itself. With the help of Andersen Consulting, it set up two divisions, ICA Partihandel to operate the wholesale side and ICA Detaljhandel to operate the retail services end. The two are tightly bound together by a communications network which integrates and links ICA's 2,700 individual stores with the group's distribution, sales and marketing operations. This consists of a so-called backbone network based on the national telecommunications network provided by Telia, the Swedish state telecom company, and an X25 communications network. The backbone system ties together the computer and telephone systems of ICA's nationwide organisation, while the X25 network, with 138 nodes, or intersections, allows all the individual stores to connect to the backbone. From the storeowner standing in the aisle of his supermarket punching in his day-to-day product needs into a hand-held device, orders can be channelled back automatically through the ICA systems, combined and rationalised with other orders flowing in from elsewhere, then directed to the appropriate distribution point and, ultimately, to the supplier. In the other direction, goods are tracked out to the stores, on to the shelves and through the check-out. Sales information and centralised marketing campaigns are also fed out through the system. 'The idea is to get supplies to the retailer as quickly and as cheaply as possible,' says Ake Westerlund, ICA's data project leader. The target of cutting ICA's logistics costs by 50 per cent by 1995 appears to be well in sight. The efficiencies the system allows in correlating and managing orders has led to a radical shake-up of ICA's distribution network. Half of the group's 22 regional distribution centres have been shut and the number of central warehouses has shrunk to two from three. By enhancing its knowledge of its own demands, ICA has been able to move away from a system of individual suppliers transporting their goods to several ICA distribution centres to a so-called cross-docking operation. This involves suppliers delivering to one ICA centre where goods are reloaded on to ICA transports. ICA now has two cross-docking centres, in the southern cities of Gothenburg and Helsingborg, and it is planning a third in the Stockholm area. Although this appears to add an extra link in the distribution chain, the cut it allows in the number of local distribution centres and the lower prices it enables ICA to force out of suppliers more than pays for the cross-docking facilities. Transport costs are squeezed as delivery trucks are used at maximum capacity and inventories are kept much lower than previously. 'In the past, suppliers delivered weekly to each distribution centre. Therefore, the distribution centres had to keep about one week's worth of supplies. Now, deliveries are made daily and inventories have been reduced by 50 per cent. We are getting larger volumes through fewer centres,' says Richard Hill of Andersen Consulting. KF, with an 18 per cent share of Sweden's total retail market, is following a similar path from a different starting point. It always served as the supply and distribution organisation for the many co-operative retail chains within its empire, but is now seeking to modernise and further integrate its systems. Five store chains - the Konsum supermarkets, Obs] hypermarkets, B&amp;W hypermarkets, Fakta discount chain and Obs] Interior stores - are served by one supply and distribution organisation. KF has also used Andersen Consulting to advise it on how best to organise such a complex operation. It, too, has reduced its distribution centres, from 13 to 11, and has opened a cross-docking centre in the southern city of Malmo. Urban Strand, KF's IT manager, says the organisation was quick to introduce point-of-sale links to back-office operations, for example through the use of check-out scanners. But he says a new generation is now required to integrate further the point-of-sales systems back through the chain to the suppliers. This is what EDS is working on. 'What EDS has done is take over the monitoring and enhancement of the system. We have all the information - we need the applications to put it together to make distribution more efficient,' says Strand. Ultimately, at the store level, it seems, systems could be developed to the point where orders were automatically triggered from point-of-sale monitoring of the flow of goods out of the stores. The store manager might have little more to do than monitor the system. Hill says ICA already has a system which is 'completely on-line', from the central network out to its 'Budica' in-store network. The latter allows not just the control of the flow of goods in and out of the shop, but also carries information on marketing campaigns, produces weekly analyses of a store's operations and sales trends, pricing models, E-mail links to the rest of the ICA network and staff training programmes. The complete ICA network is 'functionally richer than any other we have ever been involved with throughout the world', says Hill. But customers at least may be comforted to know that neither ICA nor KF envisage the elimination of the human factor. Both say store managers will always want and need to talk to their supply points about the availability of certain products and make subjective decisions on ordering - particularly for fresh goods. And, says KF's Strand, there is no technological substitute for the manager on the supermarket floor gauging the tastes of customers.</p>

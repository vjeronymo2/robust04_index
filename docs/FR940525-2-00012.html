			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Development of a Repository and a MRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the Act was passed, the Department anticipated that a geologic repository would be in operation and prepared to begin acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. As indicated above, when the Standard Contract was promulgated, the Department envisioned that it would have a waste management facility in operation and would be prepared to begin acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides for a comprehensive site selection and site characterization process, wherein the Department makes a recommendation to the President for approval of a repository. Currently, the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada is the only site authorized by the Congress for site characterization. Should Yucca Mountain prove scientifically suitable, and be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and approved by the Congress, the Department currently projects that the earliest possible date for acceptance of waste for disposal at a repository is 2010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to availability of an MRS to accept and temporarily store spent nuclear fuel, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 (Amendments Act) linked the development schedule for an MRS facility to the geologic repository. The Amendments Act precludes the Department from selecting an MRS site until a repository site is recommended to the President, and MRS construction may not be started until a construction authorization for a repository is received from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Given these timing restrictions, the Department has looked to the negotiated siting process, administered by the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, and a negotiated agreement proposing a site to the Congress as the appropriate mechanism for achieving the 1998 waste acceptance target. Experience has shown that there are significant challenges associated with siting any facility of this type. Thus far, neither the efforts of the Department nor any other organization, including the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, have achieved the level of success needed to realize significant progress in locating and developing a site by 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an April 1, 1993, letter to the Secretary of Energy, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) proposed that a collaborative dialogue be initiated to identify and develop constructive recommendations for the Secretary and others for their consideration in evaluating alternatives for interim spent nuclear fuel storage. In order to establish a dialogue whose participants represented a broad range of affected interests, NARUC extended invitations to state utility regulators, nuclear utility executives, environmental groups, and representatives from the State of Nevada. Individuals from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were invited to provide technical assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the course of three meetings, the participants identified alternatives for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel, and considered the advantages and disadvantages of each. On February 25, 1994, NARUC issued the Report and Recommendations of the NARUC Dialogue on Spent Fuel Management, presenting the results of this stakeholder dialogue. In summary, the majority findings of the NARUC dialogue were that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Centralized off-site interim storage of spent fuel is far preferable to on-site storage at reactor sites throughout the country. The federal government should take immediate action to establish centralized interim storage capability by 1998, including the commencement of an effort to develop such capability at one or more federal sites. This represents a sensible, safe, economic approach to meeting the nation's near term spent fuel management needs. The participants recognize that Congressional action is necessary to effectuate many of the recommendations. They also recognize that this is a difficult issue and are ready to actively assist the federal government in discharging its responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Department's Waste Acceptance Obligation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many utilities have maintained that certain terms in the Act and the Standard Contract created an unconditional obligation on behalf of the Department to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. Some of these utilities have informed the Department that they have implemented long term waste management plans based on this interpretation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's preliminary view is that it has no statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel beginning in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or other facility constructed under the Act, although the Department in implementing the Standard Contract may have created an expectation that it would begin accepting such spent nuclear fuel in 1998. Accordingly, the Secretary has indicated her intent to explore with affected parties various options and methods for sharing the costs related to the financial burden associated with continued on-site storage. Any form of cost sharing offered through the Nuclear Waste Fund is not intended to fulfill the Department's ultimate obligation under the Standard Contract to take title to and physical possession of spent nuclear fuel once a facility constructed under the Act is operational.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Purpose of Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Notice of Inquiry is intended to implement the Secretary's initiative by eliciting the views of affected parties on: (1) The Department's preliminary view that it does not have a statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or other facility constructed under the Act; (2) the need for an interim, away-from-reactor storage facility prior to repository operations; and (3) options for offsetting, through the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund, a portion of the financial burden that may be incurred by utilities in continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the Department proceed with some form of cost sharing, each utility would be offered an opportunity to modify its Standard Contract. As a condition of such cost sharing, it is possible that the Department may require a release, in whole or in part, of potential contractual liability arising out of any obligation to accept waste prior to commencement of repository operation or the operation of another facility constructed under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that there are a number of potential forms of cost sharing arrangements, but at this time, the Department has not reached a decision whether to proceed with, nor is it predisposed to, any particular form of cost sharing. Currently, the Department is evaluating a design for multi-purpose canisters (MPC) to support spent nuclear fuel transportation, storage, and disposal. The MPC offers the potential for considerable standardization, simplification and, consequently, cost savings for both utilities and the Federal waste management system. Given the potential benefits of the MPC, the Secretary has directed that the options to be explored by the Department should include, to the maximum extent possible, the provision and use of MPCs to address both schedule and cost concerns arising from the potential unavailability of a repository or an MRS in 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

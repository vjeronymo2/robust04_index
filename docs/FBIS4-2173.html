Prior to the signing ceremony this afternoon, Chinese Vice-  Premier Li Lanqing met with Kentaroo Aikawa, general manager of  the Japanese Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Yasuo  Matsukawa, general manager of the Tomen Co., who have been here  to attend the ceremony.    The equipment worth 95 million U.S. dollars is to be  provided  for the fourth phase of the Qinhuangdao Coal Terminal Project,  which is one of the key construction projects of the eighth  five-year plan (1991-1995).    According to the contract, China will import a whole coal  terminal loading and unloading system, affiliated equipment and  computer control system.

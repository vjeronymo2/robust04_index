			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Rabin Is Besieging  Christopher's Mission Anew," AL-BA'TH says: When the head of  the Israeli Government sees that there is no use for peace, this  means he still follows the policy of separate solutions and  partial deals and still obstructs the mission of the U.S.  diplomat who seeks to activate the peace process.    AL-BA'TH adds: Rabin is trying to lay siege to Christopher's  mission to make it fail, just like his other recent tours. Rabin  may have found an acceptance of his conditions by some who are  going to the talks through his separate deals. Syria, however,  is determined to adhere to its constant, principled positions  that reject any solution that does not restore Arab rights.    In conclusion, AL-BA'TH says withdrawal from the Golan,  southern Lebanon, and the rest of the occupied Arab territories  is a primary condition for peace, stipulated by the peace  initiative. Syria will continue to adhere to its constants and  to its commitment to international legitimacy. It restates that  it is not in a hurry and that the party obstructing the peace  process will bear the consequences, sooner or later.    Under the headline "Rabin's Threats," TISHRIN says: The  clearly threatening tone in Rabin's speech about opportunities  for peace, Rabin's establishment of a timeframe for signing a  peace agreement with Syria, and his statement that if this is  not achieved, he will propose supplying the Israeli Army with  weapons in preparation for the prospect of war -- all these  threats and statements include fallacies. They represent an  obvious attempt to falsify facts, strike a blow at the peace  process, and raise tension in the region.    The paper adds: Syria has dealt with the U.S. initiative and  the question of peace very seriously. It has made concrete  suggestions to make progress in the peace process.    The paper says Rabin's statements are an obvious attempt to  thwart the mission of the U.S. secretary before it even starts.  TISHRIN says Rabin's threats do not frighten Syria. Everybody  knows there can be no peace in the region without Syria. All  the fragile agreements that have been concluded are destined to  fail utterly if Israel does not submit to the resolutions and  principles of international legitimacy and the foundations of  the Madrid conference by withdrawing from all the Golan and  southern Lebanon and restoring Arab rights.    TISHRIN concludes: If the peace process is to collapse  because of Israel's intransigence and evil intentions, then  Israel alone will be to blame for its failure. The  international community and the parties sponsoring the peace  process should intervene to correct things and stand up to and  deter Israel's belligerent threats.</p>

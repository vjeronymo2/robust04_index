			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: US investors look abroad for higher returns US INVESTORS bought a record Dollars 51.5bn in foreign stocks and bonds last year as institutions and individuals continued to look overseas to diversify their portfolios and find higher returns. In 1991, US investors bought Dollars 47bn of foreign securities. In contrast, foreign investors were net sellers of US equity securities in 1992, selling Dollars 5.2bn of stocks over the 12 months. In the previous year, overseas investors had been net buyers of US stocks. US investors continued to prefer foreign stocks to bonds, said the Securities Industry Association. However, acquisitions of fixed-income securities grew faster than acquisitions of stocks, the SIA said. In total, US investors bought Dollars 32.1bn of foreign equities, and Dollars 19.4bn of bonds. As always, European markets were the main beneficiaries of US demand, attracting a record Dollars 17bn in direct investment, the bulk of it (Dollars 11.3bn) going into UK stocks. Mr David Strongin, director of international finance at the SIA, said that the UK's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism, and a sharp drop in UK interest rates, made UK equities look especially attractive to US investors. The busiest part of the year for US buying of foreign stocks was the final quarter, which suggests that US investors saw the turmoil in European currency and equity markets as a buying opportunity. Asian markets received Dollars 8.9bn, of which about half went into Japan. US investors bought more Japanese stocks last year than in 1991, an indication that they believed the Tokyo market was heading for a recovery. Interest in other Asian securities was particularly focused on Hong Kong. US investors poured Dollars 2.8bn into the colony in the hope of taking advantage of rapidly-growing Chinese stock markets.</p>

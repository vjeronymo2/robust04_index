Though this prediction might seem a self-fulfilling  prophecy, unless there are unforeseen factors, it would be a  mistake to believe that relations with the United States are  totally devoid of major question marks. In fewer than five  years the big disagreements have disappeared, at least for the  foreseeable future, after the Carlos Menem government explicitly  decided to abandon successive policies (neutrality in  international conflicts, nuclear and missile development,  objections to the world's economic order, and so forth) --  policies upon which Argentina has historically built the various  levels of its relative independence.    Yet while the overestimated ghost of Condor-2, or the  threat,  which has never been quite serious, of a nuclear proliferating  Argentina, or of a country in default with the international  financial system, have faded in the strange post-cold war  atmosphere, there are at least three areas in which the two  countries can disagree.    -- International trade is today the most sensitive area.  Through its efforts to adjust its economy to the demands of  capitalism, Argentina has become the country in the hemisphere  that is most strongly committed to the neoliberal model. In  order to make this bitter medicine easier to swallow, Argentina  bet strongly on the still unfulfilled promises of having access  to productive investment, and of a free and rational economic  order with a minimum level of equitability. Based on Menem's  interpretation of the international situation, the two phenomena  should occur under the leadership of the United States, the only  superpower that survived the old order after the collapse of the  socialist alternative. The U.S. power, however, is concentrated  in the military sector, while its economic power has been  fragmented and has been transferred from the states to the  corporations, which are ruled by the ideology of big, fast  profits. Old certainties, like the ones provided by the Bretton  Woods system, have disappeared. In a recently published article  Godman Sachs International Vice President Robert Hormats said  that the truth is that the industrialized countries have not yet  made the strategic decision to incorporate the 3 billion  inhabitants of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia into an  authentically open global economy and an authentically open  international financial system. The administration of Bill  Clinton last year attached strategic priority to the commercial  issue by implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement  with Canada and Mexico (NAFTA) and by signing the GATT accord.  But after attaining both objectives the Clinton administration  has remained on guard, lying in wait for conflict, threatening  Japan with the legislation known as Super 301, which contains  all the arbitrariness imaginable, as well as the political  weapons for a hot commercial war.    -- Also regarding the economy, the United States still has,  with respect to Argentina and also to other countries of the  region, additional demands concerning rules for the increasingly  critical and intangible intellectual property market (in  Argentina, this situation is now being reflected by the  pharmaceutical patents law), and for corruption. The problem of  corruption has worsened in modern democracies, because it is a  feature that opposes the concept of justice in the  sociopolitical system of competitive equality that the market  should provide. The U.S. case itself is highly illustrative.  Clinton, who adopted the fight against state corruption as an  electoral campaign banner and also as a U.S. foreign policy  priority, is today, along with his influential first lady  Hillary Rodham Clinton, under the public suspicion of illegal  acquisition of political funds. Even though no specific charges  have yet been pressed, the matter is being investigated by a  special prosecutor, and will soon be investigated by Congress.  At any rate, the Republican opposition seems to have proven --  beyond all reasonable doubt -- that Clinton engaged in  maneuvering to cover up the scandal that has been christened  Whitewater.    -- The problem of drug trafficking and its criminal  consequences, such as the laundering of money in the enriched  Latin American financial markets, is another matter that has yet  to be harmonized by the two countries.</p>

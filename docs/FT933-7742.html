			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: New Footsie peak on overseas buying A SUDDEN rush of overseas buying caught the UK stock market by surprise yesterday and drove share prices to new all-time peaks. Marketmakers struggled with a shortage of stock now of severe proportions, while record trading in both traded options and the September Footsie future indicated the rush by fund managers to climb aboard the rising stock market. Equity prices opened higher and, in spite of a weaker government bond market, moved ahead strongly throughout the session. At best, the FT-SE 100 Index touched a new trading peak of 3,076.2, before settling to a closing high of 3,073.6; the day's gain of 48.6 was the largest daily rise since January 26 this year. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed 29 points to a new peak of 3,494.9. 'There was substantial overseas investment in UK equities yesterday,' said Mr Nigel Little of Panmure Gordon. Dealers reported heavy US demand for UK equities, and the attractions of the UK market were supported by a global strategy note from Nomura International, which was believed to have operated a buy programme in UK equities. 'Don't be long Japan . . . don't be short Hong Kong, UK, US and Mexico,' was the advice to clients from Mr Nicholas Knight,the Nomura strategist who remains committed to his forecast of a Footsie reading of 3,500 at end-1993. Mr Knight sees London as attractive for foreign investors because of its perceived recovery in the economy and in corporate earnings, as well as falling interest rates and a firm currency. The announcement yesterday of a rise of only 1.4 per cent in UK retail prices and a decline of 0.2 per cent in retail sales in July left views on the economy little changed, but the firmness of sterling underlined optimism on interest rates. However, UK equities lacked encouragement from the domestic government bonds, which yesterday saw a reversal of the firmer tone of recent sessions. Further strong rises in the drugs stocks as US investors regained confidence in the sector provided a sound platform for the advance in the Footsie index. But domestic retail shares responded to the market's confidence that interest rates will fall again soon by moving ahead in good volume. Favourable views of the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruling on British Gas overflowed to benefit other utility issues. Seaq volume increased sharply to 887.1m shares, close behind the year's record of 908.2m registered less than a week ago. Tuesday's Seaq turnover of 638.5m shares, when the Footsie gained 16.7, was worth Pounds 1.43bn in retail value, confirming that investors continued to take the bull tack. Domestic confidence in the UK equity market has been reinvigorated by this week's news that Britain's public sector deficit was below expectations last month, buttressing hopes that the UK government is under less pressure to raise taxes in its November Budget. Equity traders were prepared to brush off the slower trend in UK government bonds yesterday, dismissing this as little more than expected profit-taking. A rising bond market has provided the background for the advance in UK equities which, NatWest Securities has commented, are no more expensive relatively than they were several weeks ago.</p>

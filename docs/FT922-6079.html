			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Japan tops foreign assets league: Tokyo's net overseas holdings rise to record Dollars 383bn JAPAN last year regained its position as the world's largest holder of net foreign assets, despite the turmoil in Tokyo's financial markets. Japan's net overseas assets rose 16.8 per cent to a record Dollars 383.1bn (Pounds 216.40bn) at the end of 1991, overtaking Germany's total of Dollars 345.4bn, according to figures published yesterday by the Ministry of Finance. Japan held the top spot for five years from 1985, before losing it to Germany in 1990. Economists said the figures highlighted Japan's continuing ability to invest abroad, even though some of its financial institutions have been hit by the slump in the Japanese stock and property markets. The balance of Japan's gross short-term investments overseas declined slightly - by 0.4 per cent to Dollars 759bn - because of cuts in financial market investments by Japanese banks. Banks have been reducing foreign assets to try to meet standards for capital adequacy set by the Bank for International Settlements. However, the balance of gross long-term investments rose 13.8 per cent to Dollars 1,247.9bn, thanks to continuing investments in foreign securities, in direct investment such as factories, and in loans made under Official Development Aid (ODA) programmes. Taking short- and long-term investments, Japan increased its total gross foreign assets by 8.0 per cent to Dollars 2,006.5bn. Foreigners' investment in Japan also grew, with the balance of gross inward investment rising 6.1 per cent to Dollars 1,623.4bn. Foreigners' long-term investments soared 39.5 per cent to Dollars 647.4bn, as investors poured funds into Japanese stocks and bonds, hoping to take advantage of the slump in the Japanese equity market. Foreigners' holdings of Japanese securities rose 32.7 per cent. Foreigners' short-term assets declined by 8.4 per cent to Dollars 976.0bn, as investors switched funds from short-term instruments, such as yen-denominated bank deposits, into equities. The disparity in flows of direct investments increased once again - with an increase of Dollars 30.3bn, Japan's total direct investments rose to Dollars 231.8bn. Foreigners investments in Japan rose a modest Dollars 2.4bn to Dollars 12.3bn. Japan's June long-term prime rate has been increased by 0.3 points to 6.3 per cent, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The long-term credit banks and the Ministry of Finance were divided over what the June long-term prime rate should be. Bank officials said they wanted to raise the rate by 0.3 percentage points in line with the yield on the latest five-year bank debentures, while the MoF said it was opposed to a 0.3 point increase on concerns about its possible negative impact on the economy. The increase was the first in 11 months. The rate was last raised by 0.2 points to 7.9 per cent in July 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Wong: "More U.S. Imports Due"] </F>   [Text] Sino-U.S. trade will exceed $30 billion this year  and the Chinese surplus will decline, a government official has  predicted.    "Imports from the U.S. are set to expand as China's economic  growth remains in the fast lane," said Ou Huarong of the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC).    In the first four months of this year, China's exports to  the  U.S. totalled $4.9 billion and its imports $3.5 billion.    Ou does not expect the U.S. deficit with China to run as  high  as last year's $6 billion.    He urges the U.S. to relax its controls over high-technology  exports to China to help balance trade.    The U.S. has not formally revoked the economic sanctions it  imposed against China in 1989. In fact, certain new  restrictions have been added.    "The export controls are a Cold War product, yet the U.S. is  far from reaching any breakthrough in this regard," Ou pointed  out.    In Beijing late this month the two countries are scheduled  to  discuss the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) and  trade in services.    Ou says the two governments should maintain the momentum in  bilateral trade that picked up when U.S. President Bill Clinton  decided on May 26 to renew China's most-favoured-nation status  and delink it with human rights.    He urges the U.S. not to put China on the Priority Country  List for alleged "severe" violation of intellectual property  rights. The U.S. has until the end of June to make the decision.    "We don't want to see a setback in bilateral trade with  China  being placed on the list," Ou said.    "The Chinese Government has fully implemented the Memorandum  of Understanding on IPR between the two countries and has  established an IPR protection legal system that represents the  highest level of protection on IPR.    "The government has taken notice of infringements of IPR,  particularly in audio and video products, and has taken positive  and effective measures to curb the violation," he said. He  added that the U.S. should recognize the effort.    According to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, once a country is  put on the Prority Country List, it will have to be engaged in a  half-year period of negotiation with the U.S.. If the  negotiations are unsuccessful, the U.S. will announce  retaliatory measures against products of the country in question.    As for access to Chinese markets for American products, Ou  said China has also fulfilled the terms set forth in another  bilateral agreement.    For example, China has on it own slashed the number of  import  quotas and licenses, plus tariffs on a wide range of products,  in addition to what is done according to Sino-U.S. bilateral  market access memorandum of understanding.    MOFTEC has further enhanced transparency by regularly  publishing all effective trade policies in its Statement, a  public record similar to the U.S. Federal Register.    Ou said the first China Foreign Trade Law, which was  announced on May 12, has settled the problem by stipulating a  uniform trade policy across the nation.    On agricultural issues, Ou said the two countries have  already made progress in that China has lifted the ban on  importation of wheat from California and apples from Washington  State. And several protocols on animal products have also been  signed.    As for trade in services, Ou said China and the U.S. should  discuss matters within the framework of the General Agreement on  Trade in Services (GATS), which was signed in Morocco in April  by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The two-way trade seems to be headed in the right direction.    For instance, MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi and U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ron Brown have decided that the two countries should  set up joint workshops covering a wide spectrum of industries,  such as telecommunications, aerospace, chemicals, energy,  transportation, environmental protection and trade in services.    The two sides have also organized a workshop to address the  differences in how they compile trade statistics which have led  to American claims of an exaggerated deficit with China.    At the same time, Ou expressed concern over trade  protectionism in the U.S..</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): FT Election Share index The gap between stocks that might gain from a Labour victory and those that might gain from a Conservative win widened further yesterday. Companies that stand to lose from Labour's policies - for example the water utilities - weakened noticeably after the Labour manifesto was published. They show up in the 'Conservative gainers' portion of the index, which dropped by over 2 per cent, twice as much as the FT-SE index. Conservative gainers are now four per cent below closing prices on the day the election was announced.</p>

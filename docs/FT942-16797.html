			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Councils cut total of student grants Local authorities in England and Wales have halved the number of discretionary grants they give to students in higher education since 1990, says a report published today. Discretionary awards, usually Pounds 2,000 a year for higher-education students, do not directly affect undergraduates who reach the minimum A-level examination requirements. But they do affect post-graduate work, and several vocational courses including law. Several local authorities have cut their budgets for discretionary grants to help meet the strict government spending limits of the past four years. Numbers in higher education have almost doubled during the same period. According to the report, produced by the National Foundation for Educational Research, potential students' chances of obtaining funds depend on where they live. It found that 12 of the 73 authorities surveyed for the report had made increases of 20 per cent in real terms in their awards budgets, while 34 made decreases of the same magnitude. Overall expenditure was projected to have decline by about 8 per cent in real terms between the years 1990-91 and 1993-94, although the total number of awards increased by about 20 per cent. Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, said: 'It is a matter of regret that local education authorities were not able to provide more (discretionary grants). 'The overall position is by no means as gloomy as some had predicted but there are striking differences between local authorities' policies - differences it is hard to justify on general educational grounds.'

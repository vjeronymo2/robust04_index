			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO POLITICIANS TO PRESSURE COUNTY TO SETTLE REMAP LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Los Angeles' Latino political leadership will pressure county supervisors at  their Tuesday meeting to settle the multimillion-dollar redistricting lawsuit  against the county immediately and pave the way for a Latino to succeed  Supervisor Pete Schabarum.  </P> <P> The decision came Sunday night at the end of a 2 1/2-hour meeting called by the  Latino community's senior elected officials to set strategy in the wake of  Schabarum's decision not to seek reelection to the First District seat he has  held for 18 years.  </P> <P> For the time being, the group of 26 officials and political activists held off  endorsing any particular candidate until potential challengers better assess  their chances.  </P> <P> But the group, led by Congressman Esteban Torres (D-Pico Rivera) and Los  Angeles City Council members Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre, will ask the  board Tuesday to rearrange Schabarum's predominantly Anglo district to include  more Latino neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The move reflects worry among Latinos that Schabarum's last-minute move may  have threatened the ability of prominent Latinos to seek the seat. Of those who  are considering a run, Alatorre and Molina -- who both live outside the  district -- could not file for office unless the lines were redrawn. Torres may  not be able to run because he has filed for reelection to Congress.  </P> <P> Latino voting strength is at the heart of the redistricting suit now being  heard in federal court in Los Angeles. The U.S. Justice Department, the  American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund allege that the supervisors had broken up Latino communities  among three districts to keep Latinos off the influential board.  </P></p>

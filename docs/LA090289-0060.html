			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ARMS OFFER SEEN PAVING WAY FOR SUMMIT  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is working on a new strategic arms proposal that could  help pave the way for the first summit meeting between President Bush and  Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev later this year, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> The proposal, which Bush may announce later this month, will be aimed at  closing the gaps on several issues in the four-year-old talks between the U.S.  and the Soviet Union on long-range nuclear weapons, the officials said.  </P> <P> Other Administration officials said they expect to receive a formal response  from Gorbachev soon to several U.S. proposals offered earlier this year on ways  to improve the verification of a proposed strategic arms agreement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Picking Up the Pace  </P> <P> Both developments suggested that Bush, after moving slowly on the Strategic  Arms Reduction Talks (START) during his first eight months in office, now wants  to speed up the pace of negotiations to reduce the number of long-range nuclear  missiles and bombs in U.S. and Soviet arsenals.  </P> <P> Officials declined to provide details of discussions on the new U.S. arms  proposal. "It's being worked at a very high level," said one. But they said it  may include revised versions of pending U.S. proposals on verification as well  as "some movement" on the long-debated issue of limits on cruise missiles.  </P> <P> Tangible progress in the START talks would improve the chances for a  Bush-Gorbachev summit later this year, Administration officials have said. In  addition, prospects for a summit are said to have been boosted by the swift  pace of East-West negotiations over conventional forces in Europe.  </P> <P> Officially, however, Administration spokesmen remain noncommittal. "Our  position remains that a summit meeting will be appropriate at some point, but  we are not there yet," a State Department official said.  </P> <P> The START talks, which began under President Ronald Reagan in 1985, are aimed  at reducing the two superpowers' arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons -- the  roughly 25,000 missile warheads and bombs with which each country could  annihilate the other.  </P> <P> During the Reagan Administration, U.S. and Soviet negotiators agreed to the  framework of a treaty under which those weapons would be reduced by more than  25%, including cuts of almost 50% in long-range ballistic missile warheads, the  most dangerous nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> But significant differences remain. One involves sea-launched cruise missiles,  which the Soviet Union wants to ban or limit but the U.S. Navy wants to keep.  Other issues are how to count and verify the number of air-launched cruise  missiles in each country's bombers and how each country can verify that the  other is keeping its word.  </P> <P> On the positive side, Administration officials say they have been cheered by  two factors in the Soviet position on START.  </P> <P> First, Soviet officials appear to have eased their opposition to U.S. research  on defenses against nuclear missiles -- the Strategic Defense Initiative, also  known as "Star Wars." Although the Soviet Union still objects to the program,  some officials believe that the Kremlin might accept continued U.S. research  and testing -- in part, because Soviet experts don't believe a workable  defensive system can be devised.  </P> <P> Second, Moscow appears to have taken the Administration's proposals on  verification seriously, officials said.  </P> <P> "If they had wanted to, they could have come back and said . . . 'We're totally  opposed to this,' but they didn't," one official said. Instead, the Soviets  have been studying the proposals and have promised that Gorbachev will make a  formal response soon, officials said.  </P> <P> The verification proposals, offered by U.S. negotiators at the START talks in  Geneva in June, include allowing each country to inspect the other's missile  factories even before a treaty is ratified.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issue of Surprise Attack  </P> <P> Another U.S. proposal that officials said the Soviets have taken seriously is a  ban on tests of "short time-of-flight missiles." These are high-speed nuclear  missiles that could hit targets in seven minutes or less after being launched  from submarines, thus making a surprise attack more possible.  </P> <P> The new U.S. arms control proposal will also be on the agenda of talks later  this month between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, officials said.  </P> <P> Those talks, which will also cover the prospects for a U.S.-Soviet summit, will  be held Sept. 22-23 at a lodge and at a log cabin in Wyoming's Grand Tetons.  The meeting is the result of an agreement between Baker and Shevardnadze to  give each other a chance to see more of their countries than just Washington  and Moscow.  </P> <P> McManus reported from Washington and Lauter from Kennebunkport, Me.

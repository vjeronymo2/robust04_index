			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CBS MAKES SEASON'S FIRST CHANGES;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE NETWORK PULLED 'E.A.R.T.H. FORCE' AND 'LENNY.' 'THE FLASH' WILL  MOVE TO A NEW TIME.  </P> <P> CBS, off to a fast start in the 18-day-old fall TV season, moved quickly  Thursday to keep its momentum by yanking the low-rated "E.A.R.T.H. Force" and  also pulling the sitcom "Lenny" until it finds a better time slot for the  blue-collar comedy.  </P> <P> Streamlining its schedule as it prepares to broadcast up to three weeks of  baseball's Major League Baseball playoffs and World Series, CBS also postponed  the Oct. 25 debut of another series, "Sons and Daughters," and moved several  other shows to new time periods.  </P> <P> "E.A.R.T.H. Force," a series about a team of environmental protectors that  debuted Sept. 16, apparently became the season's first cancellation as CBS  announced that it "has been placed on hiatus" and "had its last regularly  scheduled broadcast" last Saturday.  </P> <P> In the case of "Lenny," another new show, CBS said that it definitely will  return to the schedule in a different time period. It had aired Wednesdays at 8  p.m.  </P> <P> With the baseball playoffs a possible make-or-break period during the new  season for CBS, the network -- which has finished third in prime time for the  past three years but is a solid second thus far into the 1990-91 season --  appeared to be dumping or moving its ratings deadwood in preparation for a real  run at No. 1 NBC.  </P> <P> In a key move, CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky also pulled Dan  Rather's successful "48 Hours" from its new late-night Saturday slot and gave  it the important 8-9 p.m. time period opening the Wednesday lineup, starting  Oct. 24.  </P> <P> "48 Hours" did well last season against NBC's 8 p.m. Thursday powerhouse, "The  Cosby Show."  </P> <P> Now, "48 Hours" will lead into two other series upon which CBS is depending on  Wednesday: the reliable ratings entry "Jake and the Fatman" and "WIOU," an  upcoming new show about a local TV news operation, which many observers feel  may be the network's best freshman program.  </P> <P> CBS also made moves to strengthen its Thursday and Saturday lineups. On  Thursday, "Top Cops," a reality show about police stories, switches from an  hour to a 30-minute format and goes up against "Cosby," "The Simpsons" and  "Father Dowling Mysteries," beginning Oct. 25.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, "Top Cops" knocked off both NBC's "Hunter" and ABC's "Cop Rock"  head-to-head.  </P> <P> Also on Thursdays, CBS will move its comic-book entry "The Flash," which has  started stronger than expected, out of direct competition with "Cosby" and "The  Simpsons." It will follow "Top Cops" from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., with CBS hoping  the carryover last half-hour of the show will draw viewers away from NBC's  "Cheers."  </P> <P> Rounding out CBS' Thursday lineup will be "Doctor, Doctor" and another reliable  ratings winner, "Knots Landing."  </P> <P> On Saturdays, CBS has revamped its 9-11 p.m. lineup after dumping "E.A.R.T.H.  Force" and moving "48 Hours." Starting Nov. 17, "Wiseguy," with Steven Bauer  replacing Ken Wahl, will be a weekly entry. Beginning Nov. 24, it will be  joined by "Broken Badges," a series about an undercover crime-fighting unit.  </P> <P> "Wiseguy," which has been shown in late-night reruns in recent months, will be  CBS' entry against ABC's "Twin Peaks."  </P> <P> CBS said that while "Lenny" will return soon, "Sons and Daughters," a family  drama, has been "postponed until a later date."  </P> <P> In a key move, CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky also pulled Dan  Rather's successful "48 Hours" from its new late-night Saturday slot and gave  it the important 8-9 p.m. time period opening the Wednesday lineup, starting  Oct. 24.  </P> <P> "48 Hours" did well last season against NBC's 8 p.m. Thursday powerhouse, "The  Cosby Show."  </P> <P> Now, "48 Hours" will lead into two other series upon which CBS is depending on  Wednesday: the reliable ratings entry "Jake and the Fatman" and "WIOU," an  upcoming new show about a local TV news operation, which many observers feel  may be the network's best freshman program.  </P> <P> CBS also made moves to strengthen its Thursday and Saturday lineups.

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAFFITI  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum has sunk to a new low. His answer to recent graffiti  denouncing Los Angeles County's inadequate AIDS policies is to take the money  to clean it up out of the already pathetic county AIDS budget (Metro, May 10).  How clever!  </P> <P> Along similar lines, a number of possibilities suggest themselves. Since, for  example, much of the gang graffiti marring local buildings is the handiwork of  people of low income and members of minorities, we could clean it up with funds  from the programs that provide food, housing, etc. for the poor, or from  job-training programs.  </P> <P> Better yet, take it out of Schabarum's salary. If he worried half as much about  health care as he does about graffiti, there never would have been a problem in  the first place.  </P> <P> BRUCE MIRKEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

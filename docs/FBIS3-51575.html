			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eddy Leon Barreto from "The Observer" newscast] </F>   [Text] Calm is returning to the cities of Puerto La Cruz  and Barcelona after four days of public demonstrations. As  Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz are slowly returning to normalcy,  the police have announced the arrest of scores of people  involved in neighborhood riots. The National Guard has  implemented continuous patrols in Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz  neighborhoods to prevent any outbreak of violence.    General Miguel Aparicio Ramirez, commander of the Anzoategui  State military force, has said that the riots were economically  motivated and that they took place to protest the implementation  of the value-added tax and the increase in public bus fares. He  urged the population to remain calm and not to take any action  against private or public property, because people involved in  such actions will be prosecuted under the Vagrancy and Hoodlum  Law.    [Begin Ramirez recording] We are ready. We have implemented  the Sovereignty Plan which permits the deployment of the  National Armed Forces when police forces cannot effectively  check public order disruptions. So far there has been no need  to use any Armed Forces units, and I hope that they are not  needed. [end recording]</p>

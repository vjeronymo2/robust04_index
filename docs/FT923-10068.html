			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank 11% higher at Pounds 369m LLOYDS BANK, the smallest of the Big Four UK clearers by asset size, yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in its pre-tax profits during the first half of the year. However, the improvement chiefly reflected lower provisions against bad debts and the release of Pounds 72m of provisions of problem country debt. Pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30 were Pounds 369m, up from Pounds 331m a year ago. The total bad debt charge was Pounds 329m, down from Pounds 425m. Total assets were down from Pounds 54.17bn a year ago to Pounds 50.39bn. Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, said that though there had been tight control of costs, the trading side had not been good because of the continuing recession in the UK economy. Lloyds Abbey Life was the group's most profitable business, contributing Pounds 142m (Pounds 150m) pre-tax, followed by its problem country debt operation which made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 95m (Pounds 14m) including release of the Pounds 72m provision. Corporate banking contributed Pounds 60m, up from Pounds 18m a year ago, with provisions down from Pounds 82m to Pounds 41m. The provisions were the lowest figure for the past five half years. UK retail banking, usually regarded as the activity in which Lloyds outshines its competitors, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 11m, down from Pounds 56m a year ago, after bad debt provisions of Pounds 266m, mostly against losses on loans to small and medium sized businesses. Personal customer business is said to be improving. Private banking made profits of Pounds 38m, up from Pounds 35m, and profits from international banking rose from Pounds 26m a year ago to Pounds 37m. Lloyds Merchant Bank slipped into a loss of Pounds 14m, down from a Pounds 3m profit last time after provisions of Pounds 18m against investments by Lloyds Development Capital. However, investment managing and stockbroking are said to be doing well. Net interest income declined from Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 1.07bn. Other operating income was slightly up at Pounds 815m (Pounds 806m), including Pounds 166m (Pounds 160m) in UK current account fees and Pounds 254m (Pounds 224m) in other UK fees and commissions. Credit card income was flat at Pounds 36m (Pounds 35m). Lloyds' unsuccessful bid for Midland Bank cost Pounds 4m. The group's net interest margin narrowed to 4.4 per cent from 4.49 per cent. In the UK the net interest margin was 5 per cent, down from 5.33 per cent. Group operating costs were slightly down at Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 1.28bn), producing an improvement in the cost:income ratio which fell to 63 per cent from 63.7 per cent a year ago. The total number of employees working for the group fell from 71,521 a year ago to 65,458 at the end of June. Lloyds' capital ratios are stronger than they were a year ago with its risk asset ratio at 10.2 per cent, up from 9.2 per cent and the tier 1 capital at 6.7 per cent. Its loan book in the UK has fallen to Pounds 30.96bn from Pounds 33.5bn a year ago. Earnings per share were 16.4p, up from 14.7p, and the interim dividend is being increased to 5.9p (5.4p). In the market, Lloyds' shares fell sharply, closing 23p down at 401p. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GREENPEACE WILL GIVE A WIDE BERTH AT TRIDENT LAUNCH  </P> <P> Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists, their ship damaged by the Navy during a  protest last week of a Trident 2 missile launch, said Tuesday they will observe  an upcoming launch but will not try to stop it.  </P> <P> "Our intention is not to physically obstruct the upcoming Trident test, but to  exercise our rights to protest in international waters," said Shannon Fagan, a  Greenpeace spokeswoman.  </P> <P> She said a 60-foot-ketch, the Mondeivitano, would sail to the vicinity of the  test site later this week "and will maintain the same distance from the site as  other Navy vessels."  </P> <P> The Trident submarine launch area is in the Atlantic 50 miles off Cape  Canaveral. During a test launch, the Navy declares a 5,000-yard radius safety  zone around the submarine.  </P> <P> Last week, the MV Greenpeace penetrated the safety zone and dispatched two  motorized rafts in an effort to halt a launch from the submerged submarine  Tennessee. But a Navy submarine support ship bumped the Greenpeace vessel  several times and used fire hoses to shoot water down the smokestacks to stop  the engines. Small Navy boats corraled the rafts.  </P></p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Medical advances 'threatened': Annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science opens with warning on health policy and defence of old age ANTI-SCIENCE feelings among the public, politicians and health policymakers are threatening the progress of medical sciences into 'the most exciting and productive phase in their long history', Sir David Weatherall, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, warned last night. In his presidential address to the meeting at Keele University, Staffordshire, Sir David said: 'It would be a tragedy if this mood of disillusionment with the basic medical sciences, and science in general, were to impede progress as we move into the next millenium.' Policymakers were taking an increasingly short-term view of improving patient care. They were also turning their backs on research. A sign of this was the recent white paper on the National Health Service, Working for Patients, 'in which research is barely mentioned'. He added: 'In the resulting marketplace economy of some of our teaching hospital trusts, it is already clear that, presumably because it poses a risk to competitiveness, research is going to be very low on the agenda.' The government's new research strategy was founded on 'a feeling that high-technology medicine is having a dehumanising effect and that we should be directing much more effort into preventive medicine and the needs of individual patients,' he said. 'Because these changes are occurring at a time when society is disillusioned with science, and when support for medical research is so limited, there is a genuine danger that the pendulum may swing too far and that, in our new customer-driven approach to medical research, the vital role of the basic medical sciences may be neglected.' Sir David, who is a leading geneticist, sketched out his field of research's potential. 'It will help us to understand the acquired defects in our genes which lead to . . . the generation of cancer. It offers us a completely new way of developing diagnostic and therapeutic agents.' But Sir David warned against unrealistic expectations. 'Claims by molecular biologists that within the next five or 10 years we will be able to identify the major genes involved and somehow alter our susceptibility to our common killers (such as heart disease) are naive and misleading, based as they are on a complete misunderstanding of the enormous complexity of these diseases.' The public disillusionment with medical science was due partly to over-optimistic claims about the speed with which research breakthroughs would benefit patients. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURBING OUR LOTTERY FEVER  </P> <P> Not being a Washington writer, physician, lawyer, university professor or  anything else of consequence, I cannot expect space equal to that accorded to  Peirce, but I can wish that you will print a letter response.  </P> <P> The column is a scarcely-disguised advocacy of prohibition from gambling. While  some of his suggestions have some validity from a view of public economy, e.g.,  the business of advertising, the gist of the article is that people, especially  poor people, don't know how best to spend their money.  </P> <P> However arrogant this and other expositions on the subject are, including The  Times' own editorial hostility to lotteries, its greater sin is smugness. Has  not Peirce ever heard of a simple thing called hope? When you're down, perhaps  down and nearly out, hope goes a very long way. And it is not the same thing as  an unreasonable expectation.  </P> <P> Let comfortable people with discretionary funds engage in the random but holy  process of stock trading; let those who wish to do so buy lottery tickets.  </P> <P> DENNIS J. WHALE  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

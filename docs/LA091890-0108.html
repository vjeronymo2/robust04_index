			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORKING HARD TO KEEP 'EM FLYING;  </P> <P> MODELS: A MANUFACTURER OF RADIO-CONTROLLED HELICOPTERS IS TRYING TO OVERCOME A  TRADE DISPUTE AND KEEP HIS BUSINESS FROM CRASHING.  </P> <P> John Gorham, president of Gorham Model Products of Calabasas, said he can't  sleep at night now. He has mortgaged his home to the hilt and used all his  savings trying to keep his tiny firm, which makes radio-controlled model  helicopter kits, from crashing.  </P> <P> Things are so grim that, Gorham said, he got a call from his bank earlier this  month to tell him that his personal checking account was $1,000 overdrawn. He  instructed the bank to transfer money from the $5,000 he has left from the  second mortgage he took out on his house.  </P> <P> "We're working day by day now," Gorham said. "All of my moxie is almost gone."  </P> <P> But not completely. Gorham, 68, still has enough pluck left to hope that he  will be able to obtain bank financing to buy his company the time he says it  needs to recover. Without a loan, he says, he will be out of business within  four months.  </P> <P> Gorham blames a Japanese company, Hirobo, for his troubles. Hirobo, Gorham  said, used to be his biggest supplier, but the company undercut him by allowing  its Canadian distributors to infiltrate his market in the United States. One of  the Canadian companies calls it "free trade." Gorham calls it "unfair trade  practices."  </P> <P> No matter the cause, Gorham is hurting. Gorham's company rang up $3 million in  sales in 1986 and 1987, and it had profits of about 9 cents on the dollar. From  that high, annual sales have sunk to a little more than $1 million, and the  company is losing about $20,000 a month.  </P> <P> Until May of last year, Gorham was the U.S. distributor for Hirobo's model  helicopters and related parts. Hirobo, which also makes industrial products, is  a small company by Japanese standards. But of its roughly $50 million a year in  revenue, only a small percentage is from selling helicopter models.  </P> <P> The motor-powered models are scaled-down versions of the real thing. The weigh  between 5 and 9 pounds, are about 4 feet long and up to 1 1/2 feet high. Most  are sold in toy and hobby shops by a growing legion of radio-controlled-flying  buffs. Fewer than six companies worldwide make the helicopter parts, assembly  kits and fully constructed models.  </P> <P> The Academy of Model Aeronautics has about 180,000 members, association  spokesman Geoffrey Styles said, and about 95% fly radio-controlled helicopters.  </P> <P> Gorham, who is a native of Britain, worked for years as an aerospace engineer.  In the late 1960s and early '70s, he was the chief engineer of flight guidance  and control systems for the Lockheed L-1011 commercial jet. After leaving  Lockheed, he worked as an independent consultant. He became interested in model  helicopters in 1978, and started building and designing his own  radio-controlled craft.  </P> <P> In 1981, Gorham built and flew 10 model helicopters for the movie "All Night  Long." After the filming was completed, he took the models to a trade show,  where he got enough orders to get his company off the ground. He formed the  allegiance with Hirobo in 1983.  </P> <P> But in 1987, Gorham said, his sales of Hirobo products -- which then accounted  for nearly two-thirds of his total -- started to drop precipitously. After  asking around in the industry, he said, he discovered that many American  dealers were getting their Hirobo helicopter products from two Canadian  companies -- Udisco in Montreal and Yellow Aircraft in Vancouver. These  companies were undercutting his prices -- which range roughly from $200 to $800  per helicopter -- by about 30%, he said.  </P> <P> Gorham said he built his business on his ability to provide service and  technical support to his customers; the Canadian companies, he said, are only  distributors. He said, however, that he would end up giving free service to  people who bought from the Canadian distributors because there was no way of  knowing which distributor provided a particular models, he said.  </P> <P> Gorham complained to Hirobo about the Canadian distributors and also about what  he saw as other problems, among them poor quality in an important product line,  which was allowing a competing company to gain market share and was costing  Gorham money on repairs and replacements. Eventually, Gorham said, Hirobo  executives consented to meet with him.  </P> <P> The meeting took place in May, 1989, but it did not produce the results Gorham  had hoped for. Afterward, Hirobo stopped all shipments to Gorham, he said, and  did not respond to his many phone calls, letters and faxes.  </P> <P> Hirobo could not be reached for comment. The company now sells its model  helicopters in the United States through Altech Marketing, an Edison, N.J.,  firm.  </P> <P> Lyon Kunin, vice president of Udisco, said he has sold only to dealers in  Canada but that there is little he can do if those dealers want to sell the  products in the United States. "That's free trade," he said. "It's restricting  trade if you tell a dealer, 'You can't sell here.' "  </P> <P> Hirobo nonetheless broke a verbal agreement with Gorham by allowing helicopters  from other distributors to be sold in Gorham's territory, said Robert James  Terry, a Long Beach-based interpreter who acted as a consultant to Gorham in  his dealings with Hirobo. But, Terry added, Gorham erred by not insisting that  the agreement be put in writing from the beginning.  </P> <P> "John went into a business arrangement with Hirobo on a handshake," Terry said.  "He made a mistake in dealing with the Japanese in not signing a contract with  them."  </P> <P> Virtually overnight, Gorham said, his business was nearly devastated. He saw  what he thought was a way out -- using local subcontractors to make replacement  parts for parts previously bought from Hirobo. He also worked on new designs of  his own that he hoped would set new standards for helicopter models.  </P> <P> Gorham's efforts have earned respect from model enthusiasts. His helicopters  are among the most popular, says Larry Spurling, spokesman for the Radio  Control Hobby Trade Assn. Randy Gibson, events coordinator for the  International Radio Control Helicopter Assn., said "in a lot of ways, the  quality has gone up since the separation."  </P> <P> Gorham also cut his overhead and dug further into his parts inventory. His  staff, once numbering 22, is now down to 15, and "we keep the lights down and  the heat off," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Countdown starts for 10 mines BRITISH COAL has formally served notice to miners' union representatives that it is starting a 90-day statutory consultation period, at the end of which it intends to close 10 pits. Letters inviting local union representatives to meetings with management were issued yesterday as British Coal ceased production at two more pits - Grimethorpe and Houghton Main in South Yorkshire - leaving only one of the 10 - Betws in south Wales - still cutting coal. British Coal officials said the consultative period would present miners with an opportunity to argue their case against closures. Instead, miners' unions are concentrating their efforts on legal action to force British Coal to resume production at all the pits. They also want the 10 pits to be discussed at national level and to be included in the government's wide-ranging consultations on its energy policy. Applications for injunctions by the National Union of Mineworkers, the Nacods pit supervisors' union, and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers are scheduled to be heard in the High Court on Tuesday. The unions claim to have compiled evidence pointing to a deterioration of coal faces, roadway and equipment at some of the pits that have ceased production over the past two weeks. According to union officials, the evidence suggests that British Coal is effectively pre-empting the outcome of the consultation period by allowing the mines to become unworkable. Yesterday a group of women demonstrators chanted and cheered as miners emerged, possibly for the last time, from Grimethorpe Colliery. Meanwhile, the Labour party will today launch a campaign aimed at exploiting public outrage at the government's pit closures in an attempt to promote its alternative economic strategy. The effort to link the closure of the pits with wider fears of depression and redundancies begins in earnest next week when Mr John Smith, the party leader, begins a tour of mines in Durham and South Yorkshire. Nottinghamshire County Council is to hold an independent inquiry chaired by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, last year's chairman of the Bar Council, into pit closures and their effect on the local economy. Evidence provided by the inquiry will be collated and presented to the review promised by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Bullion pressures golds Gold bullion's late decline past Dollars 380 an ounce sparked further losses for related Johannesburg shares, and only financial stocks managed to post significant gains after good results recently and steady prospects for the sector. The overall index finished 10.9 lower at 5,745.4, industrials were 8.8 better at 6,907.2 and golds fell 45.6 or 2.3 per cent to 1,928.5. Some traders said golds were oversold after recent hefty losses, but needed a spark in the bullion price to bounce from current levels. A slight easing in the financial rand late in the day offered some support, with diamond leader De Beers managing to advance over the day for the first time in a week. De Beers ended 25 cents firmer at R90, Anglos was R1 weaker at R230 and Gencor slipped 30 cents to R14.15. Sappi managed a strong R1.25 rise to R70.75.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / HSBC advances 51% to Pounds 2.58bn: Banking group's profits buoyed by Asia Pacific contribution - Dividend lifted 24% A buoyant banking market in the Asia Pacific region along with big earnings from foreign exchange and capital markets trading lifted pre-tax profits of HSBC Holdings by 51 per cent to Pounds 2.58bn last year, from Pounds 1.74bn. Rising income more than offset an increase in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 1.16bn, against Pounds 990m. There was a Pounds 160m charge against falls in the value of aircraft and other assets of its Concord Leasing arm in the US. HSBC, which has become the second most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange since its acquisition of Midland Bank in 1992, lifted its final dividend to 16.5p, raising the total payout by 24 per cent to 23.5p. It also announced an enhanced scrip alternative to the final dividend. At 24.75p, the scrip alternative is worth 50 per cent more than the cash final. The offer will be underwritten by NatWest Markets, with the brokers Cazenove. Mr John Bond, HSBC chief executive, said last year had produced 'a very encouraging result'. The acquisition of Midland had 'exceeded our expectations, particularly in treasury and investment banking businesses'. However, Mr Bond warned that dealing income of Pounds 1.09bn, against Pounds 621m, was unlikely to be repeated this year. This was because the turn in the interest rate cycle meant that treasury and capital markets 'are unlikely to be as favourable'. Total non-interest income rose 23 per cent to Pounds 3.58bn, compared with Pounds 2.9bn pro forma, after restating the accounts to adjust for the consolidation of Midland. Dealing income included foreign exchange earnings of Pounds 377m, against Pounds 383m. Most of a Pounds 72m increase in miscellaneous operating income was due to higher income from the sale of life and pension products in Midland. Net interest income rose 13 per cent to Pounds 4.44bn, against Pounds 3.9bn. The net interest margin on loans rose to 2.8 per cent, compared with 2.7 per cent, helped by a release of suspended interest in Hongkong Bank. Profits were dominated by operations in Asia, with Pounds 1.93bn, or 75 per cent of pre-tax profits, coming from Hong Kong and Asia Pacific. The ratio of cost to income fell to 55.2 per cent against 62.2 per cent, in spite of a 7 per cent rise in staff costs to Pounds 2.5bn, against Pounds 2.34bn, and a 7 per cent rise in expenses to Pounds 4.4bn, against Pounds 4.2bn. The ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 7.9 per cent, against 7.4 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 71.7p, compared with 48.8p, although headline earnings per share excluding exceptional profits were 69.4p. Post-tax return on average shareholders funds rose 20.8 per cent, against 17.3 per cent pro forma, and return on assets rose to 1.1 per cent, from 0.7 per cent. Shares closed 7p up at 945p.

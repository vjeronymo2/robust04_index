			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 25 (TANJUG) -- Serbian opposition  leader Vojislav Kostunica on Saturday criticised the Western  attitude to the Yugoslav crisis, denouncing U.N. sanctions  against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) as unjust and senseless.    The sanctions "are inflicting suffering on the people and  not  the regime," they are destroying the market economy and  compromising the democratic idea in a society where "there has  been no democracy for half a century," said Kostunica, the  leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, in an opening address  at the party's convention.    The draconic U.N. sanctions, clamped on Yugoslavia in May  1992, have brought the population and 500,000 refugees to the  verge of destitution, depriving them of the most basic  foodstuffs and medicaments as well as of fuel for heating homes,  schools, hospitals and refugee camps. The attitude of the  Democratic Party of Serbia to the world's power-wielders is  "neither pro-Western, nor anti-Western," said its leader.    Party Vice-President Vladeta Jankovic said that the party  was  giving "unreserved support" to Serbs outside Serbia in their  just struggle for securing space for independent life, and added  that the party considered as justified the aspiration that the  Serbs' ethnic space should be united in one state.    He said there was no danger of the party getting bogged down  in primitive ultra-nationalism, because it had never viewed with  understanding the inflicting of suffering on civilians,  unnecessary destruction of towns and cities and demolition of  religious and cultural landmarks. The party will work for  bringing to justice the handful of war criminals who have donned  the uniform of the Serb soldier, he said.</p>

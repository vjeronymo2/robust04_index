			<p>BFN     [Text] Ginowan--In reaction to the crash of a medium-type  CH-46E transport helicopter at the Futenma Air Station in the  afternoon of 6 April, Ginowan city held an extraordinary meeting  at 0930 on the morning of 7 April to discuss how to deal with  crashes in the future. The city, which considers the crashes  involving the helicopter and an F-15 fighter to be an issue  arising from U.S. military bases existing in central Okinawa,  decided at the extraordinary meeting to call on cities, towns,  and villages in central Okinawa to take actions to protest the  crashes.    Meanwhile, the Special Committee on U.S. Military Bases  (chaired by Seiei Chimen) of the Ginowan City Assembly (chaired  by Harunobu Nakamura) held a session at 1000 on the morning of 7  April to decide that the assembly holds an extraordinary session  to adopt a resolution and a statement demanding a halt to flight  training by U.S. forces over residential areas and an early  return of the Futenma Air Station. The extraordinary session is  scheduled to open at 1400 on the afternoon of 7 April.    Members of the Special Committee on U.S. Military Bases took  a look at the crash site from outside of the Futenma Air Station  and confirmed that debris from the crashed helicopter landed on  the roof of Mr. Kiuma's house. They then entered the air  station through the Oyama gate to tour the crash site.    On 7 April, one day after the helicopter crash, Ginowan city  remained relatively calm with almost no helicopter noise being  heard. The helicopter in question broke into two pieces when it  crashed, and it remains that way, with only its debris having  been recovered.    In the past, the Ginowan City Assembly adopted resolutions  protesting against the crash and overturning of a CH-46  helicopter on Futenma Air Station runway in October 1992 and  against the dropping of a set of repair tools by a UH-1  helicopter onto the prefectural highway in Nakagutsuku town in  October 1993.</p>

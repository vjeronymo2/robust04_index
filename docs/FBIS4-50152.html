			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Taiwan will never agree to  a proposed change in its country code for international direct  dialing (IDD) service, a telecommunications official said Monday  [15 May].    "We hope to retain the current IDD country code, 886, as we  have used it for more than 20 years," said Steven Y. Chen,  director-general of the Directorate General of  Telecommunications under the Ministry of Transportation and  Communications.    IDD country codes are usually located by the International  Telecommunications Union (ITU), an affiliate of the United  Nations. As Taiwan is not a UN member, its country code has not  been formally registered with the Switzerland-based  international telecommunications organization.    Taiwan was first allowed to use the 886 country code in the  early 1970s through informal talks with ITU and several major  western countries, Chen noted.    Beijing urged ITU to force Taiwan to change its IDD country  code to 866 five years ago in an attempt to signify its claim of  sovereignty over Taiwan, Chen reported. Mainland China's IDD  country code is 86.    Chen said ITU has so far not formally informed Taiwan that  it  plans to change Taiwan's current IDD country code.    "Even if we are forced to change our IDD country code in the  future, we would never accept the Beijing-proposed politically  significant code," Chen stressed. Taiwan has resisted the use  of the 866 code because it might create the misleading  impression that Taiwan is under Beijing's jurisdiction.    As the world's 15th largest IDD user, Chen said, Taiwan  should not be forced to change its country code for any  political reasons. "We'll ask friendly ITU member nations to  help us uphold our present IDD country code," he said.    Taiwan was forced to abandon its 785 and 789 country codes  for international telex services in March after the ITU formally  allocated the codes to Kazakstan and Turkmenistan respectively.  Taiwan now uses 769 as its country code for international telex  services. Local companies said they have received many  complaints from their foreign customers during the past month  saying their telex messages had been mistakenly transmitted to  the two former Soviet States.</p>

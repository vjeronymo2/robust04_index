			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian gold exploitation plan shelved PLANS FOR a tender for Russian companies to exploit the country's largest hard-rock gold deposit have been put on ice. The sacking of Mr Yuri Nozhikov, governor of the Irkutsk region, announced by President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday, means that the State Geology Committee must now wait for a new administration before renewing its attempts to organise the tender. But Ms Louise Moore, representative of Star Technology Systems of Australia, maintains that a joint stock company her company has formed with Lenzoloto, a Siberian state-owned gold producer, has exclusive rights to exploit the deposit. She says she expects Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, to order previously secret information on the reserves to be declassified so that Star can pay the first Dollars 20m instalment of its Dollars 250m investment in the project. Ms Moore says declassification is a condition set by Star's banks to release the money raised for the project. But the State Geology Committee wants to see the partners' business plan before it grants a licence and before the information about reserves can be declassified. Star argues that it does not need a licence because documents were confirmed at local level. The project, which would be the first to allow foreigners into Russia's undercapitalised gold industry, has been the subject of a long-running controversy, with parts of the Russian administration opposed to letting a small Australian company have access to such a prize without competition. Lenzoloto and Star maintain, however, that their joint stock company has already been approved by the State Property Committee and that the state is not providing Lenzoloto with the support it needs to pay workers and continue construction work for the development of Sukhoi Log. Star is also going to develop alluvial gold deposits on the site.</p>

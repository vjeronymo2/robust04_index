			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rise to Pounds 7m at Hardys &amp; Hansons Two new pubs and the refurbishment of some older establishments helped Hardys &amp; Hansons, the Nottingham-based brewer, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 7.04m in the year to October 1. 'We are not beginning to see a recovery here. We could not say the recession is beginning to end,' said Mr Richard Hanson, chairman and managing director. Turnover rose to Pounds 31.7m (Pounds 30.3m). Mr Hanson said prices had increased in line with the rest of the industry and, stripping out the new premises, volumes were stable. He said cost pressure had pushed prices up by 4p in September bringing the cost of a pint of bitter to Pounds 1.14p in the company's managed pubs. The company launched three new canned beers in July. Yesterday's figures benefited from these for only three months. A 9.8 per cent increase in trading profits to Pounds 6.32m (Pounds 5.76m) was not fully reflected at the pre-tax level. Income from interest and dividends fell from Pounds 962,000 to Pounds 638,000 as rates fell and funds were invested in the company's estate. Hardys now has 255 pubs in the east Midlands with about one third directly managed and the remainder tenanted. About 100 pubs are based in Nottinghamshire, with the same number in Derbyshire. The board is recommending an increased final dividend of 5.5p giving a higher total for the year of 8.5p (7.9p). Earnings per share rose to 18.935p (18.647p).</p>

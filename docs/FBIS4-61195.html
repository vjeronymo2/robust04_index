			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Maritime Kray Administration Head Yevgeniy </F> Nazdratenko by Nina Rostarchuk: date and place not stated:  "The Road to Russia Runs Through Maritime Kray"]    [Text] The Kray Soviet session was prepared to examine two  questions: one, to confirm the head of the Kray Administration,  and two, to establish a separate republic in Maritime Kray.    Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko heard out the first question  as a guest. But nowadays he gets up onto the platform as  governor of that huge and "remote region, which is nevertheless  our own" and proposes removing the question of a "separate"  republic from the agenda. Now, and forever more!    Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko begins our conversation in an  unexpectedly abrupt manner.    [Nazdratenko] I am categorically against splintering Russia  into tiny principalities. And you know, I am not a stray  "commie." It is painful to stand by and watch as people pilfer  Russia bit by bit, instead of living in a united country, a  single economic area, under one authority and one president.  The idea of sovereignties may well be high-minded, tempting,  and sweet, but there is nothing behind it once you begin to  consider not your own ambitions but the people who have  entrusted you with power.    So what exactly is today's Maritime Kray? Is it Russia's  eastern gate, its outpost on the Pacific coast, as it is  commonly described? No, it is first and foremost an enormous  territory lorded over for many long years by government  departments; and now we are being forced to disentangle the  results of their specific style of management.    The first of these results is plain for all to see: in our  region, a loaf of bread costs 1,000 rubles [R]. The average  wage in the kray is R80,000. Don't look so surprised: Living  standards in the Far East have always been lower than the  average for the country. And now we are divided by a veritable  abyss. The same loaf of bread costs R100 in Altay. Because  they have their own grain there, whereas our environmental  conditions are completely different. We have to import  everything. As long as we have to import, for instance, grain,  it is becoming so expensive that, but for subsidies, a loaf of  bread would cost around R7,000 in the stores.    This is the most serious question which we are trying to  resolve today. I can see how this can be done, but I hear  warnings from all sides: Whatever you do, do not get it into  your head to buy grain abroad! By doing that you will destroy  national grain producers!    I agree that it is essential to support our own producers.  And when we were getting grain for R250,000 a tonne, we did  just that. But "our boys" do not think about us! Railroad  companies are again increasing charges for freight shipment, and  the price of a tonne of grain has soared right up to R400,000!    So it was that we decided to construct a terminal at one of  the ports and take delivery of Canadian hard wheat -- 6 million  tonnes per year. Right away we were able to breathe more  easily, because the imported wheat is a quarter of the cost.  Moreover it is better quality than ours. The scraps from the  grain milling industry can be used to make mixed feed to support  livestock in the region. We have to survive. Unfortunately,  the interests of the state are often at odds with the interests  of the region.    [Rostarchuk] Maritime Kray has sufficient nuclear reserves  to last 20-25 years. Five-meter high thickets of rushes are  growing in waste water tanks. What does this indicate? Abnormal  radiation levels, and a polluted environment. There are  villages along the coast where it is no longer possible to live.  For humanitarian reasons alone, people have to be removed from  there and given a chance to settle elsewhere. But where? Where  is that coveted paradise where people can expect work and  lodgings? There is no such place in Maritime Kray.    [Nazdratenko] And it is in precisely this horrific  ecological situation that people are starting to talk about a  nuclear power station. I want none of it! Every fiber of my  being opposes it. On the other hand, how can we extricate  ourselves from the power crisis which erupted this winter across  the entire Far East? In Magadan Oblast an entire city was iced  up. We saw that tragedy with our own eyes: The Far East  Shipping Company had to evacuate the inhabitants. We ourselves  missed the worst of it, thank God, although we came close to the  brink. Everything went into providing heat -- all budget funds  went into this. Coal was brought into the region at any cost.  Its price hit R115,000 a tonne. Just imagine how much went up  in smoke, in the literal sense of the word: We burned money.  Money which should have gone to the people, in the form of  wages or to develop the budget-financed sphere.    In order to resolve the question of power supplies in  Maritime Kray, it is essential to complete the construction of  the Ussuriysk TETs [heat and electric power station]. To feed  it we will expand the Rettikhovka, Pavlovka, and Luchegorsk  coalfields. But it will take 20 years to do all the work. Of  course, it will be completely impossible to manage without state  help. And it is not very nice, believe me, to have to go cap in  hand to somebody. But you know, we are only trying to "finagle"  what is Maritime Kray's due. The abundance of energy generated  by the Siberian GES [hydroelectric power station] cascade --  built, incidentally, by the whole country -- should cost R9 per  kilowatt-hour. But they take R230 from Kamchatka. And a little  less from Sakhalin -- R170. We have long tried to draw the  government's attention to this problem, and at last we have  forged a decree on stabilizing the kray economy. We now pay R40  per kilowatt-hour.... But this is not the solution. I believe  that average rates for the whole of the Russian Federation  territory should be adopted.    [Rostarchuk] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, there is a nuance here....  Is it really the case that your ports process cargoes for  Maritime Kray as such? No, these are cargoes for the whole of  Russia. Maritime Kray comprises the major warehouse center for  all Russia's regions. Is that not so? Some people are  suggesting that you exploit the fact by levying a quit rent on  anybody who uses your "gateway" and your land and use it to top  up the local budget.    [Nazdratenko] But they must understand how this "local  initiative" will turn out for other regions! In my view, it is  better to impose order through civilized methods. And such  methods do exist. Only, it is essential for the "upper  echelons" to understand that the Far East has its own specifics  and that what suits others does not necessarily suit it. You  have to cross 12,000 km by rail to reach us, and this landscape  is by no means the same type of landscape as that between Moscow  and Ryazan.    It is vital to realize that, when airlines inflate ticket  prices to R400,000 one-way, they are cutting Maritime Kray off  from Russia. You try flying west to see your relatives or  sending an expert there on a business trip! An intercity  telephone link is an unthinkable luxury even for an enterprise,  never mind an elderly grandmother stranded in Maritime Kray with  no relatives!    All these things seem minor, but it is these things which  shape an individual's life, and they affect his mood and his  well-being. My fellow countrymen are feeling increasingly  alienated from the main part of Russia, and that was not the  case before.    But when I start talking about uniform rates for  electricity,  about preferential prices for air tickets and freight carriage,  people instantly begin suspecting me of anti-market  inclinations. But you know, many people are aware that at the  end of the 1980's I fought for flotation, I was one of the first  to set up an enterprise with a non-state form of ownership -- a  mining enterprise in Dalnegorsk. I am not against reform. But  who needs to float a "dead" industry? If subscribing for shares  entails a 30- or 40-percent cut in the workforce, and people in  that particular one-horse village or city have nowhere else to  work, then, tell me, why bother floating it?    [Rostarchuk] Obviously, the heart of an industrialist  still beats within you, and you are looking at Maritime Kray as  a huge economic structure....    [Nazdratenko] Of course, I am concerned about production and  I am trying in every possible way to maintain it....    The Law on Bankruptcy is completely incomprehensible to me.  Take the "Zvezda" Plant -- a candidate for "mothballing"....  The aviation plant in Arsenyev is barely breathing. They work  for the Ministry of Defense; they fulfill its orders. But  nobody is in any hurry to cover their production costs or the  pay for people's labor. The same picture can be found at many  enterprises. They operate at a loss purely because they are  owed enormous sums of money. So pay them! Then they in turn  can pay all their taxes, settle outstanding debts for  electricity, and everything will take its course.    The only way out of all this turmoil of ours is authority  within the country. It is wrong to expect the economy itself to  "impose order"; production units are grinding to a halt one  after the other.    I make no secret of my liking for Chernomyrdin, as it seems  to me that he is the only person capable of leading the  government now. There is no point in our being afraid of a  regulated economy. It may well be worth fixing prices for  energy sources, at any rate. This is not a return to old ways,  but a necessity of the transition period.    [Rostarchuk] Nevertheless, Maritime Kray is unlikely to sit  back and wait for charity from Moscow....    [Nazdratenko] ...and "scramble out of the mess" ourselves?  Right. We have started to work out a concept for the status and  the development of the Maritime Kray. I am sure that this will  be a "practicable" document. Experts from the Far East  Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences are working on it.  Whatever we devise, this is how we will live. The buck will  not be passed to anybody else -- were we to embark on the wrong  road, that is. Our region has many problems in common with  Kamchatka, Magadan Oblast, Sakhalin, Khabarovsk. The Russian  czar knew what he was doing when he unified these territories.  And we have to unite. We must integrate, otherwise we will  "end our days" having sold off our resources for a song just to  put food on our tables.    [Rostarchuk] But is it really such a bad thing that foreign  investments are now actively heading for the Far East?    [Nazdratenko] Not at all! I am very much in favor of  developing cooperation. Nevertheless I prefer to do this on a  legal basis, and the juridical side of this matter has still to  be elaborated even now....    In this sense we have a lot of work to do and we have a lot  of potential. For all that, it seems to me that what is  important now is that we turn not so much toward the east as  toward the west. We yearn for Moscow, and we yearn to share the  life of our country. And the fact that 76 percent of Maritime  Kray inhabitants voted for the Russian Constitution proves that  they are putting up with the current problems patiently,  remaining loyal to their country and hoping that things will  change for the better.</p>

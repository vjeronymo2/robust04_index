			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The minimum performance standards identified by the Council for enforcement applications of satellite or radio vessel monitoring technology are the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The system must deliver accurate, real-time data for processing at a station on shore;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Position reports must contain vessel identification, the latitude and longitude of the vessel, and the date and time of the fix (i.e., positional fix);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Shipboard equipment must be capable of providing fully automatic, hands-off position reports and battery-powered operation for a given period of time. Units should also accept vessel power to charge internal batteries;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Shipboard equipment must be self-initializing when power is interrupted to maintain automatic operation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. The Global Positioning System should be used for VMS units where communication transmitters are linked with navigation receivers in order to obtain accurate position information;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. The shipboard equipment must be built to withstand the rigors of operation on a commercial high-seas fishing vessel in the Central and Western Pacific;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. The system must not require routine maintenance, and should be easily serviceable by trained technicians;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. The system design should permit the exchange, at sea, of sealed components by individuals who may not be trained technicians; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The shipboard equipment must be capable of monitoring vessels throughout their range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the establishment of these performance standards, NMFS and the USCG conducted a second test. This test indicated that one of the initial technologies examined might meet the performance requirements established by the Council, and merited further study in a larger experimental program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At a regular meeting of the Council on December 2, 1992, the members adopted a VMS policy to ensure that the development and application of a VMS in the Central and Western Pacific is carried out in a manner that is comprehensive, attendant to the needs of management authorities, cost-effective, and fair to the fishing industry. That policy states that the Council recognizes that electronic monitoring systems may be an effective and desirable technology for use in fisheries management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council established a VMS Committee to develop and review proposed VMS initiatives, policies, and other related topics addressed in the Council's fishery management plans under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Significant VMS decisions that would involve changes in the equipment or costs to be borne by the fishermen will be made by the full Council.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 31, 1994, NMFS published a policy (59 FR 15180) that established standards for all VMS used in U.S. fisheries. The policy covers the technical requirements of the equipment, the security of the system, and the confidentiality of the data. Implementation of the proposed rule would be consistent with that policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While VMSs are a promising alternative and supplement to existing enforcement techniques, uncertainties remain. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The extent to which the entire range of the vessels throughout the Pacific can be covered in practice;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The amount of other enforcement resources necessary to confirm apparent violations detected through use of the system;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The feasibility of applying the system to other fisheries with different fishing characteristics;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The extent to which the VMS hardware and software used would allow the integration of U.S. fishing vessels into developing regional VMS systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The cost effectiveness, from an enforcement perspective, of VMSs as compared to traditional methods of enforcement; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The social and economic effects of establishing a VMS, such as assessing the impacts on the owners, captains, crew, fishing behavior, and regulatory compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given these considerations, NMFS proposes to implement an experimental VMS program. Under this program, all vessels with a limited entry permit for the Hawaiian pelagic longline fishery would be required to carry a NMFS-owned vessel monitoring unit. As units become available for installation, the NMFS Office of Enforcement would schedule vessels for installation of a VMS unit. To the extent possible, installations would be scheduled to accommodate the vessel's fishing schedule. Reasonable notice of the proposed installation date would be given to the holder of the limited entry permit for the vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NMFS headquarters Office of Enforcement would exercise overall supervision and evaluation of the program, and determine when the objectives of the program have been met, thereby warranting termination of the experimental program. Day-to-day responsibility for implementing this program, however, would rest with the NMFS Special Agent-in-Charge (SAC) in Long Beach, CA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed action follows an extensive review of such systems by the Council under the guidance of Amendment 4 to the FMP and was approved by the Council at its meeting on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 14&hyph;16, 1993. The following elements were approved by the Council and are incorporated in this proposed rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. NMFS would select the necessary VMS equipment and provide it at no cost to the permit holder. This equipment would remain the property of NMFS and must be returned to NMFS upon request;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. All equipment would meet the performance standards adopted by the Council listed above;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Interfering with the equipment in any way would be prohibited;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Smoky tunnel Sir, Lex ('Eurotunnel', January 5) wonders whether Eurotunnel will be able to generate new cross-channel traffic that no-one had predicted. I imagine that its London-to-Paris trains will attract lots of new business from smokers such as me who have been told by British Airways that they are no longer welcome on board.

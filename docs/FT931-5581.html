			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Councils urged to maintain arts cash THE ARTS Council yesterday expressed its concern about cuts in local authority arts spending. Local authorities are the main paymasters of the arts in England and Wales, spending more than Pounds 300m a year, compared with the government's Arts Council budget of Pounds 225m. But rate-capping and other financial pressures have persuaded many local authorities to cut their arts budgets for 1993-94. Mr Anthony Everitt, secretary-general of the Arts Council, has written to local authorities urging them to maintain their arts spending. The Theatre Foundry, a touring arts organisation in Walsall, West Midlands, has lost its entire local authority revenue of Pounds 75,000 and the nearby New Vic Theatre in Stoke has had its grant from Staffordshire County Council cut 40 per cent. The Northern Ballet has lost Pounds 57,000, reducing its grant to Pounds 200,000, and Watermans Arts Centre in Brentford, west London, has suffered a 15 per cent reduction in grant. The Arts Council, which received an increase of only 2 per cent in its grant for 1993-94, can offer no financial help. It is pressing the Department of National Heritage to make it a statutory requirement for local authorities to support the arts.</p>

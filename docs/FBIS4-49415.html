			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Rixin (0491 2480 2450) of the Economics </F> Research Center of the State Planning Commission: "Views on  Scale of Investment in Fixed Assets"]    [Text] During the  period in which our country is shifting toward the socialist  market economy structure, theoretical circles and comrades in  the departments in charge of macro-economic management actually  hold different views on the matter of the present scale of  investment in fixed assets. To summarize, their controversy  focuses on two questions: First, is the present scale of  investment in fixed assets too big or not? Second, how should  the state control the scale of investment under present specific  conditions? The following are my own viewpoints on these two  questions.    The question of whether or not the present scale of  investment in fixed assets is too big involves the means and  standard for measuring the scale of investment.    One way is to use comparable prices to compare the  investment  scale of one year with that of the previous year; that is, we  can get the investment scale and its growth rate after allowing  for price rises in the scale of investment of the year. We can  accordingly judge if the investment scale is proper. Some  economists favor this method, and the State Statistics Bureau  has also compiled price indexes of investment in fixed assets.  The statistical communique of 1993 indicated the society-wide  investment in fixed assets was 1,182.9 billion yuan. Although  it increased by 50.6 percent over the previous year, it actually  increased by 22 percent over the previous year with the  deduction of the price index of investment in fixed assets  (which stood at 23.4 percent). The growth rate was lower than  that of 1992, which stood at 23.7 percent. So it is impossible  to come to the conclusion that the scale of investment for the  year is too high. Nor did the statistical communique of 1993  mention that the investment scale of the year was too high.  Instead, it only said that "the total scale of investment in  fixed assests of construction projects in progress was too  high." However, scale of investment and scale of construction  projects in progress are two different concepts. The communique  of 1993 indicated that the total scale of investment in fixed  assets of construction projects in progress for state-owned  units was 2,327.1 billion yuan. With the deduction of projects  that were completed by the end of the year, the volume of  unfinished projects amounted to 1,320 billion yuan; given that  the amount of investment of the state-owned units completed in  fixed assets stood at 832.1 billion yuan for the year, the  unfinished projects could be completed within one year and seven  months. It was major progress as compared with the fact that  the construction projects in progress needed two or three or  more years to be completed in recent years. So we cannot say  that the scale of construction projects in progress at the end  of 1993 was too big either.    Another way is to get the proportion of investment in fixed  assets in the GDP by comparing the investment scale of the year  with the GDP based on current prices. When we view investment  in connection with the economic strength of the state, we can  see if the investment scale is in proportion to the state  economic strength.    According to the statistic data, the proportions of the last  three years are listed in the following table:    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Unit current  |1991          |1992          |1993          |  |              |price (hundre-|              |              |              |  |              |d million yua-|              |              |              |  |              |n)            |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |GDP           |20188         |24020         |31380         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Society-wide  |ditto         |5509          |7855          |11829         |  |investment in |              |              |              |              |  |fixed assets  |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Proportion of ||27.3          |32.7          |37.7          |  |GDP           |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Investment of |current price |3628          |5274          |8321          |  |state-owned u-|(hundred mill-|              |              |              |  |nits in fixed |ion yuan)     |              |              |              |  |assets        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Proportion in ||18.0          |22.0          |26.5          |  |GDP           |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      In 1993, the society-wide fixed assets investment accounted  for 37.7 percent of the GDP, while investment of the state-owned  units in fixed assets accounted for 26.5 percent of the GDP. In  my opinion, this indicates that the investment scale was too  big. The reasons are as follows:    First, in view of the historical experience of  investment rates in fixed assets, the current scale of  investment has broken through the rational limit. The  practice of reform and opening to the world for fifteen years  indicates that once the proportion of society-wide investment in  fixed assets in the GDP exceeds 30 percent, and the proportion  of investment of state-owned units in fixed assets in the GDP  exceeds 20 percent, the relations in various aspects of the  national economy will become strained and even out of  proportion. The present relations of all aspects of the  national economy has already been very strained. The reason is  no other than this.    Second, compared with the planned arrangement for 1993,  the original scale of investment was much exceeded. The  first plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress  adopted the plan for 1993. It arranged that the total scale of  society-wide investment in fixed assets to be 800 billion yuan,  the investment rate being controlled within 30 percent.  Investment in state-owned units took up 565 billion yuan of it  while that of collective-owned units and invididuals accounted  for 235 billion. Now the society- wide investment in fixed  assets has exceeded the planned amount by 382.9 billion yuan,  the excess rate being 47.9 percent. Investment in state-owned  units is 267.1 billion more than the planned amount, the excess  rate being 47.3 percent, while investment by collective- owned  units and individuals has exceeded the planned amount by 115.8  billion yuan, the excess rate being 49.3%. According to  the  1993 plan, the arranged investment rate was controlled within 30  percent, that is, the proportion of the society-wide investment  in fixed assets in the national income. According to  statistics, the rate of society-wide investment in fixed assets  in 1992 was 39.5%. It is estimated that it rose to around  42  percent in 1993, exceeding that in the period of "the Great Leap  Forward." This was unusual since the founding of the PRC.    Third, last year's currency supply hit a record  high, reflecting an excessive scale in investment. In  1993, the GDP rose by 30.6 percent according to current price  calculation, while the society-wide investment in fixed assets  rose by 50.6 percent. That is an important reason why the demand  for currency grew. The situation of rapid increase in  investment causing an abrupt increase in currency supply is as  follows: On the basis of a large supply of 115.8 billion in  1992, a record high supply of 152.9 billion yuan was made in  1993. It was more than the total supply of the latter five  years in the 1980s (a total supply of 115.3 billion yuan from  1985 to 1989). By the end of 1993, currency in circulation  reached 586.5 billion. It rose by 35.3 percent compared to an  increase of 36.5 percent in the previous year. This was  exceeded only in 1988 (an increase of 46.7 percent), reaching  another height.    Fourth, the state of inflation also reflects an  excessive scale of investment. The increase of currency  supply caused by inflationary investment resulted in price  hikes. In 1993, the price index of the residents living cost  expenses (including commodity and service prices, i.e., the  consumer price index in the West) rose by 14.7 percent compared  to an increase of 6.4 percent in 1992, while the retail price  index rose by 13 percent compared to an increase of 5.4 percent  in 1992. The inflation rate last year exceeded two digits, for  the fourth time in over four decades after the founding of the  PRC. Great attention should be paid to it. As the effect of  money supply on prices has a lag period, the big increase of  money supply in 1993 will play a role in commodity price hikes  in 1994. So this year our economy will continue to face a severe  inflation situation.    Fifth, compared with foreign countries, the investment  scale of our country is relatively large. At present, the  proportion of investment in fixed assets in the GDP usually  stands around 15 to 20 percent in developed countries. Japan  stood around 30 percent at the highest. Of course, this  proportion has to do with the stage of economic development.  Take the ROK, a newly emerging industrialized country, for  example. When its economy took off in the 1970s, the highest  proportion was only around 33 percent. At that time, that of  Taiwan was only around 28 percent (22.8 percent in 1992).    How the country should control the scale of investment is a  problem that has not been settled properly under the new  situation in which macro-economic regulation and control is  being implemented.    One opinion holds it unnecessary for the state to control  the  investment scale and that it cannot be controlled either.  However, I think it is necessary to control it. I can only put  forward some opinion about principles as I have not studied a  lot about concrete steps.  <H5>  First, It Should Be Made Clear that the State Maintains the </H5> Principle of Guiding the Scale of Investment Through Planning  Under the System of Market Economy    Drawing on the experience of the market economy practiced by  Western countries (regions), in its plan the state can set an  absolute investment amount (including investment in fixed assets  and the amount of additional circulating funds) as well as the  total investment rate, i.e. the proportion of the total  investment (separating fixed assets investment and the amount of  additional circulating funds) in the GNP. In this way, the  investment scale will be more or less in keeping with the  economic strength of the country. With the reform of planning,  it is required that statistics move a step ahead to work out the  relevant indexes of the base period.  <H5>  Second, the State Should Formulate a Comparatively Detailed </H5> Industrial Policy To Guide Investment Direction    An industrial policy should be implemented in various  localities. We should combine readjustment of economic levers  with implementation of an industrial policy to promote  realization of the state investment plan.  <H5>  Third, the Central Bank Should Strengthen Its Control Over </H5> Fixed Asset Loans    The central bank should strictly control the plan for fixed  asset loans transmitted by the state. It should be included in  both the state investment plan and the credit plan of the bank.  It should be strictly carried out with no excess allowed.  Financial institutions of all kinds should not give fixed  assets loans at random. Localities and departments cannot issue  bonds, launch pilot projects of adopting the share-holding  system, and illegally raise funds for construction. We should  work according to the state plan while exploiting foreign  capital. We should strengthen guidance and practice of  standardized management in those construction projects in which  foreign businessmen have invested directly.  <H5>  Fourth, Use Different Means to Control Investments for </H5> Different Investors    The present macro-management of investment actually still  focuses on the management of investments by state-owned units,  failing to see investors of various economic elements newly  emerged since reform and opening up started, such as those of  the private economy, individual economy, township and town  enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign  cooperation enterprises, enterprises solely run by foreign  businessmen, and enterprises run jointly by the state and  collectives, by the state and individuals, and by collectives  and individuals. The main efforts of our reform of the economic  management structure should be shifted to these practical  affairs to earnestly strengthen macro-management of investment.</p>

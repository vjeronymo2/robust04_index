			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Dunkel warns on protectionism STRONG-ARM tactics by big countries to impose policies on others could endanger the world trading system, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said in South Korea this morning, apparently referring to the US, Reuter reports from Geneva. Unless the Uruguay Round talks on trade liberalisation were wrapped up this year, he told the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Seoul, they might never be completed. 'We see for example attempts to impose domestic environmental or labour standards on other countries through trade measures, and attempts to open markets through bilateral pressure rather than in multilateral negotiation,' Mr Dunkel said. 'This bilateralism is a threat to open regional arrangements as much as it is to the open multilateral system.' Mr Dunkel said he was disturbed by 'a new flirtation with protectionism in some of the world's leading economies' and a questioning of the value of an open trading system. This was especially alarming, the former Swiss diplomat said, because hopes for a modest recovery in the world economy 'hinge on the prospects for growth in trade'. His main criticism was clearly aimed at President Bill Clinton's new team and sections of the Democrat-controlled Congress which argue for tough tactics to achieve Washington's trade objectives. Mr Dunkel said Mr Clinton's request to Congress for renewed negotiating authority in the round until December 15 was encouraging, and urged leaders of the industrial powers meeting in Tokyo in July to work for that deadline. In a sign that he was far from convinced it could be met, he warned that 'all of the old protectionist interests are still out there . . . waiting for their chance at a comeback and all too happy to borrow some respectable clothes'.</p>

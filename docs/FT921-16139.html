			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Appointments: No answers at Lloyds Spotting a successor to Sir Jeremy Morse, Britain's longest serving clearing bank chairman, has been made no easier following the latest reshuffle in the Lloyds Bank boardroom. Eric Swainson, a director since 1986 and a regional board member from 1979, will become a vice-chairman following the annual general meeting in April. The 65-year-old Swainson, a former managing director of IMI, is a well-known Midlands businessman, but he is just one of several vice and deputy chairmen and two years older than Sir Jeremy who is expected to stand down within the next couple of years. Meanwhile, Sir John Hedley Greenborough is retiring as a deputy chairman and Sir William Harding as adviser on international affairs. Both men will remain on the board but Geoffrey Kent, a former chief executive of Imperial group, is stepping down as a director on reaching the age of 70.</p>

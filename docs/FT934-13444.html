			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Gengold mines' income improves A FIRMER gold price helped the 11 gold mines managed by Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor group, lift income after tax and capital expenditure by 22 per cent to R73.7m (Dollars 21.9m) from R60.6m in the September quarter. The three mines not to improve on the previous quarter's performance were Bracken and Stilfontein, both of which are being closed, and Unisel which, as previously announced, is struggling temporarily with poor grades. Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said a feature of the quarter was the large increase in tax paid by some mines. Particularly hard hit were Buffeslfontein and Kinross, which paid R16.5m (R2.4m) and R24.4m (R14.7m) tax respectively. Gold production in the group was virtually unchanged at 16,751kg. The average gold price received rose by 10.5 per cent to R38,414 per kg and unit working costs, across the group, rose by 1.1 per cent to R27,377 per kg from R27,083 per kg. In the Anglovaal group, the flagship producer Hartebeestfontein lifted profits after tax and capital expenditure by 11 per cent to R49.4m in the September quarter from R44.6m in June. Higher costs saw distributable profits at the marginal Loraine mine almost halved to R3.8m from R7.5m. ETC lifted distributable profits to R2.9m from R2.7m.</p>

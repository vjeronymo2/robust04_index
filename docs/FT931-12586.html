			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Smith figures disappoint POOR figures from WH Smith reverberated through several stocks, with those with DIY interests particularly hit. Smith revealed a decline in profits to Pounds 40.2m from Pounds 50.1m, blaming one-off items and tough conditions at its Do It All subsidiary. However, analysts expressed concern at the decline in margins and disappointment at the tone of the post-results meeting. In particular, Smith's management was said to be uncommunicative regarding the DIY business, although an analysts' visit next week is intended to set out future strategy. However, unconfirmed reports yesterday that Texas Home Care, the Ladbroke subsidiary, had begun discounting heavily at some of its Scottish stores appeared not to bode well for the sector. Profits downgrades for Smith followed, with the ranges falling from Pounds 108m-Pounds 118m down to Pounds 100m-Pounds 110m for this year, and to Pounds 110m-Pounds 125m for next year. In the short term, analysts foresee further weakness in the stock, particularly, if as widely expected, the chancellor imposes VAT on books in the Budget. WH Smith 'A' shares retreated 15 to 440p. Shares in Boots, which co-owns Do It All, suffered on the results, relinquishing 8 to 517p. One house was also telling clients that Boots was weaker ahead of a review next month by the US Food and Drug Administration of ICI's Zestril heart drug. It was suggested this would affect Boots' Manoplax drug. ICI put on 3 at 1138p. Other DIY groups to suffer yesterday included Kingfisher, off 9 at 550p, and Ladbroke, 1 1/2 easier at 201p. Bearish sentiment over Smith's Our Price music business hit Thorn EMI, down 15 at 818p. CU rights talk There was renewed speculation around the market that a substantial rights issue from the composite insurance sector is imminent. Yesterday it was the turn of Commercial Union to attract the rights issue rumours, as talk of a possible cash call from Royal Insurance tended to die down. CU dropped 19 to 614p as the rumours circulated in the market that the group might ask its shareholders for around Pounds 400m. And dealers noted a sharp increase in turnover in CU stock as the session wore on, with an above-average 3.4m shares changing hands by the close. Specialists said a cash-raising exercise by CU was credible and the company could take advantage of the recent strength of the shares, which raced up to a record high of 636p earlier this month. The strength in the shares reflected the group's extremely small exposure to the domestic mortgage indemnity business, which has wreaked havoc among other insurance groups, such as Royal and Sun Alliance, and limited exposure to the beleaguered UK property market. Argyll better The climb in Argyll Group shares continued as two brokers turned positive on the stock, which has generally missed out on the surge by the other high street food retailers. BZW moved from a hold to a buy, citing the stock's underperformance which against the sector was around 6 per cent before yesterday's rise. Nomura upgraded, adding Pounds 2.5m to forecast Pounds 422.5m for this year and looking for Pounds 472.5m for next year. The shares firmed 5 to 403p. SmithKline Beecham 'A' fell 10 to 491p and the Units declined 8 to 429p in the wake of selling in New York the previous night. The stock was further affected in London as switching out of defensives into cyclicals gathered momentum, following Tuesday's one percentage point cut in UK interest rates. Analysts said continuing worries about the impact of the Clinton administration on health spending had unsettled the stock. Wellcome, also under pressure, fell 14 to 903p. Glaxo, which failed to benefit from Tuesday's market rise, caught up yesterday. In spite of uncertainties over the possibility of a move into the over-the-counter market, the shares put on 6 at 688p. There was additional support from news that Glaxo's anti-asthma drug Serevent is to be reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration on February 26. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson forged ahead 18 to 350p, reflecting the continuing high level of stock market activity and hopes of increased corporate finance business via rights issues and takeovers. Berkeley, the housebuilder which recently bought and sold a small stake in fellow construction group Higgs &amp; Hill, pocketing a substantial profit in the process, moved up 13 to 341p as Soros Fund Management was revealed as having taken a 3.19 per cent stake in the company. Persimmon added 7 at 215p ahead of a presentation at BZW. A number of brokers highlighted Northern Foods' floating debt as a beneficiary of low interest rates. The shares rose 4 to 275p. Shares in Smiths Industries came under pressure and at the day's worst were down 16p after several brokers, including Hoare Govett, downgraded profits expectations in the wake of production cuts at customer Boeing that were announced on Tuesday. The shares later picked up to close 8 lighter on the day at 351p. The production cuts at Boeing also hurt TI, which fell 8 to 285p, as Tuesday's profits downgrading from the company's broker SG Warburg finally took effect. Profit-taking and caution from Charterhouse Tilney in its aerospace and defence review saw British Aerospace retreat 6 before recovering to close a net penny off at 227p, but a recommendation of Westland in the same publication helped the shares rise 5 to 138p. Siebe improved 6 to 451p as it held presentations in the City. Speculation about improved car sales helped Lex Service advance 6 to 300p. Yield buyers were seen in Tiphook, which appreciated 20 to 359p. Further profit-taking left NFC 4 cheaper at 270p. The improved outlook for the construction sector gave a boost to English China Clays, 7 firmer at 472p. News and information organisation Reuters Holdings climbed 18 to 1366p following the launch of a UK equities service to compete with the London Stock Exchange's product, Topic. Concern that a 17.5 per cent VAT charge would be imposed on publishers faded. Kleinwort Benson argued that the charge would be only 5 per cent, thus bringing it in line with other EC countries. United Newspapers rose 13 to 528p, Telegraph picked up 5 to 454p and Reed International put on 5 at 659p. USM-quoted Southnews jumped 13 to 123p as a result of a mention in a specialist tipsheet. Public relations firm Shandwick added 2 at 23p following results on Tuesday. SG Warburg argued in an internal note that, on a prospective rating of 7.5 times earnings, the shares were fairly valued at about 33p. Allied Textile rose 8 to 453p on half-year results slightly above market expectations. BT was among the best performing FT-SE 100 stocks, with the fully-paid shares moving forward 7 1/2 to 406 1/2 p and the partly-paid 7 1/2 to 301 1/2 p after Hoare Govett upgraded its recommendation from 'undervalued' to 'buy'. Mr James Ross, Hoare's telecoms analyst, enthused over a new discount calling programme, which he said could be introduced by BT later this year. The recent series of downgrades continued to depress Cable and Wireless shares, which finished 14 weaker at 712p, also affected by switch-ing to BT. Graseby, the electronics and precision instruments group, jumped 14 to 152p. The market is now confident that the company will maintain the dividend when it announces its 1992 results, expected on Budget Day. A Pounds 17.5m rights issue initially dented the Volex share price, which fell to 395p before staging a strong rally and closing a net 26 ahead at 440p.

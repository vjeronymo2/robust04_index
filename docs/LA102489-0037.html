			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> EXXON SUES STATE FOR SPILL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Exxon Corp. sued the state of Alaska, charging that the cleanup of the Prince  William Sound oil spill was hindered because the state opposed the use of  oil-dispersing chemicals. Exxon said it will seek reimbursement from the state  for cleanup costs and damage claims that the company believes occurred because  of the state's conduct. The amounts were not specified. The case, filed in  Anchorage Superior Court, is a counterclaim to a lawsuit that the state filed  in August against Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., alleging negligence  in the March 24 spill and subsequent cleanup.  </P></p>

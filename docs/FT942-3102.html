			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Arts: Alston at Aldeburgh - Ballet The concert hall stage at The Maltings, Snape, is a fine space hitherto unused for dance. Broad, deep, uncompromising in its bare brick walls, it has just seen the emergence of a re-born London Contemporary Dance Theatre under the direction of Richard Alston. Admirers of the company, and of Alston, will be glad to know that the dancers are on tremendous form and that Alston has baptised them, as he has the Maltings in nomine Terpsichores, with three serious recent pieces, which I saw on Monday. LCDT's ensemble is slimmed down to 12 dancers - most of its major artists are still there - and Alston has responded bravely to their gifts, and to the possibilities of the stage. Britten, given the Aldeburgh festival context, was an obvious choice for music, and this year's featured composer, Stravinsky, has provided the other score. So, the opening Three movements from Petrushka for piano, and Alston's intriguing gloss on Fokine. The piano is centre stage. Rolf Hind's bold account (rich sonorities; taut rhythms) of this devilish transcription is matched by Darshan Singh Bhuller's impersonation of the puppet. In an odd fashion we seem to watch two Petrushkas, so intense the relationship between transcendental pianism and the ferocious demands Alston makes of Bhuller. (At a couple of moments, Bhuller stands watching Hind, as if contemplating an alter ego.) Four couples - white shirts; black trousers - are the Butterweek revellers, their movements hinting at Fokine's folk dances as they circle the stage and the piano which acquires a strongly dramatic presence. But the piece is Bhuller's and he shows a brutalised and somehow noble figure, in dancing that covers a range of dynamics from silkiest phrases to fierce anguish. It is a superb display of expressive virtuosity. In Sad Eyes, Alston has linked two Britten scores. The Prelude and fugue, Op 29, written for Boyd Neel, is used for plotless, open-hearted dances for four couples. The movement is fresh, broad-spanning, unclouded. (Pleasure in viewing it will increase when the mock-Indian outfits look less like uniforms.) Then, with the Lacrymae Op. 48, for viola and orchestra, inspired by a Dowland song, the mood changes as eyes sadden, seeking the rest that Dowland's text urges. The dancing couples are unhappy lovers, and at the last Alston allows them that repose which is the acceptance of suffering. The choreography is emotional, dense, subtly varied, and though I think the score a fraction too long, the dance is shaped and performed beautifully. The final piece was Rumours, Visions, which is Les Illuminations (Britten's setting of Rimbaud) staged with brilliant economy of means. The excellent lighting, and gauzy back drop used throughout the evening, was by Peter Mumford. Costuming, ideally allusive in this last piece, was by Belinda Ackerman. Alston conflates Rimbaud's poetic imagery and his fraught relationship with Verlaine. Friedrich Gehrig has the right mixture of vulnerability and wildness for Rimbaud; Kenneth Tharp's Verlaine is brooding, watchful. Around them Alston cunningly sets the strange mob of Rimbaud's dreamings, that wild parade which is announced in the first song. Among the several merits of the staging is the fact that it allows our imaginations to follow those of Britten and Rimbaud: Alston's dances are hints rather than statements. The drawback to the performance lay in an orchestral imbalance: after the invocation 'J'ai seul la clef de cette parade sauvage', I heard not one word of Gunnar Gudbjornsson's account of the tenor role. The score, from the Britten Sinfonia under Nicholas Cleobury, was otherwise excellent, as were the interpretations of the Sad Eyes music.</p>

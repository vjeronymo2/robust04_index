			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Arts: A chapel to remember - Architecture A new building of European stature in England is a rare thing. I felt that I had seen one when I recently visited the new chapel at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge designed by MacCormac, Jamieson Prichard  - the practice of Richard MacCormac the current President of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Fitzwilliam College is situated to the north of Cambridge's city centre, where it occupies a flat site of some eight acres. The first range of residential and collegiate buildings were designed in the 1960's by Sir Denys Lasdun. The budget was extremely restricted by the modest resources of the University Grants Committee. As a result the long ranges of brick and concrete buildings are functional but uninspiring. The plan of the college, devised by Lasdun, was an intelligent one with a spiral arrangement of college buildings around the centrally placed hall and public rooms. The hall itself does provide a moment of architectural excitement with its explosion of parabolic curved roofs soaring from a fort-like brick base. More recently a new residential range was added to an intriguing design by Richard MacCormac. This is now looking very well as the planting grows around the window bays from a series of brick terraces. The chapel is the latest addition to the college and is the result of a generous private benefaction. It seems to me to be one of MacCormac's best and most complex buildings. He had a difficult task to join a modest chapel on to a Lasdun range. What he has achieved is a small creation resonant with architectural ideas. The plan is a circle joined by a bridging element to the flat end of an existing block. The circle defines the whole building, immediately giving it a strong but discreet character on the college campus. The chapel itself is on the first floor and is reached by two curving staircases that gradually emerge into the clear light of the main chapel space. This is defined by four structural columns supporting a flat roof which surmounts a clerestory of windows giving top light. In section, the chapel lies like a boat moored between the staircases, apparently suspended in space. The impression of a boat is reinforced by the swelling timber underside of the chapel which you pass as you climb the stairs; you almost feel as though you are clambering into the safety of a sturdy rowing boat as you reach the timber floor of the main chapel, a sensation which is enhanced by the ships railings surrounding the edge chapel. The altar stands towards one edge of the circle. Behind the altar is a flat wall of glass giving on to a beautiful view of lawn and trees. I heard the architect talk in Oxford about his chapel and the symbolism of its design. We are, when we approach the chapel, moving on a journey through life that takes us into the safe haven of an ark which may transport us into the after life. The boat-like form of the small chapel inside the thick walls is a protected place where we can deal with grief and death and look out into the only eternity we can see - the perpetual miracle of the renewal of nature. This is an intuitive building, its mystical sensations made manifest by the care exercised by the architect - and the craftsmen, who built the chapel and made the joinery to such a high standard. For once, here is a building that prompts a whole series of architectural associations and influences. The circular form with cubic shapes inside it has a long tradition. In 1553, Vignola built a cube with an oval drum at the church of S. Andrea in the Via Flaminia, Rome. He was to develop this oval design at S. Anna dei Palafrenieri in the Vatican later in the late 1560's. Here the church itself is oval in plan, but set inside a rectangle. Michaelangelo's Capella Sforza in S. Maria Maggiore in Rome (built to Michaelangelo's design but probably completed by Giacomo della Porta in the late 16th century) is a real precedent for the Fitzwilliam chapel. In plan the apsed transepts are formed of curves which are less than a semicircle. The whole design shows incomplete forms leading into one another - something later Baroque architects, especially Boromini, were to understand and exploit. The flavour of MacCormac's chapel is, however, far from the Baroque. There is more than a reminiscence of the work of Sir John Soane. This is seen in the way MacCormac cleverly allows light into the building, through the interstices of the various elements. Soane, too, was intrigued by the idea of 'things inside other things'. The great glass wall that allows nature almost to surround the altar comes from the famous students' chapel at Otaniemi near Helsinki, in Finland, designed in the 1950's by Kaija and Heikki Siren. There a glass east wall brings the rather melancholy world of Finnish pine forests into the chapel. A large wooden cross stands in the wood beyond, like something from a wintry painting by Caspar David Friedrich. Two other elements of the chapel are redolent of recent architectural history. The whole sense of fine timber and skilled carpentry brings into the mind the world of Frank Lloyd Wright's early houses and, perhaps more particularly, the Californian timber houses in Pasadena by the brothers Greene and Greene. The other element, the curved form of the brick walls, seems inspired by the work of Louis Kahn at his Salk Institute at La Jolla, California and his Government buildings in Dacca, Bangladesh. Mario Botta, too, has recently perfected the form of the circular brick tower - especially in his remarkable office 'castle' in Lugano. This small Cambridge college chapel is an important and enjoyable new building. Labels have been attached to MacCormac: he has been called a Romantic pragmatist. I suspect that all that really means is that he has taken advantage of the freedom of form and structure made possible by modernism - and added to it an imaginative sensitivity inspired by the more romantic strands of recent architectural history. Couple this understanding with a very strong sense of the value of materials, and you have a combination of geometry and feeling that is both remarkable and rewarding.</p>

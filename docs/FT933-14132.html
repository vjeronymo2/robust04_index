			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: NZ brewer placement may fund acquisition LION NATHAN, the New Zealand-based brewing and soft drinks group, announced yesterday that it may be about to mount a takeover bid for the brewing business of Australia's SA Brewing group. Lion is raising NZDollars 260m (USDollars 143m) through a private placing of equity, and yesterday's prospectus said the proceeds would be used to reduce debt and support the possible acquisition of the brewing operations of SA Brewing Holdings. Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive, said his company, already the biggest brewer in Australia with some 40 per cent of the beer market, was tendering to buy the assets. A spokesman said Lion had had extensive talks with institutions in Australia. He said that it was interested in SA Brewing, but that the price would 'have to be right'. SA Brewing would make no comment yesterday. The company has consistently declined to comment on reports that it is planning to sell its brewing operations, which have been valued at up to ADollars 350m (USDollars 238m). The group has suffered sluggish profits recently as a result of poor beer and packaging trading. For the six months to December, net earnings were just 1.1 per cent ahead at ADollars 57.15m, although the outlook for the second half was said to be favourable. In March, when announcing a big jump in half-year profits, Lion forecast satisfactory full-year profits but said tougher competition and difficult trading conditions in the Australian beer market would be a challenge. Boosted by an acquisition, Lion's net profits for the six months to February rose 73 per cent to NZDollars 79.5m.</p>

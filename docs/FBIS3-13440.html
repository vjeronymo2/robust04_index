			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 8 March  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Protest Rallies    2. Demonstrations    3. Call to Jihad    4. Attitudes Toward Israel    5. Government Policy and Establishment Media    6. Church and State    7. Cultural Conflict    8. Regime's Downfall Predicted  <H5>  PROTEST RALLIES </H5>   AL-SHA'B's 8 March issue continues the paper's broad  coverage  of domestic reaction to the al-Ibrahimi massacre, devoting pages  2-5 to accounts of demonstrations and rallies protesting the  Hebron shooting and citing speeches by Socialist Labor Party  leader Ibrahim Shukri, the party's Secretary General 'Adil  Husayn, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Ahmad al-Malat,  and lesser figures, all castigating the government's policies  and Israeli and U.S. "hegemony" plans. This issue carries a  special banner in the upper left-hand corner reading: "A  special edition on the Egyptian people's intifadah." The major  headline is: "The Revolution of the Mosques." Several stories  and comments deal with the confrontation between police and  demonstrators at al-Azhar on 4 March.    On page 2 an approximately 3,000-word account of two SLP  rallies in al-Fashn and al-Basatin townships reports party  leader Ibrahim Shukri's remarks that the Interior Ministry tried  to ban student demonstrations at the country's top universities  and refused to allow an SLP-organized march from al-Azhar to the  mufti's office that would have included major personalities  following Friday prayers on 4 March. Shukri says: "Let the  Egyptian authorities know that marches were organized in  Britain, India, and most of the world's capitals to protest the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The marchers were not harmed but  in Egypt they were beaten up in al-Tahrir Square, their wounds  bled, and they were suffocated by police tear gas grenades,  simply because they dared to show their anger against the  criminal Zionist murderers."    Shukri criticizes the restrictions on opposition press,  police violence, and rigged elections but tells his audience  that "the wheel has started to turn and God's victory will come,  even after a long night."    A 600-word report on page 6 is about a conference held  inside  al-Azhar Mosque by the leaders of several opposition groups, the  SLP, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Nasirists, and the Liberal  Party. The meeting was held to coincide with popular  demonstrations outside the compound. The conferees urged the  PLO to reject surrender and withdraw from the "so-called peace"  conferences. They also urged the Egyptian and other Arab  governments to release political detainees.  <H5>  DEMONSTRATIONS </H5>   A 300-word report on page 2 describes the 4 March Friday  prayers at al-Istikamah Mosque in al-Jizah Square in Cairo,  cites the prayer imam's remarks on Jewish treachery, and slogan  shouting by the worshipers. The report says security forces  surrounded the area to forestall any planned march on the  Israeli Embassy. A report on page 3 describes similar protests  following Friday prayers in Alexandria and police measures to  prevent demonstrations.    A 500-word report on page 3 describes the security forces'  confrontation with worshipers who marched out of al-Azhar Mosque  after Friday prayers to protest the Hebron shooting. The mosque  was surrounded and tear gas was used to disperse the  demonstrators.    Other accounts of protests against the al-Ibrahimi incident  include a clash between police and demonstrators following  Friday prayers outside Mustafa Mahmud Mosque in Cairo's  al-Muhandisin quarter, marches by factory workers and students  in Hulwan, and reports on prayers said for the souls of the  victims of the Hebron incident in various parts of the country.    The paper carries on page 1 a six-column by 7-inch  photograph  showing police cars and security personnel against a backdrop of  an al-Azhar building. The photo has the following caption:  "Al-Azhar Square turns into a battleground." The rest of the  page is almost entirely taken up by seven other smaller  photographs depicting security measures around al-Azhar and  worshipers marching and raising Koran copies in their hands.  One picture shows "security forces arresting Labor Party member  Muhammad Ibrahim." The only text on the page is part of the  chief editor's article.  <H5>  CALL TO JIHAD </H5>   A 1,500-word account of a professional associations  conference in Cairo cites a speech by SLP [referred to here as  the Islamic Labor Party] Secretary General 'Adil Husayn who says  Ramadan this year has turned into a month of martyrdom in  addition to fasting and worship. He appeals to Egyptian police  officers not to confront young demonstrators with bullets  because he views the Egyptian police as too worthy to be equated  with the Israelis. He declares: "We have not met here to weep  for there is no time for weeping. Indeed, it is almost a sin to  weep. It is the time of anger and preparation for revenge."    Speaking at the same conference, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy  General Guide Ahmad al-Malat chastises the government for doing  nothing about the Hebron shooting and asks: "Have they been  struck dumb? Has Clinton not given them permission yet?"    Al-Malat says: "Young people, you are the remaining hope.  You are the resource. Work should begin today, not tomorrow.  It is the hope to rescue Palestine... by jihad. Jihad is the  only way. Every young man among you must prepare himself for  the day when he will answer the call to jihad."   <H5>    ATTITUDES TOWARD ISRAEL </H5>   On page 5 there is a 2,000-word report on a conference  organized by faculty members from various Egyptian universities  during which academics expressed solidarity with the Palestinian  people, backed the Palestinian demand for the removal of the  Israeli settlements, and urged the immediate severance of  diplomatic ties with Israel.    Mustafa Bakri, in a 700-word article on page 5 carrying the  headline "The Volcano of Anger," says the conflict with Israel  is one of existence, not a mere border dispute, and the whole of  Palestine must be regained. Noting that the regime is incapable  of confronting Israel, he says the hope lies with the people,  especially the young.    Islamic preacher and writer Muhammad al-Ghazali, in his  Tuesday column "This Is Our Religion," says the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre comes as no surprise because Jews are brought up  in the religious tradition of waging "a war of extermination  against their enemies."  <H5>  GOVERNMENT POLICY AND ESTABLISMENT MEDIA </H5>   Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn in a 1,500-word article on  pages 1 and 9 speaks of the eruption of public anger against  Israel and the Egyptian Government which cooperates, normalizes  ties, and advocates "hot peace" with it. After referring to the  protests of 4 March at al-Azhar and the concurrent meeting of  opposition leaders there, he contrasts the government's failure  to respond to the Hebron massacre with its success at putting  down domestic unrest and protests. He declares that no good can  come from a government riddled with financial corruption and  whose inability to remedy the country's problems is rivalled  only by its success in clinging to power against the public  wish. He urges all patriotic forces to unite in order to force  the government to listen to the opposition's views and calls for  pursuing the difficult road of democracy until the time comes  when the people can choose their own rulers.    A 1,500-word article by Muhammad Hilal on page 4 takes  Egyptian television to task for carrying less coverage on the  Hebron massacre than Israeli television and continuing to show  its quiz shows, boring serials, and "rotten" films. He notes  that Egyptian television took care not to cover the 4-March  Friday prayers from al-Azhar Mosque because its officials  realized it was going to be the scene of protests and instead  relayed prayers from another Cairo mosque.    SLP deputy leader Muhammad Hilmi Murad, writing about the  country's "popular awakening" in an article on page 7, calls on  the government to take people's wishes into account and urges  opposition parties, professional associations, and labor parties  to advocate and defend popular causes.  <H5>  CHURCH AND STATE </H5>   Muslim Brotherhood columnist Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus  addresses his thanks to university students across the country  for refuting the initial foreign news agencies' description of  the popular Egyptian reaction to the Hebron massacre as  "lukewarm and feeble." In his back-page column on page 12, he  also refers to the massive protests by professional associations  and worshipers and notes that these demonstrations reassured him  that Arabhood and Islam still flow in the country's veins. He  says: "Frankly, I feared for my country from the advocates of  pharaonism and isolation and the haters who demand separation of  religion and state." Adding that such people control state  media and education, he notes that he had been worrying that  they would "brainwash" the people into believing that they were  solely Egyptian, unconcerned with events in the Arab and Islamic  world.  <H5>  CULTURAL CONFLICT </H5>   An approximately 3,000-word article on page 12, by Mahjub  'Umar, analyzes the cultural conflict between the Arabs and  Israel, which cannot be ended by interim agreements but will  continue until the "racist aggressor agrees to restore rights  and to live in equality under the aegis of the region's  prevailing, Arab-Islamic culture." He says that the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre was a microcosm of this cultural conflict and  that the attacker, Baruch Goldstein, was a product of his  culture and cannot be called insane unless all members of his  community are called insane too. Noting that Israel itself is  the original, large settlement, he foresees the day when the  world will accept its disarmament.    Muslim Brotherhood official and columnist Mustafa Mashhur  refers, in a 1,500-word article on page 7, to the long-standing  but unsuccessful attempts by Egypt's enemies to dilute its  Islamic character, including attempts by French and British  occupiers to introduce foreign laws into the country, by  proselytizing, and the propagation of dissolute Western culture.    He says that after Hasan al-Banna founded the Muslim  Brotherhood in 1928 with the aim of reviving the Muslim state  following the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire, there came the  secularist onslaught against al-Azhar and against Islamic laws  and courts, the shackling of Egypt by the Camp David Accord, and  the attempt to forge normal ties between "Egypt's Muslim people  and the Zionist enemy who usurps Palestine." He declares that  all these attempts have failed and young men and women are  embracing religion, filling mosques to capacity, and wearing  Islamic attire voluntarily. He adds that their support for the  Palestinian cause remains strong.  <H5>  REGIME'S DOWNFALL PREDICTED </H5>   A 750-word article by Dr. Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad on page 4  accuses the government of idiocy, hatred for the public, and  love for Israel and the Kach movement. In the article, entitled  "An Eyewitness to the Regime's Crime," the writer views the  security forces' use of tear gas against al-Azhar as a sign of  the regime's imminent demise.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (16): Business needs a new signpost - Profile: the IBIA THE experienced western banker clutched his drink nervously at a party at the Warsaw Marriott and, looking around the room, said: 'You know, doing business here scares the hell out of me.' His panic comes from working in an environment where few private business have any history, and where the traditional way has been to set false trails for the communist taxman rather than establish track records for credit officers. 'You never really know who you're doing a deal with and there's always the fear that too late,' he explains. His problems are compounded by the fact that Poland's private entrepreneurs have learned the lesson that appearances make the man, and many invest in a Mercedes before buying their first machine tool to establish their credibility. 'Some you see driving around in what represents 90 per cent of their working capital,' says one referring to his colleagues. Indeed, the Polish American Enterprise Fund, a US government-financed initiative designed to boost the private sector, has invested some Dollars 10m. But it has found it is spending some 40 per cent of its effort on checking the information it is given by hopeful borrowers. Its project application form is a 15-page leaflet which not only asks about the loan proposal but delves deep into the applicant's past, including his entire employment record and home addresses for the past 10 years and his family's financial standing. Some time is bound to elapse before things improve as the sector providing information to business about companies is yet in its infancy. The locally-owned Business Industry Information Agency (IBIA), with a staff of 50, is one of the first offering such a service. A file providing the essential facts including its financial results for the past three years about a company can be provided within 10 days for Dollars 100 and the company deals with between 60 and 100 inquiries a month. Some, indeed, come from Polish companies who want details about western partners with whom they are considering a deal. Its head, Mr Jaroslav Govin, says the basis of the information on Polish companies he provides comes from the interested party. 'It's still difficult to break down barriers and some companies react to a request for figures by threatening to take us to court, as if we were doing something illegal,' he says. 'But we explain to them that we are doing the research on behalf of a western company which wants to invest or a bank which wants to lend them money and that it would be counter-productive if they were to refuse to show us anything. They usually see the point,' he adds, but admits that around 25 per cent refuse to co-operate. The IBIA can also turn to records kept in the courts under company law which require private companies to present annual accounts and other key information in special files. Then there is the opinion of the bank where the company has its account as to its creditworthiness which banks issue after their client has given the go-ahead. Tax records, however, are inaccessible. The researchers also trawl through local newspapers to turn up information and the fact that the Gazeta Bankowa, a financial weekly, is in the same group is a help. The IBIA's customers from abroad come mainly from France, largely due to a link with Coface, the export credit insurance agency and then Austria and Italy. It also has an office in the Soviet Union and is in a position to deal with enquiries on companies in Moscow and Vilnius.</p>

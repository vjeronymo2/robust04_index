			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Eagle Star and BBL unite against surveyors EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, and Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the Belgian Bank, are to take legal action against two firms of chartered surveyors after yesterday reaching agreement in a long-running legal dispute over mortgage indemnity insurance. Eagle Star will pay a maximum of Pounds 87.5m to settle the dispute with BBL, which lodged an insurance claim on policies covering commercial property loans after borrowers, including Land &amp; Property Trust, defaulted during 1990. BBL said total loans of some Pounds 308m had been extended to three separate property developers affecting six properties. The bank said its exposure via banking syndicates amounted to 46 per cent of this amount (or about Pounds 142m). The total value of losses on the loans including rolled-up interest is understood to be about Pounds 220m. The value of the settlement will depend on the outcome of separate legal action which the insurer and bank will take against chartered surveyors Lewis &amp; Tucker and John D Wood Commercial, alleging that valuations provided for the six properties were negligent. BBL will receive Pounds 70m now plus the first Pounds 35m of any cash recovered from the valuers in the joint action. Proceeds from other monies recovered will be shared between the two companies. Mr Michael Heath, executive director, said Eagle Star 'was gratified' by the settlement which reduces uncertainty about company's exposure to property-related insurances.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Manx ministry shake-up urged The Isle of Man government said in a report yesterday that responsibility for financial services should be split off from its treasury into a new department, and the island's industry and tourism departments should be merged in a new trade and industry department. The financial sector is the largest contributor to the island's economy, but the government does not have a department responsible solely for its affairs. The report on economic strategy, compiled by the Central Economic Strategy Unit under the chairmanship of Mr Terry Groves, a member of the House of Keys - the lower of the island's two parliamentary chambers - produced 71 recommendations. They included setting up a companies division in the island's High Court and appointing an experienced deemster (judge) for it. The island, a self-governing Crown dependency of the UK, is financially self-sufficient and, under its agreement with the UK, cannot go into budget deficit. Financial services and associated businesses and professions produce more than a third of the island's income. There has been dissatisfaction in the industry over the lack of government resources devoted to the sector. The industry deals with the Manx government through the island's treasury and regulatory bodies, which are supervised by the treasury. The report proposes the establishment of an economic development committee comprising ministers from the four revenue-raising departments: treasury, financial services, agriculture and trade and industry. Mr Miles Walker, the island's chief minister, said yesterday that the government had already formed the committee. He said restructuring to create new departments would take about two years. The report was the first commissioned by the island's government to include extensive private-sector involvement. Its recommendations include: Negotiating double taxation agreements for the growing ship management industry. Negotiating bilateral agreements with European Union states for the sale of Manx financial products. Enacting clearer trust legislation. Enhancing and focusing government marketing strategies. Enacting more legislation in the island, rather than taking legislation directly from the UK. Priority would be given to commercial legislation. Examining ways to ensure better use of the workforce, such as retraining, provision of childcare and incentives for businesses providing home work schemes. On residency the report says: 'It is not possible that growth and development of the economy could be achieved without an increased labour force and therefore a higher population level. But the ultimate objective is for maximum national income at the minimum level of population.' It recommended replacing the existing work permit system with identity cards, which would be issued to residents who fulfil criteria - such as long-term residence, birthright and key-worker status - which would be varied according to the island's needs.</p>

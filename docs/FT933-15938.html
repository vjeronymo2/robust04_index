			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe/GEC active Confirmation that collaboration talks between British Aerospace and GEC had taken place but had now ceased continued to excite the market and made BAe the day's best performer among FT-SE 100 stocks. Weekend press reports that the two groups were in talks about merging their defence operations led the two companies to issue a statement early yesterday saying: 'Discussions on a fuller collaboration have ceased.' However, market watchers remain convinced that such a deal may be possible at a later date and a deal will necessitate a cash injection from GEC into BAe. The shares responded by moving 4 ahead to 386p on trading volume of 2.6m. GEC closed 11 lower at 322p ex-dividend, with most of that fall accounted for by the 7.62p final dividend payment.</p>

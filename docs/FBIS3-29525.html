Foreign Affairs  Secretary Roberto Romulo said that North Korea's decision will  considerably diffuse tension in the Korean peninsula and ease  the concerns of the countries in the region. Romulo said North  Korea's move may have nipped U.S.-led efforts to push for  sanctions against the communist state; this is, if it continues  to refuse inspections of its nuclear facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An individual who fails to participate in a scheduled activity (e.g., failure to attend a scheduled training course) is not considered to be participating in SEA program activities. However, for purposes of receiving a SEA allowance, it is not always necessary for the individual to have actually participated in SEA program activities for the week claimed. What is, at a minimum, necessary is that the individual be participating in a program (approved by the State agency) which provides training programs on an ongoing basis and allows individuals to avail themselves of other SEA program services when they are needed. As long as individuals are under such a program, even though no activities are scheduled for a given week, they will be considered to be participating in SEA program activities and may be paid SEA allowances. It is possible that an individual may be eligible for both regular UC and the SEA allowance. This will occur when the individual is participating in training related to self-employment which is also approved training under State law. In this instance, the State is free to determine whether regular UC or the SEA allowance will be paid as long the eligibility requirements for the respective program are met. However, in no instance may both regular UC and the SEA allowances be paid with respect to the same period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since States do not disqualify individuals under their regular UC laws for failure to participate in SEA program activities, the SEA ``equal treatment'' provision does not address what disqualifications States may impose in these cases. It is recommended that States disqualify these individuals from receipt of SEA allowances only for the week the failure to participate occurs. Such individuals may be eligible for regular UC for that week if State law provisions relating to regular UC are met. Individuals who fail to meet the participation requirement may be dropped by the State from the SEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) They are actively engaged on a full-time basis in activities (which may include training) relating to the establishment of a business and becoming self-employed. The Department of Labor (``Department'') is researching the relationship of this requirement to the Americans with Disabilities Act. When this research is completed, guidance on what constitutes a ``full-time basis'' will be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is the case with failing to participate in SEA activities, States do not currently disqualify individuals under their regular UC laws for failure to actively engage on a full-time basis relating to the establishment of a business and becoming self-employed. Therefore, the SEA ``equal treatment'' provision does not address what disqualifications States may impose in these cases. It is recommended that States disqualify these individuals from receipt of SEA allowances only for the week the failure to actively engage on a full-time basis occurs. Such individuals may be eligible for regular UC for that week if State law provisions relating to regular UC are met. Individuals who fail to meet the ``full-time'' requirement may be dropped by the State from the SEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 5 Percent Rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3306(t)(4), FUTA, places a limitation on the number of individuals in a State who may receive SEA allowances. Specifically, it provides that the aggregate number of individuals receiving the allowance must ``not at any time exceed 5 percent of the number of individuals receiving regular unemployment compensation under the State law at such time *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Department will monitor this ``5 percent test'' on a monthly basis. Therefore, States must use at least a monthly measurement period as well. The calculation relates to individuals actually receiving (i.e., paid) SEA for the week as a percent of those receiving regular UC for the same week. Thus, for example, if 10,000 individuals receive regular UC (including UCFE and UCX) for a given week, then no more than 500 may receive SEA allowances (including UCFE and UCX claimants). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The 5 percent figure is not arrived at by taking 5 percent of the sum of the number of individuals receiving SEA and the number of individuals receiving regular UC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The 5 percent figure is an express limitation which the State may not exceed. Therefore, States must monitor SEA allowance payments closely to assure that the 5 percent limitation is not exceeded. The Department recommends that new individuals not be added to the SEA program if it appears the 5 percent threshold may be exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> No Cost to Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3306(t)(5), FUTA, places an additional requirement on the States as a condition of paying SEA allowances. It provides that the payment of SEA allowances must not result in any cost to the UTF ``in excess of the cost that would be incurred by such State and charged to such [Unemployment Trust] Fund if the State had not participated in'' the SEA program. Put simply, payment of SEA allowances may not result in any additional benefit charges to the UTF. This limitation applies only to the benefit costs associated with the payment of SEA/regular UC. It does not apply to the charging of SEA allowances to employers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

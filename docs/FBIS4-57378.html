			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with National Renewal President Andres Allamand </F> by Aida Hanania in Santiago on 31 March; first two paragraphs  are author's introduction]    [Text] No doubt it was not a time for political analysis at  the big, rambling house of Antonio Varas when evening fell on 31  March. The Holy Week holidays had come early, even to the  headquarters of Renovacion Nacional [RN-National Renewal]. At  that time only one office was still lit up in the almost  deserted building. It was the office of Andres Allamand, the  leader of the party, who was receiving an unending series of  telephone calls regarding the verdict in the case of the people  who were beheaded. Obviously, the subject drew the intermittent  attention of the opposition leader, and this matter also must  have been mentioned in the discussions which Allamand had this  weekend with Roberto Ossandon, the secretary general of his  party. Ossandon promised to go with Allamand on his daily  morning run.    On the other hand, the differences with the UDI [Independent  Democratic Union] on opposition strategy toward the present  government do not seem to bother Allamand, who considers that  the democratic attitude displayed during the Aylwin  administration was positive and extremely important. Nor does  the president of the RN feel that his leadership has been  challenged. He analyzed the present and future of his party with  undisguised optimism, while displaying caution about  controversial subjects.    [Hanania] Are you uncomfortable about having been elected a  deputy in Las Condes with votes "borrowed" from Concertacion?    [Allamand] On the contrary. I feel that this increases my  responsibility as a member of Parliament, since I feel to some  extent under an obligation to respond to a broader electorate  than usual. I am aware that some of the people who voted for me  are identified with the opposition and some of them support the  government.    [Hanania] Nevertheless, do you accept that those votes saved  you from a defeat by Carlos Bombal, which, in the view of  leaders of your own party, would have been humiliating?    [Allamand] I think that when you go into an election, you  have to accept the results. And, whether you win or lose, it is  not humiliating in any case.    [Hanania] But the election in District 23 was not an  ordinary  one. It was no mystery to anyone that in your district the  future of two different leadership styles of the right was at  stake. One of them--your own--was more open. The other,  representing a harder line, was that of Carlos Bombal. In view  of the results, how do you interpret the present status of those  two leadership styles?    [Allamand] I think that both of them survived.    [Hanania] Does that mean that there are two leaders of the  right?    [Allamand] I would not put it in personal terms. I believe  that in the center-right there are positions which continue to  exist, side by side. They are similar but are not exactly  symmetrical--nor are they identical.    [Hanania] Does the fact that Bombal received more votes than  you did mean that he reduced your status as leader in the RN?    [Allamand] (Smiling). Not at all. Anyone who knows the  particularly difficult conditions under which I became a  candidate knows that when I obtained the results I did, this was  a great success. I am not unaware, nor do I ignore the fact that  in reality Carlos Bombal received a slightly larger number of  votes. However, the votes which we both obtained are equally  significant.    [Hanania] Then your leadership was not affected?    [Allamand] The subject of the leadership is a question for  the longer term. I do not think that it is determined by a given  election. It is no mystery to anyone that if there was an  electoral district in Chile in which the nomination of an RN  candidate was particularly complex, it was Las Condes. But I am  sure that it was a great campaign and that the result left all  of us fully satisfied. This matter of the kind of leadership  label you have does not particularly concern me. Why talk about  possible conflicts over the leadership which may arise? In  politics you have to work to promote the things you believe in.  For example, the latest Adimark Poll shows an extraordinarily  positive result for me, personally--by far the best which I have  had over the past few years.    [Hanania] But Roberto Mendez, the Adimark pollster, has  pointed out that the data in that study show a lack of  leadership in the opposition today.    [Allamand] I do not think that is true. Quite the contrary.  I  do not like to talk about myself, but that poll clearly showed  me as the strongest opposition leader, a long way ahead of the  others. Among the 15 leading political personalities there are  only two from the opposition. I am in eighth place on this list,  and Carlos Bombal is 15th. In any case I do not think that this  list is very important.    [Hanania] At the beginning of March 1994 you pointed out  that  the first task facing you was organizing your party. Do you  intend to run for a third term in office as president of the RN?    [Allamand] The party has left behind it a crisis situation  and a lack of internal harmony which has damaged our political  activity since 1992, with the fateful espionage episode. Now in  the RN we are moving with a new kind of cohesion and harmony and  with a desire to work together. I am very satisfied about the  path which the party has followed over the past few months.  However, I have not yet decided whether or not I will run for a  new term as president of the party. That is a matter on which  there is still time to make a decision.    [Hanania] According to what has happened in the past few  days, there are now several people who are considering replacing  you, including those who would continue with the same political  line, such as Deputy Teodoro Ribera, and representatives of the  more "Jarpista" group [conservative faction formerly led by  Jarpa], such as Senator Sergio Romero.    [Allamand] I think that there are various persons who might  take part in an eventual contest for the party leadership. Now  what I do not believe is that such markedly different views are  being expressed as are reflected in your question. My impression  is that the party now has great cohesion. Furthermore, I am not  sure whether those two people you mentioned would be satisfied  with being identified with one tendency or another.    [Hanania] In view of the position which such a well-known  follower of the conservative line as Deputy Alberto Cardemil has  been establishing within the RN, are you not concerned that this  conservative position could again become dominant in all its  glory and majesty, but now without Jarpa?    [Allamand] (Laughing). On the contrary. The task of the  president of the party is specifically to try to harmonize the  various views of the future.    [Hanania] Will that kind of harmony require the end of the  "Jarpista" [conservative] tendency?    [Allamand] Please, who is interested in that? You make me  laugh. It is simply absurd to talk about the end of the Jarpa  tendency, given the present, internal situation in the RN.  Nobody is now working within the party in a kind of competition  for certain positions, and, even less, to develop new factions  within the party. This is a party which is fed up with factions,  many of which arose more because of personal problems than  anything else. I visualize a situation from now on of much  greater cohesion and harmony. I think it is very good for a  large party like this one, which also had several candidates for  the Presidency of the Senate, to have a number of possible  candidates for the presidency of the party.  <H5>  Opposition Alliance </H5>   [Hanania] Although the RN and the UDI have agreed on the  objective of having the "Union por Chile" [Union for Chile]  presented as a valid alternative government for the 1999  elections, once again the two parties differ on the tactics to  be followed to reach that objective. While the RN continues to  hold to the idea of keeping in effect a democracy based on  agreements, the UDI is tending toward a democracy based on  alternatives.    [Allamand] This difference between the "democracy of the  agreements" and the "democracy of the alternatives" is much more  apparent than real, since, among other things, it must not be  forgotten that we developed both concepts during the previous  government. In a modern democracy positive differences, that is,  alternatives, must coexist. We must have enough intelligence to  generate points of convergence, that is, agreements.    [Hanania] Nevertheless, some of your associates consider  that  once the transition is over, the policy of agreements will no  longer be justified.    [Allamand] We must not return to confrontation in Chilean  politics simply because the transition to democracy has been  completed. I believe that there is an enormous amount of  political immaturity in those who allege that they wish to have  nothing more to do with one of the greatest "intangibles" which  the country has as a whole, that is, the climate of political  harmony and social peace.    [Hanania] Some UDI leaders consider that a policy of that  kind will delay the possibility for the opposition to become a  real, alternative government, because such a policy blurs the  differences.    [Allamand] I believe, quite to the contrary, that such a  policy would bring the differences out more clearly and  strengthen them because such a policy would show unmistakably to  the country that the opposition has ideas and the capacity  really to have an impact on national leadership and,  consequently, to be the government. In a democracy you govern  from the side of the government, but also from the opposition.  And if they ask me how you move more quickly by being an  alternative government, in my view it is not by waiting for six  years to propose a list of actions to be taken which you have  kept up your sleeve but rather through the consistent and  continuing action of providing solutions to national problems.    [Hanania] Do you think that the position of the UDI reflects  a certain meanness of spirit by concentrating on outlining the  right rather than emphasizing the interests of the country?    [Allamand] I would not put it in such harsh terms. That is a  kind of a caricature of the situation. All of a sudden the forms  seem to be harsher than the substance. The question now is  whether, during the Frei administration, the opposition should  lend its active cooperation to accomplishing major, national  tasks or, on the contrary, to stand by its own positions and  simply act as spectators. I believe that the proper way to  behave when you are in the opposition is by cooperating actively  in carrying out the national tasks which face governments. I  hope that, finally, the UDI will also work along the line that  you have to serve the permanent interests of the country,  whether in the government or in the opposition.    [Hanania] Nevertheless, many people, including some within  the government itself, think that the RN will wind up adopting  the views of the UDI, just as, for example, it wound up  accepting the incorporation of the UCC [Center-Center Union] in  the right-wing agreement.    [Allamand] In effect we accepted the incorporation of the  UCC  since, had we rejected it, it would have been impossible to  prepare a list of candidates for the Senate. In that event, this  list achieved great success. The basic discussion was always  about how the UCC was to be incorporated. It should not be  forgotten that the UCC began by asking for 15 districts in which  it would stand on its own. But at this point that sounds to me  like an argument from the past.    [Hanania] My question, Deputy Allamand, was whether you  rejected the possibility that the RN would also end up accepting  at this point the view of the UDI by hardening its position  against the government.    [Allamand] You are working on the basis of the view that the  UDI imposes its point of view, which, objectively speaking, is  not true. During the whole period of the previous administration  the RN was consistent and coherent in implementing a policy of  agreements from the first to the last day. And, simultaneously,  we set out conditions for entering into electoral alliances,  both in the election of 1992 as well as in the election of 1993.  I hope that in this new stage of greater harmony we may act  jointly. We have a certain policy. Of course, we are interested  in having a united, opposition policy.    [Hanania] If you find that the results of the policy of  agreements followed during the Aylwin administration was so  satisfactory, why do you think that the UDI would wish to change  it?    [Allamand] Those who think that the opposition behaved badly  during the Aylwin government are blind. We increased our  parliamentary representation both in the Senate as well as in  the Chamber of Deputies. We consolidated our electoral support  and increased our vote.    [Hanania] Do the differences which appear today between the  RN and the UDI relate to the way the right might handle the  power which it obtained in the Senate?    [Allamand] At a time when the center-right has experienced  its greatest cohesion and unity over the past five years, it is  almost absurd to be concerned about such differences as exist.  There are many more points of agreement than in previous  periods. Now, each party has its own identity. The UCC has its  identity, the UDI has its own, and we have our own.    [Hanania] And is the UCC playing the role of moderator?    [Allamand] Within the coalition no one is playing the role  of  umpire or moderator. Each party presents its points of view,  things are discussed, and so far there has been enough agreement  to act together.    [Hanania] Do you believe that the unity which the right has  achieved will be really stable?    [Allamand] I think that the worst part of this difficult  process is behind us and that today we have a positive stage in  front of us. During the previous administration the differences  between the RN and the UDI were understandable, to a certain  extent, because the agreement which we had regarding what we had  to do as an opposition was different. We contributed to reforms  which I consider key factors in the present, forward looking  situation in which Chile finds itself. These included tax and  labor reforms, without which I am sure that the previous  government would not have had the prevailing social peace  between labor and management. The UDI had a different view.  However, today we have a significant, united position.    [Hanania] Speaking of reforms, what progress has been made  in  the conversations which you have been having with the new  government in dealing with pending constitutional reforms?    [Allamand] In terms of constitutional reforms, there is a  "critical mass" in support of moving forward quickly to increase  the investigatory powers of Congress and to strengthen municipal  governments, including the direct election of mayors. There are  other matters on which spontaneous agreement has also emerged,  such as, for example, the need to deal with the possibility of a  vacancy in the office of president. I have proposed that perhaps  this is a good time to see if we can reach an agreement which  would make it possible to return to synchronizing elections.  Today there is major confusion, and we have an intermittent  sequence of elections. There are other subjects, such as that of  the appointed senators, the impossibility of removing the  commanders in chief of the armed forces from office, the matter  of the National Security Council, the composition of the  Constitutional Tribunal, and the electoral system itself, on  which, as of this point, agreements are not in sight.    [Hanania] Do the constitutional reforms also involve the  conversations going on with the PS [Socialist Party]?    [Allamand] I have the greatest respect and political regard  for Camilo Escalona, and that helps us to carry on a continuing  conversation between socialists and members of the RN in  analyzing different political, economic, social, and  constitutional subjects. It is a positive sign for us to have  direct conversations which, furthermore, are appropriate for any  mature and healthy democracy. To some extent we have disposed of  the idea that the democratic center-right and the democratic  left have to go through a kind of customs examination presided  over by the DC [Christian Democracy party]. That relates to a  past phase of Chilean democracy.</p>

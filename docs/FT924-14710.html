			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Qantas advances 209% on eve of privatisation QANTAS, the government-owned Australian airline, yesterday reported a 209 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 137m (Dollars 98.7m) for the year to the end of June, marking a solid recovery from its earlier financial problems. Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, said the result understated the underlying financial strength of Qantas, which the government wants to privatise early next year. The recovery in the airline's position was underlined by an improvement in pre-tax operating profit from ADollars 68.9m to ADollars 322m. Revenue increased from ADollars 3.8bn to ADollars 4bn. Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, said the 'very encouraging' result was achieved 'in a highly competitive environment significantly affected by depressed economic conditions and heavy price discounting in major markets.' Mr Dix said the result should be seen against a background of world aviation losses of ADollars 5.5bn in 1991, when several airlines had gone out of business and only a handful had made a profit. The improvement was largely due to improved productivity following restructuring, and a ADollars 130m reduction in fuel costs following the end of the Gulf war. However, Mr Dix said the immediate outlook for the industry was uncertain because of 'destructive competition' coupled with continuing world recession, which would limit airline growth. He said there was nothing to suggest that the industry outlook for the current year was any better than in 1991-92, especially since many large airlines had already reported reduced interim profits. In parliament, Mr Willis said preparations for the sale of 49 per cent of the airline to international carriers were proceeding. The government hopes to receive binding offers from British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand by the end of next month. However, Mr Willis confirmed earlier indications that the flotation of the remaining 51 per cent of the airline might not take place in March, as planned, because of weakness in the Australian share market. Qantas last month completed a ADollars 400m takeover of Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic airline, in the first phase of the government's airline privatisation programme.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Racecourse stakes comes under orders The race to find a new owner for Epsom racecourse, home of the Derby, began in earnest yesterday as Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank, made available an information memorandum for potential bidders. Known to be in the running are Racecourse Holdings Trust, a subsidiary of the Jockey Club, and the Racehorse Owners Association. Epsom is being sold along, with Kempton Park and Sandown Park, by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, the statutory body that acquired the courses more than 20 years ago in order to preserve them from possible property developers. The courses comprise almost 1,000 acres within the M25. Estimates of their value range between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m. Mr Rodney Brack, chief executive of the Levy Board, said that 20 potential buyers had been listed so far, with a small proportion from overseas. The Levy Board will retain the freehold of the courses, and provide the purchaser with long leases subject to covenants guaranteeing the future of racing. 'If a purchaser fails to honour the covenants, the Levy Board will be in a position to take action,' said Mr Brack. United Racecourses, the Levy Board subsidiary that runs the three courses, last year had turnover of Pounds 9.9m, of which Pounds 2.8m came from non-racing activities. Racecourse Holdings Trust already owns nine courses, including Cheltenham and Newmarket, and ploughs all its profits back into racing. The Racehorse Owners Association, which has 4,500 members, in October set up a committee to investigate the possibility of buying the courses. The committee includes Mr David Sieff of Marks and Spencer and Sir Eric Parker, former chief executive of Trafalgar House.</p>

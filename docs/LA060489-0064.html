			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: BEST TO STICK WITH WATERPROOF GLUE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I glued together some furniture several months ago and it was fine,  but recently some water got into the extra room in our house and some of the  joints got loose. I had bought the glue under the impression that it was  waterproof. Are they permitted to sell an adhesive as waterproof when it really  isn't?  </P> <P> ANSWER: No, but the chances are that the glue was called water-resistant and  not waterproof. There is a difference. An adhesive that is water-resistant is  just that. It will resist high humidity and a limited amount of water, but  waterproof material will stay glued when attacked by water. When you purchase  glue that must be waterproof to meet your needs, make sure it says waterproof  on the label of the container. Manufacturers are careful not to call a product  waterproof when it isn't.  </P> <P> How to Straighten a Warped Wood Panel  </P> <P> Q: I have a large panel of wood that was not used for a long time and became  warped. What causes this, and how can it be corrected?  </P> <P> A: The usual cause, although by no means the only one, is when moisture on one  side of the wood is greater than on the other. What you should do is find out  which side is dry. Apply some moisture to that side. Place the wood on wet  grass or damp towels so that it will be in the hot sun most of the day.  </P> <P> The cupped side of the wood should be face down. Put some weights on the top of  the wood -- perhaps a few books, but not too many or the weight will be too  heavy. Examine the piece of wood at least once a day and remove it when the  wood appears to be straight.  </P> <P> Insulation Blankets Fine for Heating Ducts  </P> <P> Q: I would like to insulate the heating ducts in our basement. They are used  only for heating, not for air conditioning. Can I use the regular type of  insulation, that is, the blankets? The ducts are the round type.  </P> <P> A: Yes, the blankets are fine for heating ducts. Tell your dealer what they are  being used for, and he will give you the kind that has no vapor barrier. Vapor  barriers are not required when the blankets are used for this purpose. Also,  tell the dealer you have round ducts, since many are shaped like a rectangle.  The insulation will come with complete instructions for their use.  </P> <P> Do-It-Yourselfer Can Hang Dropped Ceiling  </P> <P> Q: Will a suspended ceiling cover the irregularities in the ceiling of the room  where it will be installed? I have put up ceiling tiles in the past but have  never tackled a suspended ceiling. Can it be handled by a do-it-yourselfer or  must one be a professional?  </P> <P> A: If you installed ceiling tiles, you should have no trouble with a suspended  ceiling. It generally is considered easier. Just take your time and  double-check everything before you go on to the next step.  </P> <P> All aspects of painting a house are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Paint  Your House Inside and Out," which can be obtained by sending $1 and a long,  stamped, self-addressed envelope to Know-How, P.O.

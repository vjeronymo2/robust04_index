			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / As They Say in Europe: Grand contradiction hits 50 This weekend marks the fiftieth anniversary of Le Monde. At least the paper first appeared on the December 18, 1944, even though it was dated the 19th, a practice which continues to this day. It is hard on those who want to know last night's football results, but Le Monde wishes to discourage that kind of reader anyway. It began life - on the presses of a daily which had been soiled by collaboration - almost simultaneously with another, tattier, Paris daily, France-Soir. But whereas France-Soir celebrated its 50th birthday last week with a commemorative edition, Le Monde had to mark its anniversary rather more grandly. Three months ago there was an article called 'Heritage', making its readers aware that a seminal event was to occur before the next solstice: there was to be a 'colloquium' under the auspices of Unesco. It made the Anglo-Saxon heart sink. So, on December 6, the Unesco colloquium took place. It was subtitled 'Reinventing the press'. The invitations were inscribed with a remark taken from Balzac: 'If the press did not exist it would not be necessary to invent it.' Up until the moment I read that, I had had a moderately high regard for Honore de B, but as a coiner of witty phrases he plainly ranks little higher than the 17th-century aphorist, the duc de La Rochefoucauld, and somewhere below the noted English idiot, Bertie Wooster. The press exists because people exist. Newspapers appeared as soon as the technical means were available. Almost everybody has produced newspapers: the Nazis had the Volkischer Beobachter, the communists, Pravda. In London there is The Sun and there is the Financial Times. There is Ouest France from West France, the Manchester Union-Leader from New Hampshire, and the Barnes and Mortlake Herald from Barnes and Mortlake. Some exist to spread lies and hatred, some to appeal to a narrow range of narrow minds, some to tell of new parking regulations on Church Road and some to tell their readers what they need to know. Fortunately, few of the contributions to the colloquium took much notice of Balzac. Instead the reader learnt of the duties of the press - 'to try to operate the difficult synthesis between justice and liberty', or its aims - to make more money, or to give primacy to information over rumour. This provides a perfect reflection of Le Monde. It is a paper of enormous pretensions that does a very good job by keeping its readers informed on diverse topics. It genuflects before every modish fashion while providing a critical eye on what is going on. It maintains the appearance of heterodoxy while not really opposing the state. Sometimes the contradiction, as during the evenements of 1968, for example, becomes too much. But Le Monde would never question the main policy foundations of the French state - quitting Nato, the reliance on nuclear weapons and nuclear power, or the hijacking of trade policy by peasants. More than a quarter of a century ago, I went to a seminar on Africa in London where the main speaker was a Le Monde correspondent who lectured the participants on the politics of the francophone states. It was an undiluted apology for French policy in the region. When asked why we were being fed this line, the man from Le Monde said, 'Of course, I would not talk like this at a Gaullist meeting in Paris.' The paper annoys its English-speaking readers by mixing news and comment in a manner that makes the Daily Mail seem objective, and yet it is able to provide breathtaking insights. I recall many years ago, following a three-part series on North Korea, of all places, with an enthusiasm normally reserved for the denouement of a soap opera. Le Monde is a co-operative of a kind. It harbours many different talents - those who think themselves the descendants of Montesquieu, those who think they are international lawyers and some brilliant journalists. There is even the occasional genius, like the former rugby correspondent, Jean Lacouture, and the cartoonist, Plantu. Today, it is not what it was in the 1960s. Then, no youthful intellectual, from Quebec to Kinshasa, could be seen without the obligatory copy of Le Monde. It is not the institution it once was, but it is a better paper. And next month it is to have a new format - does that mean photographs? But over the 50th anniversary hangs the shadow of the losses to which, at times, Le Monde seems doomed. The press will not disappear, but individual newspapers can and do. Le Monde is one that would have to be reinvented. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

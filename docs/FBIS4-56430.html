			<p>BFN     [Text] Three political parties in Port-au-Prince  recommended a vote on the Amnesty Law in order to release the  country's crisis. They are the Union of Democratic Patriots, led  by Rockfeller Guerre; Alliance for the Liberation and Progress  of Haiti, led by Reynold Georges; and the Liaison of Democratic  Forces, led by Daniel Narcisse. These parties demand the  resignations of Army Commander in Chief Raoul Cedras, General  Philippe Biamby, and Colonel Michel Francois to avoid a  catastrophe to the country through reinforced sanctions.</p>

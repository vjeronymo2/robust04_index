			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING WITH STYLE;  </P> <P> ELEGANT EXOTIC EXPERIMENTS PROVOCATIVE PAIRINGS;  </P> <P> BLENDING THEIR ETHNIC ORIGINS AND FOOD PASSIONS, FOUR CHEFS CREATE VERSIONS OF  THE ALL-AMERICAN SOUP AND SANDWICH THAT ARE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH FOR A DINNER  PARTY  </P> <P> At one time, "soup and sandwich" meant tomato in a bowl and American cheese  between slices of white bread. But that was before Southern California's  current corps of chefs entered the scene. Blending their ethnic origins and  passions with the all-American soup and sandwich, they came up with  cross-pollinated hybrids sophisticated enough for even an elegant dinner party.  But that's only one reason to prepare them. Another is just as telling: They  taste sensational.  </P> <P> Felix Salcedo of Sonora Cafe created a soup-and-sandwich menu that is  distinctly southwestern. Or is it? The traditional flour-tortilla quesadilla is  filled with American, Italian and French cheeses, spiked with sauteed Maui  onions from Hawaii and sprinkled with fresh herbs that, presumably, are  Californian. Serve it with two salsas, one of red chiles and one of cactus  leaves. To go along, Tomato Sirloin Soup with Blue Corn Tortilla Chips combines  traditional southwestern soup ingredients with slices of sirloin, stir-fried  the Asian way.  </P> <P> Michael Kang of Five Feet presents a dinner with a decidedly Asian influence  but one with European inspiration. A julienne of colorful vegetables brings  beauty to a light chicken stock. Ravioli-like dumplings made of won tons filled  with goat cheese are creamy and sour-sweet. Kang suggests serving it with  commercially made Chinese scallion cakes, split and filled with Chinese roast  duck, shiitake mushrooms, pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes and Parmesan cheese.  The result is wonderful.  </P> <P> The imaginative mind of Joachim Splichal of Patina came up with a very American  corn chowder served with tiny corn fritters. As an accompaniment, he recommends  a skewered sandwich of bacon, shrimp and lettuce that is deep fried until  crunchy and served with fresh basil mayonnaise.  </P> <P> From Hans Rockenwagner, owner-chef of FAMA and Rockenwagner, comes an elegant  mixed-metaphor meal. The sandwich, which begins with Italian-inspired grilled  polenta, is topped with lightly cooked, sushi-quality tuna, a Japanese  inspiration. From India, a mango salsa, but one made with balsamic vinegar, is  the perfect accompaniment. Serve it with Rockenwagner's delicious cold cucumber  soup, topped with a scoop of sorbet-like frozen cucumber ice, liberally  seasoned with sesame seeds, a common Asian ingredient.  </P> <P> SONORA CAFE QUESADILLA  </P> <P> MAKES 4 TO 6 SERVINGS  </P> <P> 1 medium Maui onion, sliced into rings  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons minced garlic  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon fresh oregano  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh basil  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon fresh marjoram  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon sweet dry Marsala  </P> <P> 4 ounces grated mozzarella cheese  </P> <P> 4 ounces grated Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 6 (5-inch) flour tortillas, or larger if desired  </P> <P> 4 ounces Brie, sliced 1/4-inch thick, 3 inches long  </P> <P> Red Chile Salsa  </P> <P> Fresh Chile and Nopales Salsa  </P> <P> In medium skillet, saute onion in 4 tablespoons butter over low heat, stirring  often. When onion is translucent, add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add fresh  herbs and Marsala and cook for 2 minutes more, or until mixture is dry. Remove  to large mixing bowl. Cover loosely and refrigerate until cooled.  </P> <P> Combine mozzarella and Cheddar with cooled onion mixture. Sprinkle 1/4 cheese  mixture over each tortilla. Top with Brie slices. Fold tortilla in half,  pressing gently. (Can be made up to 2 hours in advance.)  </P> <P> Brush cast-iron skillet with remaining butter. Cook quesadilla over low heat on  both sides, turning carefully, until lightly browned. (Be careful that butter  does not burn.)

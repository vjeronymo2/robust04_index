Talking About Derailed Talks Is Premature"]    [Text] On Thursday evening REUTER reported a Japanese  Foreign Ministry statement on indefinitely suspending  Russian-Japanese talks on territorial demarcation. It is  noteworthy that this report coincided with the first address by  Vladimir Shumeyko as Federal Assembly speaker [as published;  Shumeyko is Federation Council speaker], in which he made it  clear that there is no territorial problem and that the islands  belong to Russia. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr  Panov comments on the situation at KOMMERSANT-DAILY's request.    By the time of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo in October,  when it was decided to hold a regular meeting of a working group  on the peace treaty (it discussed the territorial question among  other things), experts had not been in session for more than a  year. At the time the meeting was tentatively scheduled for  December. Now, however, according to REUTER, Moscow decided to  postpone the talks "indefinitely," citing the fact that many  Russian politicians were involved in the election campaign.    According to Mr. Panov, this report, which was published a  few days ago in a Japanese newspaper, was news to him.  Incidentally, the diplomat noted, a number of Japanese mass  media have already refuted this information. The meeting,  indeed, is unlikely to be held in January, because the sides  have yet to resolve a number of technical matters related to its  organization. The Russian Foreign Ministry, however, has not  sent proposals to Tokyo for an "indefinite" postponement, Mr.  Panov said. Moreover, talking about postponement is simply  irrelevant because no specific decisions on possible dates of  the peace treaty group's meetings had been made earlier. Mr.  Panov pointed out that to all appearances a Japanese delegation  would arrive in Moscow in February. The meeting's precise date  will be announced "in the near future."  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   When a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that  talks on the territorial problem were allegedly postponed at  Moscow's request, he cited his counterparts from the Russian  Foreign Ministry. They allegedly attributed the delay to the  fact that their representatives, many of whom were involved in  the election campaign, were not ready for the talks. We may add  that the supervisor of the Japanese sector at the Russian  Foreign Ministry has also changed in the wake of the elections:  Georgiy Kunadze left for Seoul as Russian ambassador, and  Aleksandr Panov has yet to get into the swing of things. After  all, it is not so important whether the talks will take place in  January or February. Rumors about the postponement are only a  sign of Tokyo's concern about the results of such talks. The  key word here -- "election campaign" -- brings to mind the fact  that Russia's foreign policy has been more and more affected by  the "Zhirinovskiy factor;" he, having succeeded in his  nationalist rhetoric in general, has repeatedly said that the  Kremlin is allegedly ready just about to "give up the islands to  Japan."    At a time when economic populism literally costs a lot and  is  constrained by the realities of the Russian budget deficit and  ever- lasting inflation, political, or rather foreign policy,  populism may just as well be chosen as a weapon in the struggle.  All the more so because not only has it brought Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia leaders great dividends, it has also  enabled them to leave the voters in the dark as to the party's  economic program.    As a matter of fact, addressing the Federal Assembly, its  new  chief, Vladimir Shumeyko [as published], having successfully  evaded all acute angles regarding economic policy, made a point  of voicing his support for Viktor Chernomyrdin on the South  Kuril islands problem: Kunashir, Iturup, Shikotan and the  Habomai islands "belong to Russia, and there is no question of  their transfer." While he acknowledged that his view diverged  from Moscow's official point of view (which boils down to  admitting that "the problem exists"), it is clear that any talks  about the islands are doomed to a stalemate. Nikita Khrushchev,  who officially promised two of the islands to the Japanese, has  probably been the only politician who could act without paying  heed to the voters. It is also evident that a period started by  Mikhail Gorbachev, when the fact of recognizing the existence of  a territorial problem (without visible breakthroughs in its  settlement) was modus operandi in relations with Japan, is  drawing to a close. No arguments about "fostering cooperation  on the basis of compromise in the settlement of territorial  disputes" will work any longer given a formidable nationalist  opposition.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: British Coal The acknowledgment by British Coal's chairman, Mr Neil Clarke, that the pits 'reprieved' in March face closure comes as little surprise. While the intention was for further coal contracts to be negotiated, the deafening silence from the electricity generators has told its own tale. Gas-fired plant is coming on stream quickly and the better performance of nuclear power has left no need for further coal. A few of these pits may be leased by entrepreneurs like Mr Malcolm Edwards who think they can carve out a niche in the industrial and domestic market. But attention is on the 'core' pits which will be put on the block next year. There are plenty of practical problems to overcome - notably allocating environmental liabilities and dividing up the remaining three years of the coal contract among the pits. Yet the basic shape is becoming clear. A large chunk of liabilities will have to be left with a residuary body, and the final deals on the surviving pits may well be a hybrid of outright sale and operating lease. If the pits do not go to mining giants, the capital structure of the bidding companies will need examination. Reliable cash flow in the first three years means that any buy-out could afford to assume some debt. That, however, would need to be paid down by 1998 when risks increase and contracts with the generators will be smaller and harder to secure.</p>

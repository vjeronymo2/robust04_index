			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Heseltine tells Commons his plan offers coal's 'best hope' MR MICHAEL HESELTINE last night used the promise of 'hundreds of millions of pounds' in subsidies to the coal industry in a bid to snuff out a possible Conservative backbench revolt over last week's government white paper. There was 'a significant new market to go for', the trade and industry secretary said, as he defended his white paper in front of a sceptical Commons. 'We have made it clear that the best hope for British Coal is to take advantage of the opportunity we have provided.' But a series of interventions by possible Tory rebels indicated that Mr Heseltine had not completely calmed fears that the 12 reprieved pits might not survive for more than a year. These were played on by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, in a spirited plea to Tory MPs to join Labour in voting down the white paper. Today was the day for Tories who had voiced displeasure at the original pit closure announcement last October to make good the promises they had made five months ago to Britain's mining communities, Mr Cook argued. The exchanges came as the coal and electricity industries completed the signing of contracts for the sale of 160m tonnes of coal over five years, leaving the way clear for talks to begin on extra sales aimed at saving the 12 reprieved pits. Among Tory backbenchers who intervened in Mr Heseltine's speech, Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, asked why he was not acting to engineer a level playing field for coal in competition with other fuels. Mr Winston Churchill, leader of the Tory backbench coal group, charged British Coal with 'directly sabotaging' Mr Heseltine's statement to MPs last week. British Coal yesterday joined Mr Heseltine in admitting it could not forecast how big the extra market above the core contract would be. 'The generators and rest of electricity industry will effectively decide the future for our pits,' the company said. Prospects would also depend on the terms of a subsidy to help marginal pits compete. Mr Heseltine riled opposition MPs by dwelling at length on Labour policy on coal in the 1970s. This prompted the retort from Mr Cook that the trade and industry secretary should have spared MPs his 'rendition of a pantomime villain'. Politics and Parliament, Page 15</p>

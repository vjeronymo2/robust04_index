			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier  Zeljko Simic said on Friday that the international community had  set a dangerous precedent by raiding Bosnian Serb positions at  the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde, which might have  incalculable consequences for the future of international  relations and the shape of the new world order.    Simic, who chairs the committee for monitoring the  International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, was speaking at a  meeting with a delegation of the Russian State Duma (lower house  of the Russian parliament), headed by Nikolay Bezbyrodov, deputy  chairman of the parliamentary defence commitee, said a statement  released by the Yugoslav Information Ministry.    Simic briefed the Russian delegation about the Yugoslav  Government's positions in the light of the latest developments  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and said that Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) had been cooperative and flexible from the  very outbreak of the crisis in the region, which means that  accusations against its foreign policy orientation are  groundless, and most often malicious.    The Yugoslav Government has always aspired to an unbiased  and  objective view of all aspects of the crisis in former  Yugoslavia, as the only way for reaching a just and lasting  settlement of the two-year-old crisis, simic said and added that  the government would never abandon the democratic principles of  safeguarding the sovereignty of the country and the freedom of  its people.    Simic placed special stress on the unsuitability of  sanctions  and the need for banishing them permanently from international  relations.    The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia in  May 1992 for the country's alleged military involvement in civil  war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has tightened them  twice since.    Simic stressed that Russia's role had been and continued to  be of great importance to Yugoslavia and the future of the world.    Without the active, peace-making role of Russia, which  justly  insists on talks as the only mode of international communication  likely to produce lasting peace and stable relations in the  region, it is impossible to imagine a satisfactory outcome of  the civil war and relaxation of tensions in the region. This is  why all international factors must embrace the Russian approach,  which is unbiased, heeds the political reality and strives for a  comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the territory of  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, simic said.    He added that lasting and immediate peace was a necessary  precondition for all talks and political consultations, whose  outcome must not be prejudged.    The Russian parliamentary delegation agreed with the  positions expressed by the Yugoslav deputy prime minister and  said that their visit was primarily aimed at learning at first  hand the true state of affairs in the former Yugoslav republics.  They explained they intended to suggest to the State Duma later  in April some concrete measures which should help solve the  crisis in former Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Information Ministry  said in its statement.</p>

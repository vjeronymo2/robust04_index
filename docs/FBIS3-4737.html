They are grossly misrepresenting the situation of our  developing socialist economy by abusing the communique of the  21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Central Committee of the  Workers' Party of Korea on the fulfilment of the Third  Seven-year Plan (1987-1993). They allege that "North Korea is in  a serious condition, undergoing enormous trials for its failure  to attain the targets of industrial production" and "its  self-sufficiency in food has come a cropper from a long ago."    This is an intolerable distortion of the invincible might of  the socialist economy of the DPRK, which is vigorously advancing  along the road of independence and self-reliance, unaffected by  whatever fluctuation of the international situation and of our  reality in which all the people of the country fully enjoy an  abundant material and cultural life. It is also a despicable  political propaganda offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    As was reported by the afore-said communique, we made a new  great progress in all sectors of the socialist economic  construction during the Third Seven-year Plan in spite of the  collapse of socialism in the former Soviet Union and other  European countries, the disappearance of the world socialist  market and a chain of other international events and changes in  the complicated external environments.    In this period, the industrial output jumped 1.5 times and  its average annual growth rate reached 5.6 percent in our  country.    The power, coal and non-ferrous metal ore output increased  respectively 1.3, 1.4 and 1.6 times, with the result that the  nation's material and fuel bases have been expanded and  strengthened.    The steel output increased 1.3 times and all the sectors of  the machine-building industry rapidly developed to achieve a  great progress in the mechanization, automation, robotization  and computerization of the production processes.    The output of chemical fertilizers went up 1.5 times, their  qualitative composition was further improved and solid  foundations for the completion of the chemicalization of  agriculture have been laid.    A great progress was also made in light industry to bring  about a new turn in the production of consumer goods.    Garment, food and daily necessities industries rapidly  developed, locally-controlled industrial factories were updated  and dependable local raw material bases built, with the result  that the local industrial output jumped 1.7 times.    In agricultural domain, 10,400 kilometres long waterways  were  excavated and more than 12,400 pumping stations and 192  reservoirs were built.    The amount of chemical fertilizers applied to agriculture  was  raised 1.4 times and their qualitative composition improved.    In our country where the objective of ten million tons of  grain was attained already in the '80s, irrigation,  electrification, mechanization and extensive use of chemicals  have been realised and farming has been placed on a scientific  and technical basis as required by the chuche method of farming  to reap a rich harvest every year.    In fisheries, more than 1,100 fishing boats including stern  trawlers of 3,750 tons and above were built and fishing boats  and fish processing facilities briskly modernized to further  consolidate the material and technical foundations of fisheries.    In the period, Kwangbok and Thongil Streets took shape and  more than 100,000 modern flats were built in Pyongyang, which  means that residential houses for more than one million families  were built in towns and rural communities of the country.    Our people are leading a happy material and cultural life,  enjoying free medical care, free education and other socialist  benefits, without worries about food, clothing and housing.    The consolidation of our socialist economic and material  foundations and the considerable improvement of the people's  living clearly prove the invincible vitality of our independent  national economy, which is developing on the basis of the chuche  idea, unaffected by the imperialists' economic blockade and the  worldwide fluctuation.    Nevertheless, the media serving the imperialists are  zealously spreading rumors about our "economic crisis,"  motivated by a foolish attempt to undermine the external  authority and prestige of our Republic, tar the image of  Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses and crush  the hope and confidence of the world progressive people in  socialism.    They must look squarely at the unshakable will and faith of  our people, give up the foolish dream of stifling our Republic  and promptly stop the anti-DPRK false political propaganda.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (2): The long wait for heaven's mandate - A transitional stage in politics as rival groups vie to succeed Deng It was hardly a ringing declaration of self-confidence in the future, and for that reason it was revealing of the political uncertainties that prevail in China as the nation waits for its paramount ruler to die and worries about the transition from one generation of leaders to the next. The resolution of the fourth plenary session of the 14th Central Committee of September 28 laid heavy emphasis on strengthening Communist Party institutions and rooting out corruption. Its message was one of consolidation, in marked contrast to the decisions of the third plenum, twelve months earlier, which had resolved to embark on an ambitious programme of economic reform. 'The Party must be capable of recognising, enhancing and upgrading itself under the new situation of reform and of opening-up, and must conscientiously study and solve the new contradictions and new problems that crop up in the course of its self-building,' said the resolution. China's 'third generation' of leaders, as they are known in official parlance, find themselves in the uncomfortable situation of being expected to get on with asserting leadership, while at the same time remaining mindful of the fact that an old man of failing health is still the arbiter when it comes to important decisions - although it is not clear whether it is Mr Deng himself or those who are purporting to speak for him who are actually wielding authority. Mr Deng's health may have deteriorated to the point where his ability to monitor developments is very limited, but until he dies the 'mandate of heaven' cannot pass to his chosen successors. This is in spite of the fact that much has been made recently of the old man's confidence in the new generation with President Jiang Zemin at its 'core.' China, as it awaits Mr Deng's demise, is embroiled in a process of 'transitional politics' with various factions manoeuvring for power and influence in preparation for the post-Deng era. Thus, personnel changes at the top increasingly are seen through a prism of what they mean for the power balance after Deng. President Jiang Zemin, who also holds concurrently the positions of general secretary of the Communist Party and chairman of the Military Commission, appears to have been bolstering his position over the past year or so with key appointments to the party and military, and to the security apparatus. A thread running through these appointments is that the officials brought to Beijing were associated with Mr Jiang in his days in the 1980s in Shanghai when he served as mayor and then party secretary. This has given rise to talk of a 'Shanghai faction' in the leadership, but such an assessment may prove to be simplistic since many leading figures with a Shanghai connection, including Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier in charge of the economy (Mr Zhu was, like Mr Jiang, mayor and party boss of Shanghai) are not so easily pigeon-holed. With Mr Deng's demise drawing nearer and with the leadership in something of a state of flux it will almost certainly take time after his departure from the scene for a clearer picture to emerge of the strength of the various key participants and, more importantly perhaps, of the trends which they represent. The principal actors at this stage include Mr Jiang himself, Premier Li Peng, Mr Zhu and Mr Qiao Shi, the enigmatic chairman of the standing committee of the National People's Congress and third ranking figure on the seven-member standing committee of the ruling Politburo. But waiting in the wings are others who can be expected to make their bids for a share of power in the post-Deng phase. Mindful of the fact that Mr Deng's reformist legacy will almost certainly come in for a buffeting once he goes, the authorities have, for much of this year, been seeking to reinforce the message that there can be no turning back, but at the same time they have mounted a campaign aimed at reminding people that economic reform does not equate with political liberalisation. People's Daily, in a commentary echoing the theme of September's central committee meeting, stressed adherence to democratic centralism, a code-phrase for continued rigid party control, and rejected what it described as the doctrine of extreme democracy - the phrase employed by Chinese propaganda to impugn Western-style democracy. 'We must perfect democratic centralism and associated policies, so that there is no change because of a change in leadership, and no change because of a change in the leaders' views or focuses of attention,' People's Daily said pointedly. Indications that Mr Deng's legacy, which is meant to serve China for the next 100 years, will be far from immune from attack came with publication earlier this year of a controversial book whose author has thus far not been identified publicly. The book, Looking at China Through a Third Eye expresses the heretical notion that Mr Deng's policies of explosive economic growth have led China into a trap in which socialist values were crumbling, and the ability of the authorities to exert control over a restless and disaffected peasantry was weakening. Publication of such criticism, especially in the present climate of unadorned official praise for Mr Deng, was surprising, but it does indicate a certain level of opposition. Party conservatives unhappy with the excesses of the economic transformation, and ideologues who fear a withering of socialism - with or without Chinese characteristics - can be expected to be more outspoken in the post-Deng period. Criticism from party dissidents, who have been biding their time until Deng passes from the scene, may well provide an early test of the resolve of the leadership group. China's post-Deng collective, deprived of the ability to speak on behalf of a higher authority, will have to find new ways of dealing efficiently with internal dissent. Apart from Mr Deng's anointed successor, it will be the veteran officers of the People's Liberation Army who will play a crucial role in the next phase. Although the army has undergone a fairly rapid professionalisation, and thus the introduction of younger officers to its senior ranks since the late 1970s, old-guard commanders still hold sway. President Jiang Zemin's chairmanship of the Central Military Commission (the most powerful body in China aside from the Politburo standing committee) is under-pinned by the presence as vice-chairman on the commission of two Red Army stalwarts and Long March veterans - General Liu Huaqing, 78, and General Zhang Zhen, 80. Their role, and that of other revolutionary commanders, will be critical in resolving factional struggles post-Deng. In preparation for the transition and to assure continuity the word has been put out that Generals Liu and Zhang will continue in their posts for the time being. The army and security apparatus has been standing by for months to crack-down on any sign of trouble after Mr Deng goes. Security will certainly be at the top of the list of concerns in the immediate post-Deng era. Indeed, General Zhang is reported to have stressed at a recent meeting of the Central Military Commission the need for absolute loyalty of the army to the party in the next phase. His address also laid heavy emphasis on the need to maintain stability in the army itself and in the nation at this time. These will remain standard themes in these skittish times.</p>

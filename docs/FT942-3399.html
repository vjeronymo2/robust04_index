			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / CBI chief applauds Labour's altered stance The Labour party had 'changed in important ways', Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Mr Davies said in a speech to business leaders in London: 'It would be churlish not to recognise that the Labour party has changed in important ways and is offering a set of policies which, at the very least, deserve our attention. We shall give it.' The party still had a number of policies with which the CBI disagreed, such as its commitments to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and a statutory minimum wage. But, in one of the strongest indications yet of the rapprochement between Labour and industry, Mr Davies said: 'It seems very likely that we shall be facing a Labour leadership without any baggage from previous episodes in power, and with a set of economic policies rather different from those which held sway in the people's party for most of the 1980s.' His comments came as Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner for the Labour leadership, underlined once again his commitment to turn Labour into the party of 'law and order'. Mr Blair said in a lecture to the Police Foundation at London's Guildhall that his party's strategy to combat crime would be based on restoring the sense of responsibility and respect, among young people in particular. In government Labour would seek to provide the opportunity for individual self-advancement but with that chance would come the 'duties of citizenship'. Mr Blair's speech was applauded by an audience which included many of the country's top police officers. Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex, said: 'Mr Blair is clearly a politician who listens to what the police are saying.' Chief Superintendent David Golding, national president of the Police Superintendents Association of England and Wales, said Mr Blair was in touch with widespread dissatisfaction within the police force with the way the government pushed through legislation without adequate consultation. The first union to nominate a candidate in the Labour leadership contest has backed Mr Tony Blair for leader with Mr John Prescott as his deputy, David Goodhart writes. The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, which has about 50,000 members, may not set a trend among union leaders, many of whom remain suspicious of Mr Blair. However, some Blair supporters in the unions have not ruled out a nomination from one of the large unions, possibly even the GMB general union, which is holding its conference in Blackpool this week, is expected to decide tomorrow whether to make a recommendation.

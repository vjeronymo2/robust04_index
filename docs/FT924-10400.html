			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Eating Out: Count on Snow this winter SEBASTIAN SNOW left school at 16 with five O levels and the encouragement from his careers master that he might make a good estate agent. Melissa, his wife of 18 months, abandoned a Politics, Philosophy and Economics course after two years and then swapped a city secretarial job to work behind the bar at Chelsea Arts Club. They eventually met working at 190 Queensgate, a fashionable London restaurant and, in December last year, opened their own place. In spite of recession, it became profitable in its sixth month and turnover will exceed Pounds 600,000 by the end of its first year. Their business plan, which was rejected by five different banks, projected a breakeven figure of 60 covers a day - today they serve more than 100. Life is not all rosy. The hours are long and hard and Sebastian described married life as 'a business partnership but we live together.' Melissa wakes Sebastian at 7.15am so that he can get to the kitchen and he welcomes Melissa back at 1 or 2 in the morning after she has checked the till and locked up. Sensibly, in terms of fashion, health, cost and his relatively limited experience, Snow's cooking eschews the sauces and reductions of haute cuisine for the more rustic food of the Mediterranean, in particular Provence and northern Italy, where he spent school holidays. Bruschetta, brandade crostini, a gratin of mozzarella, aubergine and tomatoes, braised knuckle of pork with sage, chartreuse of partridge with cabbage and a daube of ox cheeks with mashed potatoes are just some of his dishes. All are interesting, well prepared and sensibly priced with most main courses under Pounds 10. But for me at the moment the cooking is not punchy enough, although this may change as Snow gains in experience. The wine list too would benefit from more professional counselling. Prices are not excessive - nothing more than Pounds 20 - but it is not exciting enough given the increasing number of good value wines on offer in London and there is too little by the glass. Most personally, I would welcome an off switch on the cassette player. Nevertheless I have enjoyed my four meals there - not only for the food and friendly service but because this restaurant is more than a sum of its parts. Both Snows have thrown their combined experiences into it. Although he started cooking 14 years ago he floundered for a long while. A chef he worked for seven years ago remembers that Snow had trouble butchering a duck. Then in 1988 he went to work for Antony Worrall Thompson and he was transformed. Since, he has combined confidence with a desire to learn. Financial rewards have helped - as a sous chef at 27 he was earning Pounds 25,000 pa - but the chance to wear a chef's jacket with the name of his own restaurant embroidered on it seems the biggest thrill. Melissa's most salutary work experience - as assistant manageress of a plush restaurant that went into receivership after just three months - left her in no doubt that as well as looking after her customers she must take care of staff, too. Such common sense proved invaluable when they decided to open their own restaurant. When it came to selling their homes to finance the purchase she insisted on keeping some cash for a 'rainy day'. And their ideas on decor have coincided neatly, successfully and economically: rag-rolled walls, pots of lavender on tile-topped tables, generous jars of olive oil infused with garlic and rosemary and a large, colourful mural to brighten the basement. An artistic family helps - the eye-catching photos of a girl picking lavender are of Melissa's sister, taken by her photographer brother. The gratitude that residents of Shepherd's Bush and Brook Green must feel at the Snows' arrival, as well as office workers who make up a good lunchtime clientele, is more than matched by the Snows' gratitude at the opportunities the restaurant trade has offered. A meritocratic industry, it can repay, even in a recession, those who can see through the early, poorly paid years of the necessary apprenticeship. The Snows recognise this. Partners in their own successful business they realise that, because of their choice of career, they lost touch with many friends who, during the 1980s, pursued more conventional, and at the time, more financially rewarding careers. Today this prospering business is theirs and they hope to make long-term plans - perhaps, a restaurant with bedrooms. More immediately, they have made many friends among customers who have crossed the threshold. Snows on the Green, 166 Shepherds Bush Road, London W6 7PB. Tel: 071-603 2142. Lunch: Mon-Fri and Sunday 12 to 3pm. Dinner: Mon-Sat 7-11pm. Set lunch Pounds 12.50.</p>

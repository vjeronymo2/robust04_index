			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL EXPECTED TO SEEK MORE U.S. PLEDGES BEFORE DIALOGUE  </P> <P> Israeli leaders agreed Friday to seek additional pledges of American support as  a condition for accepting a U.S. proposal for Israeli-Palestinian talks in  Cairo, political sources said.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his three most powerful ministers agreed to  seek the guarantees but would not ask that they be incorporated in a five-point  proposal that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has already modified at  Israel's request, the sources said.  </P> <P> PLO leaders, with whom Israel refuses to negotiate, were due to discuss Baker's  latest proposals at a meeting in Cairo today.  </P> <P> Israeli-Palestinian talks would be intended as a prelude to Palestinian  elections in the Israeli-occupied territories.  </P> <P> Sources on both sides of Israel's divided coalition government said Israel now  wants separate U.S. assurances that the Palestine Liberation Organization would  have no role and the Cairo talks would deal only with the elections.  </P> <P> Shamir, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Vice  Premier Shimon Peres discussed Baker's unpublished proposals for an hour Friday  and said later that their search for a common position would continue.  </P> <P> "This effort will continue and hopefully succeed, and a joint formula will be  submitted to the Cabinet," the four men said in a statement.  </P> <P> Rabin told reporters after the meeting that the final vote on whether to accept  Baker's five-point plan will be taken in the 12-member Inner Cabinet.  </P> <P> Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said the Cabinet will not meet before Arens  leaves for Japan on Sunday for a weeklong visit, leaving unclear when a final  government position might emerge.  </P></p>

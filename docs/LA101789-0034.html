			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GISH CONFRONTED WITH DATE RAPE IN 'NOT A STRANGER'  </P> <P> After sitcoms, TV likes to fill its time with social evils. Like "When He's Not  a Stranger," a cautionary tale on campus rape. It airs tonight at 9 on Channels  2 and 8.  </P> <P> The movie, courtesy of executive producer Don Ohlmeyer and writer-director John  Gray, is about a dreamy frosh named Lyn (Annabeth Gish, who made such a strong  debut in the feature "Mystic Pizza" as the innocent kid sister; she's  appropriately vulnerable and distraught here).  </P> <P> Lyn leaves her little home in New York to study at a college in our state.  Handsome star quarterback Ron Cooper (John Terlesky) inveigles her into his  dorm room and rapes her.  </P> <P> What ensues is pain, then anger. Her roommate, who's "dating" Ron, doesn't  believe her; her parents are dubious; the football coach says her allegations  will hurt the team; the college panel beats her up with its questions, then  finds no evidence of physical rape.  </P> <P> Lyn bravely persists and files felony rape charges. In the end, there is a plea  bargain and it looks as if Ron will get off with probation -- until. . . .  </P> <P> There isn't much here that we haven't seen on "Cagney &amp; Lacey" and "L.A.  Law," etc. The script opts for simple-minded characterizations and elementary  insights. But anything additional on the subject is helpful. This sort of  brutality doesn't go away.

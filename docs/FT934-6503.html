			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Back to square one for Opec The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night conceded that it would have to go back to square one in its quest to end the decline in oil prices. In a speech which will add to pressure on the oil ministers meeting in Vienna to make cuts in the present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day, Mr Jean Ping, the energy minister of Gabon and Opec president, gave a gloomy assessment of market conditions. He noted that the price of the Opec basket of six crude oils was Dollars 14.70 yesterday, the level before Opec's September meeting in Geneva at which it set the ceiling in an effort push prices closer to the Opec target of Dollars 21 a barrel. That ceiling has been largely observed, according Mr Ping, with output in October of 24.85m b/d. The bulk of the over-production occurred in Iraq, which is barred from exporting by United Nations sanctions. Ministers will focus over the next few days on possible further production cuts. Analysts say it could take at least a 3 per cent immediate reduction in the ceiling to counter bearish market psychology, especially as Opec calls for producers outside the organisation to curb their output are unlikely to lead to any short term relief.</p>

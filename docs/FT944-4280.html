			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Bossa nova's founder dies Antonio Carlos Jobim, the founding father of Brazil's bossa nova music who composed The Girl From Ipanema, died of heart failure yesterday in a New York hospital. He was 67. Jobim, Brazil's most prominent songwriter and composer, burst on to the international music scene with the bossa nova sound in the early 1960s. The Girl From Ipanema earned him and the late US jazz saxophonist Stan Getz four Grammy awards. Bossa nova's distinctive rhythms and catchy melodies became a musical craze around the world and influenced jazz and popular music for years. Apart from Getz, Jobim recorded with such stars as Frank Sinatra and British singer Sting.</p>

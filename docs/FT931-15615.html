			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: Cues that are still holding back women in management Sir, I found it refreshing to read that it is recognised, at least across the Atlantic, that women continue to encounter the impenetrable glass ceiling in the workplace in the US ('Women take stock of Wall Street', January 6). This issue is one of attitude that will take some time to remedy. Perhaps management is only taking its cues from the general population. My favourite memory is one of a call I received that had been transferred from the receptionist. Upon answering the phone I was immediately asked: 'Are you the secretary?' It took great restraint for me not to reply 'No, are you the plumber?' I do not understand what it is about the tone in one's voice that indicates a profession. Perhaps I should have studied voice psychology rather than economics. Also ironic was that in the three-quarter page 'Who's News' section of the Wall Street Journal (January 6) there was not a single mention of a female. In a country this size I find it difficult to believe that there was not one corporate move or appointment of a female that was newsworthy. Ah, but alas, the chocolate-chip cookie has already been perfected. What more is there for us to do? Eileen M O'Connor, 20m Edgewood Road, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, US</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sheffield Insulations well ahead at Pounds 9.11m Sheffield Insulations Group, the distributor of thermal insulation and related products, yesterday announced substantially higher interim pre-tax profits, reflecting organic growth and acquisitions. The group also revealed plans for a one-for-one scrip issue and said it plans to change its name to SIG to more reflect its broadly-based distribution business in the UK and overseas. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 almost trebled from Pounds 3.09m to Pounds 9.11m, on turnover up 78 per cent to Pounds 132.7m (Pounds 74.6m), which included Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 1.44m) from acquisitions. Earnings per share advanced by 55 per cent to 8.5p (5.5p) and the interim dividend is increased by 11 per cent to 2p (1.8p). Mr Norman Adsetts, chairman, said the results reflected 'good organic growth in the continuing operations supported by encouraging contributions from acquired businesses. 'The strong first half sales and margin performance in all our businesses and the opportunities which exist for further growth and development within the group lead me to view the second half and beyond with confidence,' he added. Operating profits from continuing operations advanced from Pounds 3.09m to Pounds 7.81m, while total operating profits increased threefold to Pounds 9.25m (Pounds 3.09m). WMS Group, a manufacturer of fittings for plastic windows and doors which contributed only one month's profit to the 1993 interim results, posted operating profits of Pounds 3.2m on turnover of Pounds 19.8m in the 1994 first half. In the core insulation and ceilings distribution business, market share gains, further operating efficiencies and progress on margins all contributed to an improvement. In hardware and security products, WMS continued to trade well having produced a strong profit performance.</p>

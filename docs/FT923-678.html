			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Russia says its budget revenues are exhausted RUSSIA's central bank warned yesterday that the country's budget revenues were exhausted, largely because of a big fall in tax income. Foreign experts in Moscow last night confirmed this. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, told parliament on Tuesday that the deficit was Rbs800bn - though the central bank said the figure was Rbs950bn. Mr Arnold Voinikov, the central bank's first deputy chairman, said yesterday that either the government must tightly limit its expenses, or the bank would be required to give it further credits which parliament would have to agree. The central bank has had to finance the rapidly increasing deficit, and is aggrieved that the government blames it for being the sole cause of credit expansion. He rejected the statement made earlier this week by Mr Gaidar that the bank should concentrate only on financial policy, saying that a stable currency was only possible in a stable economy and that 'if the bank closes its eyes, as it is asked to do, to the fall in production, especially in those areas producing necessary goods, then I for one will resign'. Mr Voinikov also denied government claims that the bank had been responsible for fuelling inflation because of unilateral granting of credits to commercial banks and enterprises - saying that of the nearly Rbs1,400bn injected into the economy in the past few months, all but Rbs76bn had been spent by agreement either with the parliament or the government. David Waller adds from Frankfurt: Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank, yesterday urged government creditors of the former Soviet Union not to forgive any part of the debt outstanding when they meet next week. Mr Bernhard Walter, a main board director of the bank, urged that banks and governments should pursue a full rescheduling of debt over the long term, but said that any debt write-offs would be 'counter-productive'. Write-offs would deter badly-needed foreign investment, he argued, as they had in Poland where creditor governments had forgiven part of outstanding debts. Hungary had been more successful in attracting investment because it was committed to repaying its debts, Mr Walter said. He said that capital payments would probably be rolled over for another three months following the expiry of the existing 90-day rollover on September 30. The Paris Club of government creditors is meeting the day before. Mr Walter also reiterated Dresdner's call that interest payments on loans to the former Soviet Union should be paid in roubles, on condition that these roubles could be converted into holdings in property or other assets. The total ex-Soviet debt is believed to be more than Dollars 80bn (Pounds 46.7bn), of which Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn is owed to private sector banks. Although Russia and other republics are formally committed to meeting interest payments, banks and governments received only Dollars 170m of a total Dollars 1.2bn interest which was due in the first five months of the year.</p>

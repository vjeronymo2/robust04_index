			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino recently addressed  the 20th OAS Special General Assembly held in Mexico. He said  the Panamanian Government priority is to resolve the country's  social problems and emphasized that a large percentage of the  1994 budget has been dedicated to the social sector (education,  health, housing, and public works).    Minister Mulino said the Panamanian Government feels each  country should contribute, taking into account their respective  human and material resources, to the establishment of a new  hemispheric cooperation phase based on equality, social justice,  and reciprocal respect and benefits. The OAS, said Mulino, has  been enriched with the protocols of Washington and Managua. The  inclusion of extreme poverty as a basic objective for integrated  development and the creation of the Inter-American Council for  Integrated Development have been decisive steps in the struggle  we have initiated and to which we are all committed, the  Panamanian minister added.    Additionally and as an initiative of this special general  assembly, Foreign Minister Mulino added, Panama completely  supports the proposal to declare 1994 the year of social  integration, with the objective of establishing social  integration as a priority of Inter-American cooperation.    Minister Jose Raul Mulino also emphasized to the 20th OAS  Special General Assembly delegates the importance of the current  electoral process in Panama, which is pluralist and free, to the  country's democratic consolidation. On 8 May [election day] and  1 September [inauguration day for the elected government], a  difficult and complicated transition period will have ended and  the elected government will find a country that is active  economically and has been institutionally and financially  reconstructed, the Panamanian minister reported. He also  invited all the OAS delegates to attend the elections as  observers and verify Panama's significant democratic  advancements.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gulf tensions take toll on regional markets The region had mixed feelings about the latest threat in the Middle East. Taiwan, meanwhile, was closed for the national day holiday after a fall of 6.1 per cent on Saturday on rumours of the death of the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping; this followed a 7.8 per cent fall in the previous three days, dragged down by the Hualon group's payments default case. Tokyo was also closed for a public holiday. BANGKOK dropped 2.2 per cent on blue chip selling initiated partly by fears of renewed tensions in the Gulf. The SET index closed 31.66 lower at 1,428.12 in turnover of Bt7.38bn. The finance sector was the biggest loser and the most active, falling 3.25 per cent in turnover of Bt1.2bn. Siam City Bank topped the active list, shedding Bt0.75 to Bt29.50. KUALA LUMPUR was under pressure early in the day following the news that Iraq was massing troops near its border with Kuwait, although prices subsequently recovered from their lows on late bargain-hunting. The composite index ended 12.21 or 1.1 per cent lower at 1,110.12 after a low of 1097.34, with the bearish sentiment also aggravated by apparent political tension in Malaysia when an Umno youth leader clashed with the prime minister, Mr Mahathir Mohamad, over the ousting of a scandal-hit party official. Among gainers, Berjaya South picked up MDollars 4 or 15.1 per cent to MDollars 30.50 on news that it was buying into Malaysia's privatised sewerage consortium. SYDNEY combined positive exploration news from a number of oil companies with speculation on an oil price rise due to the Iraq-Kuwait confrontation. The oil and gas index closed 29.5, or 3.2 per cent higher at 940.3, helping the All Ordinaries index to a gain of 20.5, or 1 per cent at 1,988.0. SINGAPORE was lower with the mood bruised by tensions on the Iraq-Kuwait border. Heavy profit-taking in Malaysian stocks traded over the counter also weakened sentiment. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 27.81 to 2,302.28, just managing to hold above the psychological 2,300 level. SHANGHAI's A share index closed 5.5 per cent lower as last week's rumour laden trading, concerning the health of China's leader Deng Xiaoping, continued to overshadow the market. The index finished down 42.00 at 715.86 in increased turnover of Yn5.0bn. Large capitalised issues led the day's fall. Shanghai Petrochemical lost Yn0.15 or 6.8 per cent, to Yn2.06 in heavy volume of 21.9m shares. Maanshan Iron and Steel gave up Yn0.14 or 6.5 per cent, to Yn2.03 in volume of 10.0m shares. In Shenzhen, the A share index fell 10.09 or 5.8 per cent to 162.99 and the B index edged down 0.40 to 116.05. HK stocks close off lows in thin, bearish trade. HONG KONG closed off its lows after a day spent languishing around the lower support level of 9,200 in thin turnover and weak sentiment with foreign funds liquidating south east Asian holdings. The Hang Seng index closed 36.48 down at 9,248.40 in turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn compared with HKDollars 2.9bn on Friday. The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong fell 30.98 or 2.4 per cent to 1,284.69 in response to the latest fall in the Shanghai A index. BOMBAY was lower on weak buying support in thin volume. The BSE 30 share index dipped 15.61 to 4,410.95. Brokers said that they expected trading to remain low in the next few days ahead of a Hindu festive season. SEOUL closed higher in moderate trading, in spite of consolidation by primary blue chips as a rally persisted among banks, financial companies and low and medium-priced shares. The composite index closed 6.72 higher at 1,068.68. Trading volume totalled 46.89m shares compared with 68.83m on Friday. WELLINGTON ended a four-day losing streak which saw the NZSE-40 index lose 3.8 per cent, but only barely with a rise of just 4.89 to 1,992.93. Equities were supported by a firm bond market, although the New Zealand finance minister said yesterday that higher rates were inevitable. MANILA's composite index closed 25.05 lower at 2,972.108 in turnover of 1.584 bn pesos, also reflecting the Iraqi troop movements. JAKARTA watched the Gulf, and took profits after last week's sharp rebound, the official index ending 3.18 off at 511.86 in thin volume.</p>

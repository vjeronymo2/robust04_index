			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: 'STRUGGLING TRUTHS' IN TIBET  </P> <P> Things get cerebral this week at the Odyssey Theatre, where Ron Sossi is  staging the premiere of Peter Mellencamp's "Struggling Truths," opening  Saturday.  </P> <P> "It is a think piece," admitted the theater's artistic director. The setting is  Tibet, spanning the 1930s to 1950s. In a succession of 40 scenes, a  "reincarnated, enlightened" lama narrates the stories of a brother and sister  who end up on opposing factions -- he wants to be a lama, she joins the Chinese  communists -- and of the Dalai Lama taking the throne as a teen-ager.  </P> <P> As a historical evocation, Sossi allowed, "It has certain information -- but  since the man and woman are totally fictitious, it's really a condensation of  what happened."  </P> <P> The basic premise, he continued, "is the clash between the ideas of Tibetan  Buddhism and Chinese Communism. That's the political level. But on the  metaphysical level, there's the whole idea of duality: that we live our lives  under the illusion that everything breaks down into opposites -- things are  good or bad, black or white. In the philosophical sense, it's about how we're  caught, always choosing between those opposites. Therein lies our state of  suffering, the Buddhists say."  </P> <P> Although Sossi stressed that the playwright does not side with either the  Buddhist or Communist point of view, the piece is nevertheless provocative; one  Asian actor turned down a role because, he said, he didn't like the play's  politics. Which leads to another issue: the director has heard rumors of  discontent about the relatively small number of Asian actors (three out of 14)  cast in the piece.  </P> <P> "It was never intended by the writer to be all-Asian," he said  matter-of-factly. "It's a parable, not a historical document. I definitely  wanted to do it cross-culturally; that's how we advertised. We wanted to use as  many Asians as possible, and we went out of our way to look for them. The long  and short of it is, the Asian community of actors is not that large, so our  choices were very small. Some of the Asian actors we cast later withdrew.  Others we found didn't even come in to audition."  </P> <P> THEATER BUZZ: Speaking of the Odyssey, we were wondering what was going on with  that "one- year" lease signed with the city last August. The theater doesn't  show any signs of picking up and moving on any time soon. "Originally they told  us, 'We can only give you a one-year lease, but the way the city operates,  it'll probably be two or three years -- at least,' " said Sossi. "At the same  time, (Councilman Zev) Yaroslavsky said, 'Don't hold your breath; anything can  happen.' So that's where we are."  </P></p>

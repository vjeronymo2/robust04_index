			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: The British PM explains goals - Major's letter to EC leaders The following are key excerpts from the letter sent last Friday by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to other EC leaders. In it he explains why EC finance ministers will not be present at next week's emergency summit meeting in Birmingham. He also outlines the British presidency's goals. 'A number of colleagues have expressed willingness to have a general discussion at Birmingham of the recent turbulence on the foreign exchanges and about the lessons we need to draw. 'Some of you have, however, expressed concern that if finance ministers are present that would arouse expectations of immediate decisions and could itself create market instability. I am very happy to respond to that concern and do not propose to invite finance ministers to join us. It would not be credible, however, in the light of very dramatic and far-reaching events, to have no discussion at all of these events when we meet.' Mr Major said he wanted the summit to agree a declaration covering: greater openness in the Community business; more consultation by the European Commission before making proposals for legislation; steps to remove peoples' concern at the loss of national identity by making a reality of the concept of subsidiarity; greater involvement by national parliaments at an early stage in Community decision-making; increasing the appeal of the Maastricht treaty by showing how it affects the lives of ordinary people for the better, for example greater freedom of movement, consular protection, educational exchanges and an improved environment. 'The Community has been through a rocky patch,' Mr Major said. 'I believe that at Birmingham we can give a new and united signal showing both that we have responded to public opinion and how we will bring the Community closer to the lives of our citizens.'</p>

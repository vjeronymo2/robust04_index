			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Ex-Boddington chief hits out at bid for Devenish Mr John Boddington, former joint managing director of Boddington, yesterday spoke out against the company's Pounds 127.7m hostile bid for JA Devenish, the brewery and public house group. Speaking at Boddington's extraordinary general meeting, he asked Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman of the pubs, hotels and healthcare group, what he could do to improve Devenish's existing management. Without waiting for an answer he went on to ask him: 'Do you not think Boddington has enough on its plate already with the current expansion, at premium rates on borrowed money?' To applause from a minority of the shareholders present he concluded: 'This is Boddington seeking to get bigger for bigness sake.' Mr Cassidy rebutted the accusation, replying that Boddington's strategy had produced excellent results over the past two years. The company pointed out that Mr Boddington had long been a critic of the board. While Mr Boddington, who held his post until the mid-1980s, only holds 125,000 shares his intervention was seized upon by Devenish 'as proof of Boddington's misconceived strategy'. However, despite opposition to the proposed takeover from a small group of shareholders Boddington said it had received 48m votes in favour of the bid, with only 1.5m against.</p>

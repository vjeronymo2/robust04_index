			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: MADONNA IN TORONTO ECHOES MAE WEST  </P> <P> SO, YOU MAY have read that Madonna got out of Toronto in the nick of time,  beset as she was in her last performance there by the police "Morality Squad."  (They called upon her to change her show as they'd had complaints that it was  "obscene and lewd.")  </P> <P> Madonna asked her Toronto audience: "Do you believe in freedom of expression?"  (They howled, "Yes!")  </P> <P> The star is now in Detroit, where she gets to say things like this: "I would  rather have canceled the show than let anybody dictate how I can or can't  express myself as an artist. This is certainly a cause for which I am willing  to be arrested."  </P> <P> Ah, yes, shades of Mae West in the '30s when she did her play "Sex." There is  nothing like charges of "obscene and lewd" to hype the box office.  </P> <P> UNIVERSAL insiders say that Robert Redford's new movie, "Havana," is one of the  best of his entire career. The blond one is to be given an honorary degree in  science at the University of Massachusetts Sunday in Boston.  </P> <P> Spike Lee's movie after the upcoming "Mo' Better Blues" will be called "Jungle  Fever." It tells of a young African-American architect who falls in love with a  young Italian-American temp secretary.  </P> <P> "Back to the Future III" is racking up nationwide records in 2,000 theaters and  now director-writer Bob Zemeckis says the grand total for all three  "B-to-the-F" movies could hit the $1-billion mark!  </P> <P> Quincy Jones dropped out of Seattle University to join Lionel Hampton's band in  the good old days. Sunday he'll be accepting his alma mater's honorary  doctorate at commencement. The night before, Quincy plans to reprise Dooley  Wilson's famed song from "Casablanca," singing "As Time Goes By" for Warner  Bros. guests at re-dedication ceremonies in Burbank.  </P></p>

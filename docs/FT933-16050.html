			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: New music, old ideas - Concert Now that the former Almeida Music Festival has shrunk to a mere pendant for the Almeida Opera season, we still hope - quite unrealistically - that it will somehow distill the newest and liveliest music into its few allotted slots. It can't, and doesn't. The non-operatic part of this year's programme comprises just two concerts by the Brindisi Quartet, two potpourri piano recitals, a recitation of Strauss's 'melodrama' Enoch Arden and a single concert by Richard Bernas's Music Projects ensemble. Thus the latter, given on Saturday, was so to speak the only broad-gauge exhibit - and it proved discouragingly narrow. It was well played, of course; the Bernas team's contributions always are. What it signally failed to do was to suggest that anything of fresh interest was going on. It concluded grimly with John Adams' 1982 Grand Pianola Music, which now sounds like such a loud, protracted nullity as to undermine the cleverer impression made by his more recent theatre-pieces. It is possible - just - to imagine why it got a warm American welcome in its time, when pure minimalism was beginning to seem a straitjacket. What the 'grand pianola' plays, however, is minimalist textures (endlessly repeated notes and figures, etc) without the fascination of slow, systematic change that was the original point. Instead there are sudden, arbitrary switches for variety's sake, with colourful patches which hark directly back to Stravinsky, and for emphasis some blatant Hollywood effects (scored with unblinking crudity). The total is far less than the sum of its parts. If Yvar Mikhashoff's arrangements of some Conlon Nancarrow player-piano studies seemed pleasant but unnecessary, Nancarrow's urgent, crabby sense of musical purpose made Adams sound flabbily catch-as-catch-can. Presumably the music of David Lang - represented here by Are You Experienced? (after Jimi Hendrix, with Lang delivering his own winsomely fragmentary narration) and his recent Orpheus Over and Under, with a 'music-drama' soon to come - answers to some current felt need in New York. One can only guess at what that might be; in London both pieces sounded desperately thin and wispy, without even Adams' showmanship to brighten their inconsequent progress. In this company Vic Hoyland's new Chamber Concerto (an Almeida Opera commission) at least evinced the marks of thoughtful construction, hard-edged and unappetising though it was.</p>

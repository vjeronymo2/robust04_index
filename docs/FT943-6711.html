			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Bank mortgage lending figures show 9% fall More discouraging signs in the housing market came yesterday from bank mortgage lending figures which showed a fall in new net lending and in loans approved in July compared with June. The British Bankers' Association, which released the figures, said they reflected the relative reduction in banks' market share compared with last summer. But these figures, with those published by the Building Societies' Association last week, show that the number of loans approved last month - about 83,000 - was about 10,000 fewer than the number approved in June and about 4,000 down from the previous July. Lenders have been saying that although recovery has been slow and fragile by comparison with last summer there has been some advance in lending. But Mr John Ecklin, BBA director of statistics, acknowledged that the figures were 'disappointing'. On a seasonally adjusted basis new net lending by banks in July totalled Pounds 593m, a fall of 9 per cent compared with Pounds 652m in June, and below the Pounds 910m lent last July. Net lending figures take into account repayment of principal. Gross lending by banks in July amounted to Pounds 1.8bn, but the BBA said that the increase from the Pounds 1.7bn June figure was probably 'more than accounted for' by seasonal factors. July was the month of highest mortgage lending by banks and societies last year. Separately, Halifax Building Society's annual survey on home improvements shows that homeowners are preferring to use their savings to pay for home improvements instead of increasing their mortgages or taking out loans.</p>

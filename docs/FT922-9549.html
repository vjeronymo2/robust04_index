			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): Bonds may prevail, unless the ERM crumbles - After a decade of exceptional real returns, short-term prospects are less encouraging THE CONSERVATIVES' emphatic election victory may be about to deliver UK investors into a promised land of low and stable inflation; but no one is quite sure how the investment landscape will change as the UK adjusts to membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. The real returns earned by UK pension funds on their equity portfolios over the past decade have been exceptional. The average annual nominal return on UK equities over the 10 years to the end of 1991 was 19.6 per cent. Deflated by the average earnings index, which is the best indicator of the change in their liabilities, this implies a real return of 11.3 per cent on UK equities, compared with 6.3 per cent on UK fixed-interest securities and  1 per cent on index-linked gilts. Little wonder, then, that UK pension funds have both accumulated large surpluses in recent years and orientated their portfolios towards equities. But the short-term prospects for real returns do not look so encouraging. The rate of economic growth is the most important long-run determinant of real returns on equity investments. But current tensions within the ERM, and the pain of adjustment to a low inflation regime, may depress real equity returns over the next few years. The total return on equity investments is equal to the dividend yield plus the capital gain. The capital gain depends, in turn, on the expected future stream of profits. Assuming that the share of profits in national income remains stable, the main determinant of real profitability, and thus the long-term real return on equity investments, is the real growth rate of the economy. History confirms the central role of GDP growth in determing long-run real returns, according to a recent paper from Lombard Street Research. Mr Tim Congdon and Mr Simon Ward show that the combination of an expected trend rate of real economic growth of 2-2 1/2 per cent, added to an average dividend yield of 5.2 per cent over the period 1955-90, implies an annual real return of 7-8 per cent, before management fees. A recent BZW study confirms their expectations: the average annual real return on equities, with gross income reinvested, was 7.2 per cent over the 70 years to 1988, higher than target real return of 4-4 1/2 per cent normally set by pension funds, but much below the real yield on equities in the 1980s. Yet this relationship between real returns on equities and trend GDP growth tends to hold true only over very long periods: several decades, rather than a few years. Real returns in the 1990s could stray from this long-run trend for a number of reasons: sluggish economic growth; changes in the profit share in GDP; or changes in market expectations. ERM and European growth: The clearest threat to UK economic growth, and thus real equity returns, is the high level of nominal and real interest rates that Germany is imposing on its ERM partners. Because Germany sets the floor for Europe's monetary policy, the rest of Europe remains stuck with a combination of slow growth and tight monetary policy. Even if the Bundesbank feels able to cut its rates by the end of this year, as inflationary pressures abate, it is unlikely to cut rates very far, very fast. ERM and the UK: UK rates may have to remain above those in other European countries. The interest rate premium against German rates has narrowed to just half of a percentage point. But if UK imports surge and the trade deficit widens, the markets may become nervous once more about sterling's ERM parity. In addition, there is still some way to go before UK industry fully adjusts to life in the ERM. Annual wage inflation is still above 7 per cent, and therefore remains higher than the European average. There may have to be a few years of high unemployment and squeezed profits before UK unit labour cost inflation falls to European levels. Corporate profitability: But UK productivity growth in the 1980s grew faster than in every main industrialised country, except Japan; and output per person-hour in British manufacturing is still only two thirds of the German level, suggesting that there is room for further improvement. UK equities benefited from the rise in the share of value-added that was distributed in profits in the 1980s. According to the OECD, capital's share rose from 30.3 per cent in 1975-79 to 31.5 per cent in 1980-87. Yet the rate of return on capital in the latter period was virtually unchanged at 9.5 per cent, well below the OECD average of 14.2 per cent. Capital gains: The main determinant of the rate of return on equities is likely to come from short-run movements in share prices, as investors reassess their expectations of the future. Congdon and Ward find that, over one-year periods, changes in the return on equities come about largely through swings in the dividend yield. Only over five-year periods do changes in dividend growth matter. But even over 20 years the correlation between share-price indices and output is weak, as the charts shows. At first sight, the UK equity market does not appear over-valued. The average price-earnings ratio of UK equities is broadly in line with long-run trends; the prospect of low inflation could boost profitability; and the ratio of nominal yields on bonds to equities has fallen to 1.95:1, lower than its past average of 2.25:1 Yet low inflation combined with high and stable yields on bonds may reduce the need for such a high nominal premium on fixed interest investments. If inflation were to fall to 2-3 per cent a year, and economic growth remained below trend for the first half of the decade, the current nominal yield gap of 4 1/2 percentage points between bond and equity yields would make bonds an attractive investment. The market is not yet convinced that the UK will move into this low-inflation world: the yield gap between nominal and index-linked gilts remains nearer to 5 percentage points. The capital gains from falling nominal yield may make bonds portfolios outperform equities during this adjustment. The strength of the UK's ERM commitment remains a central uncertainty. If tensions in Europe were to boil over, the ERM were to crumble and the UK were to return to its inflationary ways, then the short-term case for bonds would quickly disappear.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / US employment growth slowed by bad weather: Radical change to monthly survey's method Bad weather reduced employment growth in the US last month to about a third of its recent levels, with only 62,000 jobs created against 190,000 in December, according to the Labour Department. However the unemployment rate rose nominally, because of the introduction of new survey methods. Most hard hit were weather-sensitive industries - with construction, in the throes of a big expansion, adding only 3,000 jobs. The retail trade generally, tourism and restaurants also suffered as Americans were forced to stay at home. The survey was taken in the week before the California earthquake and the vast ice and snow storms covering the eastern half of the country. Substantial rebounds are expected this month, weather permitting. Manufacturing employment, up only 2,000 in December, rose by 26,000 in January, while the number of hours worked in factories remained high. Other recent economic indices have all pointed to continued strong economic growth, even if not to the point of the 5.9 per cent annual rise in gross national product achieved in the final quarter of last year. The unemployment figures for January reflect the most radical revision in the monthly survey's methodology in its 50-year history. Focused on full-time employment, the old method under counted part-time workers, many of them women, but exaggerated 'discouraged' workers, those who have given up looking for employment. The new data collection is also based on the the 1990 national census, reflecting the large growth in the population of minorities with higher-than-average jobless rates, particularly Hispanics. The result is that unemployment in January is now estimated at 6.7 per cent, down from 7 per cent in December, using the new method of calculation. Under the old method, December's rate was 6.4 per cent and January's would have been 6.3 per cent. The department's broad conclusion is that last year's unemployment numbers would have been roughly 0.5 per cent a month higher had the new methodology been applied.</p>

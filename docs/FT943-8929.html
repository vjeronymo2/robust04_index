			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Callback services cut international call costs They give a new twist to the phrase 'Don't call me, I'll call you'. The 'call-back' services mushrooming across the US now offer a way for travellers abroad to avoid the high rates for international telephone calls charged by many countries. But their huge popularity is attracting furious opposition from telecommunications carriers, who are pressing for the services to be made illegal. Callback takes advantage of the fact that rates for international calls are very low in the deregulated and intensely competitive US telecommunications market, but are high in many other countries, particularly those where the service is provided by a state-owned PTT. Japan, for example, despite recent deregulation, still charges very high prices for international calls. To use the service, a caller in Japan dials the number of one of the 100-odd callback bureaux which have sprung up across the US. The caller hangs up after a single ring, and a programmed switch in the bureau calls back with a dial tone from a US carrier's line. The caller can then use that line to call anywhere in the world - and will pay only US rates. Mr Dennis Anderson, vice-president of Colorado-based International GeoTel, estimates that his service halves the usual Dollars 2 per minute charge to call from Tokyo to the US in peak time. His company, which started late last year and already has more than a thousand business customers, is targeting businesses in Latin America, the Pacific rim, Italy, Spain, Greece and Eastern Europe, which have the most expensive international calls. 'We could save a company based in Latin America hundreds of thousands of dollars a year,' Mr Anderson says. The callback operators see themselves as pioneers testing the technical and legal frontiers of telephony. Their popularity with travellers and businesses in Japan is all the sweeter because it occurs against a background of rising tension between the US and Japan over Japan's alleged failure to open its markets for telecoms equipment. Callback operators point out that, even without the help of threats from the US government, they have succeeded in exporting considerable slices of spare US telephone capacity into the Japanese market. The development of these services in the past year has been driven partly by the invention of the programmable call-back switch. But explosive growth this summer has followed a ruling in May by the US Federal Communications Commission that such devices were not illegal, despite fierce opposition from US carriers and some overseas PTTs. The US carriers AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint argue that they are not recompensed for the cost of the initial call to the US. 'Theft is theft,' says Mr Bob Baulch, a manager of the AT&amp;T's global strategy division. The company is determined to defend that principle, he says, even if the carriers gain extra revenue from calls which would otherwise have been placed with foreign PTTs. In practice, however, if many people take advantage of the services, Mr Baulch believes they 'will ultimately have downward pressure on other countries' rates'.</p>

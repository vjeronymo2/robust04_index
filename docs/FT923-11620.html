			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Newmont Mining slips NEWMONT Mining, the Denver-based gold mining group, reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 24.4m, or 36 cents a share, compared with Dollars 22m, or 32 cents, in the same period last year. Lower gold prices held consolidated sales down to Dollars 158.7m compared with Dollars 167.2m last year. The average price received for gold was Dollars 388, down 2 per cent from last year's Dollars 395. But the results for the three months ended June 30 were boosted by Dollars 10.6m from the settlement of a gold-dollar swap. The quarter was also affected by lower production at Newmont Gold, the group's 90.1 per cent-owned subsidiary. Its output dropped to 403,000 ounces compared with 419,000 ounces a year ago. At the same time, the cost of gold production at Newmont Gold rose to Dollars 212 an ounce from Dollars 208 an ounce last year. Newmont Gold, which reports earnings separately, had second-quarter net income of Dollars 17.2m, or 16 cents, down from Dollars 29.3m, or 28 cents last year. Net income was reduced by Dollars 1.5m due to a write-off of obsolete equipment. For the first six months, Newmont Mining's net income was Dollars 56.8m, or 83 cents, down from Dollars 59.4m, or 88 cents. The 1992 period included an after-tax charge of Dollars 11.6m for a shift to new accounting standards.</p>

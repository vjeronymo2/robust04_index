			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MANCUSO': LAST SHALL BE ONE OF THE WORST  </P> <P> The only redeemable component of last season's appalling NBC miniseries  "Favorite Son" was Nick Mancuso, a surly FBI agent who somehow emerged from  this tawdry production untainted and fit for recycling.  </P> <P> Hence, "Mancuso FBI," airing at 10 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39. It's the  last of the new fall series, and one of the worst, driving a potentially  interesting character played by a good actor (Robert Loggia) into the ground.  </P> <P> That isn't surprising, given that the co-executive producer of the spinoff is  Steve Sohmer, who also created "Favorite Son" from his novel of the same name.  And Sohmer's co-executive producer and the director of tonight's premiere is  Jeff Bleckner, who also directed "Favorite Son."  </P> <P> Their lack of restraint in "Favorite Son" carries over to "Mancuso FBI."  </P> <P> When the secretary of a nominee for Secretary of Defense with a reputation for  womanizing is discovered drowned in his pool, Mancuso is dispatched to  investigate. By being easily snookered at almost every turn in the case,  however, he immediately loses credibility as a character, substituting bombast  and histrionics for intelligence. Not that an FBI agent has to be smart, only  that this one is so unsmart -- and ready to jump to conclusions and make wild  charges based on weak or no evidence -- that you wonder how he can still draw a  paycheck.  </P> <P> Mancuso is less investigator than bully, a loud, frothing, coarse, insulting,  obnoxious, one-man tornado whom Loggia revs up so high that you want to gag him  and tell him to calm down. Seething is one thing, but director Bleckner lets  Loggia roar out of control.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the script by Sohmer and producer Ken Solarz is so preposterous that  it approaches farce. "This country is precious to us, but it is no more  precious than our marriage," the Cabinet nominee's wife tells Mancuso. Does  anyone really speak that way?  </P> <P> You do a double take when a TV reporter willingly gives Mancuso the name of a  highly sensitive anonymous source. You do another when the reporter doesn't  even wince when Mancuso confronts the source. And, finally, you do a third at  the comically maudlin and inept ending.  </P> <P> No more, please! Uncle! Uncle! HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

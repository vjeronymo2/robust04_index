			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has said it is making every effort to  rescue Tanzanians who want to return home following the ongoing  heavy fighting between the Rwandan Government troops and the  forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. (?A statement)  issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International  Cooperation said those Tanzanians who are in Rwanda and who want  to leave the country should contact embassy officials currently  living at the residence of the Tanzanian ambassador in Kigali as  soon as possible so that arrangements can be made for them to  travel back home.    In the statement, the government calls on Rwandan Government  troops and the RPF fighters to ensure the safety of Tanzanians  in the country and that of those who want to return home. The  government also called on the sides involved in the country's  conflict to immediately stop fighting so as to save the lives of  all Rwandan citizens as well as those of foreign citizens in the  country.    The statement said Tanzania was still determined to continue  seeking a solution to the Rwandan conflict and called on the  sides concerned, particularly the Rwandan Government and the RPF  fighters, to implement the Arusha peace accord as it is the only  way of solving their problems.</p>

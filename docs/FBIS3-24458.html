			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Klimov article under the rubric "Only in </F> ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA": "`Greetings' From the Other Side, or Whose  Interests Does the Federal Government Communications and  Information Agency Protect"]    [Text] Recently the press has carried a series of articles  criticizing the activity of the Federal Government  Communications and Information Agency under the Russian  Federation president. Particular zeal in this respect has been  shown by a Mrs. Selivanova, whose byline appears on a number of  articles in SEGODNYA and KOMMERSANT-DAILY. Such close attention  on the part of the press, or to be more accurate on the part of  a single writer, to a structure that cannot be found even in  government handbooks prompts a legitimate question: Why is this?    First of all I want to say thank you to Mrs. Selivanova.  Were it not for her articles I, first, would still find it  difficult to decipher the abbreviation FGCIA (Federal Government  Communications and Information Agency) and, second, would not  know that the FGCIA is a powerful pillar of the state and that  there are termites trying to undermine that pillar. Why do I  reach these conclusions? Because, now that I have familiarized  myself with the substance of the question, I have arrived at the  opinion that Selivanova's articles "Yeltsin in Gorki-1994" and  "Sparkling Days of Kremlin Administrators" (SEGODNYA) and "Mind  What You Say: Walls Have Ears" [Slovo ne vorobey: poymayut --  vyletish] (KOMMERSANT-DAILY) contain so many fantasies and  distortions that you get the firm impression that the author is  interested in achieving certain aims that are not expressed in  the articles.    But before citing examples, let us say a little about the  FGCIA and about what the Federal Agency does for the state.  Only someone who is utterly uninformed can argue that the FGCIA  has a monopoly in the sphere of providing information support to  state structures (and Mrs. Selivanova speaks precisely of  monopolism). In fact the FGCIA is part of a system of  information support for organs of state power which also  includes the independent channels of the Foreign Ministry,  Defense Ministry, Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Committee  for Statistics, Federal Counterintelligence Service, Foreign  Intelligence Service, and others. But it is precisely the FGCIA  that brings together the best scientific minds in the field of  cryptography, specialists capable of closing any channels for  the leakage of information of state importance.    Recent events in the life of the intelligence services again  prove that foreign states' special services have by no means  slackened their work. They have perhaps just slightly  reoriented it toward the economy. They are now stepping up  their efforts to intercept and analyze large amounts of  non-secret information, obtaining as a result valuable data  about Russia's life and activity. U.S. National Security Agency  intelligence satellites constantly orbit over our country's  territory, vacuuming up information from unprotected  communication lines and relaying it to powerful processing and  analysis centers.    Who can shield and safeguard information of state importance  from any forms of intelligence, including satellite  intelligence? The answer is clear -- only the FGCIA, with its  powerful scientific and technical potential and many years of  experience.    Nor is there any doubt that the development of information  and telecommunication systems has always been ensured by a  proper level of protection of those systems. This has always  been the case in all countries.    I will not be able to briefly list all the conclusions of  the  SEGODNYA and KOMMERSANT-DAILY author regarding the FGCIA --  anyhow there is no point in doing so. I will dwell on the main  ones. The elimination of the Information Resources  Administration (IRA) within the structure of the President's  Administration and its transfer to the FGCIA structure as a main  administration is declared to be virtually a disaster.    If you proceed from the essence of the matter, this merger  was aimed at implementing a unified technical policy, removing  the duplication that existed, enhancing the reliability and  security of information and telecommunication systems in  Russia's organs of state power at the center and at local level,  and also precluding the unjustified and ineffective use of  budget funds intended for the creation of new communications and  computer systems without regard for the existing information and  telecommunications resources in our country. Translating this  semiofficial language into something more intelligible, let us  ask: What is the point in funding several communications  systems from the state budget and why should a single consumer  receive the same information from two sources? But that is  precisely what happened when the IRA existed. Now this kind of  duplication and overspending is ruled out by the president's  edict.    But this is where we found Mrs. Selivanova's first  "greetings" from the other side. I call it that because I can  only conjecture about whose interests she is attempting to  uphold. And she does this so clumsily that you can only marvel.  Thus in February she reported that the president had not signed  the edict about the merger of the FGCIA and the IRA because he  had been warned by the newspapers. That is all the president  has to do -- read papers containing articles about the IRA.  Incidentally, even the "newspaper outcry" existed only in Mrs.  Selivanova's articles.    Perhaps she is defending the interests of former IRA leader  V. Kupriyanovskiy. Defending them zealously, even stooping to  slander. One of the articles says that 400 IRA staffers have  been accused of political unreliability. This is sheer fantasy.  Practically all IRA specialists are continuing to work in their  former jobs in implementation of the president's edict "On  Improving Activity in the Sphere of the Computerization of  Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation."    Why is Mrs. Selivanova fighting so hard for the former IRA  leader? I don't think it's because of personal sympathies. But  nor do I want to claim that valuable information came into the  hands of the publications featuring Selivanova and their masters  from the former IRA leader. As yet there is not all the  necessary information on this score. I do not want to break the  law.    But V. Selivanova does this with little thought for the  consequences. In all her articles, and especially in  KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 12 March, she directly accuses the FGCIA of  illegal, anticonstitutional activities in eavesdropping on the  telephone and office conversations of top officials and  compiling so-called "telephone files" on this basis.    As is well known, the procedure for carrying out  investigative operations, including eavesdropping on telephone  and other conversations, is defined by the law "On Investigative  Operation Activities in the Russian Federation." This indicates  the range of organs entitled to carry out this activity. The  FGCIA is not among them, and, in my view, the agency has proper  grounds for demonstrating in court that tittle-tattle in a  newspaper is very different from tittle-tattle in a kitchen or  on the doorstep. I think that the persons in the president's  immediate entourage whom the author of the articles is trying at  all costs to set at loggerheads will also not remain indifferent  to tittle-tattle in the press.    Nevertheless, if you read Mrs. Selivanova's revelations  closely with pencil in hand, you get the impression that the  author's "greetings" could even come from the other side of  Russia's state border. After all, the attack is precisely on  the line of increasing the information security of organs of  state power. Whether deliberately or not, Mrs. Selivanova's  articles serve the interests of foreign special services, which  even now, during a worldwide thaw, openly state that they obtain  a considerable proportion of their information about Russia's  life and activity from technical means of information transfer.    Or maybe the "greetings" come from Russian mafia structures?  After all, because of the flaws in bank systems they have been  able to steal hundreds of billions of rubles from the state, in  other words, from you and me. Remember the numerous cases of  bogus advice notes. It was the FGCIA which blocked this channel  for the loss of state funds. A standard for digital electronic  signatures has been developed in conjunction with the Central  Bank. This technical solution makes it possible to establish  the addressee and the authenticity of a financial document.  Forgery is now impossible. The FGCIA ciphers are good for  decades, that is, it will take that long for anyone to be able  to find the keys to the ciphers.    All this confirms yet again the timeliness of the  president's  edict "On Improving Activity in the Sphere of the  Computerization of Organs of State Power of the Russian  Federation." And all this yet again refutes Mrs. Selivanova's  newspaper articles.    I also have to say a few words about the lies in her  articles. I'm sorry, but it's true. FGCIA leader Aleksandr  Starovoytov -- doctor of technical sciences, professor, and  honored scientific and technical figure of the Russian  Federation -- came to the Government Communications Agency at a  time when government communications required radical renewal and  modernization. As a leader of a science and production  association, he came as a recognized and experienced specialist  in the telecommunications sphere. That was essentially how his  active service began.    And what about the claim about magnetic fields surrounding  the government White House? This gibberish is apparently  designed for people who did not complete their elementary  education. It is also totally untrue that the FGCIA engages in  business by signing commercial contracts with foundations of  dubious origin to supply them with "open-source information"  from government structures.    And the style of Mrs. Selivanova's articles: "...after two  years of painstaking work to overcome the undesirable  consequences of 1991 the `underground Sverdlovsk Oblast  Committee' in the Kremlin in close alliance with the  `underground Gazprom' in the White House and other similar  structures is finally restoring both information-political and  organizational control over Russia's top state leadership."  Take newspapers from 1936 or 1937 -- the spirit of their  articles is just the same.    I am not going to ape Mrs. Selivanova in this regard and  describe enthusiastically what happens to people who undermine a  pillar of the state. In a democratic state everything is  decided by conscience and the courts.    But in the very near future we will describe the varied,  useful, and very interesting activities of various structures of  the Federal Government Communications and Information Agency.</p>

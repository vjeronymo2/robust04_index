			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Field] </F>   [Text] WELLINGTON, May 24 (AFP) -- New Zealand will send  250 infantry soldiers to join the United Nations protection  force in former Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Jim Bolger announced  Tuesday. The force, which will be attached to a British  company, amounts to around 10 percent of New Zealand combat  ready troops and is the country's biggest military commitment  since the Vietnam War.    "This is not a decision the government has reached lightly,  but I firmly believe it is the right decision," Bolger told  parliament in announcing New Zealand's first contribution to the  United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia.    The prime minister said New Zealand had special  responsibilities as a current member of the Security Council and  as a founding member of the United Nations. He said the New  Zealanders would face danger. "The nature of the conflicts and  the tasks undertaken by UNPROFOR make this unavoidable." Bolger  added: "Peacekeeping is no soft option in defence terms," he  said.    "We will take every care to minimize the risk to our  personnel, but the element of risk cannot be totally removed."    The force is to have six weeks training immediately in New  Zealand and would then leave for two weeks training in Britain  before deployment in Bosnia. An attempt to hold a parliamentary  debate on the contribution was frustrated when the leader of the  small opposition New Zealand First Party, Winston Peters,  objected. The main opposition Labour Party said they supported  the contribution.    "This is not New Zealand going to fight a European war, it  is  a New Zealand contribution to maintaining peace," opposition  leader Helen Clark said.    "The government considers it important that New Zealand as a  small member state, strongly committed to the founding  principles of the United Nations, plays its part to the greatest  extent possible of supporting and implementing the decisions of  the UN Security Council," the prime minister told MPs. He said  the size of the contribution was determined in order to meet  UNPROFOR requirements and to be as self-sufficient as possible.    "It would enjoy a distinctive national identity yet be  readily integrated into the larger British unit," Bolger said.  "Satisfactory arrangements can be established to ensure that New  Zealand would retain full control of the New Zealand contingent  while operationally attached to a British battalion." Thirty  six other nations also contribute to UNPROFOR.</p>

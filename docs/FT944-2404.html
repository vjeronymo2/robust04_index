			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Slow speed town traffic transmitted Measuring the speed of traffic flows in towns can be difficult because vehicles are constantly stopping and starting. Trafficmaster, a company that provides live traffic information to motorists, believes it has overcome this problem by devising a system that uses video cameras and number plate recognition software to track the speed at which traffic moves through two points on the road. A video camera photographs the number plates of a batch of cars, which are digitised and transmitted by radio signal to a site further down the road, where another camera photographs the targeted number plates. Trafficmaster plans to install the equipment early next year on two London routes. The company will destroy the sightings data after its use to protect drivers' privacy.

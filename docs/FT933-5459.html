			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Campaign against Thorp reprocessing funded by international financier Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, is funding a high profile campaign against the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, Bronwen Maddox writes. The Goldsmith Foundation, controlled by Sir James, has paid for an Pounds 18,000 balloon, in the shape of a white elephant. It has also put up the finance for the campaign run by WBMG, the environmental communications group. Sir James' office said last night that the financier confirmed 'that he has been funding groups opposed to nuclear power over a number of years and has been helping groups opposed to Thorp'. WBMG, whose directors include Mr Pete Wilkinson, former director of Greenpeace UK, and Mr David Gee, former director of Friends of the Earth, said yesterday that it 'couldn't deny' the contribution from the Goldsmith Foundation. According to Mr Wilkinson, WBMG wants to spread debate about whether Thorp should be licenced to start operation beyond the 'green' movement. 'We are putting both sides of the argument before the public - the balloon is a floating question mark' he said. The elephant, which has been floating over Wiltshire and Kent, will tour up to October 4, when the current public consultation on Thorp ends.</p>

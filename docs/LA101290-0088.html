			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANNERS VOTE TO LIMIT LANDFILL'S EXPANSION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Planning Commission on Thursday sent its final  recommendation on Sunshine Canyon Landfill expansion plans to the Board of  Supervisors, which will make the final decisions in late November or December.  </P> <P> The commission voted 3 to 0 to allow dump owners, Browning-Ferris Industries,  to expand the landfill capacity by 17 million tons, rather than the 70 million  tons the company requested.  </P> <P> The commission did not close the door on later expansions but recommended that  additional capacity increases require a new round of county approvals.  </P> <P> Thursday's vote finalized a tentative commission decision that was made on  Sept. 27.  </P> <P> In addition to the reduced dumping capacity, the commission approved the  removal of about 4,000 oak trees in the canyon, which would be eliminated from  county maps as an ecologically sensitive area.  </P> <P> Dump opponents are expected to appeal the recommendation to the Board of  Supervisors and ask members to deny Browning-Ferris any permit to expand. BFI  officials will ask the board to grant them the full-expansion permit.  </P> <P> County planners said the board will further review the proposal and hear more  testimony from opposing sides before their final vote.  </P></p>

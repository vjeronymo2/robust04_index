			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament April 25 SAPA -- Bombers were stupid and  spineless if they believed they could stop the elections, the  minister of foreign affairs, Mr Pik Botha, said on Monday [25  April].    Speaking in debate on constitutional amendments, he said  those responsible for recent explosions would not halt the  elections. "We will not allow ourselves to be scared off. I  appeal to all South Africans to take part in the elections with  even greater dedication and determination."    Earlier, Mr Roger Burrows (DP [Democratic Party] Pinetown)  said the DP utterly condemned the bombings and the bombers  responsbile for blasts in Johannesburg on Sunday, and in  Germiston and Randfontein on Monday. "The people of South  Africa must go to the polls with the firm belief it is democracy  they are going to achieve."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime </F> minister and foreign minister, by Zagreb Television  correspondent; Granic in Rome -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] We have Mate Granic, Croatian deputy  prime minister and foreign minister, on the phone line from  Rome. Good evening, Mr Granic.    [Granic] Good evening.    [Correspondent] Thank you for granting us this interview, I  know that you are very busy. First of all, could you tell me  what is Italy's stand on sanctions against Croatia?    [Granic] Italy is concerned about the news on the presence  of  Croatian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it was also with  great understanding that they accepted my explanations that  these are only volunteers, and only up to 2,000 of them, and  that there is a much larger number of volunteers from Islamic  countries than Croatian volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Also,  I explained that Croatia had no intention of initiating a  military intervention, and that it suggested that all  Bosnia-Herzegovina borders be supervised.    [Correspondent] Alright. You had this to say about the  presence of volunteers. You therefore stick to your statement  that there are up to 2,000 volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Can you comment on Butros Ghali's letter to the Security  Council this evening in which he states that there are 3,000 to  5,000 soldiers of the regular Croatian Army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Granic] They call the volunteers: elements of the Croatian  forces -- and that is the only difference. Concerning the  figure of 3,000 to 5,000, they have received it from various  sources, although not everyone agrees with these figures,  including NATO.    [Correspondent] In addition to the sanctions, did you  discuss  with [Italian Foreign Minister] Mr. Andreatta what could happen  at the EU meeting in Brussels on 7 and 8 February? Was there  any talk of a new plan by the three members [of the EU]?    [Granic] The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will certainly  be discussed at the meeting, but no discussion about sanctions  has been envisaged. Likewise, a presidential communique is  expected in the Security Council as well as a certain warning to  Croatia, but no proposal of sanctions. Concerning the EU and  the discussion they will have, an offer is expected from the EU  for more efforts to be invested in organizing a meeting between  the Croatian and Muslim sides, and an offer that representatives  of the three important EU countries -- Great Britain, France,  and Germany -- in addition to the United States, will be present  at the meeting.    [Correspondent] However, it must be admitted that it is  unlikely that any progress in that respect will be made, seeing  that [Bosnian Foreign Minister] Mr. Ljubijankic's statement was  made public this morning, and he is still insisting on the  sanctions.    [Granic] You see, Mr. Ljubijankic is usually the one who  voices the toughest statements of the Bosnian leadership. We  believe, and we have had confirmation that there will be a  meeting between the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim sides early next  week.    [Correspondent] Talking about the improvement in relations  between Muslims and Croats, will you perhaps mention some facts  from the field. Namely, it is well known that Croats and  Muslims are still fighting the Serbs together in some parts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example in Usora and Posavina.    [Granic] The basic aim of Croatia's policy is to stop all  clashes between Croats and Muslims, without any preconditions,  and also to establish a permanent peace, and not only peace, but  also permanent cooperation, because that is in the strategic  interest of both Croat and Muslim nations.    [Correspondent] OK. Thank you for now. Tell us just at the  end what is awaiting you in Rome tomorrow.    [Granic] Tomorrow, I will have a meeting, that is, a  reception with the Holy Father, and then with the state  secretary, Cardinal Sodano, and the Vatican foreign minister,  (Torano).    [Correspondent] Mr. Granic, thank you, and I wish you a  successful day tomorrow.    [Granic] Thank you very much.</p>

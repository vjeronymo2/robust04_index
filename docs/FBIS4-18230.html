			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Juergen Leinemann: "`Afterwards, You're </F> Bismarck'"]    [Text] When he comes, he usually is not seen. Then a  folding door opens somewhere in the background of the hall, and  in comes a group of tall gentlemen. With wary looks and strained  movements, they shield a dynamic empty space in their midst,  into which a respectful crowd, now standing, tries to stare from  above: therein he--Wolfgang Schaeuble, 51--rolls toward his  stage.    He smiles while he vigorously propels his vehicle forward.  Immediately--recently in Wolfenbuettel just as everywhere  else--an emotionally charged local matador of the Union will  greet him as a man "who has done his duty for our German  fatherland to the limits of human capacity."    Now many eyes are moist. A cool Schaeuble attentively  observes the reactions. Only his right middle finger twitches  rhythmically on his hands folded in front on his chin.    Must he not see himself as a "hero"? That is what Wolfgang  Schaeuble asks Wolfgang Schaeuble in the friendly seclusion of  his parliamentary group office in Bonn. Of course not; who is he  after all? The "chief" has gained enough distance to laugh at  himself. On the other hand, "I do not suffer from excessive  modesty either." And as though he wanted to prove that, the  ambitious man from Baden suddenly mentions the name of Bismarck  in his subdued comtemplation of himself and his political role.    Since he cannot have meant that as he only could have meant  it, he tries to touch it up: "One cannot want to be Bismarck,"  he says hastily. Then, for an interval of silence, the gaze of  the man who is so proud of the unification that he negotiated is  reflected inward. "Only afterwards are you Bismarck," he nods.    It was not just a painful subject that Wolfgang Schaeuble  had  stumbled into but an uncomfortable one as well. After all, he  would first have to become chancellor if the comparison is to  make any sense. But the "crown prince" of the incumbent does not  want to talk about that in the 1994 election year. He certainly  knows that the "rascals" in the press and opposition are just  waiting to put him up against Helmut Kohl.    But that attempt does not work with Schaeuble and "for  heaven's sake" it must not be successful. They should all go  ahead and make fun of him as the chancellor's "paladin" or  "puppet." "We have no need for debate and are not interested."    Party friends believe that it is quite possible that  sometime  in the last year Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is always aiming for  success and measurable results, has toyed with the idea of an  early replacement of Helmut Kohl. In the coming series of  elections, however, he will give his full support to Helmut Kohl  without, of course, backing away from his own ambitions.    The chief of the parliamentary group has accepted the fact  that he can come to the chancellorship only through Helmut Kohl  and not against him. So in the past days he has been making  himself scarce in Bonn--although he finds the election losses of  the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] bearable in the scope of  the relative situation--so that he will not have to talk about  the chancellor's uncertain future. This week, however, he is all  the more present: in Washington. Chancellor candidate Schaeuble  is presenting himself on a goodwill tour just as Rudolf  Scharping, chief of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany], will do in three weeks.    A Bismarck in a wheelchair? American experts on Germany such  as the historian and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,  remembering their lame President Franklin D. Roosevelt, will  certainly be less offended by his physical handicap than by his  Bismarck-attitude.    Is it not true that of late Schaeuble has been awakening a  lot of memories of the clanking mixture of national braggadocio  and feverish promoterism with which the Germans triumphed  internationally after Bismarck founded the empire? "We Germans,"  "our nation," "our German fatherland," the "protective community  of fate Germany," their soul, their set of values, and their  code of duties--who in the last decades would have dared to be  as provocative in Bonn with strong words of German nationalism  as the slight man from the Black Forest?    Wolfgang Schaeuble finds the charge that he has changed from  a pragmatic political manager into a nationalistic ideologue  "very amusing." And is he not really more of a chatty speaker  than an emotional declarative orator ? "There is nothing at all  martial or theatrical about me."    When Schaeuble wants to use such self-descriptions to deny  similarities with Franz Josef Strauss, one cannot contradict  him. But not just Hans-Ulrich Klose, the chief of the  parliamentary group of the SPD, knows that the SPD delegates in  the Bundestag react to him downright "allergically  aggressively." Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that too. And that is  exactly the way he wants it.    At the same time, the cool negotiation talents of the jurist  Schaeuble are still undisputed even today. Even in politically  explosive negotiations such as on the asylum law or nursing care  insurance, compromise-manager Schaeuble is impressive through  his nimbleness and competence. He relaxes the atmosphere with  irony and sportsmanship and one can count on his agreements,  laud social democrats and liberals.    Schaeuble had long since gained a solid reputation in this  area in Bonn when he was abruptly and brutally pushed into the  lamplight of the broad public. First the sudden unification and  then the assassination attempt turned the managing helper, who  was pulling the strings for Kohl behind the scenes, into a  responsible leader. Unhappily since then he has been obsessed  with the idea of wanting to improve the political and  atmospheric state of the lurching republic.    "Politics is always a matter of balance between individual  freedom and a relationship with the community," he lectures from  behind his desk in Bonn, a portrait of Konrad Adenauer to his  side. "The trend is now tending more toward an unraveling and  splitting of the community." And as he learned in his youth in  the cold-war state of the "old man," he is insisting on the  melding force of enemy images.    "Only in conflict does it become clear what one stands for  or  against." That is Wolfgang Schaeuble's conviction. Thus, for  example, he stands for Berlin and adds something to that: "It is  a matter of Germany." And then he waits to see who howls. That  will be the enemy against whom the people must unite.    Is that really the "conservative revolution" that  Schaeuble's  leftist party friend Warnfried Dettling sees coming as Helmut  Kohl's legacy? Will this "turn back the clocks of modernity in  Germany," as the sociologist Ulrich Beck fears? Is Wolfgang  Schaeuble thereby initiating the downfall of the Union as a  people's party?    Actually the chief of the parliamentary group has entered  into a "very fruitful and sensible division of labor" with the  chancellor, which is happening without any need to talk a lot  about it. The game is called: We against them. "Freedom instead  of socialism" was the classical agitation formula, which since  the disintegration of Moscow's camp does not serve so well to  mobilize fears, however.    So "we"--that is, as Helmut Kohl likes to say, "all Germans  of goodwill"--need other emotional signals of community to be  forearmed against "the others." "History," "the nation," and  "the fatherland" must be reflected in suitable symbols.    This may not be difficult for Helmut Kohl, the emotional  stager of Verdun and Bitburg. The chancellor, who knows very  well how to condense politics from the fund of this own  sentimentalities into kitschy highpoints, has a rather  dependable feel for the radiant energy of symbols.    But Schaeuable, the cold man of the intellect who sees  emotions only as an exploitable weakness of his fellow man "that  must not be left to the enemy," was completely unable to pull  off such productions. Even his own people are disturbed by the  strange mixture of national pomposity and academic lecturing  with which the chief of their group in the Bonn parliament  attacks the veiling action of the artist Christo in that he  stylizes the unfortunate Berlin Reichstag into the "most  symbolic and significant political building in Germany."    It has been clear since this speech that Wolfgang Schaeuble  is incapable of establishing a following. To be sure, he manages  his own parliamentary group with sharp and bitter parsimony and  is always well prepared but generally curt. His associates find  him rude and arrogant. Words like "rubbish" and "nonsense" are  quick to come across his lips. His delegates live in the fear  that "as soon as someone babbles something without thinking, it  will quickly become icy."    When the Union leader is nevertheless able to produce a "we"  feeling--as at the party congress of the CDU in 1993, for  example--it is the result of a calculated confrontation with  self-produced enemies. "Nothing is worse than peace with the  socialists," Union parliamentarians have quoted their chairman.  Polarization is the strategy that Schaeuble himself affirms with  obvious pleasure. "There must be conflict for it to be  interesting."    But the combative Schaeuble is also becoming dreadful for  many in his environs--and not just among his adversaries.  Concern and even fear are slipping into many respectful  statements about the lonesome politician, who is able to defend  himself so vehemently against the fate that befell him. A zone  of icy thin air seems to keep people at a distance as soon as  the chief of the parliamentary group comes to larger gatherings.    Is that just because of the wheelchair? Is it the security  zone around the especially intensively protected man that  frightens people away? Certainly. But above all there is around  Wolfgang Schaeuble an electrically charged atmosphere of  aggressiveness and controlled rage, which can be discharged at  any time in a way that can cut to the bone.    Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that. "Somehow I seem to be sharp,"  he admits not at all troubled. On the contrary, it almost seems  as though the fear that he provokes when he speaks, the  powerless agitation that his gibes produce in his opponents,  gives him a pleasurable sensation. The only thing that makes him  angry is the charge that the wheelchair has made him hard, for  which he will never forgive Jochen Vogel, the former chairman of  the parliamentary group of the SPD.    The fact is that the physically small but competitive and  athletic Wolfgang Schaeuble charged through the political world  in Bonn from the first day of his career like a taut bow. "One  had to expect arrows at any moment," says an opposition  politician who remembers the former parliamentary business  manager of the Union.    What may have been a sport then is now a vital struggle. The  man whose existence has been narrowed almost completely to  politics literally has no more latitude. For him it is always a  matter of everything or nothing. Everyone senses that and many  are frightened by it--especially since the content and maxims  that are behind all of Schaeuble's actions are rather arbitrary  within a vague conservative framework. "Just no mental blocks,"  he says.    Afterwards phases of insightful contemplation and frank  dealing with his own vulnerability and the wounds of others have  obviously appeared to Wolfgang Schaeuble to be weaknesses that  he cannot afford in the tough business of politics. When he  became chief of the Federal Chancellorship in 1984, minister  with a "special responsibility," he was "somehow terrified" by  the burden, he says. "I no longer get frightened. I am now  hardened."    This is supposed to sound casual and self-ironic. But the  steel core of his will to power shines through such jokes. His  public speeches are weapons that he uses with provocative  self-righteousness. Schaeublich always makes it clear--sometimes  with tremulous pathos and sometimes with quiet pungency--that he  thinks he has the whole truth. He is democracy. He is wisdom. He  is Germany.    Thus he increasingly turned his speeches in parliament into  a  series of verbal duels with the opposition and then he  complained sorrowfully about the many disruptions. He makes hard  statements with a soft voice. He stirs up in his listeners the  feelings that he does not permit himself to have.    The fact that he gets people stirred up makes Wolfgang  Schaeuble dangerous. The fear of his patriotic bombast seems  justified precisely because he is no devout German nationalist  but at most a conventional gentleman. "He is absolutely unaware  of the danger from the Right," believes one of his friends and  admirers.    Possibly, as he asserts, the CDU-politician really thinks  that in this way he can keep in check the rightist tendencies in  his own camp. Possibly he actually does want to move the Union  to the right to recapture the Republikaner. In any case, he has  faith in the restraining force of the will over collective  desires, fears, and feelings of hatred, which would be reckless  in any democracy. It is perilous in Germany.    But moodmaker Wolfgang Schaeuble has no antenna for this  explosiveness. If necessary, he is nonchalantly able to  reinterpret his popular campaign for patriotism into a purely  sportive affair. In a national match against France, does he as  a constitutional patriot cheer for the Germans? So it is.    Whenever Wolfgang Schaeuble is tempted to consider himself  rather marvelous--and that is not so infrequent--he remembers  the film with the late Don Camillo, who as a zealous earthly  warrior against communism had to be told by his Lord God: "Don't  take yourself so seriously."    Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that that is advisable not only for  reasons of humility but above all for tactical reasons, for vain  appearances of a chancellor rival would be the last thing that  the Union could use in its fight for the vanishing power on the  Rhine.    This was the only reason why Schaeuble, a celebrated hero at  the Berlin party congress, gave such a plain speech in Hamburg.  And he cannot say often enough that Helmut Kohl is federal  chancellor and will be once again. To emphasize that, he adds:  "Our good God will take care of the rest."    But the strange thing is that this statement of submission  sounds almost like a threat in the mouth of Schaeuble, whose  life has unmercifully suffered ups and downs in recent years.</p>

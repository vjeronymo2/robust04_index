			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Bastos Moreno] </F>   [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Former Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso has practically secured the support of the main  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] dissidents for his  presidential candidacy. In a secret political negotiation, in  which President Itamar Franco himself participated, Cardoso  obtained the support of the so-called Rio Grande do Sul group,  which is led by Senator Pedro Simon. This group is against the  alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and  the PFL [Liberal Front Party].    Cardoso also obtained a promise from ex-President Jose  Sarney  to support his candidacy as soon as the internal PMDB elections  reveal stronger support for ex-Governor Orestes Quercia. Recife  Mayor Jarbas Vasconcellos and some PMDB candidates to state  governorships will work for Cardoso's candidacy after the PMDB  internal elections. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft plans call for further DM600m A capital restructuring package, including a call on shareholders for a further DM600m (Dollars 387m) and a two-to-one capital reduction, is being prepared for presentation at Metallgesellschaft's annual meeting next March. Describing the scheme as 'only a concept', Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman of the battered German metals and engineering group, said yesterday the aim would be to offer shares in the capital increase at a substantial discount to the market rate. Shares in this year's DM1.4bn rights issue, part of a DM3.4bn rescue arranged by bank shareholders, were priced well above the market at DM250. The stock was suspended yesterday pending the announcement, after closing at DM143 on Tuesday. Despite the lack of detail, the fact that plans for a capital write-down have been announced suggests German creditor banks, which tightly control the company, have already agreed in principle. A restructuring of the group's capital base has long been expected. It is viewed as the logical consequence of the operational shake-out which has led to the sale and closure of many subsidiaries. The assets sale instituted last December has generated more than DM4bn, and 90 subsidiaries have been disposed of or deconsolidated. Mr Neukirchen said yesterday the sell-off was virtually complete, apart from the planned disposal of the Lentjes plant and pipeline activities. He repeated earlier forecasts of operating earnings exceeding DM100m in the year to the end of September 1995. Mr Neukirchen also expanded on 1993-94 figures published last week which showed a net loss of DM2.7bn on sales of DM20bn, compared with a with a deficit of DM1.97bn on DM26bn turnover. Trading and services divisions earned DM38m pre-tax on sales up DM1bn at DM8.7bn, after losing DM33m last time. Plant construction under the Lurgi group fell into a loss of DM35m, but only after setting aside DM110m for redundancies and early retirements. Dynamit Nobel has bought two more chemical concerns from its parent company Metallgesellschaft, concentrating all of the latter's chemicals activities under one roof, Reuter adds. The two subsidiaries Dynamit Nobel purchased are Sachtleben Chemie of Duisburg-Homberg, and the Chemson Group, with factories in Austria and the UK.</p>

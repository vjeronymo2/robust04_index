			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Heinler: `Lobbying Has Paid Off'"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- Austrian nuclear expert Manfred Heindler,  who returned to Vienna on Saturday [5 March] after leading the  Austrian anti-Temelin delegation to Washington with OECD  Ambassador Peter Jankowitsch, is convinced that the delegation's  activities "have fallen on fertile soil" in the United States.  Heindler expressed the conviction "that the Eximbank cannot  afford in any case to make a positive decision soon without --  and I believe that the facts speak in our favor -- a lot of  persuasion in Congress."    Heindler does not want to predict whether the U.S. loan  guarantee for the completion of the Czech nuclear power plant  can be prevented in the end. However, he is certain that, after  the Temelin case, there will not be any "repetition" regarding  the financing of the refurbishing of old Soviet reactors.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Observer: Citizen Spiers joins up At last the UK Citizen's Charter panel recruits someone with experience at the sharp end. John Spiers has joined in order to focus the panel's mind on standards in the National Health Service. Spiers also happens to be chairman of the Brighton Health Care Trust, which achieved notoriety in April for its novel approach to reducing hospital waiting lists - refusing physiotherapy to chronically sick patients aged over 65. A copy of a letter outlining the policy found its way into the hands of the BBC. Quick as a flash, Spiers denied that the policy involved 'discrimination' but was simply 'targeting' resources, thus demonstrating the sort of PR skills now required of the new breed of NHS managers. Targeting is no doubt a firm fixture in the NHS lexicon of useful jargon. Still, Spiers did partially redeem himself, by exposing the rotten conditions in his trust's hospitals. Arriving in a wheelchair at the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton, Spiers posed as a patient needing assistance. A series of inexcusable mishaps culminated in an exchange with a surly porter who was not wearing a name badge. When Spiers pointed out that name badges were obligatory under the Patient's Charter, the porter told him to 'f*** off'. Which apparently is not in the said lexicon.</p>

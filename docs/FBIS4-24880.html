			<p>BFN     [Text] Valletta, Malta, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Maltese Prime  Minister Edward Fenech Adami said that he will seek an approach  to even better Maltese-Chinese relations during his upcoming  visit to China on June 6-11.    In an interview with XINHUA NEWS AGENCY on the eve of his  visit, the prime minister also recalled his first visit to China  in 1978. "Even when I came to China as an opposition leader, I  realized the importance of promoting our bilateral relations."    The coming visit will give him the opportunity to exchange  views on bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Chinese  leaders, Adami added.    The Prime Minister pointed out that great potential exists  for the two countries to further strengthen their economic  cooperation.    Commenting on Malta's domestic economic policy, Adami said  the national economic structure is undergoing readjustment and  transformation, and that government efforts to encourage private  enterprise and liberal trade have produced fine results.    Despite wide-spread recession in Western Europe, the Maltese  economy has performed relatively well, with a low unemployment  rate of four percent and steady development in tourism and the  electronics industry, the prime minister said.    At the moment, Malta is seeking European Union membership  which, he underlined, will have great political and economic  significance for his country.    On the Mediterranean situation, the Maltese official  suggested that the Mediterranean nations should strengthen their  ties and set up a permanent organization to facilitate  cooperation and dialogue.    He also acknowledged some potentially dangerous situations  in  the region and warned against those negative factors that could  degenerate into conflict.    Adami hailed the peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue  as very positive, and expressed the hope that the  Palestinian-Israeli accord will produce good results.</p>

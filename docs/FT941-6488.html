			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Deals struck on east German coal and power Germany's three largest energy utilities yesterday announced agreement to take over the lion's share of east Germany's power generating and coal mining industries, in two deals valued at more than DM10bn (Dollars 5.6bn). The deals are the climax of two years of often bitter and complex negotiations with the Treuhand privatisation agency and the German government. The big three - Essen-based RWE, PreussenElektra, owned by Veba, and Munich-based Bayernwerk - will jointly own 75 per cent of Veag, the main east German electricity company, with the remaining 25 per cent going to five smaller western utilities. The purchase price is around DM8bn. The takeover of the giant Lausitz brown coal fields (Laubag), for a price of DM2.1bn, will involve the shareholders in a further investment of DM6bn over the next 20 years, according to Mr Friedhelm Gieske, RWE's chief executive. The Rheinbraun subsidiary of RWE will be the 51 per cent majority shareholder in Laubag, with PreussenElektra taking 30 per cent, and Bayernwerk 15 per cent. RWE Energie will hold the balance. The deals were announced in Bonn after a meeting of government and industry leaders chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They represent the final step in privatising the entire east German energy industry. Last year, the Treuhand agreed the sale of the other main brown coal mining operation, Mibrag, to an Anglo-American consortium involving Britain's PowerGen, NRG Energy of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho. The whole process was delayed by legal challenges from east German local authorities, who sought to control a larger share of the lucrative power generation industry themselves. The states of Saxony and Brandenburg are still seeking a bigger say in the operations. Veag supplies some 70 per cent of east German electricity, primarily from brown coal-fired power stations. It had a turnover of DM6.4bn in 1992, and made profits of just DM7.5m. Since 1990, its workforce has been halved to around 14,500. Mr Gieske confirmed the planned investment of DM6bn in Veag over the next 20 years, to provide an eventual capacity of 7,200MW. He said that the five Laubag opencast mines would be modernised and kept in operation and five closed. The total workforce of 12,000 would be reduced to 8,000 by the year 2000. The mines would eventually produce 50-55m tonnes of coal, compared with current capacity of some 75m tonnes. Contracts for the two deals are to be signed by the middle of the year, according to yesterday's announcement. Then the utilities will have to make a downpayment on the DM2.1bn purchase price for Laubag, followed by further payments in the course of operation. Payments for Veag will also be spread over 20 years.</p>

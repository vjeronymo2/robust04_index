Disputing that interpretation made by exiled communist  leader  Jose Ma. Sison, Dee, head of the government panel negotiating  with leftist rebels, said, "We merely stated that given our  objective to attain peace everywhere in the country, and the  reality of the serious rift within the CPP/NPA/NDF [Communist  Party of the Philippines/New People's Army/National Democratic  Front], then peace talks with Messrs. Sison and (Luis) Jalandoni  alone would no longer be adequate."    Although implying that the government would be willing to  talk with groups that broke away from the CPP, Dee yesterday  reiterated that such groups must first stop their terroristic  activities.    "We categorically state that the GRP [Government of the  Republic of the Philippines] Peace Panel had no intention of  entering into peace talks with any group, including the Alex  Boncayao Brigade [ABB], under threat of violence and coercion."

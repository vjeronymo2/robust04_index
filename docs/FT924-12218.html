			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Machinery directive set to be dropped A CONTROVERSIAL EC proposal which the UK believes would probably kill trade in used machinery looks likely to be quietly dropped after strong opposition by a majority of EC countries. The Directive on Used Machinery - now in its third draft - is intended to apply much the same safety requirements to second-hand machinery as new equipment will face under the 1989 Machinery Directive. At a meeting in Brussels in June, seven member states objected to the draft in principle, and only Spain and Italy supported it. Mr Edward Leigh, UK trade and technology minister, yesterday said 'the latest indications are that it will be dropped altogether.' The European Commission is expected to make an announcement soon.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Secret talks reopened on Bosnia THE governments of Serbia and Croatia have revived secret negotiations aimed at dividing up the ethnically-mixed republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Bosnian officials said yesterday. They warned that any such attempt would lead to terrible bloodshed. Mr Haric Silajcic, Bosnia-Hercegovina's foreign minister, said Mr Nikolai Koljevic, a prominent member of Bosnia's Serbian Democratic Party, had held informal talks with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in Zagreb on Tuesday. 'The two extreme wings of Croats and Serbs in Bosnia, which are supported by Mr Tudjman and Mr Slobodan Milosevic (Serbia's president) respectively, are trying to carve up our republic,' explained Mr Silajcic. Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, Bosnia's deputy prime minister, said Mr Tudjman wanted to revive the districts of 1939 when Croatia included parts of western Hercegovina. Croatian academics believe Mr Tudjman wants to bring Croats together in one independent state, as Mr Milosevic wants to do with the Serbs. Any agreed break-up between Zagreb and Belgrade would give Serbia the opportunity to link the self-proclaimed Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina, in south-western Croatia, with Serbia by driving a wedge across north-western Bosnia. Both ministers said the negotiations, first started between the two presidents in March 1991, had been revived to try to shore up the flagging support of the Croat and Serb presidents. Nationalists on both sides have become disillusioned because Serbia has failed to quash Croatia's independence bid, while a third of Croatia's territory is still under the control of Serb militants and the army. Bosnia-Hercegovina's 4.3m population is divided between Moslems (44 per cent), Serbs (33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent). The militant Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, a Milosevic ally, could rely on the army in the event of a forcible break-up of the republic. The army, which has put more soldiers into Bosnia-Hercegovina as it partially withdraws from neighbouring Croatia, is under the control of General Vladimir Vukovic, a Serb nationalist closely connected with General Blagoje Adzic, the new defence minister, and Mr Milosevic. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the republic's president, flew yesterday to Paris with Mr Silajcic for urgent talks with President Francois Mitterrand on Bosnia's internal problems. Before leaving, he said: 'Some of our politicians are so short-sighted that they cannot see that nobody can partition the republic and not even a single village can be taken from it.' However, Mr Stjepan Kljuic, the moderate head of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic Union party, the sister party of Mr Tudjman's party in Croatia, is losing ground to Mr Marte Boban, the Croat nationalist leader in western Hercegovina. On the other side, prominent Croat intellectuals from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital and opposition parties in Croatia and Serbia have protested against any attempt to carve up the republic.</p>

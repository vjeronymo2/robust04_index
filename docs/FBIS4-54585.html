			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader held  talks in Zagreb this evening with British Foreign Office  Minister Douglas Hogg.    [Begin recording] [Hogg, in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] The Contact Group, to which I  belong, is working out the details of bringing about a  cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The basis for this is a signed  agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina. When this issue is resolved the  Contact Group will address the problems of the so-called Krajina.    We discussed the implementation of the Washington agreement  today and concrete problems related to Krajina. The most  difficult problem is the lack of negotiation, and how to make  the parties communicate. Once they have begun talking results  will be achieved, but -- I stress again -- the problem is that  there is no dialogue.    [Sanader] We discussed the current situation in Croatia,  regarding the UN Protected Areas and the steps that need to be  taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I think that this was a very  useful exchange of views. Minister Hogg presented some of his  views -- he is to visit Sarajevo and Belgrade. I think this was  a very useful exchange of information. We will probably meet  again after his visits to Sarajevo and Belgrade, and President  Tudjman will probably receive him. We have decided we must not  stop now, but rather we must resume playing an active role as  regards the final resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and, of course, in Croatia.    [Reporter] More precisely -- what did you discuss regarding  the UN Protected Areas? Did you mention any steps which would  lead to some improvements?    [Sanader] The minister was interested in our view on the  current situation and I presented it to him. [end recording]</p>

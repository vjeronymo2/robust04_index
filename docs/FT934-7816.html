			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe's Dollars 21m expansion BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group, has strengthened its environmental monitoring instrument operations with the acquisition of Colorado-based Lear Siegler Measurement Controls for Dollars 21m (Pounds 14m) cash. The instruments manufactured by the company are mainly used to measure dispersed gaseous pollutants outdoors and the opacity of emissions from industrial chimneys. Commenting on the acquisition, Mr John Westhead, Bowthorpe's chief executive, said: 'This business will fit extremely well into Bowthorpe's data acquisition and environmental sector.' Bowthorpe's data acquisition and environmental operations already comprises six companies which bring together US and UK-based expertise in electronic data gathering and monitoring for environmental, advanced research and aerospace applications. Lear Siegler Measurement Controls, which is based in Englewood, Colorado, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lear Siegler and is a leading designer and manufacturer of gaseous pollutant monitoring instruments and integrated systems. The net assets being acquired by Bowthorpe were valued at Dollars 4.5m at the end of June. For the year to June 30, Lear Siegler reported a loss of Dollars 300,000 on turnover of about Dollars 30m. The business is now trading profitably. Under Bowthorpe the business will operate as Monitor Labs, but will continue to be run by its current management.</p>

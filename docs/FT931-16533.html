			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Laporte/Evode For students of the takeover game, the tussle for Evode is turning into a minor classic. After quietly stalking its prey for seven years, Laporte slickly pitched in yesterday with a tentative promise of a recommended bid. It promptly demonstrated its resolve by buying 6.1 per cent of Evode's shares in the market at Pounds 1 apiece. In so doing, it seemingly scuppered the chances for Wassall, which had just declared a revised final offer of 95p a share. Such an agile operator must have been greatly galled to be so comprehensively outmanoeuvred. Laporte's shareholders will certainly admire the timing. Whether they so appreciate the move's financial sense is a different matter. Much will depend on the structuring of any deal. With year-end borrowings of around Pounds 120m and gearing of 45 per cent, Laporte will be strapped to offer much cash. A rights issue or a share swap with a partial cash alternative seems the most likely approach. Laporte has stipulated that any offer will have to enhance earnings in its first year. This leaves little room for error, assuming a fair premium will be necessary for a mainly paper bid. Laporte may have a stiff task convincing investors of the speed of the rationalisation benefits. That still leaves room for complications which might induce Laporte to walk away, leaving Wassall with a clear run. Wassall will probably refrain from entering a bidding battle. Evode's shareholders must be left smiling - if not silently wondering why their hitherto unfashionable company has suddenly become the object of such desire.</p>

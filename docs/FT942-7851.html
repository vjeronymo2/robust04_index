			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Safeguards urged for right to silence Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, last night called for improved safeguards for defendants whose refusal to respond to police questioning is pointed out to the jury at their subsequent trial. He urged the government to give further thought to the provisions in the criminal justice and public order bill allowing inferences to be drawn from a defendant exercising the right to silence. The government secured a majority of 62 (176-114) in favour of the clause in the bill authorising the introduction of the new procedures. Lord Taylor said the clause was too widely drawn. He said additional safeguards should embody suggestions by Viscount Runciman, the crossbench peer, who headed the royal commission whose majority recommendations opposed change in the existing law on right to silence.</p>

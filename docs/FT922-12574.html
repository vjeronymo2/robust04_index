			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Poker game ahead of Earth Summit: Negotiators preparing for Rio are caught up in a tense game NEGOTIATORS charged with drafting a convention to combat global warming in time for approval at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, are to meet again in two weeks, in a last-ditch effort to resolve differences among the 140 countries involved. A gathering of the International Negotiating Committee (INC) in New York from April 30 to May 8 will follow five preparatory conferences over the past year, all of which ended in deadlock. As late as last February, the committee was able to produce only the sketchiest of outlines, and even then nearly every page was a forest of square brackets denoting sections where representatives were in dispute. 'It has become a big poker game,' says Ms Fiona Weir, campaigner for atmosphere protection at Friends of the Earth, the British-based international environment organisation. 'They are all staring into each others' eyes to see who will blink first.' Friends of the Earth and other international 'green' organisations are calling on governments to convene an emergency meeting of their environment ministers to save the negotiations. At the centre of the dispute is the refusal of the US to set a national target for emissions of carbon dioxide, the most potent of the gases responsible for global warming. Mr Robert Reinstein, head of the US delegation, insists each country should draw up an action plan to reduce emissions of global-warming gases 'as best it can', taking into account its own particular circumstances. Moreover, the US would continue to oppose rigid, quantitative targets and timetables, whether for carbon dioxide or for other gases such as methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The US administration believes stabilisation by 2000 would damage its economy, which depends on the fossil fuels that create carbon dioxide. This policy angers Third World countries, which see it as a determination by the US to continue its 'gas guzzling' habits. They point to a study by US economists which says carbon emissions could be cut by 35 per cent with little or no cost to the US economy. Developing countries led by the Group of 77 Third World countries, plus China, see no reason to commit themselves to a global plan unless the US and other industrialised countries give a lead. They argue that, since the industrialised countries produce three-quarters of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, they should bear the main responsibility for cleaning it up. The intergovernmental panel of scientists established to investigate climate change says that, unless action is taken now, global temperatures could rise 1 degree Celsius by 2025, with bigger increases later in the century. This would cause rises in sea levels and wide flooding; the warmer climate could upset world agricultural production. Meanwhile, the INC has not even been able to endorse these warnings in its draft preamble. While some representatives argue that there will be 'serious social, economic and environmental consequences', others want no mention of 'serious' and reference only to 'potential' climate change. European Community members want all developed countries to adopt the EC target of stabilising carbon dioxide by 2000 as the basis for an agreement, but some countries, notably oil-producers, join the US in wanting a pledge that stabilisation will only be achieved 'as soon as feasible'. Britain, having already had one compromise plan rejected, is now pressing another, a 'phased progressive approach': targets would be set for stabilising carbon dioxide by 2000 and methane at another fixed date, with other gases to be included in the programme later. A review process would put 'peer pressure' on countries which were not complying. However, this too is meeting resistence from developing countries, which are suspicious that the review might be be an encroachment on their autonomy. Differences also abound over assistance for developing countries. They want compensation from industrialised countries, including a new fund to meet the 'full and incremental environmental costs' of implementing any convention. The US, Britain and other countries within the Organisation of Economic Co-operation of Development object to the notion of 'compensation' for environmental damage. They say that any money should be channelled through the existing Global Environment Facility, which is administered by the World Bank. Another vexing problem concerns the transfer of technology to enable Third World countries to grapple with pollution problems as their industry expands. They insist they should have preferential non-commercial access to technology transfer and the use of patents which have been developed in the west. Industrialised countries say that, while they are prepared to develop a co-operative mechanism to facilitate the flow of technology, it must be on a commercial basis. The INC was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with completing an effective framework convention to combat climate change with 'appropriate commitments' in time for the summit's opening on June 1. But, as Mr Tariq Osman Hyder of Pakistan told the last INC meeting, 'the prognosis for a successful conclusion in time for Rio cannot be optimistic.'</p>

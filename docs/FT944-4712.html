			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Whips seek last-minute support for VAT vote Senior ministers and government whips were frantically trying to rally support for increasing value-added tax on heating fuel last night, battling growing unrest among Tory backbenchers. Amid rising fears in Downing Street that Labour would succeed in forcing the withdrawal of the planned increase, Mr John Major flew home early from the European security conference in Budapest to direct the government's fightback. Mr Major saw Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, immediately on his return to plan the government's approach to a crucial Commons vote said by Tory whips to be 'on a knife edge'. At least four Tory backbenchers were threatening to vote with Labour, reducing the government's notional majority to six, including the nine Conservatives who lost the whip after last week's rebellion on UK contributions to the EU. Up to eight Tories were threatening to abstain - more than enough to defeat the government in the absence of assistance from the 10 Ulster unionists, who were planning to vote with Labour. Mr Clarke and Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, spent most of yesterday afternoon in meetings with rebellious backbenchers demanding the withdrawal of the increase. Mr Clarke, who discussed the crisis with Mr Major on Monday night, even telephoned Mr Geoffrey Dickens, a seriously ill Conservative backbencher, to gauge his support. There were signs that the government pressure was making headway, but the chancellor faced demands from some backbenchers for more compensation for pensioners and the low paid. Even government loyalists were grumbling about the government's refusal to drop the second phase of VAT on heating fuel, which will raise the tax from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. One backbench MP, normally a supporter of Mr Major, said the issue had been handled with 'all the guile of a newt'. Another said it was 'a bit of a mess'. However, few were willing to go as far as Sir George Gardiner, the rightwing MP for Reigate, who said in an article in The Times that the cabinet had brought the Conservative party 'to the brink of disaster'. Downing Street officials said the prime minister stood by warnings from Mr Clarke that the government would have to raise other taxes if Conservative rebels succeeded in forcing the withdrawal of the VAT increase. The second tranche would raise about Pounds 1.5bn a year, on top of about Pounds 1.4bn from the first increase to 8 per cent last April. Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of the Commons, accused Labour of lacking an alternative to raising VAT. He said Labour plans to close tax loopholes and tax the windfall profits of utilities were 'an irresponsible cop out'.</p>

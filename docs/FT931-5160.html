			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Rome warns against steel subsidy curbs MR Karel van Miert, EC competition commissioner, wants to outlaw L650bn (Pounds 285.6m) of state subsidies to Ilva, Italy's loss-making state steel company. But some of his colleagues fear such an action could provoke a political backlash from the Italian authorities and threaten EC plans to support the ailing west European steel industry. Senior aides to the 17 commissioners will today discuss whether Mr Van Miert's proposals should be tabled at tomorrow's full meeting of the European Commission. At a special council of EC industry ministers 10 days ago Mr Giuseppe Guarino of Italy said Rome would oppose the Community-wide steel plan if the Commission did not back Ilva's L650bn recapitalisation. An Italian diplomat warned last week that outlawing the aid package 'could detonate a bigger problem'. Some Commission officials have serious doubts about the timing of the commissioner's move. 'I don't think (the proposal) will fly. It will be postponed, because now there's an agreement in council and everything has to be treated globally,' one said. But Mr Van Miert, who has made clear that EC state aid rules will not be relaxed for the steel industry, seems determined to call the bluff of the Italian authorities. He wants Rome to recover L350bn already paid to the loss-making steelmaker in the form of a capital increase, and freeze plans to pay a second tranche of L300bn. Italy has written to the commissioner urging him to delay a decision on the subsidies until the Italian authorities have prepared a new restructuring plan. This scheme, which Ilva says will be submitted by the end of next month, will take into account the first impressions of Mr Hayao Nakamura, the group's new Japanese managing director. Mr Van Miert wants to discourage a damaging race by EC governments to subsidise their national industries. He believes Brussels should also renew pressure on the Spanish government, which is seeking approval for a controversial aid package for its steel industry. So far he has not submitted formal proposals on Spanish steel to avoid provoking Madrid. This is not the first time that Rome has tried to delay an EC decision on subsidies. Last July Mr Guarino wrote to Mr Van Miert's predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, urging him, unsuccessfully, not to start a formal investigation into the state aid programme. The Commission was incensed by Ilva's announcement of a L498bn loss in 1991, which cast doubt on an original plan's stated objective of floating Ilva's shares.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Enrique Santos Calderon: "The Echo of the </F> Ballot Boxes"]    [Text] A lot of abstention, yes, but what could be  expected, given the confusion, the lack of seriousness, the  absence of ideas, and the down-home populism that are proving to  be one of the most debatable legacies of the Constitution of  1991?    Moreover, it did not strike me as all that dramatic.  Historically, voter participation in Colombia has always left a  great deal to be desired. With a few extraordinary exceptions,  such as the plebiscite of 1957, most elections have had little  more than a 60-percent turnout. The abstention rate reached 70  percent in the elections for the Constituent Assembly in 1991.  After the congressional repeal, the elections to choose a new  one had a 65-percent abstention rate.    This is disturbing, no matter how you look at it. It would  be  better to see the voter turnouts of 80 and even 90 percent that  democracies such as Italy, Spain, and Costa Rica have. Not  because voting is mandatory--that is a disagreeable  requirement--but because they have greater political maturity  and democratic consciousness.    Indifference, cynicism, apathy, skepticism, ignorance,  rejection, or complacency--all these and more explain the  persistence of abstentionism in Colombia. And it is not  exclusive to us; in the United States, to choose an example not  too far away, voter turnout is hardly ever more than 50 percent.    It is significant, in any event, that with so much political  openness, so many new civil rights, the proliferation of  electoral lists, new groups, special districts for blacks and  Indians, etc., not only do people not flock to the polls, but  voter participation actually declines. This is something to  think about.    Furthermore, if blank ballots, the citizen's most explicit  and conscientious way of expressing his repudiation for  everything, are not given enough attention, people will feel  that this form of protest vote is not worth the trouble, either,  and will be discouraged from participating.    A central conclusion to be drawn from these legislative  elections is that there are no national leaders. Only 16  senators were elected by quotas, and the impressive battle for  the leftovers reflects an fragmented political scene in which  there is not a single figure with national appeal.    There are so many things to remark upon in these elections:  the return of longstanding but very weakened electoral barons,  such as Guerra Serna and Name Teran; the decline of others, such  as Gustavo Dajer, Salcedo Baldion, and Humberto Pelaez;  surprises such as that of Jimmy Chamorro, which confirm the  political consolidation of the Christian groups; phenomena such  as Poncho Renteria, whose 20,000-odd votes can be considered a  protest against the political class.    I was saddened by the disappearance of Galanism as a  parliamentary force and the absence of figures such as Maria  Cristina Ocampo, Juan Lozano, and Alfonso Valdivieso from  Congress. No leader has been able to fill that void (Gaviria is  another matter), and the petty bickering they got involved in  was the final blow to that liberal faction in Congress.    I was also disturbed by the defeat of the M-19 Democratic  Alliance (AD M-19). It was completely annihilated, losing all 12  seats. Figures such as Vera Grabe, Anibal Palacios, Bernardo  Gutierrez, and Eduardo Chaves will not be around anymore. We may  have disagreed with them, but they were an active presence and  represented voices of criticism and debate. The debacle of the  "M" confirms the limits of populism. But the parliamentary  disappearance of the left (with the exceptions of Cepeda of the  PC [Conservative Party] and Jorge Santos of the Revolutionary  Independent Worker Movement, MOIR) may send the wrong signal to  armed groups about the futility of the parliamentary, legal  struggle.    Some columnists, such as Francisco Santos, have expressed  the  opinion that the big winner in these elections was Andres  Pastrana, while Ernesto Samper lost out. This is a dubious  argument, apparently based on the fact that the conservatives  doubled their seats in the Senate--from 16 to 32--and in  particular on the fact that Samper got 1.5 million votes less  than Gaviria did in the Liberal Consultation of 1990.    It should be noted, however, that at that time of  indignation  and grief, people voted overwhelmingly against the dictatorship  of terror that the drug lords were trying to impose, and in  favor of the person who had been designated the successor of the  slain leader. When they feel that something important is at  stake--the survival of the system, for example--they go more  decisively to the polls.    The results of the legislative elections can be interpreted  in a number of ways, and everyone talks about the party  according to how it went for them. But now that the electoral  scene has been cleared of the confusion of lists and the  question of the vice presidencies has been resolved, it is time  for the home stretch in the race between Samper and Pastrana.    Samper made a big hit by naming Humberto De la Calle as his  running mate. He is the ideal vice president, given his training  and experience, his personal abilities, and his presidential  stature. The Samper-De la Calle ticket clears the way for the  Liberals and significantly strengthens Samper's presidential  chances in an election where every vote will count.    Pastrana's ticket, on the other hand, does not have a  comparable attraction. Not because Luis Fernando Ramirez is not  up to the job, but because he does not give Andres what De la  Calle gives Ernesto. The ticket looks very "kindergartenish."  Lacking a candidate of De la Calle's stature, one whom Pastrana  sought desperately, or a figure like Noemi Sanin, who prefers to  save herself for more dignified jobs, the Pastrana-Ramirez  ticket lacks that element of complementarity, that charismatic  attractiveness that wins votes, which the Samper-De la Calle  ticket does have.    Now, let the presidential campaign begin in earnest. Let us  see the debates and the clash of ideas between the presidential  and vice presidential aspirants. We have two months to find out  how they plan to govern us; to know what their specific  proposals are for peace, for the economy, and for the social  ills that plague Colombians; and above all, to compare them.</p>

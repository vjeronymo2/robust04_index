			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Giuseppe Sangiorgio; place and date not given: "League a  Mountain, Miglio a Pebble; Bossi: If Professor Wants To Leave  Us, He Is Free To Do So"]    [Text] Turin -- "Come, now. Let us not make too much of  this Miglio business. I still do not know what is going on, I  do not know what he wants to do. I heard that he is annoyed,  that he is this, that he is that... Let him decide. If he  wants to leave the League, he is free to do so."    [Sangiorgio] Mr. Bossi, the professor [Gianfranco Miglio]  has  announced that he will not vote for the government in the Senate  because he was rejected as institutional reforms minister. And  he says that you are the traitor. Does that charge not worry  you, either?    [Bossi] Nonsense; I have not betrayed anyone. Miglio's is an  idle argument, not a defense of federalism. And that says a  great deal about his anger. [Prime Minister] Berlusconi and  [National Alliance leader] Fini would never have granted him  that ministry. That is the truth of the matter.    [Sangiorgio] What if the government were to fail to gain a  vote of confidence, through Miglio's fault?    [Bossi] Come, now... Let us not exaggerate. We are short of  a majority in the Senate, but I am sure the government will  succeed nevertheless. Those people are not stupid. To hold  another election could be dangerous to the stability of the  country's democratic framework. People want governability. It  would be a huge mistake to hold another election. Everyone  knows that. You will see that when the time comes to vote in  the Senate many representatives of the forces that are attacking  us now will do the opposite of what they have said.    [Sangiorgio] So you think that, whatever happens, the  government will win the confidence vote and the League will lose  Miglio?    [Bossi] Well, personally, I will be sorry if Miglio leaves,  but from the strategic and political viewpoint it changes  nothing for the League. The League is a mountain, and if a rock  breaks away nobody will notice.    [Sangiorgio] What about the friendship, affection, and  gratitude that you owe Miglio?    [Bossi] Just a moment. I have already told you that I would  be sorry from a personal viewpoint, and that is all. My  relations with Gianfranco have always been clear and correct.  We probably speak no more than once every two months... Yes,  there is also some affection; I cannot deny it. I have always  liked children and old people.    [Sangiorgio] Miglio has always claimed to be your teacher,  to  have instilled the idea of federalism in you. Have you already  forgotten it all, Mr. Bossi?    [Bossi] What teacher? That really is not true. Miglio  joined the League in 1990, when we were already very strong; we  already had 15 regional council seats in Lombardy.    [Sangiorgio] Do you not think that you are being too harsh?    [Bossi] Look, if somebody makes all this trouble because he  is not granted a ministry, he is making a big mistake. I  telephoned him last week and found him very angry. And I can  understand it. But in politics you cannot permit yourself to  take things personally. No, you really cannot. I tried to  recommend him for the post, but there was nothing to be done.    [Sangiorgio] But Miglio has apparently said that you  promised  him Institutional Reforms.    [Bossi] Nonsense. We of the League never promise anything,  and none of us has ever said: I want this or that post. He was  the only one to have done so; he asked Berlusconi or Fini, since  he knows them.    [Sangiorgio] Then what happened?    [Bossi] Simple; they both deceived him.    [Sangiorgio] Why?    [Bossi] What do you mean, "why?" Miglio was an impossibility  for that post. Consider Fini: Do you think that the leader of  the National Alliance, which needs votes from the South, could  want as minister someone who calls southerners "hicks." Fini  and Berlusconi did not trust him, and now Miglio is making too  much of the issue. He expected too much; Berlusconi probably  made him all kinds of empty promises, and now he is venting his  anger on me.    [Sangiorgio] Will you talk to him before the Senate vote?    [Bossi] I do not know, I do not know. Tabladini went to  see him yesterday, and he told me that he is still angry. I  think, I hope, that he is sufficiently mature to realize on his  own where his contentiousness could lead.    [Sangiorgio] What if he persists?    [Bossi] Then there would be a problem with Miglio in the  League. I really do not see how he could vote against this  government.    [Sangiorgio] Be patient, Mr. Bossi. Is Mr. Miglio not one of  the founding fathers of the League?    [Bossi] What do you mean by "founding fathers?"    [Sangiorgio] The ideologist, one of the linchpins of the  movement, one of its members' reference points.    [Bossi] Look. He is someone with a special background; he is  a teacher, and I have always given him a free rein. But he has  never played the devil with me, and he must not start doing so  now. I like him, but he must not confuse his battle for  federalism with the battle over ministerial posts. I have  certain very clear principles, and I hope that he will remember  that he has them too.    [Sangiorgio] But do you think he is angry partly because you  preferred Speroni to him?    [Bossi] I do not know. Speroni is an extremely efficient  person, who used to travel around a great deal at a time when  Miglio was a university teacher. And, as we know, teachers do  not achieve much in politics... The federalist objective, which  is my plan and the League's plan, does not change if that  ministry is entrusted to one person rather than another. There  will be a great deal of work to do, and Miglio's knowledge,  expertise, and experience will certainly be useful too. I hope  that he will be proud to cooperate, to help young Speroni.    [Sangiorgio] So, there is a dispute. Who is more stubborn?  You or Miglio?    [Bossi] How should I know? I can talk to him as a friend,  but I also have to think as secretary of the League. He counts  for a great deal in the League; he is a likable old fellow. But  in the League when someone starts talking about appointments, he  becomes less likable. So, remember, my friend: The League is a  mountain. The sound of a falling stone is virtually inaudible.</p>

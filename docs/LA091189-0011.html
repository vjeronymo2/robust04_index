			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERRY TAKES CHANCES, PATRIOTS TOP JETS, 27-24  </P> <P> A lot of people have been wondering what New England Coach Ray Berry is going  to do with defensive stars Andre Tippett, Ronnie Lippett and Garin Veris  sidelined for the season.  </P> <P> If the Patriots' season-opening 27-24 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday  is any indication, Berry is going to gamble. So far, his luck has been good.  </P> <P> The Patriots converted two key fourth-down plays in the first half to set up  touchdowns, then parlayed a late missed fourth-quarter gamble into a  game-winning, four-yard touchdown run by Reggie Dupard with 1:55 to play to win  their sixth straight season opener.  </P> <P> It was a game the Patriots also tried to give away. They scored the first three  times they had the ball to build a 21-0 halftime lead, and then watched as the  Jets scored 24 straight points to take a 24-21 lead with 7:28 to play on a  49-yard touchdown pass from Ken O'Brien to JoJo Townsell.  </P> <P> New England came back and drove from its 40 to the New York four with about  three minutes to play. On fourth down, Berry could have elected to let Greg  Davis attempt a chip shot field goal for a tie. Instead, he sent Dupard up the  middle for no gain.  </P> <P> Although the gamble didn't result in a first-down or touchdown, the Patriots  were able to hold on defense. They got the ball back on the New York 38 with  2:22 left following a 38-yard punt by Joe Prokop, who earlier had scored on a  17-yard run on a fake field goal.  </P> <P> Three plays later, Dupard was in the end zone. Tony Eason got the drive going  with a 31-yard pass to Cedric Jones to the New York seven. Dupard got three on  first down and then scored.  </P> <P> The Jets never got farther than their own 44 on their final drive.  </P> <P> "We're going to have learn that in this league you can't get away playing one  half," O'Brien said. "You just can't leave 30 minutes on the sidelines."  </P></p>

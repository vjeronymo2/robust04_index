			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Ringing the change Even those excluded from the global syndicate formed to market the third tranche of the BT privatisation must admit that the structure is a sign of the times. In a global equity market it makes sense for large international issues to be marketed globally by investment banks with worldwide reach. In the last BT sale, cross-border marketing was permitted only to SG Warburg. This time the restriction has been relaxed. The hope is the sale will proceed more smoothly as a result. Still, the UK Treasury is taking some risks. The structure also gives 11 banks exclusive rights to market the paper to the 500 top institutions worldwide who would anyway be expected to take up the lion's share of the issue. It is to be hoped that in return for this privilege members of this group will compete effectively against each other. Otherwise the arrangement will go down simply as providing jobs for the boys. This risk is higher if the selection process was distorted for political reasons, for example in the vain hope of reciprocity in other countries' privatisation deals. One test will be whether overseas buyers take up more than the 40 per cent share of the institutional tranche they absorbed last time round. The talents of BZW and NatWest Securities would then have been put to good use. The risk is that the opposite happens and that the likes of Daiwa and Paribas discover hitherto undreamed of skills in selling to UK institutions. Having been given the opportunity, they will presumably try their best.</p>

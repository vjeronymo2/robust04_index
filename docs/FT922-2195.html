			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hafnia increases share issue HAFNIA Holding, the troubled Danish insurance group, has increased its share issue from DKr1.5bn to DKr2bn (Dollars 331m). This issue is being underwritten by Danish institutional shareholders and Paribas, the French bank. Hafnia's urgent need of capital was underlined by events in the stock market yesterday. It suffered heavy unrealised losses when shares in Baltica Holding, its big domestic rival, fell by DKr77 to DKr460, wiping some DKr350m off the value of Hafnia's 33.5 per cent stake in Baltica. In a statement to the stock exchange, Hafnia said its equity capital at June 16 had been reduced to DKr400m by the fall in the value of strategic holdings in Baltica and Skandia, the Swedish insurer. Hafnia said, however, that it believed it would be able to sell its strategic holdings in Baltica and Skandia at a price above the current market prices. Hafnia's present troubles began when its finances became seriously over-extended after trying (together with Norway's UNI Storebrand) to acquire control of Skandia last winter.</p>

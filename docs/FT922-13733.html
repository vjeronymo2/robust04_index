			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Prophets of doom proved correct as the conflict in Bosnia escalates / A report on how western recognition made the war inevitable. Fighting will not be house-to-house but flat-to-flat THE DARKEST predictions of the outcome of the Yugoslav crisis are being realised. Civil war appears to have begun in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the latest Yugoslav republic to gain international recognition. Serb irregulars seized the town of Zvornik on the eastern frontier with Serbia yesterday and Belgrade radio said the predominantly Moslem town was now a 'free city' under Serbian control. The radio also reported artillery duels between the federal army and Croats in Mostar, southern Bosnia. Many observers warned that violence in this central republic was inevitable following the European Community's recognition in January of neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia as independent states. Germany, believing that immediate recognition would end the war in Croatia, pressurised the EC to recognise the former Yugoslav republics. But this left Bosnia in the rump Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation which remained. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy to Yugoslavia, said yesterday that US and EC recognition of Bosnia had damaged the peace process. 'When we had recognition of Bosnia . . . that again threw another factor of instability into the stew, just as early recognition of the republics of Slovenia and Croatia did.' Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, felt he had no choice but to insist on independence for Bosnia before reaching agreement among the three ethnic groups on the republic's future shape. Bosnia, sandwiched between Croatia and Serbia, is now the scene of several wars. These include a war among the ethnic groups within Bosnia to take control of local communities, and a war waged by Croats, from outside the republic, for control of western Hercegovina against Serbs and the Yugoslav federal army. But the most serious war is that being waged by the Serbs against Moslems and Croats, a war which is being masterminded behind the scenes by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, and General Blagoje Adzic, the acting federal defence minister. Western diplomats based in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, say Serbia appears set to fight a full-scale war in Bosnia despite a deteriorating economy. They say that Mr Milosevic is ignoring diplomatic pressure to stop the war and is making no effort to calm Bosnia's Serb leaders who are known to take orders from him. Mr Radovan Karadzic, one of these leaders, says Bosnia's Serbs, who account for one-third of the population, have the rightful claim to 68 per cent of Bosnia's territory based on their definition of ethnic occupancy. In a pattern already made familiar in Croatia thousands of Serbian ultra-nationalist fighters have been despatched to Bosnia on the pretext of defending 'endangered' Serbs. They see themselves as threatened in an independent Bosnia and want to remain in Yugoslavia with Serbia and Montenegro, Serbia's close ally. The current fighting is reviving bitter historical memories. The First World War began in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist. And during World War Two Serbs again showed their determination to fight for their perceived right to live together. Croats, who make up 17 per cent of the population, have also drawn their map which includes 35 per cent of Bosnia. Diplomats say that Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, is obsessed with annexing western Hercegovina, despite Croatia's formal recognition of Bosnian independence. The carve-up of Bosnia by Serbs and Croats would leave Bosnian Moslems, 43 per cent of the population, without a homeland. Moslems, backed by Croats, support Bosnian independence but the descent into anarchy leaves all the ethnic groups with no choice but to fight to defend their very existence. The pattern of war in Bosnia risks following that of Croatia, which left at least 6,000 people dead and 1m homeless. But in Bosnia, the stakes are even higher. In Croatia the ethnic divide between Serbs and Croats was generally clear. But there are no such precise divisions in the main towns of Bosnia. All three communities have warned that fighting would not just be house-to-house but flat-to-flat in the numerous high rise buildings which surround Sarajevo. In ethnically mixed towns the fighting peaks and dies without warning, only to ignite in other towns. A plethora of militia groups is fighting in many local wars while military observers say at least one-third of the federal army is deployed in the republic. Later this month the main body of 14,000 UN peacekeepers is due to be despatched to Croatia. But despite unsubstantiated hopes that their presence will calm Bosnia it now appears more likely that the UN will have to relocate its headquarters from Sarajevo which on Wednesday night came under heavy bombardment by Serb irregulars.</p>

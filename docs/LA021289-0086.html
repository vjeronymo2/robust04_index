			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL HONORS NOTED ALUMNI WITH HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Like baseball and rock and roll, Beverly Hills High School has its own Hall of  Fame.  </P> <P> Each year since 1984, the school has selected a group of graduates who have  gone on to fame and fortune.  </P> <P> Past recipients have included Los Angeles Philharmonic Music Director Andre  Previn (Class of '46) and actress Betty White (Class of '39).  </P> <P> But "we are not just talking about celebrities," said John Suckling, president  of the school's Alumni Assn., which makes the selections. "I would prefer to  think of them as people who are noted in their chosen professions or careers.  They might be in any profession -- banking, medicine or acting."  </P> <P> Thus, this year's inductees are brothers George and Hoyt Pardee, home building  executives, and Charles Older, a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge. They  join 12 other Beverly Hills High School graduates who have been honored.  </P> <P> The winners are selected from a group of people who are nominated and  interviewed by individual members of the Alumni Assn. board of directors. The  entire board votes on the final decision.  </P> <P> Winners are announced in the association's annual magazine, mailed to former  graduates throughout the country. This year, the association plans to place  plaques honoring each Hall of Fame member on a wall at the school. The display,  said Principal Sol Levine, "will give students a sense of the history and  achievements of the institution they are a part of."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Philanthropic Work  </P> <P> "The Hall of Fame was created because we know these names are important,"  Suckling said. "It's an interest-getter, but it is also intendeded to be a true  honor. We don't give it to anyone to whom it would not be important. They have  to want it."  </P> <P> The Pardees founded the Pardee Construction Co. in 1946. The company merged  with Weyerhaeuser Co. of Washington state and became one of the largest  residential construction firms in Southern California. George (Class of '38)  and Hoyt Pardee ('36) have been recognized for their philanthropic work.  </P> <P> Older (Class of '35) was a decorated fighter pilot during World War II. He was  appointed judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1967. He has won  several California State Bar awards.  </P> <P> The two Pardees could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Older, reached by telephone, said: "I think it's great. I feel honored to have  been chosen. There are many others who are just as deserving."  </P> <P> Other Hall of Fame members are Sherman Mellinkoff ('37), dean emeritus of UCLA  School of Medicine; Robert Moore ('38), Disney animator; Robert Hartmann ('34),  White House aide and journalist; Walter Stoessel Jr. ('37), former ambassador  to West Germany; Robert Badham ('47), former congressman from California; Maria  Tallchief ('42), prima ballerina; Dr. Jerome Kay ('39), thoracic and  cardiovascular surgeon, and Louise Brough ('40), former Wimbledon and national  tennis champion.  </P> <P> Last year, founding President Justin McCarthy ('41) was honored along with oil  executive William Pagen ('38) and White, who stars in the hit NBC-TV series  "The Golden Girls."  </P> <P> Suckling said those in the Hall of Fame are only a few of the notable graduates  from Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Famous Parents  </P> <P> "There are few public high schools in the country with more famous students,"  he said. "Beverly Hills graduates turn up all over the place."  </P> <P> For example, Suckling displayed a newspaper article that appeared last year  about Col. Robert B. Thieme Jr., a graduate in the Class of '36. Thieme, a  Texas-based fundamentalist preacher noted for his frequent attacks against  unions, feminists and homosexuals, made news when it was reported that Vice  President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, used to listen to tape recordings  of his speeches.  </P> <P> Other famous former graduates who have not made the list include Donald L.  Bren, a wealthy Orange County developer whose personal fortune was estimated at  over $1 billion; Los Angeles Times Managing Editor George Cotliar, and actors  Jackie Cooper, Rhonda Fleming, Richard Chamberlain and Richard Dreyfuss.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills High School also has a long list of graduates whose parents were  celebrities, such as Desi Arnaz Jr., Alana Ladd and Jack Linkletter.  </P> <P> Suckling, 58, a graduate of the Class of '48, said he falls in the category of  one of the "youngest of the oldtimers who graduated from Beverly Hills High."  </P> <P> Besides naming graduates to the Hall of Fame, the alumni group works to raise  money for college scholarships for students. About $27,000 has been given to  students since the organization was founded in 1977.  </P> <P> The association also has managed to track down 19,000 of the 25,000 students  who have graduated from the school, which turns 61 years old this year,  Suckling said. These efforts have helped various graduating classes set up  reunions each year and has even assisted in the formation of alumni chapters in  New York and San Diego.  </P> <P> The association is planning a big reunion for the school's 65th anniversary in  1993.  </P> <P> It's through such reunions, Suckling said, that he manages to keep in touch  with the past. "These are special gatherings," he said. "I had an older brother  who was killed in World War II, when I was 12. When I go to these reunions it  is the only time I'm around people who knew my brother. It is a way for me to  keep in touch."  </P></p>

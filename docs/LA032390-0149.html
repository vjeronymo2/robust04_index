			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> BID TO CURB ERRANT GOLF BALLS ENDED  </P> <P> A controversial attempt to reduce the number of golf balls battering a row of  homes next to the San Clemente Municipal Golf Course was scuttled Wednesday by  the City Council.  </P> <P> Wearing ribbons emblazoned with the single word, golfer, about 20 golfing  enthusiasts applauded the council's decision not to renew an experiment that  had reversed the direction of play on two holes across the street from the  homes.  </P> <P> Instead, the council unanimously approved a $9,500 plan to install trees and  sand traps in an effort to encourage golfers to aim away from homes on Avenida  Santa Margarita.  </P> <P> Although some homeowners said the number of balls striking their homes and cars  dropped dramatically during the experiment, the altered holes merely shifted  the problem to another set of houses farther down the street, the council  agreed.  </P> <P> Golfers complained bitterly during the 30-day trial, claiming that the changes  made the holes more difficult to play.  </P> <P> Two sand traps and several trees will be dug into the right side of the  fairway, which is separated from the homes by a narrow street.  </P> <P> After a 90-day trial, the council will review the situation to see if the  latest measures reduce the number of errant balls.  </P> <P> The council also directed city staff to look into the cost of erecting a 30- to  50-foot fence along the street. That option has been strongly opposed by the  homeowners, who say the fence would destroy the panoramic ocean view from their  front yards. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PENALTY FOR DOCTORS  </P> <P> In The Times (Feb. 22), there was a news item regarding a doctor in Anaheim who  was suspended for 90 days and put on 10 years' probation by the State Board of  Medical Quality Assurance for admittedly filing false workers' compensation  claims.  </P> <P> If the medical profession wishes to retain any respect for its so-called high  ethics, then it's high time they took drastic steps in cases such as this,  instead of the slap-on-the-wrist punishment they administer.  </P> <P> Why not take away a license permanently? Perhaps to some this is a high price  to pay, but it would show others that a license to practice medicine is not  also a license to steal.  </P> <P> JOHN HALL  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

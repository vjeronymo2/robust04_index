			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Trade commission rules US not harmed by UK rail imports The US International Trade Commission has brought to an end a dumping suit filed against British steel producers with a ruling that the US industry is not injured by exports of new steel rails from the UK, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The ruling, delivered late on Thursday, came after a 5-1 vote in which only the Commission chairman, Mr Don Newquist, a Democrat, found that the dumping caused injury. Two other Democrats joined three Republicans in the vote. The outcome sends a reminder to US steel producers, who have filed dozens of dumping and countervailing duty suits against their foreign competitors, that they cannot count on a finding of injury from the non-partisan commission. The US Commerce Department, which is believed to be more susceptible to political pressure, had found a dumping margin of 70 per cent on the rail imports. The suits were filed by Bethlehem Steel Corporation and CF&amp;I Steel Corporation in November 1992. The US imported almost Dollars 70m worth of rails in 1991 from Japan, the UK, Luxembourg and Germany. British Steel accounts for the lion's share of the UK's steel rail exports to the US. The privatised steel maker sold 27,000-28,000 tonnes in the US last year, worth Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m and up sharply from the 15,000-16,000 tonnes exported to the US in 1991, adds Andrew Baxter in London. Yesterday the company welcomed the ITC's decision, but noted that the outcome was only what it has considered all along to have been reasonable.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead SmithKline Beecham reports six-month results to June 30 on Tuesday and analysts are expecting pre-tax profits for the second quarter of between Pounds 272m and Pounds 282m. But particular attention will given to the plight of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug; this used to be the group's biggest product but its patents in the United States expired on May 17. Wellcome, another pharmaceuticals group, reports four-month figures to June 30 on Thursday. The company is changing its year-end from August to December so analysts have no comparable figure for last year. But sales of Zovirax, Wellcome's biggest product, have been disappointing and analysts will also be looking for signs that the sales decline in Retrovir, the HIV and Aids treatment, could be bottoming out. Waste Management International, the environmental services group, reports second-quarter figures on Monday. These are expected to show continued growth despite the impact of the recession in continental Europe. Analysts are looking for a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 37m in the same period last year to between Pounds 40m and Pounds 44m. There should be a good contribution from Wessex Waste Management, a joint venture with Wessex Water. David S. Smith, the paper, packaging and office supplies group, is expected to report a continued recovery in profits when it announces annual figures on Wednesday. Although first-half profits were down, analysts are forecasting a full-year, pre-tax figure up from Pounds 27.1m to between Pounds 33m and Pounds 35m. But earnings per share will show little change, reflecting the Pounds 90m issue last year to pay for office products wholesaler Spicers. First Technology reports full-year results to April on Thursday. The group, which designs and makes crash dummies and safety sensors for the car industry, is expected to report profits of around Pounds 4m, up from Pounds 2.34m.</p>

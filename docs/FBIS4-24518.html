			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said here today that China hopes that the  U.S. side will refrain from engaging in any official contacts  with the Taiwan authorities.    The spokesman made the statement when asked to comment on a  report that the U.S. side allowed Lien Chan of Taiwan to stop  over in the United States on his way to Latin America.    "We are deeply concerned over this matter", the spokesman  noted, pointing out that the "transit diplomacy" or "vacation  diplomacy" that the Taiwan authorities have been pursuing is  designed to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan".    "We hope that the U.S. side will implement the principles  laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques in its  action, refrain from engaging in any official contacts with the  Taiwan authorities and prevent Lien Chan from making transit of  the United States in any way, in the overall interests of  Sino-U.S. relations", the spokesman said.</p>

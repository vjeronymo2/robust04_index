			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "Information Exchange--for the Common Good"] </F>   [Text] The second conference of leaders of press agencies  of Turkic-speaking countries has been held in Bishkek.  Delegations of the ANATOLIA, TIKA (Turkey), TAK (Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus), KYRGYZKHABAR, and KAZTAG agencies  took part. Representatives of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan were  unable to make it to the capital of Kyrgyzstan for technical  reasons.    The conference showed once again the enormous possibilities  of concerted activity in the accomplishment of the common  professional, technical, and financial tasks of the agencies in  the pursuit of the domestic and foreign policy of the sovereign  fraternal states.    The opinion that such activity should be shaped on the basis  of the priorities of the official policy of each country, with  regard to the documents and agreements adopted by their leaders,  was expressed. It should be based on a desire to create an  objective and multifaceted notion of the life of each country in  order to counterpose its product to the alternative and  frequently unscrupulous information structures.    The main direction of the cooperation of the united  agencies,  however, the conferees believe, is a concerted information  policy, the coordination of the development and use of their  professional and technological communications resources, and the  joint defense of national interests in international  organizations of the press and television, which would afford  new opportunities for unrestricted and multilateral information  exchange.    Decisions on financial and organizational questions of the  subsequent activity of the joint agency of the Turkic-speaking  countries (TKA), which was created last year at the first  conference, which was held in Ankara, were adopted.    The participants in the meeting agreed to institute the  publication of a joint bulletin, which would publish news of an  economic and cultural nature. It would subsequently be  disseminated in the world information space in English, German,  and Spanish. For the realization of this project it is  contemplated establishing a computer network among the members  of the TKA.    The conferees were received by Askar Akayev, president of  Kyrgyzstan. He supported the idea of the TKA being open for  membership by the press agencies of other Turkic-speaking  countries and emphasized that this was in keeping with the  initiative of Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan,  concerning the creation of a Eurasian Union. Permanent  information exchange, Askar Akayev said, will serve not only the  rapprochement of peoples with common historical roots and  cultural traditions but also the building of a new economy based  on market relations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An accident similar to that in Chernobyl is  impossible in Russia, a spokesman for Rosenergoatom, Russia's  nuclear power engineering concern, running all 9 Russian nuclear  power plants, has said.    Anatoliy Zemskov told Interfax that after the events in  Chernobyl, much work had been done to make nuclear reactors in  Russia safer.    For instance, at the Leningrad nuclear power station, the  first power block has been reconstructed. Technological  channels were replaced and so were the reactor's inside graphite  covering and the protection system. The speed with which rods  fall into the active zone has increased from 18 to 4 seconds.    "This work makes it possible to avoid negative processes  that  are possible at the Chernobyl-type reactors," Zemskov declared.  "Of course, this does not rule out separate incidents, however,  today's safety systems can localize them," he said.    He also reported that the term of some reactors exploitation  would soon be up, and power units would have to be stopped in  ten years or so. This holds true of the Leningrad, Kola, Kursk,  and Novoronezhsk nuclear power stations. So, it is now very  important to start designing nuclear reactors of an advanced  type, Zemskov said.    He disclosed that engineers at the St. Petersburg branch of  the Atomenergoproekt institute were completing work on the  design of a new NP-500 reactor. In the first quarter of 1995,  work will start on an experimental reactor with a maximum  capacity of 650 megawatt. "The equipment used in this reactor  has been tested in most critical situations and has proved  reliable," Zemskov said.    In his words, experts are considering the possibility of  setting up nuclear power plants in some remote regions.  "Sakhalin, Kamchatka, Chukotka, and Yakutia ask for smaller  yield atomic power stations on their territories," he reported.    In his words, there is a plan to transform some nuclear  reactors from icebreakers to movable platforms. Besides, there  are blue- prints for building a small remote-controlled nuclear  power plant. Placed underground, such a station can operate for  25 years automatically, provided fuel delivery is regular.</p>

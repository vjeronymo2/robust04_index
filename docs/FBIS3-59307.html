			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Yu-hsiang (7115 3022 4382): "Localization </F> of Workers Hired From Abroad Hints at Conspiracy"]    [Text] Hong Kong's already unstable contingent of  civil servants is seriously torn and divided over the  British-Hong Kong government's sudden introduction of a new  measure allowing the conversion of employees hired from  overseas. Naturally, there is intense conflict between the local  civil servants and foreign civil servants hired abroad, but even  among local civil service groups, there is dissention. This has  cast a shadow over Hong Kong's social stability in the  post-transition period, which is most regrettable.    The Hong Kong government has suddenly announced the policy  of  allowing foreign civil servants to turn local contract workers,  and this has evoked strong repercussions among Hong Kong's more  than 100,000 Chinese civil servants who believe that this is  clearly the Hong Kong government's attempt to undermine the  localization program. The Hong Kong media are almost unanimous  in their opposition to this new policy.    The British-Hong Kong government probably had not  anticipated  this loud voice of opposition toward this foreign civil servant  conversion system, and except for sending a minister-level  officer to hurriedly explain to Hong Kong's several large civil  service associations to minimize the impact of the incident, it  tried to defend itself saying that the plan in no way  contradicted the policy of localization of civil servants.  <H5>  Ford Misleads the Public </H5>   According to the British-Hong Kong government's official  explanation, the British rushed through the foreign civil  servant conversion plan without prior deliberation or  consultation because the government was concerned that the  foreign civil servants might sue the government on human rights  grounds, charging the government of depriving them of their  right to continue to work in Hong Kong after 1997. In  particular, many among the foreigners have lived in Hong Kong  for seven years or longer, which would qualify them as local  residents under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic  Law's definition. Upon making its studies, the Legal Department  concluded that if the overseas employees should sue the  government, there was a good chance that the government would  lose.    Even before there is a lawsuit, the government has declared  that it would lose. This is quite unheard of. Subsequently, the  British-Hong Kong government's Chief Secretary Ford defended  this new plan saying it complied with the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the pertinent articles of the Basic Law and that  it was an effective measure to keep the talented people in Hong  Kong after 1997.    Ford may be guilty of taking things out of context and  misleading the people, because the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the articles in the Basic Law never  discriminated against foreign civil servants. Except for a  handful of minister-level positions which must be filled by  Chinese nationals after 1997 to give expression to Chinese  sovereignty and the policy of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong,  other government department positions are to be recruited  openly, and anyone with ability, regardless of nationality, is  eligible for consideration.    Thus, after the Hong Kong SAR government is established in  1997, the criterion for recruiting civil servants will be  "appointment based on ability only," and foreign-born civil  servants will not be denied their right to continue to serve  Hong Kong; however, the special privileges and benefits they  enjoyed in the past under the rule of the colonial government  will not be extended beyond 1997.  <H3>  British-Hong Kong Has Always Discriminated Against Local  Public Servants </H3>   An editorial in a Chinese language magazine actually called  upon the Hong Kong people to be generous in accepting foreign  civil servants to continue to serve Hong Kong after 1997, so  that Hong Kong could retain its characteristic as a large  international city. Some pro-Britain Legislative Council members  even expressed concern that any rejection of foreign civil  servants would infer or border on racial discrimination.    This is pure "slavish comprador philosophy." In the past,  the  British-Hong Kong colonial government has always favored foreign  civil servants and has always discriminated against native  Chinese civil servants. It was only as a result of the arduous  struggles of the local civil servants a decade or so ago that  the Hong Kong government agreed to implement the policy of  localization of civil servants. But there has never been any  clear results, and the local public employees have long harbored  much resentment. But now the British-Hong Kong government has  executed a sneak attack by suddenly announcing the foreign civil  servant conversion system, permitting those who meet the  qualifications to convert to local civil servant status; they  even called that a part of the localization process.    This is stealing the sky and putting up a sham sun -- a  gigantic fraud. The original meaning of the policy to localize  the public servants is pure and simple. It means to give the  local Chinese employees who make up the majority of the  contingent of civil servants a better chance of being promoted.  But today, the government is trying in vain to call the foreign  civil servant conversion plan a part of the localization process  and even saying that this plan applies to less than 200 foreign  public servants. This is a sly manipulation of statistics,  because this handful of foreign employees all hold high-ranking  positions in various government departments, and if they are  considered local employees after 1997, they will never leave,  and this will directly jeopardize the promotion opportunity for  hundreds and thousands of local Chinese civil servants. No  wonder when this new policy was announced, local Chinese civil  servants were in an uproar.    The authorities announced this new policy on the third day  after Governor Patten had gone on vacation. Was it a  coincidence, or was it pre-arranged? Before Patten left Hong  Kong, he had said that during his vacation, he would read no  official documents, nor did he want his subordinates to fax him  anything which could spoil his holidays.    Is Patten going to ignore everything and wait until the  whole  affair blows over before coming back to work, so that he would  not have to face the local Chinese civil servants? The fact is,  since Patten took office in July of last year, he has  consciously or unconsciously let the foreign civil servants keep  all the privileges they enjoy in the Hong Kong government. He  not only has announced the continued employment of Chief  Secretary Ford who should be retiring, but he has also  deliberately ignored Chen Tsu-tse [7115 4371 3419] who was  expected to be the first Chinese to become chief secretary  before 1997. Chen has become so discouraged that he eventually  quit his position at the Education and Manpower Planning  Department and quietly left the Hong Kong government.  <H3>  The British-Hong Kong Government's Move Divides the Civil  Servants </H3>   One of the main reasons for the Hong Kong government's  announcement permitting foreign civil servants to change systems  is that if qualified overseas employees were not allowed to turn  local and keep their jobs, the government could be sued by the  Overseas Employee Association for human rights violations. But  according to the terms of employment of overseas workers, once  the contract expires, the government has the right to renew or  terminate any overseas employee's contract as warranted. In  other words, even if an overseas civil servant meets all the  requirements of becoming a local employee, it does not mean that  his or her contract will be automatically renewed upon  expiration or that he or she can continue to work in the  government. This is but the government's deliberate attempt to  mislead the public.    The already not very stable contingent of civil servants is  badly torn and divided over this new measure suddenly introduced  by the authorities allowing the conversion of foreign employees.  Between the local and foreign employees, there naturally are  serious conflicts, but even among local civil service groups,  there are dissentions. This has cast a shadow over Hong Kong's  social stability in the post-transition period, which is most  regrettable.    Today, some local civil service groups are prepared to sue  the Hong Kong government, and others are drafting private  lawsuits to prevent the conversion of foreign civil servants.  The matter has become even more complicated. It is learned that  the Chinese authorities have formally asked to discuss the  matter at the 27th round Sino-British Joint Liaison Group  Meeting to be held in Beijing in mid-September. This no doubt  will add another variable to the Sino-British negotiations over  Hong Kong's political reform. Prospects are grim.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Loophole tightens around tax gurus Tax advisers were yesterday trying to find new ways through the ever-diminishing loophole which allows companies to avoid National Insurance contributions by paying employees in kind. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced on Tuesday that gemstones and fine wines would be treated as earnings and therefore be liable for National Insurance contributions. The measure extended moves by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the last Budget to prevent gold bars and other tradeable commodities being used to avoid contributions. Mr Jim Yuill, director of social security services at accountant Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'There are other ways of avoiding national insurance contributions which have not yet been tried and we will be bringing them to the fore in the next few weeks.' He declined to be specific, in case of a pre-emptive move by the authorities to block the proposals. There are still a few NIC avoidance measures in existence, however. Mr Yuill cited the controversial use of single-premium insurance policies. The DSS says that there is legislation which should catch life insurance policies but some accountants disagree. 'I'm sure it will end up in the courts,' Mr Yuill said. He added: 'The employer takes out a policy on the life of the employee for a small amount, say Pounds 100, which is caught by NICs. The trick then is to inflate the value of the policy by making a second and large payment which escapes NIC liability. The employee then cashes the policy in.' Other tricks to make payments in kind include giving high street store gift vouchers, paying for employees' holidays and buying cars for them. Like gold bars, diamonds and wine, these are taxable benefits but they have not been widely favoured by employees because they are not as easily encashable. Mr Martin Kaye, managing-director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, said: 'It will never be the same again.' He believed that one alternative for employers was to turn to antiques, which have a mature market in the auction rooms.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPITAL PERFORMANCE;  </P> <P> AN ENVIABLE L.A. FAMILY OF FUNDS TAKES A LONG VIEW  </P> <P> For Wall Street, the 1990s are shaping up to be a time of dwindling  opportunities, lost jobs and meager profits.  </P> <P> But the unfolding decade almost seems special-ordered for Los Angeles-based  Capital Group, the Southland's biggest private money manager:  </P> <P> * In a troubled investing environment that demands a long-term focus, Capital's  oldest stock and bond mutual funds boast historical track records that are  among the industry's best.  </P> <P> * While many firms are just now struggling with their baby boomer employees'  restless ambitions, for 30 years Capital has had an egalitarian management  structure that stresses high individual achievement -- and lets junior  employees run their own shows.  </P> <P> * While financial services companies of all kinds are paying dearly for the  excesses of the 1980s, Capital's tortoise-like, conservative approach has left  it in a powerful position to gain from competitors' weaknesses.  </P> <P> Yet for Capital's monolithic size -- $55.8 billion under management, ranking it  16th largest of all U.S. money managers -- the firm is a surprisingly quiet  presence in Los Angeles. "We probably should be better known in our hometown,"  admits Jon Lovelace, the 63-year-old vice chairman of the firm and by most  accounts its spiritual leader.  </P> <P> One of Capital's few highly visible executives in recent years has been Robert  Kirby, chairman of the firm's institutional investing arm, Capital Guardian  Trust. A member of the so-called Brady Commission that studied the 1987 stock  market crash, he became a vocal opponent of computerized program trading in the  late 1980s. In general, however, Capital has rarely sought publicity. Yet its  investment record has become the envy of many rivals.  </P> <P> "It's a first-class operation," says Budge Collins, head of Collins Associates,  a Newport Beach firm that tracks investment firm performance. "They hire good  people and they keep them. They have very low turnover."  </P> <P> "It's an organization of which I've never heard anything negative," adds  Michael Stolper, a San Diego pension consultant.  </P> <P> Both insiders and outsiders say much of the credit for Capital's success goes  to the self-effacing Lovelace, a Princeton economics graduate whose father  founded Capital in the early 1930s.  </P> <P> Ironically, Lovelace also now represents one of Capital's greatest challenges  -- that is, the challenge of doing without him as he nears retirement. Though  Lovelace insists that Capital's management depth is so great that his presence  wouldn't be missed, insiders say his departure would leave a void.  </P> <P> As the biggest stock mutual fund manager on the West Coast, Capital is the  antithesis of its giant East Coast rival, Fidelity Investments.  </P> <P> Both firms began to make their names in the 1950s, and both have grown  dramatically since. But Fidelity offers 124 mutual funds; Capital offers just  24. Fidelity aggressively jumps on new fund trends and is a magnet for "hot"  money that jumps from investment to investment; Capital always chooses the slow  road.  </P> <P> What's more, Fidelity's structure is based on what is sometimes called the  "star system" of portfolio management, as personified by Peter Lynch, who ran  the firm's Magellan Fund in the 1980s. Each Fidelity fund has one manager  ultimately calling the shots.  </P> <P> Capital's approach is the polar opposite: All 24 funds are split among three to  five money managers, each of whom is free to manage his or her slice without  answering to one fund czar. In that way, no star system can develop because no  single manager alone can make or break a fund.  </P> <P> The Capital system's results:  </P> <P> * The firm's three biggest stock funds far outgunned the average stock fund and  the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index in the 10 years ended Sept.  30. An investor who put $10,000 in Capital's Investment Co. of America fund in  1980 would have $42,300 now. That same investment in the S&amp;P 500 would be  worth $37,000.  </P> <P> * Capital's success wasn't just a phenomenon of the 1980s. Its funds, under the  American Funds name, have produced strong returns since the 1950s. That record  has landed the firm a long list of accolades -- from Forbes magazine's fund  honor roll to the top spot in a 1990 report on the best fund families by fund  tracker Kanon Bloch Carre.  </P> <P> On the surface, having three to five people separately managing chunks of a  single fund -- as bullishly or bearishly as each sees fit -- might seem like an  invitation to investment anarchy. But Capital has discovered that, regardless  of short-term conflicts, the results over the long-term somehow come together.  </P> <P> The multiple-manager system was devised by Lovelace in 1958 as just a  transitional idea after a fund's manager moved up. But as he saw it working,  Lovelace and his co-managers became convinced that the concept was a smarter  approach than the one-manager system.  </P> <P> Another Lovelace innovation came in the mid-1960s, when Capital began including  its research analysts in the multiple-manager system. Traditionally, analysts  have simply fed ideas to fund managers to accept or reject.  </P> <P> "But some of our younger people in research asked, 'Why not let us manage some  of the money?' " Lovelace recalls. Nearly 30 years later, Capital says the  analysts' portfolios have frequently been the best-performing parts of its  funds.  </P> <P> What's perhaps most striking about Capital's corporate culture is that it  developed long before it was considered important to listen to -- let alone  implement -- employees' ideas. One of Lovelace's guiding philosophies, he says,  is to "to build responsibilities around our people, rather than just put names  in organizational boxes."  </P> <P> Capital employees say that isn't just talk. Robert Neithart, a 25-year-old  assistant economist at Capital, believes that the firm is "sort of a unique  place to work. . . . One of the things they try to get across to younger folks  here is that they really do take your opinion seriously. They don't put an  asterisk near your name and say, 'He's only been here for three years.' "  </P> <P> That egalitarianism isn't without cost, though. Employees say the atmosphere is  collegial, with a lot of give-and-take, hash-it-out discussions over investment  strategies. But the firm wouldn't win any awards in an expense-control contest,  Capital's executives admit. "Clearly the way we do a lot of things is not the  most efficient way," says David Fisher, executive vice president of Capital's  international operations.  </P> <P> However, because Capital is private -- it's owned by about 75 of its 1,200  employees -- it faces none of the pressures of public firms to sacrifice  long-term goals for short-term profit.  </P> <P> Why has Capital been able to thrive under that philosophy, while other money  managers have been forced to live quarter to quarter? A key reason is that  Capital essentially demands that its individual investors make a long-term  commitment up front.  </P> <P> While Fidelity and other mutual fund companies sell their shares directly to  the public, Capital funds are available only through brokers. To get into a  Capital fund, an investor must get the pitch from a broker and pay a steep  sales commission -- 4.75% to 5.75%.  </P> <P> That puts a damper on the idea of trading in and out of Capital funds and thus  makes it easier for fund managers to devise long-term game plans with the  money.  </P> <P> The possibility of selling the funds directly to the public is reviewed  periodically, Lovelace says. "But when we review it, we always stay with where  we are," he says.  </P> <P> Why? "Our story is not simple," Lovelace says. The concept of true long-term  investing under Capital's system takes patient explanation, which only a  salesman can provide, he argues.  </P> <P> One of the key points the broker makes, Lovelace adds, is that Capital will  never promise good short-term performance. What is promised is steady growth of  a nest egg over time -- which plays well with investors who are serious about  retirement planning.  </P> <P> Of course, if Capital had failed to deliver over the past 30 years, its  marketing would be to little avail. But because its investing record has been  strong, the firm has created what could be a self-perpetuating cycle -- it  pulls in long-term money, delivers above-average long-term returns, and thereby  attracts more long-term money.  </P> <P> Some rivals might argue that Capital's reluctance to introduce new funds shows  a narrowness in investing talent. Indeed, Capital is far better known as a  stock manager than a bond manager, even though it runs one of the biggest bond  funds (the $1.8-billion Bond Fund of America). In its rating report earlier  this year, fund-tracker Kanon Bloch Carre gave Capital an "A" grade for its  stock funds, but only an average collective grade for its bond funds, many of  which still are relatively young.  </P> <P> Capital's executives acknowledge that the firm is less recognized for its bond  talents. But they make no apology for their patient approach toward new fund  forays.  </P> <P> That stance is supported by the firm's broker network, which views Capital's  conservatism as a major selling point with clients. "They could have brought  out 20 new funds over the last few years, and every one would have been a  winner," says Mike Scafati, who heads mutual fund sales for brokerage A. G.  Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. "But they pay attention to what's best for the  client."  </P> <P> For all of the success that Capital has had with its broker network, the system  also makes the firm vulnerable. Though Capital's list of big institutional  clients grew rapidly in the 1980s, its mutual fund business still accounts for  60% of assets, versus 40% for the institutional arm. So the small investor  still is the firm's bread and butter -- which means that Capital depends on the  brokers' ability to get the funds' message out. And as hard times hit the  brokerage industry, and more brokers leave the business, Capital faces the  prospect of reaching fewer investors.  </P> <P> James K. Dunton, executive vice president of Capital Research, admits that a  constant challenge "is the maintenance of the sales force, which we don't have  any real control over. . . . We approach the needs of those (brokers) every day  like it's the most important thing we have to do -- because it is."  </P> <P> Yet even if the current brokerage shakeout is painful, this is hardly the first  time Wall Street has gone through a purge. Capital's sales network has survived  other shakeouts, and the firm's competitors have little doubt that it will  survive this one too.  </P> <P> A much bigger question mark is how well Capital's lauded management style will  survive Lovelace's eventual retirement.  </P> <P> Lovelace scoffs at such concerns, noting that he already spends much of his  time away from the office, working from home in Santa Barbara. "Because of the  nature of our structure, we're not highly dependent on one person as some  organizations are," he says flatly.  </P> <P> Still, Capital's senior managers don't hide their reluctance to imagine Capital  without Lovelace. "There is simply no way to replace a great leader like that,"  Dunton says. "Many of the bold, decisive strokes of this organization have come  right out of his head."  </P> <P> * RELATED STORY: D4  </P> <P> </P> <P> QUIET GIANT  </P> <P> Capital Group now is the biggest private money manager in Southern California,  and the 16th largest in the nation -- ahead of such perhaps better-known names  as Chase, CalPERS, Dreyfus and Travelers.  </P> <P> Assets under management at year-end except latest  </P> <P> 1950: $40 billion  </P> <P> 1990: $55.8 billion  </P> <P> Source: Capital Group  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S MONEY MONOLITHS  </P> <P> The biggest money managers based in California, according to the 1990 listing  by Institutional Investor magazine.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:2.55IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Firm  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Headquarters  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wells Fargo  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Francisco  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $92.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Capital Group  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Los Angeles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 51.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Calif.

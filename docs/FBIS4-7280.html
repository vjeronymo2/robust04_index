			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by freelance commentator Takashi Tachibana] </F>   [Text] To put it bluntly, what the Hata government has done  to the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is a surprise  attack. If it had happened before the election of the prime  minister [in the Diet], the SDPJ would not have voted for Mr.  Tsutomu Hata, and consequently, the Hata cabinet could not have  been formed. The exclusion of the SDPJ from the coalition  immediately following the election is nothing else than a breach  of political faith. It thus is natural for the SDPJ to have  left the coalition.    When Mr. Hata was elected prime minister, the mass media  gave  prominent coverage to Mr. Hata's political career and character,  regarding him as "faithful," "honest," "a common man," and  "earnest." But judging from what Mr. Hata has done to the SDPJ,  I cannot say that he is an upstanding figure. I wonder whether  he is defending himself in saying that everything was plotted by  Mr. (Ichiro) Ozawa, who controls the Hata government from behind  the scenes.    When asked about the existence of the "dual-power" structure  involving Mr. Ozawa, Mr. Hata said "even an actor has the right  to choose a scenario," thus admitting that he is no more than an  actor. However, even if the recent move was plotted by Mr.  Ozawa, Mr. Hata has to take responsibility for choosing Mr.  Ozawa's plan.    I wonder how far Mr. Hata will play his role in a political  drama scripted by Mr. Ozawa. It seems that Mr. Ozawa's plan for  realigning the political parties is increasingly gaining  momentum with the ultimate goal of materializing his plan to  rebuild Japan by forming the Imperial Rule Assistance  Association after breaking up all the existing political parties.    If Mr. Hata, in taking part in such a plan to forcibly  realign the political world, which breaks faith with the SDPJ,  intends to carry out Mr. Ozawa's plan to rebuild Japan, he  should stop considering himself a "common man" and should  instead call himself "crafty" or "a person who always follows a  high-handed person [Ozawa]."    Now that the SDPJ has decided to secede from the coalition,  it is unavoidable that the Hata cabinet will be short-lived.  But there is the possibility that Mr. Hata will try to prolong  the life of his cabinet by undermining the solidarity of the  SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party. However, this may lead  to further political turmoil, and we do not want see that. What  the people want to see is the immediate dissolution of the Diet  and a general election.    Japan's politics is faced with a historic turning point, but  what Japanese politicians are doing is instead only political  warfare, and in such a situation, wherein the people's wishes  are not being reflected, the wheel of history is about to turn.  We should avoid this. What we expect from the new government  is the dissolution of the Diet and a general election to hear  the judgment of the people.</p>

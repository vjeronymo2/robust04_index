			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities stand up well after base rate news - Market report The  1/2 percentage point rise in the Bank of England's key lending rate failed to upset the UK stock market to any significant degree. Market strategists applauded Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, for his courage in making a pre-emptive strike on base rates, without waiting for inflationary pressures to reach threatening proportions. The rate increase was thought unlikely to check significantly the recovery in the UK economy, or in company profits and dividends. By the close of trading the FT-SE 100-share Index had recovered more than half of its initial fall, with the final reading of 3,128.8 showing a net loss of only 10.5 points - by no means a serious setback. The equity market took its lead from the UK government bond market, where long-dated issues closed very firmly. At least one leading securities house raised its forecasts for both the UK economy and the Footsie index, while at the same time predicting that interest rates could reach 8 per cent by the end of next year. The timing of the Bank's move caught out some traders who had relaxed their interest rate caution after last week's meeting between the chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England had appeared to pass off without drama. But the disclosure yesterday morning that UK producer output prices had risen by an unexpected 0.3 per cent in August halted an initial improvement in share prices and gave the market 20 minutes warning of a possible move on interest rates. Shares quickly plunged when the news came, driven by determined selling of stock index futures by the locals, or independent, futures traders. Within an hour, the Footsie had transformed a 1.9-point gain to a loss of 25.3. However, the 3,114 mark proved to be the day's low and most of the gain had been recovered as London waited for Wall Street to reopen after its uncomfortable session on Friday. In the event, Wall Street was only 3 Dow points off in UK hours, but sudden weakness in the US dollar hit the blue chip international stocks in the UK market and pushed the Footsie down again. The focus also fell on interest-related stocks. Store and retail issues performed fairly well, with the leaders showing either very modest losses or, in some cases, holding steady. There were casualties among the housebuilding companies, which faced two adverse factors; higher base rates hit their costs and the danger of a rise in mortgage rates - some building societies said yesterday they would raise rates - threatens the still fragile recovery in the housing market. The second line stocks, having joined in the general shakeout in the market, were slower than the blue chips to respond to the improvement in bonds. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 22.7 down at 3,713.3. But trading volumes were moderate, with the Seaq-reported total of 484.6m some 25 per cent down from Friday's figure. Retail business on Friday was worth Pounds 1.28bn. By the close, the market's attention was switching to prospects for today's US consumer prices data, which could renew the pressures on the Federal Reserve caused by the producer price figures announced before the weekend. There was also uncertainty ahead of the Bundesbank policy meeting on Thursday, with some analysts suggesting that German rates could still be reduced. On the domestic front, the market faces the retail price index for August, due tomorrow. Although any sting in these figures appears to have been drawn by the pre-emptive move on base rates, some traders warned that any sharp rise in RPI could still upset the stock market.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Euro Disney loses FFr188m but will pay a dividend: Alice Rawsthorn analyses the first published annual figures since opening of French theme park EURO DISNEY, which has been clouded by controversy ever since opening its lavish Euro Disneyland theme park in April, yesterday confirmed analysts' gloomy forecasts by reporting a loss for its last financial year. The results, the first annual figures to be published since Euro Disneyland's launch, reveal a loss of FFr188m (Pounds 23m) on overall revenue of FFr8.46bn for the year ended September, which includes nearly six months of the park's operation, against net profits of FFr248.7m in the previous year. The immediate outlook is little better. Euro Disney warned of further losses for this year. Euro Disney has long since lost its star status on the stock market and the investment community's expectations of it are at a low. Its shares, which soared to a peak of FFr164 before the opening of the theme park, yesterday fell FFr5 to FFr68. Analysts had been bracing themselves for far heavier losses. The news that Euro Disney plans to pay a dividend - albeit a token FFr1 - was well-received, as was the announcement that it has reached agreement with Disney, its US parent, to relax the terms of their financial arrangements. Disney will waive its 'management fee' of 3 per cent of total revenues for 1992 and 1993 - thereby forfeiting FFr114.6m of the FFr3.82bn park and hotels revenue in 1992 - and will postpone repayments until Euro Disney is profitable. The crux of Euro Disney's problems is that attendance at the park and hotels has been lower than expected. Euro Disney, like its US parent, is notoriously loath to disclose financial information. However the park attracted 6.8m visitors between the opening and September 30. This suggests, as Mr John Forsgren, finance director, conceded, that it is on course for a total of 10.5m visitors in its first year of operation, rather than the initial target of 11m. The level of hotel occupancy at 73 per cent is also, according to Mr Forsgren, 'several points' below expectations. This shortfall is partly the product of the sluggish economic environment. Euro Disney did, after all, finalise its financial plans before its 1989 flotation in more clement conditions. The change in the economic climate has also added FFr200m to Euro Disney's annualised interest bill, due to the rise in French real interest rates, and temporarily scuppered its plans to develop the land around the park. However, Euro Disney has also been affected by its failure to adapt the formula of its US theme parks to meet the needs of the European market. Mr Forsgren said it was attempting to address this issue. It has improved facilities for coaches (more popular in Europe than the US) and made its marketing more explicit to try to cut down on crowding. Euro Disney is also changing its merchandise mix to include more classic Disney character items and adding more points-of-sale. Similarly it is trying to cut staff (the biggest area of variable costs), mainly by retraining central employees to work in the park. Meanwhile the economic climate has worsened. The currency crisis has strengthened the franc, notably against the pound and the lire, making it much more expensive for the British and Italians - respectively 20 per cent and 10 per cent of the park's visitors - to go to Euro Disneyland. 'This will be a difficult year, although we do expect to see some improvement in attendance' said Mr Forsgren. 'As for when we will move into profit - I do not want to make any projections about that.' Lex, Page 20</p>

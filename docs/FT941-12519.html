			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A squeeze brought a sharp advance in Footsie futures on the last day of the equity account, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers attributed the early weakness in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 to 'squaring of the books' and the contract fell to its low of 3,413 within the first hour of trading. A slow and tentative rally soon prised the big institutions from the sidelines and that demand turned into a squeeze sending March further ahead. The release of favourable figures on US inflation not only brought another bout of hectic demand but also helped bring a turnaround in the fortunes of the underlying cash market. At the day's peak the contract showed a premium of 20 points to cash. It finished at 3,466, around 11 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 7 points with volume at 16,304. Volume in the traded options improved to 54,074 of which 16,918 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

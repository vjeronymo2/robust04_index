			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Kevin Maxwell hearing adjourned MR Kevin Maxwell yesterday succeeded in staving off immediate bankruptcy. After a 75-minute private hearing in the High Court a petition by the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management seeking an immediate bankruptcy order against him was adjourned to September 1. The adjournment means that Mr Maxwell will have two court appointments on the same day: he, his brother Ian and Mr Larry Trachtenberg are due to make their second appearance at the City of London Magistrates Court on fraud and theft charges on that date. After yesterday's hearing Mr Maxwell read a prepared statement. He said the liquidators' petition had not been heard and the court had listed September 1 'to hear the grounds for my opposition to their expedited petition'. He continued: 'To the best of my understanding an expedited petition is only heard when there is a serious possibility that assets will be dissipated pending the hearing. This is utterly misconceived in my case. No assets have been dissipated or will be dissipated. 'I have and will always conduct myself in compliance with court orders and for the benefit of all my creditors. I am pleased the court's decision today has given me this opportunity to publicly state my views.' On July 20 Robson Rhodes, the liquidators of BIM from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell empire pension funds have disappeared, were given final judgment against Mr Kevin Maxwell. In that High Court action they claimed Pounds 450m damages for his alleged breaches of his fiduciary duty as a director of the company. The court ordered Mr Maxwell to make interim payments totalling Pounds 406.8m, pending assessment of his total liability. He did not defend the claim because, he said afterwards, he did not have the resources to do so. Immediately after obtaining that judgment the liquidators issued a statutory demand for payment. Normally three weeks are allowed for compliance with such a demand but section 270 of the 1986 Insolvency Act permits the time to be abridged and an expedited petition for bankruptcy to be issued 'if there is a serious possibility that the debtor's property or the value of any of his property will be significantly diminished during that period'. It was that expedited procedure adopted by the liquidators to which Mr Maxwell referred in his statement yesterday. The adjournment is unlikely to prove more than a hiccup in the liquidators' move to make Mr Maxwell Britain's biggest ever bankrupt. He would take over the mantle from Mr William Stern, the former property millionaire made bankrupt in 1974 for Pounds 118m. The liquidators are expecting the High Court to rule next month on their application for final judgment in their identical, but opposed, claim against Mr Ian Maxwell, who was also a director of BIM. If successful they will seek to have him made bankrupt also.</p>

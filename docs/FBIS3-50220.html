			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- In a statement released  today, Defense Ministry State Secretary Igor Urban said recent  insinuations that Slovakia was decreasing Russia's debt to it by  taking weapons instead were a "deliberate misinterpretation."  The former Soviet Union currently owes Slovakia about $1.5  billion. Slovakia will seek to recover at least part of the  amount by capitalizing its claims, making decisions on the basis  of the debtor's payment ability to pay and the Slovak  Government's needs, the statement says.    On November 30, 1993, Slovakia and Russia signed a protocol  on reaching an agreement on partially decreasing the  indebtedness of the former Soviet Union and the Russian  Federation to the Slovak republic through deliveries of special  technology. On the basis of this agreement, Slovakia bought in  December six Russian MiG-29 fighter planes and spare parts for  various other equipment, worth a total of $180 million.    On Friday [21 January] in Moscow, Urban announced that  Slovakia would reduce the debt further by buying another $80-90  million worth of equipment. Like Hungary, Slovakia is  attempting to get partial payment in the form of replacement  parts for the Russian military equipment which the Slovak Army  uses, according to the statement. Because technical systems  cannot be changed from one day to the next in order to be  compatible with NATO's weapons systems, it is necessary to  maintain our present equipment in combat readiness. This is not  possible without deliveries of replacement parts.    Urban emphasized that the deliveries did not indicate a  Slovak orientation to the East. Nor is this measure to be  explained as a lack of seriousness towards our NATO partners.</p>

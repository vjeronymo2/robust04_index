			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PLEA TO DIM LIGHTS GETS GOOD RESULTS  </P> <P> The cry came from Palomar Observatory at the start of the decade: Turn down  your lights!  </P> <P> And by now they mostly have.  </P> <P> The treasured astronomical finds being made from the world's most famous  observatory were being jeopardized by Southern California's urban sprawl and  the increasingly bright sea of street lights, illuminated billboards, parking  lot lights and even front-yard landscaping lights pointing skyward. The problem  did not exist atop Mt. Palomar when the observatory was under construction in  the 1940s.  </P> <P> The primary culprits were mercury vapor or incandescent lamps that were washing  the sky with unwanted white light. Astronomers found that their light-gathering  telescopes, trained on ultra-faint stars, galaxies and quasars in the far  corners of the universe, were being poisoned by man's urban lighting.  </P> <P> So in 1981, the astronomers at Caltech, which owns and operates the Palomar  Observatory, mounted an intense public relations and political campaign to  darken Southern California's night sky.  </P> <P> They wanted outdoor light fixtures to be pointed downward. They asked that  non-essential outdoor signs and billboards not be illuminated after midnight.  And, most important, they wanted the state Department of Transportation, San  Diego County and its various cities to convert their street and highway lights  from the traditional white light to sodium light that -- while unpopular with  some people because of its yellow hue -- is less offensive to the telescopes  atop Mt. Palomar.  </P> <P> The filters at the observatory can screen out the yellow light, while the  low-pressure sodium bulbs effectively illuminate the same area.  </P> <P> One by one, the various public bureaucracies, sympathetic to the nature of  astronomical research and not wanting to render useless one of Southern  California's greatest scientific tools, cooperatively fell in line to reduce  light pollution.  </P> <P> Generally, they agreed that when the old lights burned out, they would be  replaced with sodium units. New housing and commercial developments were  required to install the yellow lights from the beginning.  </P> <P> "We've had excellent cooperation and results," said Robert Brucato, the  observatory's assistant director. "If  </P> <P> the controls hadn't been put in place by the various agencies, we'd be in very  bad shape right now."  </P> <P> Bob Thicksten, the observatory's superintendent, admits that the new-generation  public lighting casts an eerie glow over San Diego County.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I'll get up in the middle of the night to check on things and I'll  do a double-take when I look to San Diego," he said. "The region is in an  orange-ish glow, like a distant forest fire." TOM GORMAN  </P></p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pressure builds for oil cuts as prices test fresh lows Oil prices tested new five-year lows yesterday as efforts intensified to orchestrate a worldwide production cut by the main producing countries, including those outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The price of the benchmark Brent blend for February fell 39 cents in early trading in London yesterday to Dollars 13.25, its lowest level since November 1988. The price began the year at about Dollars 20 a barrel. The latest falls followed visits to the UK and Norway by Mr Said bin Ahmed al-Shanfari, the Omani oil minister. Oman is not a member of Opec, but it was among the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council that last week called for production cuts to be shared among Opec and independent producers. Mr al-Shanfari is reported to be seeking agreement from the main oil producing countries for a 1m-1.3m barrels a day cut to prop up prices. On Tuesday he met Mr Tim Eggar, UK energy minister. World production levels were discussed, but Mr Eggar reminded the Omani emissary that UK oil output was decided by private sector companies. In Oslo Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the Norwegian industry and energy minister, said: 'Under the present circumstances we will not undertake any measures to restrain our production. Opec is the cartel and Opec has the main responsibility for exercising production restraints'. Some small independent producers, such as Egypt, say they will abide by output cuts. But analysts believe their participation in such a scheme would probably be symbolic at best. They say Opec needs to secure the co-operation of large independent producers, including Russia, which Mr al-Shanfari is also expected to visit, to make such a plan credible to international oil markets.</p>

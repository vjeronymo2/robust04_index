			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: Record for Texas Instruments TEXAS Instruments reported a record second-quarter performance, boosted by a strong improvement in its semiconductor operations. Net income and net revenues for the electronics manufacturing group reached an all-time high. Net revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.1bn, up 13 per cent from Dollars 1.9bn in the same period last year, while net income was Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, compared with Dollars 72m, or 73 cents, in last year's second quarter. Profits were well above Wall Street projections of about 99 cents per share. Profits from operations for the second quarter were Dollars 173m, compared with Dollars 128m in the same period last year. Substantially higher profits from semiconductor sales more than offset a loss in computer operations, the company said. Defence electronics profit margins remained stable on lower revenues. Semiconductor revenues increased by 26 per cent, while the digital products division increased sales by 4 per cent. Defence electronics revenues dropped 8 per cent. 'TI's semiconductor business has improved steadily over the past five quarters, despite delayed economic recovery in some of the industry's key geographic regions,' said Mr Jerry Junkins, TI chairman, president and chief executive. Semiconductor orders reached record levels in Japan, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, with strong demand across all product lines, Mr Junkins said. Revenues from semiconductor patent royalties contributed Dollars 125m in the quarter, including Dollars 31m from agreements reached during the quarter with Hyundai Electronics, Gateway 2000, and Nippon Steel Semiconductor. Mr Junkins announced plans to increase capital spending on semiconductor production facilities to about Dollars 700m this year, an increase of Dollars 50m over the company's previous projection. He also reported that TI's joint venture semiconductor manufacturing operation in Japan with Kobe Steel achieved volume production during the quarter. Another joint venture with Canon, Hewlett-Packard and the Singapore Economic Development Board, in Singapore, began operations during the quarter and is expected to reach volume production next year. Net revenues for the first six months of 1993 were Dollars 4bn up 12 per cent from the same period of 1992. Net income for the half-year was Dollars 192m, or Dollars 2.04 a share, up from Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.10, in the same period last year.</p>

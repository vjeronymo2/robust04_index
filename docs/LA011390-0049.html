Rivers, allegedly told  an undercover FBI agent during an October, 1986, meeting that he would be  awarded a contract if he contributed money to a Barry reelection fund-raising  effort Rivers was organizing in Atlanta.  </P> <P> According to the court records, Rivers said: "Ya'll just do this," gesturing to  invitations to the fund raiser, "It's (the contract) done right now."  </P> <P> The court records were unsealed after a hearing in which a federal judge denied  a request by Rivers and prominent city contractor John Clyburn that wiretap  evidence gathered against them be suppressed in their trial on bribery and  conspiracy charges.  </P> <P> The accusations against Rivers and Clyburn are the latest in a long string that  have been lodged against people close to the mayor.  </P></p>

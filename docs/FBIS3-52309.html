He told our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling that the  government will not announce its intentions with regard to the  Golan in advance, but neither will it avoid difficult decisions,  and when required to decide whether and how much to cede, it  will do so. He asserted that the Golan was conquered because of  security considerations alone and that the government will not  negotiate on it until Syria realizes that our security and very  existence constitute the essence of our presence on the Golan.    The construction and housing minister inaugurated a new  housing project in Qatzrin today. The project consists of 500  housing units, most of which have been sold. Replying to  reporters questions, Minister Ben-Eli'ezer said the inauguration  of the project and his tour of the Golan 10 days before the  Clinton-al-Asad summit have no political significance. He noted  that the tour was planned three months ago and that the  government will continue to aid in the development and expansion  of the Golan settlements.</p>

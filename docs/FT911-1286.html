			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Impatient Bush returns to work: US markets reflect lingering doubts over health of the president PRESIDENT George Bush eag-erly returned to work at the White House yesterday after spending two nights in hospital being treated for an irregular heartbeat. The news that the previously fit and vigorous Mr Bush, who will be 67 next month, has a heart problem sent shock waves through both the political world and the financial markets. The dollar had weakened overnight on concern about the president's condition, but rallied temporarily on the news that he was returning to the White House. In the US bond and equity markets, relief at Mr Bush's return to work was overshadowed by lingering doubts about his health. The Dow Jones industrial average was lower for much of the day but it recovered on light end-of-session buying to close 2.78 higher at 2941.64. Doctors at the Bethesda Naval Hospital said they believed drugs alone could deal with a condition known as atrial fibrillation which Mr Bush developed late on Saturday afternoon while jogging. Dr Burton Lee, the White House physician, said Mr Bush had 'no physical problems of any kind that we can detect other than the irregular heartbeat'. His heartbeat returned to normal late on Sunday, became irregular again early yesterday and then stabilised after he returned to the White House. Mr Bush was discharged from hospital after the doctors decided against an electric shock treatment known as cardioversion which they had warned might be necessary. Doctors will continue to monitor Mr Bush's progress at the White House. Mr Bush, who yesterday saw Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, made no secret of his impatience to leave hospital. Looking fit and well on his return to the White House, he said he wanted to get back to work. The weekend's events also raised questions about the low public standing of vice-president Dan Quayle, who would succeed Mr Bush if he died. Under the 25th amendment to the US constitution, Mr Quayle would have temporarily taken over the powers of the presidency if Mr Bush had had to be sedated to have the electric shock treatment, which has so far not been needed. Mr Quayle is still rated lowly in opinion polls as a possible president and there was renewed debate in the US press about whether Mr Bush should retain him on the ticket as vice-president in next year's election.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ze": "Vojtech Bugar in First Position"] </F>   [Text] The editorial office of [Hungarian-language Slovak  daily] UJ SZO asked its readers in which Hungarian politician in  Slovakia they have the most confidence. According to the 1,153  responses received, the largest number of votes, 798, went to  [Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement Chairman, MKDH] Vojtech  Bugar. [Chairman of the MKDH parliamentary group] Pal Csaky was  second, with 683 votes; [Coexistence Deputy Chairman] Arpad  Duka-Zolyomi third, with 492 votes; [Coexistence Chairman]  Miklos Duray fourth, with 357 votes; and [Hungarian Civic Party,  MOS, Chairman] Laszlo Nagy fifth, with 257 readers' votes.  Similarly, the MKDH received from the readers of the  Hungarian-language daily 533 votes; Coexistence was second, with  380 votes, and MOS third, with 231. The editorial team does not  claim that the survey was representative. Nonetheless, it is  interesting and, for the uninitiated, perhaps even surprising  that Miklos Duray finished only in fourth place and was even  overtaken by his party colleague Arpad Duka-Zolyomi. Vojtech  Bugar's popularity is the result of his politically prudent  decisions. When we consider that it is the result of a  longer-term trend, it also signals that our Hungarian fellow  citizens prefer a realistic policy to a radical one.</p>

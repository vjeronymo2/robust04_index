			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: FUN IN THE KITCHEN IS OUT OF DAD'S RANGE  </P> <P> When I fantasized about coming home from the Women's Revolution, I always  visualized Tara. I saw my husband anxiously pacing the veranda, and when he saw  me coming down the long, dusty road, tired and numb, he ran to meet me halfway.  Then he lifted me off my feet and said, "Come in and rest. I have a roast in  the oven with new potatoes, baby carrots, a Caesar salad and a surprise for  dessert."  </P> <P> Somehow I never visualized him sitting in front of the TV set yelling, "How  long is dinner going to be?"  </P> <P> I am not alone. Ninety percent of married women who work outside the home do  most of the cooking. The majority of them get a meal to the table in less than  30 minutes. Nearly 80% do not eat out because of the exorbitant prices.  </P> <P> Men live by the old adage, "If God had wanted men to cook, he would never have  invented women."  </P> <P> The male mindset about cooking intrigues me. Some men will go to the store.  Some men will set the table. Some men will make coffee in the morning. A few  will set a cereal box on the table. Beyond that, most men will not cross over  the line. They have no curiosity about how to turn on the stove. They have  never seen a naked chicken. They see no adventure in tearing along a dotted  line.  </P> <P> My theory is that it's not so much a macho thing as it is fear. I think to them  a kitchen is the Temple of Doom. All those whirling blades, open fires,  arsenals of knives, boiling pots and dinging bells make 'em crazy. They're flat  out intimidated by them in action. So they act like they're above them. They'll  fix a disposal, but they won't feed one. They'll unstick ice cube trays from  the freezer, but they won't fill them with water. They'll sharpen knives, but  they won't use them.  </P> <P> On the other hand, put them in the back yard in a cute little apron and a  chef's hat and they're Betty Crocker.  </P> <P> As I have often told my husband, "I'm replaceable, you know. Anyone who can  read can get a meal to the table. There's nothing to it. Cooking isn't a  talent. It's an exercise." Yet whenever I come in late, there he is, sunk into  a chair in front of the TV set waiting for the proverbial "dinnnahhh." If I  didn't come home for two years, there is no doubt in my mind he would sit there  until he would decompose and neighbors would eventually call the police to haul  his starved bones away.  </P> <P> I'd like to be able to report the next generation of men is being converted to  "kitchen," but this doesn't seem to be the case. Both of my sons consider  chicken Kiev a Russian wimp and Hungarian peppers two rock sisters on MTV.  </P> <P> One kid who eats every meal out said to me recently, "I just paid $2.50 for a  hot dog. How could you and Dad afford to feed me three or four at one meal?"  </P> <P> "I didn't give you a paper napkin," I said.  </P></p>

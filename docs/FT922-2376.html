			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Algiers' corruption clean-up gamble: The risk of demoralising officials while seeking trust TOSSING a bomb into a munitions dump was how one observer summed up the likely consequences of Algeria's bringing to trial General Mostefa Beloucif, who was arrested last month on charges of embezzling state funds. Gen Beloucif, secretary general of the defence ministry from 1980 to 1987, was widely regarded as the second most powerful man in Algeria after former President Chadli Bendjedid, who stepped down in January. His arrest came a few days after the publication by the daily El Watan of a confidential report by a committee of five generals, including the current defence minister, Gen Khaled Nezzar. Gen Nezzar is also a member of the High Executive Council (HEC), which has ruled the country since the electoral process was suspended five months ago after the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won the largest share of the popular vote in the country's first multi-party elections. Algerian leaders may be gambling that a clean-up is key to winning a measure of popular trust. Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, who returned from 28 years' exile to head the HEC, has made clear his determination to root out corruption. Senior colleagues such as Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the energy minister, accept that the gravest challenge they face as they seek to implement reforms - as complex and painful as any taking place in eastern Europe - is 'the credibility gap between the people and the leadership built up through years of mismanagement'. He recently told US oil executives: 'A large segment of the population has, I am afraid, lost confidence in the capacity of the leadership to provide jobs, housing, health care and its ability to combat corruption.' However, a series of corruption trials is unlikely to reduce backing for the more than 4,400 remaining alleged FIS supporters who still languish in desert camps, and risks further demoralising civil servants and senior technocrats. The hitherto unthinkable is meanwhile happening in the economic sphere. Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, prime minister, has conceded: 'There are no longer any taboos. If shares in state companies have to be sold to private investors, be they Algerian or foreign, we will do it.' But more action will be needed to convince the private sector, the myriad state company managers who are sceptical of reforms, western companies which have signed up for investments worth nearly Dollars 2bn in 122 local joint ventures since legislation was liberalised two years ago, and the IMF with which a new facility is being negotiated. Public enterprises - not all of which are in dire straits - are still paralysed by the uncertainty about their future. Many leading international companies have responded to the liberalising of oil and gas exploration policies last year by signing contracts. Joint ventures have also been agreed, many with private Algerian companies, which allow for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, car parts, computers and building materials. As a gesture of support the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, has agreed to lend Dollars 10m to support a joint venture between the Algerian state oil company Sonatrach, France's Air Liquide and Air Products of the US to build a helium plant. Further foreign investment will depend in large part on domestic stability. A second challenge faced by the authorities is to rekindle some kind of dialogue with the fundamentalists. And, what is critical, the public has to be convinced that economic hardships ahead will not be another opportunity for a few people to line their pockets and foreign bank accounts. Presidential elections could take place before the end of the year 'if all the political conditions are assembled,' Communications Minister Abou Bakr Belkaid said yesterday, AP reports from Algiers. Mr Belkaid, speaking to foreign journalists, said the candidacy of Mohammed Boudiaf, president of the High Executive Council which rules the country, is a 'strong hypothesis.'</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Butte loss static at Pounds 355,000 Butte Mining, the UK company whose main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits  -it is seeking damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) from former managers and promoters - has reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 355,000 for the six months to end-December and the result for the full year is not expected to be any worse than this. The interim result is little changed from the Pounds 336,000 deficit in the same period last year. Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said the past six months 'have been frustrating, with no action by the Federal District Court judge in Montana on any of the substantive motions in front of him.' 'Until the judge rules on these motions, a court date cannot be set. We have developed an extremely strong case and look forward to the opportunity of presenting it in court,' he added. In the second half of this year, Butte expects to finish restructuring and floating VAM, an Australian gold company, and to receive about ADollars 800,000 (Pounds 394,000) from this transaction. This will provide funding to develop some of the company's property in Montana.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOVIETS CUT HUNGARIAN OIL 30%  </P> <P> Hungary has been informed it will suffer a 30% reduction in Soviet crude oil  deliveries and will have to look for other suppliers to fend off fuel  shortages, a government spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Spokesman Balazs Laszlo told a press conference a Hungarian negotiating party,  which went to Moscow to try to persuade the Soviets to adhere to the current  Soviet-Hungarian trade agreement, had been informed of the cuts Thursday.  </P> <P> The negotiating team had gone to Moscow after Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai  Ryzhkov announced a 7 million ton -- or 5% -- cut in Soviet oil exports  overall.  </P> <P> Laszlo said the Soviet cuts came in the wake of "the gradual depletion the  established oil fields in the Soviet Union." He added, "The Soviet economy  showed signs of a general collapse."  </P></p>

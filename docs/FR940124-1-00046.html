			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In sum, to implement section 496(n) of the HEA, the proposed regulations make it clear that in evaluating an agency's application for recognition, the Secretary may not and does not depend solely on written submissions from the accrediting agency or on announced visits to the agency or its member institutions or programs. The Secretary makes a more thorough and independent evaluation of an agency's application for recognition, including, where appropriate, unannounced visits to ensure that information available to the designated Department official is comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased, and to ensure that the agency is actually carrying out its stated policies and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope of recognition requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under &sect;602.10(b) of the current regulations, in order for an accrediting agency to be recognized by the Secretary, the agency has to meet each recognition criterion taken as a whole unless it can demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that one or more criteria should not be applied. In &sect;602.13(c) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires an agency to meet each of the requirements contained in this part. However, in &sect;602.13(e) the Secretary proposes that the Secretary may exercise discretion and grant recognition to an agency that does not comply with each requirement if the Secretary determines that the agency's effectiveness is not impaired by its noncompliance. Such discretion might, for example, be exercised if an accrediting agency is unable to conduct an unannounced site visit, as required by &sect;602.24, because the program being evaluated is offered on a military installation that requires prior approval before any visitors are permitted on the installation. The Secretary believes that Secretarial discretion provides the desired flexibility that non-Federal negotiators sought during the negotiated rulemaking sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consensus was reached by negotiators regarding the elements to be included in the scope of recognition the Secretary grants to an agency,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., geographic area, the degrees or certificates awarded, the types of courses or programs offered, and the length of the recognition period. In the proposed regulations, the Secretary has clarified that an agency's scope of recognition does not automatically extend to any preaccreditation status it offers. Rather, when an agency formally applies for recognition, it must include the types of preaccreditation status for which it seeks recognition, and the Secretary grants recognition to an agency for each preaccreditation status if the agency complies with all the requirements for recognition with regard to that preaccreditation status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.14&blank; Limitation, Suspension, or Termination of Recognition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496(l) of the HEA permits the Secretary to limit, suspend, or terminate the Secretary's recognition of an accrediting agency before the completion of the agency's recognition period if the Secretary determines that the agency has failed to meet any of the requirements of part 602. In &sect;602.14 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes the procedures to be followed before the Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition. The proposed procedures allow the agency to request a hearing to contest that action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that, if an agency requests a hearing, the hearing will be conducted by the Advisory Committee. However, the Secretary further proposes that the hearing may be conducted by a subcommittee of the Advisory Committee, consisting of three members of the Advisory Committee, if the schedule of the full Advisory Committee would not permit a hearing to be held in a timely manner. After evaluating the evidence presented before it, the Advisory Committee or subcommittee makes a recommendation to the Secretary as to whether the sanction proposed by the designated Department official, no sanction, or another sanction is warranted. Any hearing held under this section is open to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the negotiated rulemaking sessions, in response to non-Federal negotiators' concerns about the lack of sufficient appeal mechanisms, the Secretary added to this section a provision that either party in a hearing may appeal the Advisory Committee's or subcommittee's recommendation to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

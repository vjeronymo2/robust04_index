			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY-BASHING AND THE DISNEY GROOMING POLICY  </P> <P> Here we go again with another round of Disney-bashing over its grooming policy,  the "Disney Look." It is quite obvious that The Times and its readers who  oppose the Disney Look are not aware of the Disney organization, its policies  and its philosophies. Let's set a few facts straight.  </P> <P> Walt Disney was not an employee of Walt Disney Attractions, the division that  operates the theme parks in Anaheim, Orlando, Tokyo, and, soon, Paris.  Therefore, he was not covered by the Disney Look. Any Disney character  possessing facial hair is not an employee of Walt Disney Attractions; they are  copyrighted characters owned by the Walt Disney Co. The persons performing the  roles of these characters comply with the Disney Look because they are  employees of Walt Disney Attractions.  </P> <P> The Disney Look is a clean-cut, natural look that does not divert the guests'  attention away from the park as would long hair, facial hair, heavy makeup,  excessive jewelry and any extreme appearance. One need not get paranoid over  who will be targeted next, as one reader expressed about the future of men with  thinning hair. The Disney Look does not prohibit natural baldness; it does  prohibit shaved heads.  </P> <P> The Disney Look works. It is one reason Disneyland has changed the image of  amusement parks from that of dirty places operated by surly personnel to that  of a clean place staffed by courteous, well-groomed employees. Now it can even  be said to be their trademark look. Throughout the years that the policy has  been in effect, the quality of the employees has not diminished, and the  reputation of Disney has been unsurpassed by its competitors.  </P> <P> Those opposing the Disney Look always complain that Disney should get with the  times, but a time-proven idea such as this is far superior to the alternative,  me-first, do-as-I-please attitude that prevails today among many people. This  non-offensive, timeless standard demands the best from each employee, and that  in turn has helped more than one-half billion guests enjoy their visits to the  Disney theme parks.  </P> <P> MARIO MOTA  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

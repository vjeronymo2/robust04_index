Minister Bar'am  estimated that another four or five cabinet ministers supported  his position. In his opinion, yesterday's cabinet decisions  were insufficient and did not meet the urgent need to halt a  deterioration of the situation. Minister Bar'am was speaking in  an interview to Qol Yisra'el.    Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that he had  information that reserve IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers  were training groups from the Jewish Defense League, Kakh, and  Kahana Hay in the United States. Tzaban told Qol Yisra'el that  last year, the Kahana Hay movement had trained 200 youths in New  York. Three graduates of that course arrived in Israel and  embarked on violent tours of the territories. Minister Tzaban  called for a ban on entry into Israel for members of these  groups.</p>

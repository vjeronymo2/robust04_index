			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Lloyd's defers pressing its claims on Names / A look at reaction to the insurance market's decision to bring in a six-month moratorium on writs LLOYD'S NAMES reacted with a mixture of consternation and confusion yesterday to the insurance market's decision on Thursday to defer issuing any new writs in pursuit of outstanding debts. Mr Peter Middleton, the London market's new chief executive, says that no more of the 3,500 letters sent to Names establishing their debts would be converted into writs until April next year. Lloyd's says these debts total about Pounds 360m. He says the extra six-month moratorium would allow Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - more time to cope with 'temporary insolvency' and to liquidate their assets without making such substantial losses. A total of 549 of these Names have already paid what they owe since receiving the letters but the news makes no difference to almost 200 Names who have already been issued with writs. Mr Richard Peacop, a Name with a writ, says: 'This is totally cynical. Six months' delay is neither here nor there. It still leaves your neck hanging over the block.' In a letter to Mr Michael Freeman, a solicitor representing many Names taking action to resist paying their cash calls, Lloyd's stressed yesterday that its decision was designed to give more time to Names who had just been notified of their debts. It was not a general amnesty affecting others who have been aware of demands for longer. The first legal action - a summary judgment in the commercial courts - is not expected until March. Other appeals, including one to the European Commission, will take considerably longer. By the time the six months are up, Mr Middleton says that many other things will have changed. Two panels he has created - one on open years and another on errors-and-omissions policies, covering market indemnity - will report by early next month and efforts 'significantly' to reduce the cost base of the market will already be well under way. Names already facing legal action are concerned that those given more time will turn their backs and not offer funding and support to groups fighting Lloyd's. They also believe there is a moral obligation on other Names to help them, since any judgment will set a precedent which applies to them all. Mr Philip Dinkel, vice-chairman of the writs response group, which is helping to co-ordinate the legal defence, remains confident that the cases can nonetheless be effectively funded - and won. Mr Freeman warns that, without additional financial support, preparation of the defence cases could be jeopardised as the costs escalate. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, who met Mr Middleton with four MPs just before the public announcement, remains convinced that the new chief executive has generated a U-turn in the approach of Lloyd's to Names. Mr Middleton, by his own admission, is performing 'a juggling act'. He must delicately balance the interests and human tragedy of Names against both the needs of policyholders to be paid and the long-term reputation of the market. He already takes heart from a decline in the number of resignations from membership, at 1,351 so far this year out of a total of 34,000, compared with 3,166 by the same time last year. The number of new Names joining this year is just 50. One suggestion is that recent reports of mental stress and suicides have propelled motivated Lloyd's into taking action. One Lloyd's Name killed herself recently in Wales and Mr Fred Yeo and Mr Charles Bailey, two Canadian Names, also took their own lives in recent weeks. 'It's tragic,' says Mr Middleton. 'We are human beings and we are affected by what has happened. We are trying to do everything we can to help those Names.' Mr George Pakozdi, a dentist living in Toronto, Canada, who is a member of the Lime Street members agency and knew both Canadians who committed suicide, says he is convinced they were driven to suicide by pressure for repayments from Lloyd's. He adds: 'They had been healthy, well-adjusted men, but they could see no future. There isn't a day that goes by when you don't get something from Lloyd's. It seems it will never end. I hope something comes from their sacrifice.'</p>

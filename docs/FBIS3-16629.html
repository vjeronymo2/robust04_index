			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, 17 Mar -- The scheduled holding of  Croatian-Serbian talks on 22 March at the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb is no surprise for the Croatian side. Russian special  presidential representative Vitaliy Churkin told journalists  this after his consultations on Wednesday [16 March] evening  with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. "We had previously been  studying with President Tudjman and other Croatian officials the  matter of the meeting that has been announced. It was therefore  nothing unexpected for him," V. Churkin said. In his opinion,  it is necessary next week above all to sign a document on  ceasing hostile actions, which would guarantee the  non-resumption of conflicts in and around the areas of Croatia  that are under UN control.    "Recently we have been working really hard to make it  possible. Agreement in principle to sign such a treaty was  reached previously, but it did not happen for reasons of a  political and emotional character," V. Churkin noted. "The  Croatian side is ready for a dialogue and will take part in the  talks at the Russian Embassy," Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, the Croatin  president's press assistant, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent  today.    Meanwhile, the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned today from  well- informed diplomatic sources in Zagreb, that by no means  all the obstacles capable of preventing the signing of the  document next Tuesday have yet been removed. V. Churkin will  continue discussion of the problems of the Croatian territories  under UN control in Washington, for which he left by air this  morning.</p>

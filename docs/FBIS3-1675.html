Statistics from the customs department show that last year  China's exports of electronics products reached 8.11 billion  U.S. dollars, up 18.1 percent from the previous year;  foreign-funded electronics enterprises gained an export income  of 4.43 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 54.6 percent of the  total export value of electronics products.    In the past few years, the Chinese Government has been  paying  special attention to the electronics industry, and defined it as  the state's pillar industry for key development. Early last  year the State Council re-established the Ministry of the  Electronics Industry to reinforce the administration and  management of the industry.    Statistics show that last year the national electronics  industry finished a total output value of 175 billion yuan,  constituting some 5.2 percent of the country's total industrial  output value. Of the industry's 40 kinds of major products, 32  had big increases in output, which included ground stations for  satellite communications, program-controlled switching,  micro-computers, telephones and videorecorders.    Experts from the electronics sphere said the country's  electronics industry is now facing new development  opportunities, for which the reasons are:    The state is accelerating the construction of economic  information systems to improve and reinforce macro-control  means; various industries are showing great enthusiasm in using  electronic information technology to remold traditional  industries; the demand by national economy and social life for  various electronic products has kept on increasing, which  provides a broad market for the industry; many foreign companies  have expressed interest in the Chinese market, and the industry  has met with an unprecedented boom in foreign cooperation.    To speed up the readjustment of industrial and product  structure, the ministry has defined nearly 20 key construction  and technological remolding projects, including integrated  circuits, mobile telecommunications, facsimile equipment,  new-type program-controlled phone exchanges, and the  second-phase project of video recorder and video camera.</p>

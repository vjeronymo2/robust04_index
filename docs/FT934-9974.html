			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Economics Notebook: Reality plays tricks with Emu theory It is, according to one old saw, better to travel hopefully than to arrive. But as in so many things in life, the European Community is turning conventional wisdom on its head. Increasingly, the transitional second stage of economic and monetary union, which starts on January 1, is shaping up to be an especially difficult venture with many incalculable problems. By contrast, the third and final stage of Emu, with its planned single currency and central bank, has been subject to so much analysis and discussion over the past five years that its hazards, although real enough, appear familiar and less daunting. The second stage of Emu is supposed to pave the way for fully fledged monetary union towards the end of the decade. In it, EC member states are to strive for ever greater convergence of economic performance, particularly in terms of price stability and sound public finance, and to step up policy co-ordination. Such far reaching changes are best attempted on a sound institutional basis and against a favourable economic background. The past year's crises in the European exchange rate mechanism and the continuing recession on the continent mean neither condition applies at present. Compounding the difficulties are policy inconsistencies, notably in France, and widely divergent ideas among member states as to how far the EC should move down the path of institutional integration in stage two. With the community heading for yet another year of sub-optimal growth, the economic background is especially bleak. Although Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC's economic affairs commissioner, has suggested that EC growth could be as high as 2 per cent next year, others are far less hopeful. The commission's own forecasters have suggested that growth next year will be about 0.9 per cent, largely because they believe Germany is heading for another year of declining economic activity. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister and current president of the EC economic and finance ministers' council, noted last week that the commission was likely to revise its growth forecasts upwards. But he added that many countries, including Belgium, would not be following suit. Low growth will make it more difficult for member states to control their budget deficits and so will hamper progress towards meeting the Maastricht Treaty's convergence criteria, which include a 60 per cent limit for the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product. In the absence of draconian public spending cuts, which would be politically risky, public debt is bound to keep rising as a percentage of GDP in those EC countries where economic growth rates are lower than real interest rates. This condition applies in France and Belgium. In Belgium's case, where the ratio of debt to GDP is around 130 per cent, the outlook is one of further deterioration unless and until growth exceeds real interest rates. In spite of last month's easing of Bundesbank monetary policy, that date is probably some way off. Doubts about convergence will make EC economies vulnerable to financial market pressures in stage two. Belgium's debt problem has exposed its currency the Belgian franc to selling pressure in recent weeks. International investors have also been looking askance at other signs of economic divergence that are not singled out in the Maastricht Treaty. France's sharply rising unemployment rate was a key factor behind the loss of confidence in the French franc ahead of the July and August currency crisis that culminated in the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands to 15 per cent. Looking ahead, there is no early sign that French unemployment will decline from its current 11.8 per cent level, while youth unemployment at about twice that rate is especially disturbing. The joint Franco-German convergence programme, unveiled on Tuesday, has caused surprise among some European officials for its optimistic view that French growth could be as much as 3.5 per cent after 1995. One non-official view, expressed last week by Professor Christian de Boissieu of the Sorbonne University in Paris, was that growth would be nearer 2.5 per cent. As worrying to European monetary officials is an apparent lack of coherence in French monetary policy. At a recent monetary conference in Amsterdam, Mr Andre Icard, director general of research at the French central bank, insisted that currency stability was the main plank of monetary policy, in spite of the franc's decline against the D-Mark since August. But he also said France would pay more attention to the M3 money supply measure than in the past. Those who took his remarks at face value were left wondering how the Bank of France would react to conflicting signals from its chosen indicators. Others concluded that France's current monetary policy was to shadow German interest rates. According to Mr Maystadt, the planned European Monetary Institute, which is due to begin operating in Frankfurt in January, is the ideal institution to iron out such wrinkles and demonstrate consistency of decisions among national central banks in the run up to stage three. But that presupposes that EC member states will have achieved a consensus on what the EMI should do and on the technicalities and instruments of an eventual Europe-wide monetary policy. Although discussion on the role and functions of the EMI is just beginning, it is already clear that there are wide divergences between authorities such as the Belgian finance ministry that see it as an instrument to force integration and the Bank of England and Bundesbank which think its role should be mainly advisory. It is too early to predict that the problems of stage two will prove so great as to jeopardise the goal of monetary union. But they are much greater than when the Maastricht Treaty was signed in February 1992 and throw an unflattering light on the EC's habit of setting deadlines for policy change without regard to economic developments.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Miyazawa returns after talks in Washington Japan's prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, yesterday returned to Tokyo after two days of talks in Washington to a chorus of concern about the prospects for Japan's economic relations with the US on both trade and macro-economic issues, Charles Leadbeater writes from Tokyo. Most business leaders raised doubts about the wisdom of US demands for quantitative indicators to measure foreign access to segments of the Japanese market. There are also concerns that the US is embarked on a strategy to talk up the yen, to help choke off the growth of Japan's trade surplus with the US. Mr Miyazawa's visit confirmed worries in Japan that the Clinton administration will be more assertive than its predecessor in pressing for measurable results in reducing the trade deficit. Mr Miyazawa and President Bill Clinton on Saturday agreed to set up a joint panel to design a forum for discussing ways to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Mr Clinton stressed such talks would have to lead to measurable results in opening the Japanese market to competitive US producers. He also noted that a strengthening of the yen against the dollar would help to reduce the Japanese surplus and that Japan's recent Dollars 117bn stimulus package was only a first step in resuscitating the flagging Japanese economy.</p>

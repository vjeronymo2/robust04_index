			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IACOCCA GOT $4 MILLION IN SALARY, STOCK, BONUSES, CHRYSLER SAYS  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca was awarded nearly $4 million in 1989  salary and stock and in bonuses earned the year before, the company's proxy  statement said today.  </P> <P> The amount Iacocca received topped the $2.5 million received by General Motors  Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith, but fell behind the $6.6 million awarded to Ford  Motor Co.  </P> <P> Chairman Donald E. Petersen, who retired March 1.  </P> <P> Iacocca was awarded $3.7 million in salary, bonuses and stock for 1988.  </P> <P> Chrysler executives received no cash bonuses for 1989 because of an agreement  with the United Auto Workers union that when the auto maker doesn't make enough  money in a year to grant profit-sharing checks to union members, executives get  no cash bonuses.  </P> <P> The nation's No. 3 auto maker reported 1989 earnings of $359 million, far below  the $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion reported by GM and Ford, respectively. Last  month, GM distributed profit-sharing checks of about $50 each to its eligible  employees and Ford handed out checks of about $1,025 each.  </P> <P> The UAW, which has called the GM and Ford executives' compensation levels for  1989 a "disease," had no immediate comment on today's Chrysler proxy statement.  </P></p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Trident sub loses Pounds 250,000 sonar gear BRITAIN'S latest Pounds 650m Trident missile submarine lost a crucial part of its defensive sonar equipment during sea trials, a parliamentary committee was told yesterday, David White writes. The all-party Commons defence committee also heard that delays in the command system software meant the submarine could not fire torpedoes. But it was told the system, designed by BAe-Sema, a joint venture between British Aerospace and the Anglo-French Sema group, would be ready by the time the vessel was deployed. HMS Vanguard, the first of four Trident submarines, is due to enter service in late 1994 or early 1995. The towed array, costing about Pounds 250,000, is part of the specially designed Sonar 2054 system provided by GEC-Marconi. 'We have not yet come up with any reason why it was lost,' Rear Admiral Richard Irwin said. But it appeared there had been an assembly error by either the supplier or VSEL, the submarine's builder.</p>

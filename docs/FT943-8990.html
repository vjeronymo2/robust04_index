			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Let's have fare play - As the English soccer season opens, Peter Berlin looks at how fans are fed At the top of the away terracing at Brisbane Road, home of Leyton Orient, an English second division soccer club, squats a hamburger shack. The terracing is exposed to the elements. When the wind blows it wafts the foul smell of greaseburgers and cooked canned onions down over the fans. When the rain falls it forms brown puddles amid the discarded plastics spoons, sugar, milk and tea spilt from the table next to the stand. The shack is an institution. Its occupant is known with affection as the 'fat frier'. Nowhere in England are travelling fans, usually regarded as unwelcome guests, treated so well. Inexplicably, fans seem to like the fare and, unusually, they can queue for, buy and eat their burgers without missing any action. Clubs know that catering can be lucrative. They offer spectators in the executive boxes smart pre-match meat-and-two-veg meals. They have restaurants and banqueting halls for pre and post-match meals. But the average fan wants no more than a quick snack before kick-off and at half-time. The result is an uneasy compromise: a limited menu of overpriced and sweaty burgers, sausage rolls, pies, Kit Kats, fizzy drinks, instant tea, Bovril and, when permitted, beer, with just about enough vending staff to get everyone back into their seats by five minutes into the second half if they spend the whole interval queuing. Compare and contrast with the Ballpark at Arlington, a baseball stadium opened this year, home of the Texas Rangers. A baseball crowd looks like an ants' nest. Regardless of the state of play, lines of people scurry up and own the aisles, ascending empty-handed, returning with laden cardboard trays, dodging the mobile vendors who sell drinks, ice-creams, pop-corn, hot dogs. At Arlington every step has been taken to make sure that the fans spend the entire three hours or more that a game lasts eating and drinking themselves into a coma. There is an upmarket restaurant, the Diamond Club, for holders of season tickets. This offers 'white tablecloth dining' in tiered seating which allows you to scoff and watch. There is a branch of TGI Friday's which also offers a view of the game. In 'preferred seating', ie ordinary seats that cost more, there is waiter service. A friendly young man regularly comes round and pesters spectators. Do they want even more nachos, burritos, hot dogs, beers, even Caesar salad? He taps the order and seat number into a hand-held computer, transmits it and seconds later another friendly young man appears with the food and the bill. Along the concourses behind and under the stands, the hot humid Texas air is filled with the smell of burning meat. There are 102 concession stands, all operated by Sportservice Corp of Buffalo New York. Some have droll baseball names: Short-Stop, H R (home run) Bakery, R B Ice Cream (a pun on RBI for run batted in) and Bambino's (which serves pizza and is named after Babe Ruth). There are yoghurt stands, barbecue sandwich stands, Tex-Mex stands. On the upper level there are four 'grilles', air-conditioned fast-food havens that sell the full range of hot dogs and drinks, and hamburgers and 'carved sandwiches'. You can cool off, eat, and still watch the game through the windows. It is not gourmet food but it is tasty, varied and attractively presented. The prices are not exorbitant and the queues are rarely long. But there have been unexpected drawbacks. The detritus from the eatathon is rinsed into the stadium's storm drains. There it has rotted in the humid Texas heat. The stench is worst near the best seats. The club has taped over drains and is planning to introduce machinery to blow the gases from the drains. The quality of food at Arlington is not unique. I visited the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, a modern, covered arena where the Expos baseball team plays. There are pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, croissants, salads and ice creams there, as well as a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. The food court offers the atmosphere and variety and quality of catering of British Rail's tarted-up London termini. There are also Montreal smoked meat sandwiches (with a strong chemical taste of flavourings and preservatives) and even poutine, a Quebecois dish of chips, gravy and cheese curd; traditional but hardly a delicacy. This is children's food and at the Olympic Stadium half the crowd seemed to be made up of delirious children in a screaming sugar frenzy. A few baseball stadiums, notably those in New York, share the British soccer approach. Yankee Stadium has a 'food court' somewhere in the bowels of the stand but it is hard to reach and queues are long. I went on opening day in April. The fans in the cheap seats were happy with a steady diet of beer, broken occasionally by a hot dog. The result, after three hours in the hot sun, was more fist-fights than I saw in the whole of last season at English soccer grounds. For soccer fans who travelled to the World Cup dreaming of better snacks in the land of fast food, the experience was more Orient than Arlington. This was in part because the matches have, for the most part, been played in old, or very basic American football stadiums. At Giants Stadium in New Jersey, the most solid foods on offer were hot dogs and dehydrated potato knishes sitting foil-wrapped in heated display cabinets. The soft drinks were flavoured with chlorine by the ice cubes. When Ireland played Italy there, in 90`F, the bars ran out of Evian water, at Dollars 1.70 for a tiny bottle. The beer supplies held up - a reflection of the appetites of the American Football fans who normally use the stadium. Strangely, given soccer fans' immobility, there were few vendors walking the aisles. In blazing Dallas they offered drinks. Small bottles of water 'ice cold' at kick off, merely 'cold' by half time, cost Dollars 3. There are pleasant surprises. The outdoor walkway around the Rose Bowl in Pasadena is filled with food stands: there are churros (fried, sugar-dipped ropes of dough), pizza and lots of ice creams and ice lollies as well as the usual hot dogs. But at most of the other grounds, at least those not surrounded by huge car parks, the best food is outside the stadium. The ageing Dallas Cotton Bowl, just a few miles from Arlington, sits in Fair Park, built to host fairs and exhibitions. There, the restaurants were open and vendors had set up stalls. There were sausages on sticks and turkey legs which looked as if they had come off ostriches and which British police would view as a potential weapon. On the shady approach to Stanford Stadium I had a burrito as big as a soccer boot from a friendly family stand serving Mexican food. It was bland, as Americanised Mexican food so often is and so stuffed with beans in a liquid sauce that it was impossible to eat standing up. But compared to anything on offer in Leyton on a Saturday afternoon, it seemed wholesome, exotic, tasty and generous. Sport, Page XVI</p>

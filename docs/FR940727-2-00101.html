The proposed action would authorize possession, but not operation, of the facility, for a period of five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Need for the Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The license for the facility was due to expire on October 13, 1989. The licensee made a timely request for renewal as a possession only license on August 10 and 31, 1989, for a period of 20 years which was later modified on February 14, 1994 for a period of five years. The proposed action is required to authorize continued possession, but not operation, of the facility, so that the licensee can complete its decommissioning plan and ultimately decommission the reactor facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Possession Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An alternative to the proposed action that was considered was not renewing the license. This alternative would have led to possession of a facility and radioactive material without authorization by law. This alternative did not provide an acceptable way for the licensee to possess the facility prior to decomissioning, or for decommissioning the facility in a controlled, coordinated manner. The other alternative was to renew the license for possession only a period of one year, but this would require license renewals on an annual basis until decommissioning is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reactor is defueled and all special nuclear material and source material have been shipped offsite or transferred to the State license. The only remaining radioactivity at the facility is activated reactor components. There is no potential for generation of further radioactive materials. The extension of the facility license as a possession only license for a five year period allows the licensee time to complete its decommissioning plan and affords it a reasonable time to implement decommissioning. Further, providing additional time for the licensee to develop and implement the decommissioning plan should lessen the environmental impact, in that radioactive materials will continue to be depleted by the decay process and the licensee will have an opportunity to better plan and conduct decommissioning activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives Use of Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources beyond those normally allocated for such activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the propose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for this proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request for a license renewal application dated August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994.

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> An ugly smudge is widening in the once clear, blue water of Lake Tahoe because  of man-made pollution and acid rain, said a scientist who has studied the lake  for 30 years. Charles Goldman, a limnologist -- one who examines the physical,  chemical and biological properties of fresh water -- told the American Assn.  for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Francisco that there is  "irrefutable scientific evidence one of the world's cleanest, largest,  loveliest lakes is deteriorating at a predictable rate." He said pollution has  caused algae to grow 5.5% a year, resulting in an annual water transparency  loss of 1 foot. The area's wildlife, economy and drinking water are also  threatened, Goldman said.  </P></p>

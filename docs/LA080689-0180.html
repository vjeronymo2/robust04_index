			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPARING NOTES WITH LUTOSLAWSKI  </P> <P> At 76, Witold Lutoslawski stands as one of the seminal figures of post-World  War II composition. Writing in most instrumental forms, he has had an impact in  the musical world far out of proportion to his relatively small output.  </P> <P>  He began his struggle toward a personal style early, notating compositions at  age 9. During the war, his efforts were necessarily submerged, as he played in  a piano-duo in a Warsaw cafe. Afterward, he found the arts bureaucracy of  Stalinist Poland unreceptive to his work, but by the mid-1950s was gaining a  reputation as a conductor of his own works in Poland.  </P> <P>  Lutoslawski has championed his cause in Los Angeles, most recently in 1985. On  Monday he will talk about his music and life with Los Angeles Philharmonic  composer-in-residence Steven Stucky at UCLA. Wednesday at Royce Hall he will  lead the Philharmonic Institute Orchestra in a program of his own compositions:  "Chain III" (1986), the West Coast premiere of the First Symphony (1947) and  the Cello Concerto (1970) with Institute director Lynn Harrell as soloist.  Institute members will also offer his String Quartet on a chamber music program  Friday, also at UCLA.  </P> <P>  A conversation with the avant-garde composer:  </P> <P>  Question: One of your characteristic traits is your unwillingness to  compromise in your creative work, your expression of truth through your music.  What does the concept "truth" mean in relation to such a non-semantic art as  music?  </P> <P> Answer: What I understand by truth in a piece of music is a genuine, honest  expression of what you have to convey to others. Loyalty to yourself, to your  own aesthetics, to your own aims. . . . A piece of music is true when it  reflects a personal, original artistic conviction without regard for the  consequences. You may wonder whether this position is not utterly egocentric  and whether society needs art created on the basic of such principles. It is my  deep conviction that society needs only such art. A work based on lies, on the  abandonment of principles for the sake of transitory, capricious aims like  pleasing the tastes of critics or the public, just to get applause or fame or  money -- those are the works that are not the products of purely artistic  motivation!  </P> <P> Q: The 20th Century has granted the intellect absolute dominance in every area  of human endeavor, including art. What role do emotion and intuition on the one  hand, and rationalism and intellectualism on the other, play in your work?  </P> <P> A: Anyone who is well versed in the composition process cannot fail to notice  that the rational factor dominates in my works. Mine is a deliberate, organized  working technique -- that is true.  </P> <P> However, I ascribe the most fundamental importance to what used to be called  inspiration. Although this term may be a bit pompous and imprecise, it is an  absolutely irreplaceable one to refer to the attitude, the spiritual state that  is essential to the act of creation. Everything that is authentic in a piece of  music is the result of inspiration.  </P> <P> Q: There are no operas in your oeuvre, and you have never permitted the use of  your music in the ballet. As a composer you clearly imply that music is the  most asemantic of the arts, and that any attempt to combine it with  extra-musical matters contradicts its fundamental message. . . .  </P> <P> A: I have always subscribed to an abstract concept of music. The only  unambiguous message that music in itself can convey is a musical one. Music is  music! Of course, that is not an adequate definition, since we know how  strongly music affects human emotions. What do they mean? What is their nature?  Must these emotions be given "extra" meanings?  </P> <P> Some people are inclined to interpret music in an extramusical way. . . . Less  sensitive listeners feel alien in the world of sound; their thoughts escape to  a realm of images or feelings that do not exist in a given piece of music. This  is a subjective reaction to music.  </P> <P> But there are people of greater musical sensitivity -- composers, for instance  -- who do not have this anxiety reflex, who confront the sounds directly. For  them, the sounds are part of such a rich, various beauty that they have no need  to search for anything beyond the sounds themselves.  </P> <P> Q: In 1949, your First Symphony was branded a "formalist" piece and banned from  public performance in Poland. Why was that infelicitous term so significant in  relation to such an asemantic art as music?  </P> <P> A: I never understood what that was supposed to mean. In my opinion it was  nothing but typical "art official" jargon, useful for persecuting artists who  retained some individuality, whose creativity didn't conform to the "socialist  realism" that was obligatory in Poland at that time.  </P> <P> But in any case, the fact remains that my symphony was labeled formalist and,  as such, was not performed in my country for 10 years. After the last  performance of the work at the Polish National Philharmonic Hall in 1949, the  minister of culture stormed into the conductors' room and in front of a dozen  people announced that a composer like me ought to be thrown under the wheels of  a streetcar. It is interesting that this was not meant as a joke -- he was  really furious! This story is quite true, although nowadays it does sound  anecdotal; it is also an illustration of most artists' situation in Stalinist  Poland.  </P> <P> Q: Could you tell me what the sources of your aesthetic, artistic and  compositional inspiration were in these days, or even earlier?  </P> <P> A: In my musical career the works of various composers have served as models  for me. The Viennese classics, above all; Beet-hoven, as an unequaled master of  large-scale forms in general; Haydn and Mozart as well.  </P> <P> Brahms' symphonies and concertos, on the other hand, despite my sincere love  for them, had a negative creative impact on me, and its polemical reaction is  evident in many of my works, such as my Second Symphony or String Quartet,  which oppose Brahms' concept of large-scale forms as a matter of principle. . .  . I confess that I always feel exhausted after a performance of a Brahms  symphony, concerto or even a sonata, probably because there are two main  movements -- the first and the last -- in each of them.  </P> <P> These considerations led me to search for other possibilities, and I finally  found a solution in a two-movement large-scale form in which the first movement  prepares for the main one to follow. . . . During the first movement, the  listener is supposed to expect something more important to happen, and may even  grow impatient. This is exactly the situation when the second movement appears  and presents the main idea of the work.  </P> <P> This distribution of the musical substance over time seems natural to me, and  conforms with the psychology of the perception of music. I have composed  several works in this form, the most characteristic being my String Quartet  (1964) and Second Symphony (1967).  </P></p>

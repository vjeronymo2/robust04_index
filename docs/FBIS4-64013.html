			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By an ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The majority of deputies of  the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament,  believes that a sensible pragmatism should dominate in the  Russian foreign policy, chairman of State Duma Ivan Rybkin said,  receiving Iraqi ambassador in Russia Hasan Fahni Jum'ah on his  request today.    "I want to tell you frankly that we would like to establish  cordial and friendly relations between Russia and Iraq," the  State Duma chairman said. He noted that with all changes taking  place in Russia, the state leaders should not forget their old  friends while making new friends.    Hasan Fahni Jum'ah, who has been performing his duties over  the past five months only, emphasised Russia's influence at the  international arena. "Taking into consideration a great  potential of the Russian people, one can say that Russia will  soon regain its past status in the world and restore the  balance, which was completely destroyed during the recent  years," the ambassador said.    Hasan Fahni Jum'ah and Ivan Rybkin also discussed the  strengthening of bilateral, interparliamentary cooperation  between Russia and Iraq, the State Duma press service informed  ITAR-TASS.</p>

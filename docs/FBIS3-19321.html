In the morning  Walter Hengl, the second SPOe member of the Tirolean Government  and provincial councilor for health and social matters, had  already announced his departure from politics and had suggested  Nationalrat deputy Walter Guggenberger as his successor.    Tanzer resigned from all his posts during the meeting.    Regarding a successor for Tanzer, the vote taken in the diet  group between Provincial Party Secretary Herbert Prock and  Nationalrat Deputy Walter Guggenberger led to a stalemate with  both receiving seven votes. A definitive decision is to be made  by the Provincial Party Executive Committee during a meeting on  Monday evening. [passage omitted]</p>

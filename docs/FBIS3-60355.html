			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article on the Environmental Agency, part of the larger </F> series entitled "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads," by Masaki  Kagoshima, Science and Technology Department reporter: "The  Environmental Agency -- Environmental Administration Faces Tough  Going"]    [Text] Global warming, ozone layer depletion, the acid  rain phenomenon, etc. Environmental disruption is progressing  quietly and steadily. Based on the current trend of increased  emphasis on environmental administration, the Environmental  Agency [EA] is trying to shift its policy to a global  environment preservation- oriented administration concerned with  the nation's overall policies from the current  regulation-oriented administration which emphasizes pollution  control and nature preservation. However, there is growing  criticism within the EA and outside that the "EA has no clear  policies," and that "it lacks the ability to work out plans."  The path toward "breaking away from old traditions" is unlikely  to be easy.  <H5>  The EA Falls Behind the Ministry of Health and Welfare </H5>   Recently, there is a growing "tense atmosphere" in the EA  because the Ministry of Health and Welfare [MHW] has spelled out  its plan to enact a new law designed to improve the water  quality of rivers, lakes, and marshes which are the source of  tap water.    Musty tap water in the metropolitan area and the Kinki area  and the detection of cancer-causing substances from water are  major problems. While tap water is under the jurisdiction of  the MHW, public waters such as rivers, lakes and marshes, which  are the source of tap water, are under the EA's jurisdiction.  Some people believe one cause for the EA's tense atmosphere is  the sense of crisis that "the MHW will make a raid into the EA's  jurisdiction using the opportunity of the enactment of the new  law."    There have been strident calls within the EA for some  measures to be taken to deal with "unsavory and dangerous  water." In response to the MHW revising water-quality standards  for tap water in late 1992, the EA began studying comprehensive  measures to improve water conditions through cooperation with  various ministries and agencies. As the EA is about to work out  water measures, the MHW is trying to take action by utilizing  the enactment of the new law as leverage. It can be said that  the EA was taken by surprise.    EA officials offered the excuse: "We have delayed coming up  with measures due to staff shortages." However, it is a fact  that many people were critical of the EA's slow moves, saying:  "Despite mounting public expectations for environmental  administration, the ministry failed to grasp it at an early  date."    As global environment disruption is advancing, it is  necessary to shift the emphasis of environmental administration  to global environment preservation-oriented policies, which  require wide- ranging measures on economy, international  relations and other issues, away from pollution control policies  centering on regulations. It can be said that the "tap water  issue" between the EA and the MHW indicates that although the EA  is trying to break away from old traditions in view of this  trend, it needs to make additional efforts.  <H5>  EA's Plans Are Leaked to Other Ministries and Agencies </H5>   The EA was set up in 1971 for the purpose of centralizing  pollution control administrations. From the beginning, the EA  has faced two problems. One is that the EA is a mixed force  comprised of officials who have been transferred temporarily to  the agency from other ministries, and another is that other  ministries and agencies, as well as industrial circles, are apt  to regard the EA with enmity.    Since environmental preservation measures such as pollution  control do not easily coexist with development and economic  progress, it is hard for the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry and industrial circles to accept them. In 1981, the EA  submitted to the Diet an "environment assessment bill" designed  to make a pre-survey of the impact of development works on the  environment, and to work out counter-measures. The EA faced  tough going from the initial stage of working out the bill due  to pressure from industrial circles and other ministries. When  the bill was compiled at long last, the EA had made considerable  concessions and the content of the bill was very different from  its original idea. For example, the EA excluded power plants  from the list of targets for environmental assessment. As a  result, Diet deliberations became entangled and the bill was  eventually scrapped.    Discord between career officials and officials temporarily  transferred to the EA is noted in the agency. EA's career  officials said in anger: "In some cases, EA's plans were  demolished in advance because its strategy toward important  projects were leaked to ministries and agencies to which  transferred officials originally belonged." Takashi Kosugi,  House of Representatives member (from the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP]) and former parliamentary vice-minister of  environment, expressed criticism, saying: "As officials  temporarily transferred from other ministries and agencies think  their job at the EA is merely a stopgap, they tend not to tackle  environmental administration in earnest. This is an abuse  caused by a mixed force."    The term "the faithful of the environmental persuasion" is  often used at the EA. This term refers to officials who entered  the EA resolving to contribute to the preservation of nature as  well as to solve pollution problems, and such officials show  their intense enthusiasm for tackling environmental problems.  They are irritated by the attitude of some transferred  officials who pay attention only to ministries and agencies to  which they originally belonged.    A senior official who had been temporarily transferred to  the  EA once fired subordinate officials, saying: "You have to work  hard while keeping in mind there are not many companies that  will accept so-called `Amakudari' [high government officials'  landing a fat job in a semi-government or private corporation  upon retirement] officials from the EA." The senior official's  remarks indicate EA officials would be unlikely to secure future  posts with private companies upon retirement unless they work  hard because the EA does not have a long history. A career  official who heard the story said in anger: "I entered the EA  because I want to tackle environmental problems. Working for  the sake of a future post means putting the cart before the  horse."  <H5>  No Strategy for Making the Next Move </H5>   The EA's current greatest concern is a basic environment  bill. At last the bill is likely to pass the current Diet  session. The basic environment law is the so-called  "constitution" concerning environmental administration which  will enable the transformation from the current anti-pollution  administration to an administration oriented toward preservation  of the global environment. Enactment of the bill is the EA's  long-cherished desire as all EA officials say: "Unless the bill  is enacted, we cannot make the next move toward concrete  measures to preserve the environment."    However, there is a view that even if the basic environment  law is enacted, it will be difficult for the present EA to "make  the next move immediately." This is because the EA has failed  to establish a full-fledged, systematic strategy toward  preserving the global environment. Kazuo Aichi, Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] member in charge of policy affairs and  former EA director-general, expressed his concern: "With the  transformation to an environment preservation-oriented  administration, the EA's policies will be entwined with various  factors such as the economy, diplomacy and education. EA  officials may be at a loss on how to deal with matters that they  have not dealt with before."    Taking into consideration the increasing importance of  environmental administration, Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the  LDP's Policy Research Council, stated his recommendation: "The  EA should be placed under the direct control of the prime  minister so it can check policies of other ministries and  agencies from the viewpoint of environment preservation." It is  noticeable that other politicians who had shown little interest  in environmental issues often comment on environmental issues,  including environmental taxes. The number of "supporters" for  the EA is steadily increasing.    Although EA Director General Wakako Hironaka was greatly  respected as an expert in environmental issues, she has failed  to make clear-cut statements on the issues. The director  general intends to overcome the current economic recession by  expanding environmental preservation investments.    However, it is reported that although she has urged sections  in charge to embody the idea, there has been barely any  response. It seems that Director General Hironaka's hope that  the "EA will be able to make positive comments" has not yet been  realized. One cause of this situation is the weakness of the  mixed force which is apt to give consideration to other  ministries and agencies. However, the main cause is that "since  the EA itself has failed to put its views on environmental  issues in order, its ability to work out plans is weak," (as  stated by Shinseito's Aiichi).    Meanwhile, there are some merits in the mixed force. There  is a view among career officials that, "thanks to efforts by  transferred officials who are proficient in negotiating with  other ministries," the basic environment law is about to be  enacted despite the resistance of other ministries and agencies,  (according to Toshiro Kojima, chief of the EA's Water Quality  Management Division). To make utmost use of the trend of  emphasizing environmental preservation, the EA should not grieve  about the shortage of staff or the mixed force but take an  attitude of changing its demerits into strengths.</p>

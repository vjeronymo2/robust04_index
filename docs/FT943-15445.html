			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / BBC programming to get extra Pounds 180m The BBC is setting up a programme strategy fund to channel Pounds 180m in extra finance into programmes over two years. The money, to come from savings and increased efficiency, is in addition to an extra Pounds 75m which has already been allocated to the main programme-making directorates. The fund is being created to ensure that the additional money goes to areas and types of programming which need strengthening. Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, said: 'Every single area of programming will benefit but a lot of it is going to go into expanding the amount of drama on BBC 1.' The BBC admitted yesterday that the corporation had 'a long history of under-performance' in popular drama, and cited disappointing programmes such as Grushko, a detective series set in Russia. The fund, which will have Pounds 60m to spend in the next financial year and Pounds 120m in 1996-97, was announced yesterday by Mr Birt as the corporation published its report and accounts for 1993-94 and made one of its new, more detailed reports on performance. In addition to the extra cash, the BBC said savings would also allow an increase in capital expenditure. The accounts show that the highest-paid member of the BBC board of management - almost certainly Mr Birt - received Pounds 266,783 in 1993-94, including a performance-related bonus payment of Pounds 16,000 and a pension payment of Pounds 28,062. Last year the highest-paid member - presumably Sir Michael Checkland, the former director-general  - earned Pounds 180,721. One of the main sources of savings of more than Pounds 100m a year has come from 'producer choice' - the system of allowing producers to buy services outside. BBC programme-makers have continued to carry out 90 per cent of their business with BBC Resources but full costing has led to a fall in demand from some services and there was a net loss of 700 jobs in the resources department over the year. Further gains came from cutting evasion of potential licence fee income from 8 per cent to 7.2 per cent and reducing the cost of collection from 5.8 per cent of licence fee income to 5.3 per cent. A Pounds 30m contingency fund to cover the first year of 'producer choice' was not needed. The BBC had total licence fee income in the year to March of Pounds 1.6bn and an operating surplus of Pounds 122m before restructuring costs of Pounds 53m. Last year there was an operating surplus of Pounds 5m after restructuring costs of about Pounds 100m. Borrowings were reduced to Pounds 63m. As part of the review of the BBC's activities Mr Birt recently spent 20 days visiting all parts of the corporation. He said: 'You come back from a journey like that and feel pretty cheerful about what is happening in the BBC.'</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPECT  </P> <P> The real problem with teaching is not money but respect. Kids, their parents,  and school administrators often treat teachers without the common courtesy and  respect that they would give their doctor or other professional person, like an  airline pilot or banker.  </P> <P> Students lie to their teachers, cut class, and whine about their homework and  grades. Parents bully teachers into doing things against their better judgment.  School administrators criticize teachers in private and in staff meetings, and  call endless "conferences" to discuss what could be more efficiently handled by  memos.  </P> <P> As a Los Angeles junior high and high school teacher (first in public, now in  private schools), I've been forced to change grades against my will, make  degrading apologies, and listen to endless abuse from people who think they  know more about my job than I do.  </P> <P> I feel that 20 years of teaching, with the vast majority of my former students  having good memories of the time spent with me, are my best references for my  qualifications as a professional instructor. You don't call your dentist a  fool, you trust his judgment. I am rarely asked for my honest opinion about  anything important regarding my job. I have never been asked by an  administrator what I don't like about the school's treatment of me.  </P> <P> I don't work for money, have never participated in a strike, and I spend hours  after school every day helping kids for no extra pay. I still love teaching and  do it for the kids, not for their parents or my bosses. And if I ever got a  little respect once in a while, I might remain a teacher for the rest of my  life!  </P> <P> BARRY KRAUSE  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

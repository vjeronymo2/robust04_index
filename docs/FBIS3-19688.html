In the SPD leadership it was said that at  the Executive Committee meeting Scharping primarily insisted  that his "financial policy guidelines" be supported. This means  Scharping's promise that an SPD-led federal government will not  raise the tax quota or net borrowing, within this framework  there is to be redistribution at the cost of high-wage earners,  the growth of the federal budget should be below that of the  nominal GNP. According to SPD Federal Manager Verheugen, these  "basic values" presented by Scharping were not contradicted in  the SPD Executive Committee. The Executive Committee discussed  the debate about income thresholds for a supplementary tax.  Verheugen said that in the Executive Committee there was  "complete agreement" that the planned solidarity surcharge of  7.5 percent for all, which the Federal Government is planning,  is to be rejected as unsocial. He said that the income  threshold of 50,000/100,000 German marks [DM] (single  people/married couples) does not refer to the gross income but  to the taxable income. According to SPD calculations, this would  affect 17.5 percent of single people, but 82.5 percent would be  better off; 14.4 percent of married couples would be [adversely]  affected but 85.6 percent would be better off. Verheugen stated  that, following these explanations, there were no controversies  about this matter in the Executive Committee.    In the SPD it was recalled that Scharping had not committed  himself to any detail. Last Friday the SPD chairman spoke of an  income threshold of DM50,000/DM100,000 (single people/married  couples), using "may" and said: "Whether this is done will be  decided by further deliberations." The matter must be seen "in  connection" with other financial policy projects. On Monday SPD  officials said that it is still open whether the demand for a  10-percent supplementary tax to replace the 7.5 percent  solidarity surcharge planned by the coalition is to be included  in the election campaign program. Scharping's advisers have  warned against including such details, which might prove null  and void after a stocktaking of the actual financial situation  of the Federal Government. For this reason, Scharping wants to  avoid giving detailed figures in the election program.    The SPD Executive Committee for the first time discussed the  draft, which was formulated under the leadership of Scharping  and his deputy Lafontaine. The final vote in the Executive  Committee is to be taken on 2 May, following discussions within  the party; the draft formulated by this process is to be passed  on as a motion for a resolution to the delegates of the SPD  Congress in Halle on 22 June.    Before the SPD Executive Committee meeting began on Monday  at  noon, the members of the body avoided continuing the public  debate that had started on the weekend. Lower Saxony  Minister-President Schroeder (SPD) was heard saying that he  considers the tax plans "highly sensible." Scharping said that  it is better to have a debate now than later. After DGB [German  Trade Union Federation] Chairman Meyer, who was once an SPD  Bundestag deputy, stated on the weekend that the income  threshold planned by Scharping is too low, Mr. Rappe, chairman  of the Chemical Industry Trade Union and SPD Bundestag deputy,  also voiced his concern on Monday.    At the Executive Committee meeting Baden-Wuerttemberg  Environment Minister Schaefer (SPD) came out against a  renunciation of a general speed limit, as envisaged in the draft  of the election program. Schafer said that both energy policy  and traffic policy favor a general speed limit. On the weekend  the election program draft was criticized by the Federal  Congress of Young Socialists in Herne. The draft is "boring and  without prospects." The Congress called for a red-green  coalition. "Our goal is the immediate opting out of nuclear  energy." The Young Socialists passed resolutions calling for  the "immediate abolition of compulsory military service." The  goal is "an FRG without an army" within eight years. Deputy DAG  [German Employees' Trade Union] Chairwoman Konitzer came out  against the income threshold mentioned by Scharping for a  supplementary tax; she called for thresholds of  DM80,000/DM160,000. Mr. Fuchs, the chairman of the Federation  of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade, criticized both the SPD  proposals and the solidarity surcharge planned by the coalition.</p>

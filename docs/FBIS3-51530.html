Alarcon pointed out that the goal of the Cuban Parliament at  the Work Centers is not to spread the same idea throughout the  country, but rather to expand it and really put it into  practice, effectively managing to streamline the nation's  internal finances.    (Jose Marrero Camacho), president of the Pinar del Rio  Assembly of the People's Government, explained to the union  leaders that in the province, for the purpose of eliminating  economic problems, it is more effective to raise production  efficiency than to raise the price of products. Theft that  increases costs; a lack of monitoring of the workforce; and  leaving one's job during the day to stand in line or to take  care of personal problems were examples presented in Pinar del  Rio as affecting the nation's internal economy.    During this meeting with provincial union leaders, with a  view to the parliamentary assemblies at the work centers, it was  suggested that every work group administer its own budget, and  that the work group especially demand trustworthy accounting.  Deputy (Maria Celia Santana) suggested that no personnel rosters  handed down from above be accepted. Others suggested eliminating  inappropriate egalitarianism [el igualitarismo] and paternalism.    A tax on salaries was amply discussed. CTC Secretary General  Pedro Ross Leal said profitability and efficiency should be at  the center of these discussions, with a view to solving problems.</p>

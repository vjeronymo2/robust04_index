			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / People: Quarta springs into action The gaping tear left in the management structure of motor components-to-aerospace group BBA by the forced resignation through illness of group chief executive John White in August is about to be mended. Roberto Quarta, 44, American-born son of an Italian tailor, is to move from his main board directorship at BTR to take over White's job from November 1. Quarta, who had been seen as one of the main rivals for BTR chief executive Alan Jackson's job as and when the latter retires, is expected to continue White's strategy of increasing BBA's growth around its core businesses of motor components, industrial materials, aerospace equipment and electrical equipment. Some BBA watchers who have been expecting BBA's acquisition rate to slow could still be in for a surprise. Quarta, said to rejoice in the nickname CS  -for coiled spring - among some colleagues, is unlikely to allow the group to mark time for long after getting his feet under White's desk. Apart from a four-year stint with motor and aircraft components group Hitchener in the US, Quarta has been a BTR man since 1978, when BTR took over the Massachusetts controls company of which he was then a vice-president. In addition to his main board role - undertaken at the start of this year - he has been chief executive of a number of BTR divisions, including automotive, construction services and electronics.</p>

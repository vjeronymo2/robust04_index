			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Hopes of recovery are raised HOPES that the economy might be recovering from recession were raised yesterday by an indication that manufacturing output grew for the third successive month in April. The purchasing managers index, which measures demand trends among big corporate and public-sector buyers, rose to 55.1 per cent last month, from 54.1 per cent in March. It was the highest level since the survey began in July. 'This latest rise suggests strongly that significant growth is under way in the manufacturing sector of British industry,' said the Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which carries out the survey. Earlier this month, the Central Statistical Office released figures showing that manufacturing output increased by 1.1 per cent in February. The survey, which covers 250 purchasing managers responsible for Pounds 250bn of corporate money each year, found that the new-orders index fell slightly last month, although it remained above the 50 per cent level. The prices index rose on the month.</p>

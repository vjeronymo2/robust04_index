			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (4): Ideas pooled to win jobs - Networks / The new awakening THE LACK of a strong identity or image has always been one of Hertfordshire's weaknesses. Its geography has pulled it in several directions - towards the East Midlands or East Anglia in the north, or towards London and the other home counties in the south. Though among the largest English counties in population, with nearly 1m inhabitants, it lacks a single main town; and, because of their differing histories and industrial backgrounds, its half a dozen sizeable centres vary widely in character. Stevenage in the north has long been an important industrial centre in its own right, with little to link it to Watford, which falls almost within the orbit of Heathrow in the west. Hoddesdon in the east has benefited as a distribution centre from its position on the route from the east coast ports; Potters Bar is a refugee from pre-1965 Middlesex and still looks for jobs and services to north London. Yet the coherence that has previously been difficult to achieve has recently shown signs of emerging. Where business and local government once went their separate ways, a series of networks has come into place across the county, leading the private and public sectors to pool resources and ideas for overcoming the problems caused by the loss of jobs in the defence and aerospace sectors. The twin centres of the new structure are the Tec, operating from a converted mill just outside St. Albans, and the county council which has thrown off a previous diffidence and involved itself in the fortunes of businesses big and small. The new University of Hertfordshire, having emerged from the chrysalis of Hatfield Polytechnic, has also involved itself in local economic initiatives, in order to establish its county-wide credentials; another main element, playing an important co-ordinating role, is the Hertfordshire Chamber of Commerce, which has most of the county's important industrial and service companies in membership. Since the mid-1980s there has also been a substantial growth in financial services, with firms such as KPMG Peat Marwick, Price Waterhouse and Hambros moving in, mainly to St. Albans, to provide sophisticated services previously available only in London. As they build up contacts across the county, these firms have themselves become nodal points on the Hertfordshire network. The first tangible result of this new spirit of co-operation has been the Hertfordshire Development Organisation (HDO), a partnership between local companies, the county and district local authorities, and the Tec. The last will itself seek to act as a bridge, linking companies which might want to come to the county with the relevant planning bodies and with developers. Particular emphasis is being placed on winning firms in areas where the county is already strong, such as computers, office equipment, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and financial and business services. Establishment of the HDO, which operates from another converted building - a barn between Hitchin and Stevenage - was one of the recommendations to emerge from a study of the county undertaken by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and a subsequent conference that brought together parties interested in economic regeneration. In much the same way, the Hertfordshire Business Centre, for which government One Stop Shop for Business status has just been won, is the outcome of a consultation exercise involving all 26,000 businesses in the county. To be set up shortly on a site in the centre of the county with the support of EC funds, it will serve the needs of all businesses but especially those employing between 10 and 200 people, and start-ups. It is planned that other economic agencies in the county will move to the site, which will also have out-stations in other centres linked over the county's Comnet voice and data transmission system. Independently, the county council has been trying to ensure, under chief executive Brian Briscoe, that it responds more effectively to the needs of businesses - and also makes known to them the opportunities they have to supply the Pounds 250m of goods and services the local authority consumes each year. A Business Forum, set up jointly with the Tec, enables larger businesses, local chambers, enterprise agencies and others to make their views known, at regular meetings, and to influence the way support is provided. Another initiative, the business charter, is designed to strip away the bureaucracy which many businesses find in their dealings with local authorities, which can very often obscure the services and information on offer. The most common concerns of businesses have been grouped under a series of headings - regulation, education, purchasing, roads and transport  -and hotlines set up to deal with inquiries in these fields. As a result, businesses will be able to find out quickly how county policies and Government and EC regulation are likely to affect them, and how they can have input into decisions. Just how effective the development of this new, closer relationship between all parties involved in Hertfordshire's economic life proves, remains to be seen, though the efforts of both the county and the Tec have drawn praise from business leaders. The change, according to Gerry Hopkinson, until recently senior partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in St Albans, has been marked: 'The county has changed from lack of interest in business to being very keen to talk. Together with the Tec, it has persuaded businesses in the county to network very effectively,' he says. Other structural problems remain. They include a disturbing lack of interest among local companies in exporting, according to Chris Humphries, managing director of the Tec; and continuing difficulty in obtaining long-term bank finance for small and medium-sized companies, particularly the owner-managed, which is forcing companies to operate on a short term basis. 'The banks are not lending for risk. If small companies are to lead us out of the recession, lending has to begin again,' argues Howard Wilkinson, senior partner at accountants, Mercer &amp; Hole. Paradoxically, by the time the results are showing through, the county as an administrative authority might not exist, for its demise is scheduled under current government plans for 1998. It may just be, however, that by then its unifying influence is not missed, a different Hertfordshire identity having been forged out of the recessionary problems of the past few years.</p>

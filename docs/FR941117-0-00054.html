			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of the Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. In favor: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Indiana Department of Motor Vehicles emphasizes the importance of the vision waiver as a tool to accurately assess the vision standards for commercial drivers, specifically addressing the condition known as amblyopia, or ``lazy eye.'' The State acknowledges that persons with less than perfect vision often develop scanning techniques to compensate for their disability, and that such techniques may actually increase their awareness of traffic and other conditions. The Tennessee Public Service Commission commented that it has grandfathered vision impaired CMV drivers and found no increase in incidents or accidents as a result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OOIDA, a national trade association representing the interests of a large number of independent owner-operators at both the Federal and State level, urged the FHWA to revalidate the waivers of the affected drivers because delay and uncertainty cause them significant harm. OOIDA believes that the FHWA's proposal ``strikes a careful balance between safety *&blank;*&blank;* and the federal policies underlying the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Optometric Association (AOA) supports the FHWA effort to study the performance of visually impaired drivers. The AOA believes ``it is virtually impossible to unequivocally delineate a visual standard,'' and therefore, contends that a waiver system is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daily Express, Inc., Mixson Oil Company, Inc. and Altim, Inc. offer the performance of their employees with waivers as examples of the ability of drivers to compensate for their disability and remain safe operators of CMVs. These companies express concern over replacing waived drivers with known safety records with other drivers whose safety record is not of the same high caliber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Private Truck Council (NPTC) also expressed support for the continuation of the vision waivers. The NPTC stresses the need for the type of data being collected from the waived drivers, as no such information currently exists. The NPTC believes that the FHWA's qualifying conditions for drivers, as well as the post-waiver conditions, ensure that those drivers holding waivers are safe operators of CMVs. The Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine also expresses the need for the data being gathered, although it has some reservations regarding the agency's study methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual drivers Thomas Breth, James Strickland and John M. Murphy also commented favorably to the October 6 notice. The latter commented on his own behalf and on behalf of a freightline company he owns and operates with his brothers. Mr. Breth, who petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit because he was excluded from the vision waiver study because he did not timely file, submitted extensive records relating to that litigation. Although he supports the waivers, he opposes limiting them to those drivers originally granted the waivers under the determination that was invalidated by the D.C. Circuit in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AHAS, supra.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers supports the 30-day extension of the waivers, but does not comment on the extension of the waivers through March 31, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. In opposition: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety accurately portrays the FHWA's premise for its ``consistent with safety'' determination as being that drivers with relatively clean driving records are at a lower risk for future accidents and that this is borne out in the crash experience of drivers in the waiver group as compared with the general commercial driver population. It concedes that the studies cited by the FHWA and other studies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  referred to in the IIHS comments ``(r)epeatedly *&blank;*&blank;* have shown that prior citations and crashes can be used as predictors of future crash risk (citations omitted),'' and acknowledges that such research ``amply justifies driver control policies based on driver records, such as point systems, suspensions, and revocations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Gebers and Peck, 1994, An Inventory of California Driver Accident Risk Factors. Sacramento, CA: California Dept. of Motor Vehicles, ``the California study''; Gebers and Peck, 1987, Basic California Traffic Conviction and Accident Record Facts. Sacramento, CA, California Dept. of Motor Vehicles; Lund, 1984, Driver Records and Crash Prediction, Arlington, VA: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety; California Department of Motor Vehicles, 1981, California Driver Fact Book, Sacramento, CA: Dept. of Motor Vehicles; IIHS, 1988, Drivers' Crash, Violations Records Predict Future Crash Involvement, Advisory No. 6, Arlington, VA: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IIHS, however, goes on to contend that these justifications are specious. It cites several studies which show that many drivers with clean driving records are involved in accidents, and that many drivers with poor driving records over a three-year period experience accident-free periods of equal length. A 1994 California report is cited which ``did find that crash risk increases as a function of the number of crashes and citations on a drivers prior record. Of the two, prior citations is a slightly better indicator of subsequent crash risk, but subsequent crash risk can be more accurately predicted from a combination of prior crash and prior citation information than from either alone.'' Significantly, it is this combination that the FHWA relied upon to reach its ``consistent with safety'' determination. The IIHS contends that none of the findings in the California report support the proposition that ``the absence of citations or crashes can be used to predict a crash-free future.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is apparent from its comments that the IIHS believes that the FHWA, in order to reach a ``consistent with safety'' determination, was bound to predict with some certainty that the waived drivers would be accident-free. The FHWA rejects this contention. The FHWA's determination is based on a reasonable expectation, supported by the studies cited both in the October 6 notice and in the IIHS comments, that the waived drivers with relatively clean driving records, as a group, would present less of a risk to public safety than a representative group of drivers, meeting existing standards, to be used in place of the waived drivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IIHS also faults the FHWA for ignoring the data gathered to date on fatal crash involvement of the waived group. Because of reporting errors by the drivers, which were detected and corrected through the FHWA back-up monitoring systems, much of the information on fatal accident involvement was not available by the time ``The Third Interim Monitoring Report on the Drivers of Commercial Motor Vehicles Who Receive Vision Waivers'' was completed on June 27, 1994. That report analyzes data collected from July, 1992, through February, 1994. The Fourth Interim Monitoring Report, which has been placed in the docket, includes both the fatal and non-fatal accident rates resulting from all data accumulated through June 30, 1994. The fatal accident rate for the waived group of drivers is indeed slightly higher than the general truck driving population. However, in none of the fatal accidents was the waived driver issued a citation or found by the reporting police officer to have been at fault.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

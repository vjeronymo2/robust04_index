			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Watchdog urges profit clawback THE government could have increased its proceeds from the privatisation of the electricity distribution industry in 1990 by clawing back part of the profits which the companies reported in the subsequent year, according to the National Audit Office. In a report on the sale of the 12 regional electricity companies the government spending watchdog says the Department of Energy considered introducing a provision for profit clawbacks over several years but decided against it because this could have affected the payment of dividends by the companies and cut the proceeds. The Audit Office says it would have been 'appropriate' for the department to explore whether higher proceeds could have been obtained by clawing back at least a portion of the profits that exceeded the companies' forecasts. The office also says that with hindsight the government could have earned more from the sale by retaining a portion of the shares to take advantage of the rise in the share price during the offer period. It recommends the government retains a substantial minority in future privatisations for this purpose. The sale of the twelve regional electricity companies. National Audit Office. Pounds 7.10.

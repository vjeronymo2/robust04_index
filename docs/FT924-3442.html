			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Letter: Equitable view of tax allowance Sir, Mr. Michael Pattison (Letters, December 1), in opposing mortgage interest relief, is surely coming at the issue from the wrong direction. It is not so many years ago that there was a simple rule; interest received was taxable and interest payable allowable against tax. The fairness of this can be seen from the example of two people, each with Pounds 30,000 in a bank deposit account. The first uses his to buy a house outright; no tax is payable or refundable as there are no interest earnings orpayments. The second leaves his deposit intact, but takes out a Pounds 30,000 loan. He thus has Pounds 30,000 earning interest liable to tax and a Pounds 30,000 mortgage, interest on which gets tax relief. This is also tax neutral. Without mortgage interest relief, he would be taxed on his interest earned, but denied tax relief on the equivalent interest paid, which hardly seems right. Why should he be at a disadvantage to the first person? The real unfairness is that all interest outgoings are not allowable, thus to mirror taxable interest earnings.

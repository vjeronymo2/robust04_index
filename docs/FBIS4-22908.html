Stabnikova, V.N. Ivanov, N.N. Gregirchak, </F> A.N. Dulgerov, Food Industry Engineering Institute and  Microbiology and Virology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences, Kiev; UDC 612.3:576.8]    [Abstract] The mechanism of bacterial neuston development  on the air and water interface of reservoirs and the  surface-active and hydrophobic layer on the water surface  (10-100 m) is discussed, and it is noted that today, there  are virtually no bacterial preparations which enhance the  self-treatment process on the basis of neuston forms of  microorganisms. An attempt is made to produce such preparations  based on adaptive selection of neuston bacterial forms with an  elevated cell surface hydrophobia and to examine the efficacy of  using neuston forms of bacterial preparations for treating water  by removing petroleum hydrocarbons and for biological  decontaminating of waste water already treated by traditional  methods. To this end, Bacillus megaterium 1BD,  Pseudomonas putida BS-2, and Alcaligenes  paradoxus BS-1 from the microorganism collection of the  biosynthesis technology division of the Microbiology and  Virology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences grown in  test tubes in a rocker making 240 strokes per minute were used.  The possibility of selecting neuston bacterial forms which  concentrate on the water/atmosphere interface is demonstrated;  the preparation on the basis of Bacillus megaterium  is more effective in treating petroleum-based hydrocarbon  contamination than the preparation on the basis of the plankton  form of the same culture. The preparation developed on the basis  of the neuston form of aerobic spore-forming bacteria is more  effective in biological decontamination of waste water treated  by traditional methods. The preparation was tested under  full-scale conditions by treating a reservoir in the Sula river  flood plain. The experiment shows that water treatment with the  biological preparation for 48 h reduces the total microbial  dissemination and makes it possible to get rid of staphylococci  and Shigella. Thus, neuston forms of bacteria with antagonistic  properties with respect to pathogenic microflora may probably be  used for waste water decontamination and for improving the  hygienic reservoir conditions. The use of neuston forms also  makes it possible to enhance the microbiological processes in a  15-40 m surface layer. Figures 3; tables 3; references 14:  10  Russian, 4 Western.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin and </F> Yuriy Tyssovskiy]    [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- President of Palestine and  chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation Yasir 'Arafat  has expressed on behalf of the Palestinian people deep gratitude  to the president, government and people of Russia for their  consistent friendly position with respect to the just cause of  the Palestinian people.    He was speaking on Wednesday at a press conference for  Russian and foreign journalists at the close of his working  visit to the Russian capital. Yasir 'Arafat said he appreciated  the fact that was the first leader of an Arab nation to be  invited for a visit to the Russian Federation after radical  changes in this country.    Speaking about the results of his visit, 'Arafat said they  were important and constructive. During his meetings with the  Russian president, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and  other officials 'Arafat discussed the most important problems of  the Middle East region. In this context he stressed that the  Middle East is for Russia not only a point on the map but  actually a neighbouring region which really exists.    'Arafat said high-ranking Palestinian officials would soon  arrive in Moscow to discuss the development of bilateral  economic ties.    As concerns Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the  procedure  of implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Palestinian  leader noted that they are continuing, although not always as  smoothly as desired and not always in the sought direction.    According to 'Arafat, Israel is constantly manoeuvering and  playing for time. The Israeli troops were due to withdraw from  the areas of the planned Palestinian autonomy but did not.    "All attempts of our friends to stimulate the peace process  have failed," 'Arafat stressed. "Despite negotiations and  accords, the situation remains as it was".    According to him, this trend is seen as favorable only by  the  extremists on both sides who want to disrupt the settlement  process. "If no headway is made along the path leading to peace,  the region will be engulfed by anarchy and Balkanisation," the  PLO leader said.    He formulated the PLO demands to the Israeli leadership --  to  speed up the exact and guaranteed fulfilment of the reached  agreements. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin likes  repeating that there are no sacred datelines, but there must  exist commitments which must be realized without delay, 'Arafat  said.</p>

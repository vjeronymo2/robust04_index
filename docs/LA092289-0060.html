			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> SAUDIS EXECUTE 16 SHIITES  </P> <P> Sixteen Shiite Muslims from Kuwait were beheaded in Saudi Arabia for exploding  two bombs in Mecca last July at the height of the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy  city, the Saudi Interior Ministry said. A statement carried by the official  Saudi Press Agency said 10 of those beheaded were of Iranian origin and two  were of Saudi descent. The statement implicitly blamed Iran for the attacks,  which killed a man and wounded 16 others. The explosions occurred despite tight  security during the annual hajj, or pilgrimage, attended by about 1.5 million  Muslim pilgrims from around the world.  </P></p>

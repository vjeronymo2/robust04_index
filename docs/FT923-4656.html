			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / HK fears crossfire in US-China trade war HONG Kong would lose Dollars HK35bn (Pounds 2.26bn) in trade if the US imposes punitive tariffs on China as a result of its Section 301 investigation, according to the Hong Kong government. A government report, aimed at alerting the US to the heavy price Hong Kong would have to pay for Washington's trade policy, estimated that 16,600 jobs would be lost and GDP would fall by 0.7 per cent. The US 301 investigation focuses on Chinese protectionism. On August 27, the administration published a list of Dollars 3.9bn-worth of US imports that would be considered for retaliation. Tariffs on these goods would be increased to up to 100 per cent. The debate appears to have heated up following the US decision to allow the sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan; but Mr Chau Tak-hay, Hong Kong's secretary for trade and industry, was adamant that this would not sour the discussions. 'These are purely trade negotiations and I do not believe other issues will affect the outcome,' he said. Hong Kong's exports are expected to rise 20 per cent this year from the 1991 level of Dollars 98bn. By comparison, the impact of the US trade action would be to remove more than one-fifth of that growth. The impact would be even greater if China countered the American moves by restricting US imports. Mr Chau said the government would present its report to the US administration and he also urged other local trade groups to lobby the US. He said the longer-term impact on Hong Kong would be far greater than the initial drop in trade. It would result in 'weakening of investment interests by Hong Kong and foreign companies in China, undermining of Hong Kong's role as a gateway to China and major entrepot, and reducing Hong Kong's longer-term potential,' he argued. The deadline for the bilateral trade negotiations is October 10.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Assistance should be real Sir, In his review of Sir James Goldsmith's book, The Trap ('Trapped in a protectionist world', November 10), Martin Wolf states that 'if we are all concerned about unemployment and the distribution of the gains from growth, the best and most politically honest policy is direct, rather than indirect, assistance to the workers'. However, before any assistance is given, would it not be a good idea to remove the barriers to employment? After all, what is the point of simultaneously discouraging an activity and then trying to assist it? Put another way, why levy tens of billions of pounds on employment and then try to encourage it by handing a tiny fraction back, at the same time trying to delude everybody that the net result is assistance?

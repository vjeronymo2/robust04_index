			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Vienna, April 5 (AFP) -- North Korea's  development of a second plutonium production line indicates that  the Stalinist state is determined to pursue an "active  programme" of nuclear weapons production, IAEA official David  Kyd warned Tuesday [5 April].    Kyd said inspectors of the International Atomic Energy  Agency  visiting the radio-chemical laboratory at Yongbyon, 90  kilometres (55 miles) north of Pyongyang, last month had  observed that a second plutonium separation line was being  constructed, similar to the first line which was subject to IAEA  monitoring.    The new line meant that the North Korean programme could  evade effective monitoring, Kyd said.    "This is of concern to us," he said. "It means North Korea  is  pursuing an active programme, while the United States and the  IAEA were hoping that it would put its nuclear activities on  hold." [passage omitted]    Kyd said IAEA chief Hans Blix had verbally notified the IAEA  governors of the discovery at a council meeting on March 21, and  had also informed the UN Security Council.    The Security Council and IAEA officials were hoping a new  mission could be sent to North Korea at the beginning of May,  Kyd said. However there were currently no contacts between  Pyongyang and the IAEA. [passage omitted]</p>

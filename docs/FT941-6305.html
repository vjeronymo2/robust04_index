			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Direct selling expansion by GRE Guardian Royal Exchange, the fifth largest of the UK's composite insurers, has signalled a sharp intensification of competition in the Pounds 6bn-a-year motor insurance market with yesterday's launch of Guardian Direct, its own direct telephone-based insurer. The group, which announced it was dropping Royal Exchange from its title on Monday, will invest heavily in the subsidiary, spending at least Pounds 10m on advertising and marketing in its first year of operation. It will compete in a market headed by Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary which insures 1.4m of the UK's 18.5m motorists. 'This is the first time a composite has made a heavyweight decisive move into the market,' said Mr Ray Pierce, managing director. He claimed that the 'sheer weight' of investment in advertising and marketing would create brand awareness, allowing the company to grow rapidly. The company is expected to underwrite both home and motor insurance. Based in Colchester, Guardian Direct will initially employ 160 people, of whom 80 will be telesales staff. 'Volume is important,' said Mr Pierce. GRE has been slow to move into the direct market, partially because of its dependence on business generated by brokers and building societies. It had also been reluctant to alienate the brokers with which it traditionally does motor business. General Accident, Eagle Star and Royal Insurance have all formed direct writing subsidiaries, but their growth rate has been more modest than that of Direct Line and Churchill, a subsidiary of Winterthur, the Swiss insurer. Mr Pierce, who joined GRE after spells as chief executive of Robson Rhodes, the accountant, and the Mortgage Corporation, said the company would be the 'strategic late entrant' and could equip itself with technology superior to many competitors. 'The systems of some of our competitors are already out of date,' he said. Although Guardian Direct will be operated separately from GRE's existing motor business, it will be able to take advantage of facilities already set up by its parent, such as a network of 500 approved repair centres for damaged cars. Guardian Direct aims to compete on both service and price. The company will handle claims over the telephone and settle bills direct. Marketing material suggests 'policyholders can save up to 30 per cent off conventional motor and household policies'.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Berisford/Magnet Should the Magnet case study graduate to the Bankers Trust training programme it is unlikely to appear as one of the great trades of the 20th century. Still, as a salutary tale for young bankers it has its merits. The Pounds 629m valuation put on Magnet by Bankers Trust when it led the buy-out five years ago seems unimaginable now. While most of the money has long since evaporated, selling out for Pounds 56m must still cause a wince of pain. The banks have performed their traditional role of selling a business at the bottom of the cycle, but this by no means guarantees that Magnet is a good purchase for Berisford. There is cash in the business but most will be required to sort out the mess. By the time the assets have been written down, Magnet will not look so cheap. At the strategic level, no one has yet successfully combined retail and professional building supplies operations. The new markets which Berisford is eyeing are already occupied by fierce competitors. Spring Ram's Regency operation may generate substantial overcapacity in doors; MFI will keep up the heat in kitchens. None of that will make it easier for Berisford to boost Magnet's sales and margins. At least the standard conglomerate spring clean will yield sufficient savings to put the operation back into profit. Shareholders will probably back what is, at heart, a classic piece of shell company financing, especially since the upturn will underwrite most of the risk.</p>

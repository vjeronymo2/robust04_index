			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Technology: Cars that can save your life - Protection in road accidents is now a selling point, as Andrew Fisher reports in a series on transport safety Today's cars are safer than ever, but this is not true of all drivers. Bad driving causes most accidents, not faulty design. The seasonal pile-ups on European motorways at times of bad weather and low visibility happen because people drive too fast and too close together. But safer cars can increase the chances of survival, however carelessly people drive on highways, town roads or country lanes. Although accident rates have decreased in many countries, despite steady growth in traffic, the number of deaths is still high - some 154,000 a year worldwide, including 50,000 in the EU, 47,000 in the US and 13,000 in Japan. Global injuries exceed 5m. As a result, safety features in cars have achieved a greater prominence than ever in motor companies' design and marketing policies. Television advertisements are just as likely to show how tough and manoeuvrable cars are as to parade their performance and glamour. Figures from the German motor industry association show that human factors account for 90 per cent of accidents resulting in injury; the other causes are mainly poor weather, bad roads, and faulty vehicles and maintenance. Thus the main intention behind the emphasis on safety technology is to save people from the consequences of their own and others' bad driving. Car buyers seem more willing to pay extra for safety as new features are developed. 'It is obvious that manufacturers now see safety as a sellable item,' says Ken Barnes, head of engineering at Britain's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Sweden's Volvo used to be alone in highlighting its models' safety qualities. Now, its rivals vie to do the same. Technological advances have made available a wide range of sophisticated braking, suspension, structural, and body protection systems for today's cars. 'People used to say 'safety doesn't sell',' adds Malcolm Thomas, overseeing the introduction of Ford Motor's Mondeo mid-range family and company car in the US after managing its launch in Europe. 'Twenty years ago, those in the industry wondered how you could get people to pay extra for safety.' There is still a limit to how much car buyers will pay. But manufacturers are now far more alert to changing customer perceptions - airbags, for example, are increasingly seen as essential in new cars, especially in the US - as well as to legislative trends. Safety is now an important part of companies' competitive strategy. 'Manufacturers are leapfrogging each other,' says Gary Suthurst, an automotive consultant at the Cranfield Impact Centre. 'Safety will continue to increase as a prime marketing strategy, mainly due to competitive and consumer pressure rather than legislative moves.' When designing the Mondeo, Ford decided to integrate safety into the overall construction from the start. It drew up safety guidelines for its engineers. 'The idea was to get away from being reactive to safety legislation and to be pro-active,' adds Thomas. It took into account likely changes in the law that would affect the car not only when it was introduced but well into its life. Among the standard features on the Mondeo are steering wheel airbags, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), seat-belt grabbers and pretensioners using sensors to reduce slack on impact, and seats with 'anti-submarine' ramps to stop them sliding forward in a crash. For its side-impact bars - another feature that companies are marketing more and more in new vehicles - Ford went to Sweden for special boron steel which has very high-tensile strength. 'Previously,' says Thomas, 'we might have gone for mild or high-strength steel tubes.' Side-impact bars were originally developed in the US, where many accidents involve pick-up trucks. Not all experts believe they are necessarily suited to European conditions, in which collisions mostly occur between vehicles of similar size. In fact, says Suthurst, stiff impact bars can harm passengers, especially in four-door cars with a rigid upright in the middle. The question of side impact has gained increasing attention in recent years. At present, European regulations specify only the need for cars to be tested for full frontal impact. But most accidents involve some form of angled collision. Auto Motor und Sport, the German motor magazine, caused a furore when it started testing cars by crashing only one side into a concrete block. Instead of the force being evenly absorbed by the protective struts at the front of the car, these were distorted. Passengers were thus at greater risk than the frontal tests had indicated. Such so-called offset tests are now being studied in Europe for possible introduction, using angled barriers with anti-slide devices to reproduce typical accident conditions. However, useful as they are, tests cannot guarantee cars' safety in widely varying conditions. 'Often, companies know how to make cars better than the law requires,' says Majid Sadeghi, managing director of the Cranfield centre (part of Cranfield Institute of Technology). Tests have to be repeatable and can give only a simplified version of road conditions. For several years, the big car companies have used supercomputers to simulate crash conditions and speed up design work on safety features. Ford made intensive use of these to build the Mondeo and ensure it could be adapted for North America and other markets. 'You can strip away all the elements of the car in a computer model,' says John Charles, safety supervisor at Ford's UK research unit in Essex. 'You can test all the components and materials for stresses and strains.' This cuts down on the number of controlled crashes that car companies need to do, saving time and money. 'On a computer, you can simulate different types of occupant,' explains Udo Westfal, director of safety at the European Automobile Manufacturers Association in Brussels. 'Instead of using dummies, you can vary the size of the occupant. It's a very advanced way of developing a safe product without using an infinite number of cars.' For US tests, the dummy's acceleration has to be measured. (In European tests, only the steering wheel's movement is recorded.) 'Most serious impact occurs in the first 20 to 40 milliseconds,' says Aruna Tilakasiri, a computer applications engineer at Ford in Essex. 'So we show the result up to 50 milliseconds.' Computers also show how airbags absorb the impact of crashes at different speeds. In an accident, a person's body weight can move at a pressure of up to 50 times gravity in a frontal impact. Safety belts are designed to absorb these huge forces. For further protection, Audi, the up-market subsidiary of Germany's Volkswagen group, has developed the procon-ten (programmed contraction and tension) system using steel cables to pull the steering wheel away from the driver. As more companies offer airbags, mainly for drivers as extra protection against steering wheel injuries, buyers have yet another feature to weigh up in the cost-safety equation. While some top-of-the-range manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz already provide airbags in all their cars, these are now becoming common on smaller models. 'This is a big step forward and it is being initiated not by legislation but by competition,' says Westfal. Not all experts are convinced of the value of airbags, arguing that their popularity in the US reflects the fact that drivers are less keen on wearing seat-belts than in Europe. However, Jurgen Gerstenmeier, a development manager at Robert Bosch, the German automotive equipment maker, says airbags could help prevent injuries in 68 per cent of accidents; use of driver airbags in all cars could cut yearly deaths by 50,000. Even side airbags are being worked on. Too many safety features, though, could prove too costly for most drivers - it would be simpler, and cheaper, if they drove slower and more safely. The series concludes next week with a look at marine safety.</p>

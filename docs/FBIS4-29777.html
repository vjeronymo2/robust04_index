			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul police have  decided to mobilize 14,000 riot troopers to beef up security in  and around Yoido Plaza, the Democratic Liberal Party  headquarters, the American Embassy and other major installations  in the capital to stave off possible raids by Uruguay Round [UR]  accord protesters.    A large-scale outdoor rally seeking to block ratification of  the Uruguay Round agreement is slated for Yoido Plaza at 3 P.M.  Saturday, with some 20,000 people including members of the  National Alliance for Democracy and Unification, Chongukyonhap,  and collegians attending.    The ralliers are to stage a 5-km street march to the Yonsei  University campus after the gathering, probably causing serious  traffic jams in and around Mapo and Shinchon, western Seoul.    Prior to the rally, some 7,000 students from seven Seoul  universities, including Yonsei and Sogang, will march to Yoido  Plaza in separate groups to demonstrate their determination to  stop the National Assembly from ratifying the UR accord.    Some 1,000 students affiliated with Namchongnyon, the  Federation of Student Councils in Kwangju and South Cholla  Province, gathered at Yongdungpo station to prepare for the  rally.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hogg slides 20% to Pounds 13.4m from Pounds 16.8m to Pounds 13.4m - at Hogg, the broking group, thanks to problems in the UK credit and political risk insurance markets, and the depressed US insurance market. However, turnover grew by 4 per cent - from Pounds 113m to Pounds 117m - with UK retail business up 9.9 per cent, and UK wholesale business improving by 15.7 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 11.32p (15p), and the final dividend is maintained at 5p, for an unchanged total of 8.15p. The market reacted neutrally, with the shares rising 1p to 186p. Mr James Vaughn, chairman, said that the group's American workforce had been reduced by 10 per cent during the year, and that the group had taken the redundancy costs last year, allowing for growth this year. Underlying broking expenses outstripped revenue growth, increasing by 4 per cent compared to 3.5 per cent. Turbulent foreign exchange markets and falling interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic were blamed for a 3 per cent fall in investment income. The company's divested Lloyd's managing agencies made Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 2.27m), accounting for 12 per cent of group profits. This is the last year they will make a contribution to profits. Its members' agency fell from Pounds 580,000 to Pounds 60,000.</p>

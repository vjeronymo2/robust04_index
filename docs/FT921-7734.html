			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut fever cools THE FEVER of excitement over an imminent rate cut in the UK cooled off yesterday, as the Bank of England stayed away from money market operations until the afternoon. Overnight rates, which began the day at about 10 per cent, were as high as 11 3/4 per cent by the afternoon. They fell back to close at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, still higher than in recent days. Virtually all money, right up to one and two years, was depressed at the opening. The market was bracing itself for a rate cut following sterling's resilient performance against the D-Mark this week. The key three months interbank rate - which is a good indicator to the course of interest rates - fell as low as 10 1/8 per cent at the bid, said one dealer, the lowest seen in some time. By the end of the day, the rate was looking for at least a quarter-point cut in rates, closing at 10 1/4 - 3/16 per cent. On the futures market, the March short sterling contract finished at 89.86. At this level, the market was expecting a rate of about 10.14 per cent by the time the contract expires on March 18. Most economists and dealers are expecting a rate reduction just after the UK Budget on March 10. However, the market will continue to speculate on an imminent cut as the election approaches. The Bank tried to cool some of the rate cut speculation at noon by offering to buy bills nearer the current 10 1/2 per cent base rate. It was ignored until the afternoon, however, when the market accepted its first tranche of assistance to stem the forecast Pounds 400m shortage. Band one treasury and bank bills totalling Pounds 92m were purchased at 10 3/8 per cent. The bulk of the shortfall was eliminated by late assistance of Pounds 240m. In the US, the Federal Reserve acted to depress the funds rate by adding liquidity through overnight system repurchase agreements. At the time of the action, funds were trading at 5 1/4 per cent. The perceived target is 4 per cent. Economists suggested that the announcement Tuesday night that the Fed would ease credit requirements reinforced the view that there would be no immediate change in US monetary policy. In Germany, the Bundesbank injected DM700m through securities repurchase agreements. This helped to hold call money rates at 9.55/65 per cent.</p>

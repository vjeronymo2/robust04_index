PLO Executive Committee member Taysir Khalid said that  Clinton's statements to leaders of U.S. Jewish organizations on  Jerusalem "are in conflict with Security Council resolutions,  which consider Israel's annexation of holy Jerusalem null and  void. They also conflict with the previous U.S.  Administrations' positions." He added that the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement "does  not allow the U.S. Administration to disdain the resolutions of  international legitimacy concerning Jerusalem, because the  agreement does not revoke or weaken these resolutions, which are  binding on the U.S. Administration and the Israeli Government,"  as he said.    Members of U.S. Jewish organizations quoted the president as  saying that he "strongly supports the view that Jerusalem -- its  east part, occupied in 1967, and west part, occupied in 1948 --  should remain `unified' and the capital of the Hebrew state."    He pledged that his administration would resist any attempt  to consider the east part of the city, which has an Arab  character, to be part of the occupied Arab territories. This is  what Washington refused to approve of in Security Council  Resolution 904 condemning the Israeli massacre of al-Ibrahimi  Mosque worshipers. Khalid, who is also member of the Political  Bureau of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,  which is opposed to the declaration of principles agreement and  the peace negotiations with Israel, urged the "influential  leaderships in the PLO and the Arab states concerned with the  negotiations to suspend the bilateral negotiations and the  multilateral committees until the Israeli Government and the  U.S. Administration announce their respect for the resolutions  of international legitimacy related to the Arab  Palestinian-Israeli conflict and their commitment to the  negotiation process on the basis of these resolutions."</p>

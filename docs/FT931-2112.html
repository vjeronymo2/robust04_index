			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Observer: Lost tribe returns Why should the Conservative members of the European Parliament give up their offices on the third floor of the European Parliament's London outpost in Queen Anne's Gate and move into the Tory party's Smith Square headquarters? The official line is that it is all to do with winning next year's European elections. 'We want to have one integrated election fighting machine', says Tim Collins, the Tory party's exceptionally young director of communications. Maybe so. But the suspicion remains that the party's forgotten tribe of MEPs has been ordered in to the expensively refurbished Tory party HQ to help reduce the overheads. Unlike, Queen Anne's Gate, the Smith Square accommodation will not be provided rent free. Fortunately, the financing of the Conservatives in Europe is on a much sounder footing than that of the Conservatives in Britain.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Michael Page ahead sharply to Pounds 4.35m Shares in Michael Page Group rose 24 1/2 p to 114p as the international recruitment and executive selection consultant announced pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 4.35m for the first half of 1994. Mr Terry Benson, chief executive, said 'favourable trading conditions had helped all the UK businesses exceed expectations'. This was in contrast to the 'mixed progress' on the Continent. Group turnover expanded from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 34.2m. The previous year's figure, however, included Pounds 1.16m from LBW France, which has since been sold. Operating profits were Pounds 4.19m, against Pounds 1.49 - including losses of Pounds 109,000 from LBW France. Within the UK, turnover was divided as to 70 per cent permanent recruitment and 30 per cent temporary. Revenue in the permanent side rose more than 51 per cent and the temporary side 'higher than that'. Michael Page Marketing and Sales expanded further and, as a result, Sales Recruitment Specialists was set up to provide sales representatives at the lower end of the pay spectrum. Mr Benson said the accountancy side expected to open two more offices by December, bringing the total to 10. In mainland Europe, profits at the French operations enjoyed a substantial increase, 'being well past the worst' as the economy recovers. Mr Benson was more cautious about Germany and the Netherlands, where trading conditions continued to be difficult. The outlook, however, seemed brighter, and another German office is to be opened in Frankfurt. The group is also planning to open an office in Hong Kong. In spite of the start-up costs, Mr Benson is expecting long-term rewards from the Asian market. The interim dividend is raised to 0.8p (0.6p), payable from earnings sharply up at 4.45p (1.65p) per share.</p>

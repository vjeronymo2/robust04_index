			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / North Korea signals move on succession North Korea's decision to send a special envoy to China signals an imminent announcement of a new leader in the Stalinist state, diplomats and analysts in Seoul said yesterday, Reuter reports from Seoul. North Korea said on Tuesday it was sending Mr Song Ho-gyong, vice-foreign minister to China as a special envoy. 'Song will be making the first public and official visit to Beijing by a senior North Korean official since the death of Kim Il-sung. This appears to be the completion of reshuffling in North Korea's hierarchy,' an Asian diplomat said. 'It is an established practice between North Korea and China to notify important changes in their countries,' he said. North Korea's former president died of a heart attack on July 8 after he designated his eldest son, Mr Kim Jong-il, as his successor, but the younger Kim has yet to be named as the country's communist party chief or state president. 'It is quite likely that Mr Song will notify leaders in Beijing of Pyongyang's plan to hold a huge rally soon formally to name Kim Jong-il as the party leader,' said Mr Ko Tae-woo, chief analyst at the Institute of North Korean Studies. 'He will probably ask Beijing to take steps to help consolidate Kim Jong-il's legitimacy,' Mr Ko said. China is North Korea's last important ally, and its blessing of the communist world's first dynastic succession is seen as vital to Mr Kim Jong-il, who lacks his father's charisma. The Asian diplomat said China's support for Mr Kim Jong-il's leadership was particularly important as South Korea had built up an important business partnership with Beijing, diminishing the North's political leverage. South Korea's trade ministry said two-way trade between Seoul and Beijing was expected to total Dollars 12bn this year, up from Dollars 9bn in 1993. Chinese figures put trade with South Korea in the first half of this year at Dollars 5bn, up 59 per cent on the same 1993 period, while trade with North Korea fell 21.9 per cent to Dollars 335m. 'As this trade and investment grow North Korea's influence in Beijing wanes, especially after the death of Kim Il-sung, who knew many of China's veteran political and military leaders,' a diplomat in Beijing said. Mr Kim Jong-il has rarely visited China and does not have the good personal relations with Chinese leaders his father enjoyed. North Korea watchers in Seoul said that North Korea's elite must have been preoccupied with the task of restructuring its hierarchy around Mr Kim Jong-il since the elder Kim's death. 'Now it is beginning to address the importance of its external relations,' said Mr Lee Seo-hang, a director-general of the government-backed Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. 'Song's visit could mark the first step to seek continuity of its external relations,' he added. The naming of Mr Kim Jong-il as the new communist party chief could coincide with celebrations on September 9 or October 10, the anniversary of the setting up of the ruling party. He was last seen publicly at a July 20 memorial service for his father.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (11): A hidden force ready for action - Japanese eye UK market KOICHI SUZUMURA, chairman of NYK Line (Europe), smiles and politely declines to put a figure on how much NYK has invested in inland distribution in the UK and Europe. One can say it is substantial, he agrees; and, yes, the rate of investment could accelerate rapidly over the next two to three years, always depending on demand. NYK, a leading Japanese shipping line, is one of the most advanced of several Japanese transport groups which have quietly been laying plans to become leading players in the European distribution market. It now has 1,300 UK employees, most of whom are involved in inland logistics. Nippon Express, which by contrast does not operate deep sea shipping, has so far invested Pounds 40m in fixed assets in Europe, Pounds 9m of which is in the UK. In 1991, rapidly growing net revenue, excluding air freight, totalled Pounds 68.5m, of which Pounds 15.7m was in the UK. Other Japanese companies in Europe include Mitsui, a large, diversified trading house, and parcels companies, Yamato and Kintetsu. These companies pose a threat to existing operators within the market. They have a reputation for being thorough and patient; above all, they have the 'inside track' with Japanese manufacturers. NYK plans to become a 'logistics megacarrier', offering door-to-door services, worldwide. In the US, for example, it is now a leading railroad operator, following the acquisition of Southern Pacific Transportation. Europe is an important part of the global jigsaw. Growth in cargo shipments between Asia and Europe is set to accelerate as Europe unifies and NYK is responding by building 'comprehensive distribution capabilities'. The initial emphasis will be on movements to, and between, points of manufacture: 'We are not intending to develop our inland traffic to retailers,' he says, pauses, smiles, and adds: 'As yet.' Mr Suzumura says NYK's transport involvement in the past has started and ended at the dockside. The move inland greatly broadens the scope of the group's activities. In the UK, NYK has two separate operations. New Wave Logistics, a global logistics brand within NYK, is starting from a greenfield site (its large warehouse in Milton Keynes has Panasonic as an important customer) with a Japanese managing director. New Wave runs separately, for the time being at least, from UCI Logistics, acquired from United Carriers Group in July 1991. UCI was bought because it has strong market knowledge and gives the company a foothold in inland transport, with a broader customer base than purely Japanese manufacturers. It contains several long-established road transport concerns: Robsons Distribution, a network warehousing and haulage firm; Hudson Shepherd, a domestic groupage operator; and Thompson Jewitt International, a leading groupage operator between the UK and Europe. The importance of local knowledge is stressed by Allan Binks, chairman of UCI (and United Carriers) and until the late 1980s a senior executive within Transport Development Group. He comments: 'Sony might be the biggest electrical goods manufacturer in the world, but Comet and Currys will determine the way they are delivered to their stores. When it comes to establishing an operation and breaking into the market, it's extremely difficult unless you have got a power base from which to build.' NYK, and other Japanese companies, are likely to buy Continental transport companies in future. Nippon Express is concentrating on developing logistics business with Japanese manufacturers at present, but says that will have changed by the mid-1990s. Japanese companies will establish a quality reputation in distribution, much as they have in cars and electronics. 'There will be a demand for contract warehousing by a Japanese company,' spokesman Mark Pester predicts. Touche Ross consultant Ray Hoare highlights the Japanese strength in finance and planning: 'They have a long-termism which the UK has not developed. As a result, they may well achieve the same result in distribution as they have in manufacturing.' While the ambitions of overseas groups such as UPS and Federal Express of the US, and TNT and Mayne Nickless of Australia, are much publicised, the threat from Japan is still not fully appreciated within the transport business, according to Jack Mather, chief executive of NFC (formerly National Freight Consortium). 'The Japanese are the hidden force. They'll come in on the back of Japanese manufacturers - they all trade and link together - and use them as a base. Then they'll spread to other customers.' They will offer formidable global systems for shipping, storage and distribution. Kuhne &amp; Nagel and Danzas will be targets. 'Even NFC is not big enough. We have to form strategic alliances with shipping lines.' Mr Mather envies the way Japanese groups work together: 'They don't have contracts, they have working relationships. I wish we Brits did it.'</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election 92: Kinnock to stress need for devolution MR Neil Kinnock will use his opening campaign rally in Edinburgh today to stress Labour's commitment to devolution but also to highlight Scotland's contribution to a united Britain. His finely balanced speech will draw on Labour's pledge for closer ties with the European Community as evidence of its determination to follow a Continental model of social democracy 'allowing all to contribute and ensuring all benefit'. The aim is to consolidate support for a Scottish parliament in preference to the full independence being offered by the Scottish National Party. In passages aimed at the national election campaign he will emphasise how different the UK's economic outlook would be if Labour's policies to address unemployment, lack of investment and poverty had been implemented a year ago. At a news conference yesterday, Mr Kinnock was asked whether a Labour government might agree to introduce proportional representation for the Commons within a first parliament. He said it was 'very highly unlikely.' The Labour leader kept the door ajar, however, by adding that the working party on electoral systems would continue its studies, enhanced with the authority of reporting to a government in office. His words will be closely perused by the Liberal Democrats who have stated that they will not enter any electoral pact with another party without a firm undertaking to make the change. Mr Kinnock left morale high among his parliamentary troops after a widely-praised valedictory performance at the last prime minister's question time before the election. Targeting Mr John Major's refusal to take part in a three-way party leaders' television debate, he accused the prime minister of being 'ashamed' and 'frit' - Mrs Thatcher's word for frightened - to defend his economic record. The final sparring followed a 40-minute meeting of the parliamentary Labour party at which Mr Kinnock was given a standing ovation. Reminding his MPs that in 1987 they began their campaign some 10 points behind the Tories, he said they were entering the new contest with an opinion poll lead and would end it with the leadership of the country. Mr Kinnock invoked Aneurin Bevan's political treatise, In Place of Fear, as depicting the kind of society they were pledged to build. Even sceptical leftwingers said it was a sterling performance. One not always uncritical shadow cabinet member said: 'There is a strong feeling that Neil is now ready for anything. He has been tested in the fire over the past few years and he has come through.'</p>

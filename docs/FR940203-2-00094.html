			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a licensee of a permanently shutdown facility spends decomissioning trust funds on legitimate decommissioning activities, the timing of these expenditures, either before or after NRC approves a licensee's decommissioning plan, should not adversely affect public health and safety, provided adequate funds are maintained to restore the facility to a safe storage configuration in case decommissioning activities are interrupted unexpectedly. Consequently, the timing of the NRC review of a licensee's decommissioning plan in relation to withdrawals from trust funds is not as important as the purpose of those withdrawals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its decommissioning plan reviews, the NRC evaluates proposed licensee activities in the planned decommissioning process to determine whether the proposed plan adequately ensures protection of public health and safety. The NRC will also assess a licensee's overall decommissioning fund balance in relation to total cost. The NRC review of decommissioning costs is focused on seeing that they fall within a normal range of costs and is not focused on examining the timing, scope, and cost of specific component removal or other decommissioning activities. Therefore, although the NRC believes that it should guard against misuse or waste of decommissioning trust funds by licensees, it is not clear that prior NRC review of the decommissioning plan would identify such misuse or waste unless it resulted in costs far higher than would normally be expected. The NRC would find it difficult to identify the misuse of funds if a licensee's estimates were within a reasonable range of the costs estimated for similar facilities. Further, the NRC does not supervise or review the actual expenditure of funds during decommissioning and would not have an opportunity to identify serious cost overruns that might jeopardize the adequacy of funding available for remaining decommissioning activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, there appears to be little motivation for utilities to misuse these funds. Most NRC power reactor licensees are subject to rate regulation by State public utility commissions (PUCs) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Utilities are normally allowed to earn a return on assets, including nuclear plants, once they are determined to be ``used and useful'' and placed in the rate base. Decommissioning costs, however, are normally treated by PUCs and FERC as non-rate-base expenses. They are passed on to ratepayers as expenses, but the utility and its stockholders do not earn a return on these collections. Consequently, there is little financial incentive for a licensee to ``pad'' or dissipate collected decommissioning funds to increase the rate base, because the stockholders would not benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, PUCs and FERC are unlikely to allow utilities under their jurisdictions to squander funds obtained from ratepayers. Rate regulators hold prudency reviews to determine whether utilities have spent funds properly throughout all aspects of plant operation, from initial planning to final decommissioning. The NRC expects that PUCs and FERC will continue to exercise their oversight of utilities' expenditures, including those being paid from decommissioning trust funds, throughout the decommissioning process. A utility has an incentive to spend decommissioning funds prudently if it knows that its stockholders will be liable for decommissioning costs in excess of those already collected from ratepayers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although NRC approval of the decommissioning plan does not ensure prevention of misuse or waste of decomissioning funds, the NRC believes that withdrawal of funds for decommissioning activities before a decommissioning plan is developed and approved should require NRC review. This is consistent with Commission guidance which provided that the staff may permit licensees to use their decommissioning funds for the decommissioning permitted above (as the term decommission is defined in 10 CFR 50.2), notwithstanding the fact that their decommissioning plans have not yet been approved by the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The criteria and supporting rationale developed to evaluate licensee proposals for early withdrawals from external decommissioning sinking funds are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The withdrawals are for expenses for legitimate decommissioning activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.2 that would necessarily occur under most reasonable decommissioning scenarios. Section 10 CFR 50.2 defines ``decommission'' as meaning ``to remove (as a facility) safely from service and reduce residual radioactivity to a level that permits release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of licensee.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

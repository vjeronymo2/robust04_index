			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / People: Telspec Telspec, the telephone equipment company being floated tomorrow, has managed to secure the services of 77-year-old ex-Cable &amp; Wireless chairman Lord Sharp as a non-executive director. Sharp (right) is chairman of Stanhope Properties and a non-executive director of Carlton but says he has been seduced back into telecommunications by the 'excitement of a developing area'. The company, meanwhile, hopes to be able to avail itself of his excellent connections in the Far East. He was approached informerly by an old colleague, Paul Skey, who had been principal telephone consultant at C&amp;W, and a director of the group's subsidiary or associate com-panies in Jamaica, Macau and Botswana. Skey had been a director of the pre-flotation Telspec for the past year. When Sharp agreed to come aboard, Skey stepped aside, though he remains a director of Telspec Europe. 'We didn't want to upset BT by having two C&amp;W directors on the board,' is how Telspec chief executive Garth Riley puts it. British Telecom is one of Telspec's principal customers. The other non-executive director is 54-year-old John Rose, managing partner of chartered accountants Hays Allan. He had worked for Telspec between 1980 and 1991 before it changed its auditors to Price Waterhouse because it felt it needed a firm with an international presence.</p>

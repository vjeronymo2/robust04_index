			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GREECE MOVING TO PRIVATIZATION  </P> <P> The government has proposed legislation allowing for sale of 49% of  state-controlled corporations to private interests.  </P> <P> The bill, which is being submitted to Parliament for consideration, refers  specifically to the Agricultural Bank of Greece, one of the nation's largest  banks, and Olympic Airways, the national carrier, and its subsidiaries.  </P> <P> The bill provides that shares would become available on the Athens Stock  Exchange. Over-staffed public sector corporations have often been cited by the  government as contributing to Greece's $100-billion public debt.  </P> <P> The legislation also entitles the state to sell the Bank of Crete, a former  private bank that was nationalized after its owner and chairman was accused of  embezzling $210 million.  </P></p>

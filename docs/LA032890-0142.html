			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3D PICNIC USES INTELLIGENCE, WIT, VARIETY TO HELP SELL DEBUT ALBUM IN A 2D  WORLD;  </P> <P> POP: THE GROUP, WHICH PLAYS TONIGHT AT THE MARQUEE IN WESTMINSTER, HAS FINALLY  FOUND AN OBSCURE SAN DIEGO RECORD LABEL FOR ITS ECLECTIC APPROACH.  </P> <P> 3D Picnic went out and made a debut album that lays out an exceptionally  diverse spread of styles and emotional tones, and pulls off each of them  exceedingly well.  </P> <P> Big mistake.  </P> <P> At least, that is, in the eyes of too much of today's music industry, which  seems to have forgotten how to think in two dimensions, let alone three. The  trick to making it in music nowadays is to fit into one of the ready-made  marketing pipelines that record companies and radio use to reach specialized  segments of a public presumed to be too narrow and fragmented to accept much  diversity.  </P> <P> That made it hard for 3D Picnic -- which plays tonight at Club Tangent at the  Marquee in Westminster -- to find a home for its self-financed album, "Dirt."  The album's 14 songs (18 on compact disc) range from sumptuous Beatlesque pop  to mournful, folk-tinged balladry, with blitzing New Wave and David Bowie-style  rockers and novelty numbers such as a hillbilly joke song, "Dirty Feet," thrown  in for good measure.  </P> <P> Given today's stratified thinking, 3D Picnic's album is far too pop for  alternative and college markets, far too offbeat for Top 40 or mainstream rock  markets and far too diverse for just about everybody who thinks in terms of  markets rather than music.  </P> <P> After repeated rejections by large labels and small, the Los Angeles band,  which has close ties to the Orange County rock scene, found an obscure San  Diego label and distributor, Earth Music/Cargo Records, that dug "Dirt." The  album, completed a year ago, was finally released last week.  </P> <P> Over dinner recently at a restaurant in Sunset Beach, band members Don Burnet,  Carolynne Edwards and Mickey Ferrel were more bemused than bitter about the  problems they had in persuading a record company to take a chance on their  album.  </P> <P> "From a marketing standpoint, it's been difficult," said Burnet, the band's  main singer and songwriter, whose long, rounded face and fisherman's cap make  him look a little like a young John Lennon.  </P> <P> "We're not playing the next big thing," he said. "If the Beatles were around  now and doing the 'White Album,' they'd probably get dropped by their label."  </P> <P> Burnet -- dubbed "Dallas Don" in the album credits -- has been a part of the  local rock scene since 1981, when he and his girlfriend piled into a van in  Chicago, headed west for their spring vacation and never went back.  </P> <P> "I had been a straight-A goodie-goodie, and all of a sudden I did an  about-face," Burnet said of his decision to quit high school at 17 and settle  in Huntington Beach, where he had friends. "I had been really shy and  introverted, and I suddenly found all this stuff I liked."  </P> <P> High on Burnet's list of things to like was punk rock.  </P> <P> "In Illinois I'd been into it, but there hadn't been any scene there. Two weeks  after I got (to Huntington Beach), I saw the Crowd (the first of the Orange  County punk bands) at a party. I said, 'This is great,' and I got into the  scene and into a band. I got my amp shipped out from Illinois."  </P> <P> Burnet's first band, Mox Nix, was "total hard core" in approach. But by 1983,  he was incorporating his more melodic rock roots (he cites the Beatles, Neil  Young, Blondie and the Ramones as key influences) in a punk band called Plain  Wrap. The trio released an album for Enigma Records in 1985, but Burnet decided  to break up the band after bassist Bob Gnarly left, complaining that Plain  Wrap's direction was becoming too pop-oriented.  </P> <P> "Bob would say, 'I just can't get into singin' this "She's Over Me" song (a  fetching pop-harmony number that appears on "Dirt") with all these skinheads  standing there."  </P> <P> While Burnet was figuring out what to do after Plain Wrap, Edwards, who grew up  near Glendale, was becoming dissatisfied with her role as keyboard player in an  all-woman band patterned after the Bangles. She placed a musican-seeks-band ad  that cited the Beatles, R.E.M. and Cheap Trick as her influences. Burnet  responded by sending her a homemade tape of his songs. They got together as a  duo in 1987 and launched 3D Picnic.  </P> <P> "Here I was, a punk from Huntington Beach, and she was a New Wave girl from the  Valley," Burnet said.  </P> <P> Burnet and Edwards kept 3D Picnic going through many lineup changes and a  far-from-clamorous reception as it played the club circuit in Hollywood, Long  Beach and Orange County (band members say their peak draw nowadays ranges from  100 to 150 fans). The current lineup features Burnet, 26, on guitar, Edwards,  24, on guitar and keyboards, Ferrel, 27, who joined about a year ago, on bass,  and drummer Mike Sessa, 24, who joined six months ago and splits time between  3D Picnic and the Hollywood Joneses.  </P> <P> 3D Picnic also had to persevere through a less-than-enthusiastic reception for  the tapes it made in hope of landing a record deal.  </P> <P> "They were offering suggestions like, what if you and the girl sang every song  together, or why don't you sing all the songs, or why doesn't she?" Burnet  said. "There'd be times we'd be thinking, 'Man, maybe we really should change  this.' "  </P> <P> "We briefly thought about it," said Edwards, a slender woman with delicate  features and dyed blond hair. "But it's just kind of false if you say, 'We're  only going to do our fast songs, or our slow countryish songs.' "  </P> <P> The lack of interest from the music industry did take some toll of band morale.  </P> <P> "It got really frustrating at times," Edwards said. "But you'd think, 'We've  come this far, it'd be stupid to give it up.' "  </P> <P> Burnet said he though of disbanding 3D Picnic "a few times. But when we started  the band I vowed not to do what I'd done with Plain Wrap, which was give it up  after too short a time."  </P> <P> Sticking with a varied approach, 3D Picnic recorded "Dirt" in studios in Orange  and Costa Mesa. The production cost of $6,000, according to Burnet, was low for  an album with a rich, full sound, incorporating many harmonies and instrumental  layers that required lots of overdubbing. Burnet said 3D Picnic economized by  thoroughly planning out and rehearsing all the song arrangements in advance so  no time would be wasted in the studio.  </P> <P> Not everything was planned, though. Riding to a gig at Bogart's one night,  Burnet and Edwards began harmonizing into a tiny Walkman cassette recorder,  singing "Dirty Feet," an oldie from the country music-comedy team of Homer and  Jethro. The song, complete with ambient road noise that sounds like waves on a  beach, wound up as the joke finale on the album.  </P> <P> It's a countrified bookend to such other lighthearted numbers as "Party  Planet," with its hangover-in-outer-space sound effects, and "The Last One," a  wry look at bad habits that are too much fun to give up.  </P> <P> On the other end of the emotional spectrum, such numbers as Burnet's "These  Thick Walls" and Edwards' "Seven Days of Mourning" make light-footed use of  language to probe heavy states of depression. Such numbers as "Charles Thinks  About It" and "Forget the Words" round out the album with catchy philosophizing  about how to cope with a world that's wound too tightly.  </P> <P> On stage, Burnet said, 3D Picnic takes a leaner, harder approach: "Live, we're  more raw and faster. I think the live situation and the studio situation should  be treated differently."  </P> <P> "Dirt" is starting to earn some good reviews, and the members of 3D Picnic  expect to go on their first national tour this summer. Conscious that the band  isn't selling "the next big thing," the members are keeping their expectations  low key.  </P> <P> "We're definitely looking to move up. We're not into the idea of being a  college-radio, alternative band all our lives," Burnet said.  </P> <P> But he said the main motivation is still pleasing himself: "I'm doing the same  thing I've been doing ever since I was in a hard-core punk band, which is doing  the music I like to do."  </P> <P> 3D Picnic, Lost Dog and Johnny Monster &amp; the Nightmares play tonight at  9:30 at Club Tangent at the Marquee, 7000 Garden Grove Blvd., Westminster.

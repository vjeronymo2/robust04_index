			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Disposals help trim deficit at Pirelli PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables manufacturer, took a further step towards recovery yesterday with a reduced group net loss of L105bn (Dollars 68.6m) after minority interests for 1992, down from L566bn in 1991. The figure for 1991 has been adjusted for disposals made as part of Pirelli's policy of selling its non-core diversified products division. Group sales rose slightly to L8,252bn from L8,145bn, while losses at the parent company level shrank to L87bn from L424bn. A substantial part of the loss reduction stemmed from extraordinary gains on the sales of activities within the diversified products division. However, Pirelli's basic operating performance also picked up, thanks to heavy industrial restructuring, which reduced the number of its factories by 12 to 90 and sliced the workforce by 6,000. Operating profits rose by about L100bn to L278bn, in spite of L108bn in additional depreciation charges. The company, which is again passing its dividend, warned that market conditions remained very difficult and repeated its commitment to continued restructuring to improve competitiveness. Recent disposals of non-core activities and the group's shares and option rights in Continental, the German rival Pirelli tried to take over in 1990-91, will produce a one-off gain of about L150bn and reduce debts by about L500bn this year. Extraordinary items stemming from the asset sales produced a net gain of L134bn in 1992, helping to lift group net earnings before restructuring charges to a profit of L41bn.</p>

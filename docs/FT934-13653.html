			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Lloyd's Names vote to admit corporate capital: Market expects more than Pounds 1bn in equity will be raised by a dozen new members LLOYD'S NAMES, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported underwriting, yesterday voted emphatically in favour of plans to admit corporate investors, marking a fundamental change in the 300-year-old insurance market. The vote came at the end of a relatively peaceful two-hour meeting attended by about 1,000 Names and will trigger moves by merchant banks and securities houses to raise more than Pounds 1bn in equity capital for more than a dozen new corporate Lloyd's members. The decision came in the face of protests from loss-making Names who have borne the brunt of the market's recent difficulties. All seven Lloyd's proposals for the introduction of corporate capital were endorsed by majorities of at least 20 to one. Only 591 of the more than 31,000 eligible to vote opposed Lloyd's main proposal. Earlier Names rejected by two to one a proposal put forward by the loss-makers to adjourn the meeting until January. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said that the admission of new investors was a 'vital step' in restoring confidence at the market. He said that 'confidence has been damaged most obviously' between Lloyd's and its Names. In addition, 'for the first time in our history our client base has been questioning our relationship, particularly in respect of our ongoing financial strength'. He warned that failure to have approved the motion would have led to continued decline as 'others revel in the business which traditionally has been ours'. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said: 'This is the first bad day our competitors have had for two years'. He said the proposals reflected commercial realities. Summing up before the vote, he reminded Names: 'The world does not owe us a living.' He called the uncertainty over the market's sources an 'Achilles' heel' and said Lloyd's could not afford to remain 'on the back foot'. It had to become 'an aggressive commercial organisation whose sole aim was to maximise profit'. Calling for the meeting to be adjourned, Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which represents 37 action groups of loss-making Names, said that Lloyd's should place a limit on the amount of corporate capital allowed into the market. He accepted that Lloyd's had begun to manage its affairs more effectively, but the changes had come too late for Names burned by losses in 1988, 1989 and 1990. Lloyd's ought to negotiate a settlement to the legal disputes at the market before introducing rule changes to allow corporate members. However, Mr Stockwell accepted the unprecedented undertakings given by Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton that a settlement would be offered to Names by the end of the year. 'If a settlement is to be achieved it must result in those currently bust becoming solvent . . . and must mean an end to Lloyd's attempting to sue Names for what they do not have. 'In spite of all our experiences of broken promises we are going to trust you again,' said Mr Stockwell. 'Fleeced sheep have only their shepherd to turn to.' The working party is also taking issue with proposals for new rules under examination at Lloyd's since last week which would greatly reduce the voting power of the smaller Names and those 'trapped' in the market by their membership of syndicates with 'open years', whose accounts cannot be settled because of uncertainty about future claims.

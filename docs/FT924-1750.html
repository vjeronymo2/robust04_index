			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: More pressure on French franc BOTH the Bundesbank and the Bank of France intervened on the foreign exchanges in support of the French franc yesterday, as the D-Mark consolidated its recent strength, writes James Blitz. Trading in most currencies was extremely thin on account of the Christmas season, and the dollar moved in tight ranges against the D-Mark. However, dealers increasingly believe that the franc may not survive without a devaluation in the run-up to the French parliamentary elections in the spring, and trading in the 'Mark-Paris' cross rate was jittery. News that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, was due to hold a news conference on Thursday morning excited some dealers yesterday. The subject of the news conference remained unspecified last night. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, may have attempted to calm markets by saying that M3 money supply would grow more slowly in November and December, after showing annualised growth of 10.3 per cent in October. Any beneficial impact from this statement, however, was lost by his further comment that German inflation remained high and was unlikely to ease in coming months. This was seen as a further sign that there would be no early end to high German interest rates. The franc was seen at a low of around FFr3.4220 against the D-Mark in late afternoon trading yesterday, before appreciating back to a close of FFr3.4170. Both the French and German central banks intervened in support of the currency at the FFr3.4176 level to the D-Mark around midday. The sums deployed in a thin market were reported to be small. Sharp rises in French money market interest rates may have been a better guide to tensions. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the prospects for a franc devaluation before the spring remained strong, and would be enhanced if signs grew that the French socialists were to lose the March election. 'Traditionally, it is the right wing parties in France that have carried out devaluations of the currency,' he said. Speculation persisted in the market of an early devaluation of the Irish punt, and there were continuing rumours of a post-Christmas holiday alignment downwards of the Danish krone. The Irish central bank cut overnight interest rates to 16 per cent from 20 per cent yesterday. The punt weakened against other European currencies, before rallying to around DM2.6394, two pfennigs above its ERM floor of DM2.6190. Mr Bill Clinton, the US President-elect, said he would back a strong dollar yesterday and this helped to boost the US currency. But the D-Mark's residual strength pushed it off a ledge above DM1.57 to close at DM1.5670 in London. It finished in New York at DM1.5675.</p>

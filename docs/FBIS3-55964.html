Gromak: "Admiral Kravchenko's Five Proposals"] </F>   [Text] The Baltic Institute of Strategic and International  Research has held in Tallinn a conference on cooperation and  security in the Baltic Sea region. You must admit that the  subject is very important to all the countries located on the  Baltic Sea. The conference was attended by delegations from 16  countries. Also a delegation of seven NATO representatives  headed by Brigade General Tom Lennon, deputy chief of the  program for military relations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff of  the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe, arrived to Tallinn, including  German, Finnish, and Norwegian ambassadors to Estonia. Since  the organizers "had forgotten" to invite the Russian envoy,  Russia was represented by Vice Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first  deputy commander of the Baltic Sea Fleet. Among the participants  were also Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas, and Estonian President Lennart Meri. The  latter delivered the opening speech at the conference, the merit  of which was boiled down to an analysis of the results of the  elections in Russia.    Only Zhirinovskiy's victory was discussed at the conference,  summarized one of the participants. According to the Estonian  president's speech, the electoral victory of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia is a factor threatening the security  of the Baltic states. Therefore, NATO should become a guarantor  for their security. I have repeatedly emphasized in my  statements and in numerous conversations, said Vice Admiral  Kravchenko, that neither electoral victory of a separate party  nor even a change of the government would mean a significant  change in the political course. The more so, since democratic  parties and movements will have a majority in the new  legislature. Personally, I believe that our elections have come  in very handy for the Baltics...    The first deputy commander of the Baltic Sea Fleet is not  alone in his opinion on this issue. One does not have to be a  great politician to understand that the representatives of  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania replaced a serious discussion on  solving real security problems of the Baltic Sea region, with  their ambitions to obtain international support for imposing on  Russia ultimate terms for troop withdrawal, as well as to  receive the moral right to introduce openly discriminative  measures against the Russian- speaking population of the Baltic  states. Moreover, this was done in a rather rough and primitive  manner, which generated negative reaction even among the NATO  representatives. One should seek Russia's advice. No matter  what difficulties it is currently experiencing, Russia is a  large state, and one should talk with respect with a large  country, they stated in their official speeches and private  conversations. In response, Lennart Meri commented that the  United States sacrificed the interests of the Baltics to the  global peace problems and the continued reforms in Russia.    This way, a conference on very important issue was converted  by its organizers into a strictly propagandist meeting. Only  the speech by Vice Admiral Kravchenko and concrete proposals of  Baltic Sea Fleet navy men brought some fresh air into it.    What did Vice Admiral Kravchenko exactly propose?    First. To draft an agreement on the free traffic of navy  vessels, in accordance with the international law on navigation  and the existing system of marine traffic control in the Gulf of  Finland.    Second. To legalize and establish a permanent connection  between the command of the Baltic Sea Fleet and the commands of  the Baltic states' navies; to coordinate plans for naval  training; and to establish regulations on emergency procedures.    Third. To provide security within economic zones of Latvia,  Lithuania, and Estonia during naval maneuvers, the Russian side  is willing to take into account reasonable economic interests of  ship owners and fishermen of these countries.    Fourth. To establish cooperation between the hydrographic  services of the Russian Federation and the Baltics, including  the establishment of a system of mutual exchange of navigational  and meteorological data.    Fifth. The issue of cooperation in emergency situations  remains unsolved, since Russia does not have an appropriate  agreement with the Baltic states. This problem must also be  solved.    Unfortunately, the vice admiral took the floor at the end of  the conference, and these concrete proposals were not officially  approved. Estonia's Defense Minister Juri Luik advocated  development of a joint defense policy of the Baltic states,  considering Russia the only enemy. He appealed to establish a  military-political union of the Baltic states, although without  Russia's participation, but with the possibility of Ukraine's  participation. Judging from the Estonian defense minister's  speech, the leaders of this country prefer cooperation with the  West and the Baltics in the field of establishing a security  system, and they intentionally attempt to create a suspicious  atmosphere around Russia, which would resemble the "cold war"  spirit.    Although no concrete discussion on security of the Baltic  Sea  region was held in Tallinn, the Baltic Sea Fleet did not waste  time. The fleet's command one more time demonstrated its good  will to enhance cooperation with the Baltic states. Although  certain circles in the Baltics did not get the message, Brigade  General Tom Lennon did. He came with a proposal to establish a  direct connection between the Baltic Sea Fleet and units of the  U.S. Armed Forces in Europe. This year, such a connection was  established with a division of the Privolzhskiy Military  District. Life has already testified to the fact that such  cooperation, including visits, joint solving of various issues,  and collective work on certain undertakings, has very good  prospects.</p>

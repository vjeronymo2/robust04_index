			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Alliances still in the wind at revamped SAS - Chief executive elect Jan Stenberg shares his vision for the airline with Hugh Carnegy Mr Jan Stenberg, who takes over shortly as chief executive at Scandinavian Airlines System, is anxious to dispel the impression that the company is retreating to its home base. He wants to kill the notion that it has returned to lick the wounds inflicted by the collapse of Alcazar, the failed four-way pan-European merger. The lofty ambitions of Mr Jan Carlzon, whose 12 years as SAS chief crashed with the Alcazar plan, have been scaled down due to 'the economic situation' facing the loss-making airline. SAS is busy shedding non-core operations, such as its travel agencies, credit card subsidiary and hotel ownership, built up under the Carlzon vision of a 'global travel service system'. However, Mr Stenberg, a senior executive at the telecommunications group Ericsson, who will take over from Mr Jan Reinas, Mr Carlzon's stop-gap successor, on April 1, said SAS still wanted to be more than a small regional airline. It planned to build through alliances. Mr Carlzon's message - that SAS faces a tough battle if it is to survive and thrive in an era of growing deregulation and competition, remains valid - and is recognised by a new chief executive who has experienced similar pressures in the telecommunications industry. The scenario SAS and its advisers sketched out before launching the Alcazar negotiations - that a stand-alone future for the airline could mean its collapse within a decade - still holds. Equally, a merger with a large carrier such as Lufthansa could be an option in the long term, Mr Stenberg says. However, his preference is for collaboration with 'a similarly-sized company'. Initially, he wants to see if SAS's so-called 'European quality alliance' co-operation with Swissair and Austrian Airlines - which, with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines were partners in the doomed Alcazar enterprise - can be 'widened and deepened'. He says he has been invited for talks by both airlines. 'In talks with other airlines, including those involved in the Alcazar negotiations, I think we should work on a pattern of collaboration that will make SAS associated in a bigger network than it is today,' he said. Mr Stenberg is also keen to develop ties with British Midland Airways. SAS owns 35 per cent of British Midland's parent company, and will increase its stake to 40 per cent this year. An eventual takeover of British Midland is not on the agenda for now, but is 'worthwhile to consider', Mr Stenberg says. 'With my background in the tele-communications industry, I can see how interested PTTs are to go across borders and buy into smaller companies, take over their telephone services and integrate them. I think we'll see that trend also in the airline industry.' However, Mr Stenberg leaves no doubt about his aversion to any revival of Alcazar-style merger schemes. 'To start up again now the discussion of a physical merger - that would be a serious mistake,' he says. As one of SAS's most frequent flyers - he has clocked up almost 250,000 SAS bonus points over the past year - Mr Stenberg has been in a good position to tune into the feelings of airline staff. 'I talk to people in this organisation - cabin attendants and so on - and they tell me that for a long time they were questioned by passengers about what they thought of Alcazar. They said they just didn't know what to say because they could not imagine what Alcazar really meant. 'What I look for is how a collaboration can be established where the parties can have joint financial interests in something which is not merged in the physical or organisational meaning.' Forging strategic partnerships is not the most urgent priority, however. Top of the list, says Mr Stenberg, is returning SAS to profitability after four straight years of losses. The Scandinavian media has cast him as a hard man brought in to push through a tough cost-cutting plan drawn up by Mr Reinas. The plan will mean SAS's 20,000-strong workforce being cut by 2,900 by the middle of next year, saving SKr3bn (Dollars 375m) in costs. Mr Stenberg insists the tough-guy image is exaggerated. However, he pointedly refuses to endorse Mr Reinas's prediction that SAS will be back in profit in 1994, and cannot be sure that further cost-cutting measures will not be needed. He is also gearing up for a radical restructuring within SAS, intended to reduce duplication of functions in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. That could unleash national political tensions that have always lurked behind the serene Scandinavian image SAS projects to the world. SAS is owned by Danish, Norwegian and Swedish companies, with an element of state ownership in each. However, the siting of its headquarters in Stockholm has often caused resentment in the other two countries. This could intensify with a further concentration in the Swedish capital. 'Some people say SAS stands for Swedish All Swedish. That is an unfair view if you look at how employment is now distributed between the three countries,' Mr Stenberg says. However, he insists that from now on economic efficiency only will dictate how the operation is run. There will be no more 'trebling the functions in order to build up a little castle in each country'.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: De Beers changes terms of venture De Beers, the world's biggest diamond group, has changed the terms of its proposed joint venture with two junior Canadian companies after disappointing results from tests in Canada's Northwest Territories. Nevertheless, De Beers will continue to explore the so-called Yamba Lake concession area and, if the group decides to go into production, it will find financing of up to CDollars 500m (USDollars 357m) for the first mine and earn a 60 per cent interest in the concession. However, De Beers no longer has any obligation to take shareholdings in Mill City Gold and Tanqueray Resources, as it agreed when the joint venture was first mooted last month. De Beers said independent testing of a 24.5 tonnes sample from the Torrie kimberlite pipe at Yamba Lake produced 19 small diamonds weighing in total less than one carat. The Torrie pipe lies in the 'corridor of hope' runs for nearly 150 kilometres and where nearly 100 kimberlite pipes - which sometimes contain diamonds - have been found. This is the second blow for Canadian junior mining companies. A recent unexpected announcement of sampling results by Kennecott, a subsidiary of RTZ of the UK, sent share prices of many of the small companies plummeting.</p>

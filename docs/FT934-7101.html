			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / French government to revitalise sluggish economy Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday said his government would consider new measures to revitalise France's sluggish economy in an attempt to curb the rise in unemployment, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The government has already launched a job creation programme of public works and employment reform. However Mr Balladur plans a special meeting of ministers at the end of the winter to decide whether additional measures are needed. One priority will be to reduce youth unemployment, now running at 20 per cent, almost twice the national average.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK ;  </P> <P> SPELTZ ON PACE TO PASS RECORDS;  </P> <P> SLOW STARTS HAVEN'T SLOWED TITANS' QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> Dan Speltz started his first season at Cal State Fullerton with a bunch of  fumbled snaps in a game played in the rain. He started his second by throwing  nine interceptions in the first three games.  </P> <P> And now, six games into his second and final season, he is on a pace to become  the first Titan to pass for 3,000 yards, and to replace Damon Allen as the  leading passer in Fullerton history.  </P> <P> Speltz threw for a school-record 481 yards against Utah State, which wasn't  enough for a Fullerton victory. All that yardage, and the Titans managed only  three touchdowns and a field goal in a 34-23 loss.  </P> <P> But the performance propelled Speltz into the top 10 in National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. statistics. He is fifth among Division I players in total  offense with 284 yards a game and sixth in passing efficiency.  </P> <P> And with 1,708 yards passing this season, he is on schedule to break Allen's  season record of 2,469 yards, and his career mark of 4,218 yards. Speltz is  currently second on the career list with 3,632.  </P> <P> Speltz also seems certain to break the school record for completion percentage  in a season, set by Ronnie Barber in 1987. Speltz is completing 70% of his  passes, well above Barber's mark of 56%.  </P> <P> The completion percentage and the yardage marks are both enhanced by the type  of offense the Titans are running -- Speltz completes a lot of short passes  that turn into long gains on the run.  </P> <P> But records are records.  </P> <P> More NCAA stats: Despite being held to 35 yards rushing Saturday, Mike Pringle  still leads the nation in all-purpose running with a 222-yard average. Sheldon  Canley of San Jose State (212) is second and Houston's Chuck Weatherspoon  (197), formerly of La Habra High School, is third.  </P> <P> Rocky Palamara, who became Fullerton's career leader in receptions (101) and  yardage (1,594) Saturday, is third in the nation in receptions per game with an  average of eight.  </P> <P> Fullerton plays Pacific at Stockton Saturday, facing a team that has discarded  its wishbone offense under first-year Coach Walt Harris.  </P> <P> Murphy called the Tigers the best Pacific team he has seen in "four, five or  six years." Pacific is 1-4 overall, 1-3 in the Big West.  </P> <P> The basketball team will open preseason practice with a midnight madness  session at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 15, the first minute teams can practice  according to NCAA rules.  </P> <P> Cedric Ceballos, an All-Big West Conference forward last season, shooting guard  Mark Hill and point guard Wayne Williams head the list of returning players  from last season's 16-13 team that won five of six overtime games, including an  upset of Nevada Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The volleyball team broke a 34-match Big West Conference losing streak last  week with a victory over 18th-ranked San Diego State.  </P> <P> Sabrina Dennis, a transfer from Golden West, had three aces, nine blocks and 11  kills against San Diego State, starting a week in which she would have 33 kills  in 65 attempts in three matches.  </P> <P> The victory also was a milestone for first-year Coach Jim Huffman, whose team  is 6-9 overall, 1-5 in conference.  </P> <P> Fullerton plays at UC Irvine tonight and travels to fourth-ranked Cal State  Long Beach Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> June Kearney, assistant women's basketball coach, will be inducted into the  Cedarville College Athletic Hall of Fame this weekend in Cedarville, Ohio. She  will be honored for establishing the women's intercollegiate program at the  school and for her success in coaching four sports over 20 years. Kearney  coached women's basketball, softball, volleyball and field hockey, and had an  overall winning percentage above .600. Fullerton basketball Coach Maryalyce  Jeremiah was given the same honor by Cedarville in 1984, being recognized as a  player and coach.  </P></p>

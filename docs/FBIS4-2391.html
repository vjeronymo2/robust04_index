			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- A series of measures  taken by the Chinese Government has managed to check illegal  entrepot trade of textiles, an official said here today.    Addressing the fourth national conference on cracking down  on  activities of illegal entrepot trade of textiles, Vice-Minister  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said  that in the recent period, the Chinese Government has  strengthened its work on striking back at illegal entrepot trade  activities. He added that leading members of departments of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, customs and departments  for inspection of import and export commodities throughout the  country as well as various textile companies have strengthened  their leadership over the work and have laid down a series of  rules and regulations on it.    Meanwhile, Vice-Minister Shi said, many documents are being  distributed and the mass media are being used to publicize the  significance of the work to allow more enterprises to understand  the severe harmfulness of illegal entrepot trade of textiles.    He explained that illegal entrepot trade of textiles refers  to those activities of enterprises or individuals trying illegal  methods to bypass the administration of textile rations and  export Chinese-made textiles through a third country or region  to those countries and regions which ration the quantity of  imported Chinese-made textiles.    Vice-Minister Shi stressed that China will continue to  actively cooperate with the governments of countries and regions  concerned to crack down on activities of illegal entrepot trade.    The current conference was sponsored jointly by the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General  Administration of Customs and the State Administration for the  Inspection of Import and Export Commodities.    Zhou Keren, director of the Department of Trade  Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, announced at the conference today that four  enterprises in Liaoning, Fujian and Guangdong Provinces have  been severely punished for their activities in illegal entrepot  trade of textiles.    Shankou Company under Dongmao Industrial Co. Ltd. in  Shenyang, Capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China,  signed in August 1993, with a Hong Kong company to export 6,200  dozens of cowboy shorts and 1,980 dozens of pajamas for ladies  to Singapore. The products were made by three factories in  Shenyang, in Guangdong Province and in Yingkou city. However,  they were labelled Fijian- made and were transited to the United  States in October and November in the same year.    The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation has decided to confiscate all the earnings from the  business of Shankou Company, cut off all its quotas of export  textiles from the business, and deprive it of its right to apply  for such quotas in 1994. Besides, the ministry also ordered the  Shenyang city committee of foreign trade and economic  cooperation to have all the business activities of the company  suspended. The ministry also suggested that the departments in  charge of the company should sanction disciplinary actions for  those people who are responsible for the illegal business.    The other three enterprises punished were Guangyu Xiamen Co.  Ltd. in Fujian Province, and Shifa Garment Co. Ltd. and Yongjia  Garment Co. Ltd., both in Shantou city, south China's Guangdong  Province.</p>

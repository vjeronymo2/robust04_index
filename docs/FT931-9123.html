			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Best protection against the risk of punitive damages Sir, Your analysis of the punitive damages threat to foreign businesses in America raises the right issues, but does not necessarily give the best answer ('The high cost of damaged goods', February 9). Arbitration (the enforceable form of alternative dispute resolution) does not exclude the possibility of punitive damages. The laws of the individual states normally permit an arbitration to award punitive damages, as a court can. In fact, an arbitration may increase the risk of punitive damages. First, an arbitration panel (normally one or three members) is smaller than a jury (normally 12 members), so the undisclosed prejudices or misconceptions of an individual member have more adverse impact in an arbitration. Second, the award of a jury can be reviewed by a court. This means that the defendant has some pressure to negotiate down the award of punitive damages before the appeal is heard, while the appeal court itself may overturn the entire jury award and order a new trial if there is an error in the trial, or may reduce the award of punitive damages. The award of an arbitration panel cannot normally be reviewed by a court. Third, the more informal atmosphere of an arbitration can be more favourable to an individual than a company, as the company has less scope for attacking the individual's credibility in the cosy environment of a small hearing room. A good product, cautious marketing, demonstrable corporate integrity and good legal advice at every step are some of the best techniques to protect against punitive damages.

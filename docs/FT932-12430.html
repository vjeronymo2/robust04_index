			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo buoyed by strong domestic sales PEPSICO, the soft drinks, restaurants, and snacks group, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 260.4m in the 12 weeks to March 20, the first quarter of its financial year. Ahead of accounting-related charges, this reflected an 11 per cent improvement on the same period of 1992. Sales were up 13 per cent at Dollars 5.09bn, while earnings per share advanced 10 per cent to 32 cents a share. PepsiCo said domestic business did particularly well, with profits rising 23 per cent - the strongest growth it has seen in nine quarters. On the international front, progress was held back by weak economies in the UK and Australia and unfavourable currency movements.</p>

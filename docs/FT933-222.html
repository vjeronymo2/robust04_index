			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Criminal case over Hoover ruled out TRADING standards officials yesterday ruled out criminal action against Hoover over its free-flights offer, but criticised the company for failing to foresee that the scheme would go so badly wrong. Mid-Glamorgan trading standards department, which has received almost 2,000 complaints, said it had received legal advice that there were no grounds for prosecuting the company under the Trade Descriptions Act. The department said criminal action could be brought only if Hoover could be shown to have known in advance that its statements about the free flights were false and if it was criminally careless. It said that while Hoover might be accused of miscalculating the take-up of its offer, there was no evidence that the company had set out to deceive or defraud customers. The department said it was calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to review the Trade Descriptions Act. The department, which conducted its investigation on behalf of trading standards authorities throughout the country, said Hoover customers who had not received free flights to which they believed they were entitled could still take civil action. Hoover said it was pleased by the department's decision.</p>

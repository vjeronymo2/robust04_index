			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings advance at Noranda to CDollars 32m THE recent drop in the Canadian dollar and improved commodity prices helped Noranda, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, almost to double second-quarter earnings. The latest earnings are still not sufficient to cover the quarterly dividend. But Noranda is leaving the payout unchanged at 25 cents, apparently in expectation of a further improvement in commodity prices and earnings later this year. Several other Bronfman-controlled companies have cut their dividends in recent weeks. Net income rose to CDollars 32m (USDollars 27.1m), or nine cents a share, from CDollars 18m, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues dipped slightly to CDollars 2.21bn from CDollars 2.28bn. The mainspring of the higher earnings came from metals and minerals, whose contribution advanced to CDollars 55m from CDollars 16m. Higher zinc prices and the more favourable exchange rate helped this year's performance, while earnings last year were depressed by a strike at Brunswick Mining and Smelting. Forest products moved from a CDollars 12m loss to earnings of CDollars 10m, thanks to stronger lumber and panelboard markets, and the closure of some loss-making mills. The company said that pulp markets are starting to show signs of a turnround, but newsprint and other types of paper remain depressed. Interest charges fell to CDollars 94m from CDollars 116m, although long-term debt rose to CDollars 4.8bn from CDollars 4.5bn.</p>

It should be recalled that U.S. Government officials have  issued a report stating that during 1993 there were several  cases of human rights violations in Chile.    The U.S. ambassador stated that the report is positive, and  the Foreign Ministry under secretary said it was better than the  past one and it acknowledges the efforts made by the current  government.    Cantuarias rejected the report, which he said was  unacceptable because it represents an intervention in a  democratic country where the state of law prevails.    The UDI legislator said Chilean dignity is trampled on  whenever U.S. Government officials feel they have the right to  intervene in domestic affairs and voice their opinion on our  behavior.    Cantuarias then said that the United States has many  unsolved  problems and its officials should be busy trying to solve them.</p>

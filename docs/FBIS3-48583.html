Here is our radio's  opinions:    The newspaper CAMBODIA LIFE on 19 January quoted sources as  saying that Khmer Rouge General Chhit Choeun or Mok has ordered  the Khmer Rouge's 998th Division to step up its operations  around the Tonle Sap lake area to kill fishermen of Vietnamese  origin.    The newspaper commented that the 998th Division comprises of  young soldiers who are notorious for their barbarous acts.    This is not the first time the Khmer Rouge conducted  terrorist acts against people of Vietnamese origin in Cambodia.  The Khmer Rouge have never renounced their attempts to massacre  these people, especially since 1993. On 10 March last year, the  Khmer Rouge killed 46 people of Vietnamese origin in Chong  Khneas village, Siem Reap provincial capital, near Tonle Sap  lake. During the massacre, the Khmer Rouge resorted to barbarism  in their killing of women, children, and old people.    Vietnamese residents living in Cambodia are under the threat  every day and every hour. The Vietnamese Government and the  world public have many times condemned the Khmer Rouge for such  barbarous acts and called for appropriate measures to protect  these people. However, until now, there have never been positive  actions taken.    The newspaper CAMBODIA LIFE said the Khmer Rouge continue  the  policy of discrimination against Vietnamese nationals and the  world community should take appropriate measures to check the  barbarous hands of the Khmer Rouge.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Ways to cure unemployment In the member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development unemployment stands at 35m, 8 1/2 per cent of the labour force. This is the gravest economic failure and social problem they confront. That is why the OECD secretariat was asked to prepare its study of employment and unemployment. It is also why careful attention needs to be paid both to its analysis and to its largely persuasive recommendations. Inevitably, the subtleties are lost in the fevered British political debate. All parties can claim some support from the OECD, although the Conservative party's deregulatory approach wins the battle on points. The OECD insists, for example, that statutory minimum wages 'often end up damaging employment opportunities for unskilled labour'. Similarly, it remarks that employment protection legislation 'can make employers more reluctant to hire new workers'. Yet, faultlessly even-handed, it also points out that minimum wages can be varied, by age or region, and that 'employment security can encourage investment in on-the-job training'. Such eclecticism can be irritating, but, in this case, it has virtues. For this report shows not only how far performance diverges, but that virtually all countries fail in at least one respect, while remedies must be multi-dimensional, because the problem is. No single bullet will slay the unemployment dragon. Performance varies dramatically even within the European Union. In 1993, the youth unemployment rate was only 4.9 per cent in Germany, but 24.6 per cent in France. Female unemployment stood at 6.1 per cent in Germany and 8.1 per cent in the UK, but at 28.9 per cent in Spain. The long-term unemployed were 59.0 per cent of the total in Belgium, but only 27.0 per cent in Denmark. Markedly worse For all that, overall EU employment performance was markedly worse than in the US, or Japan. EU-wide youth unemployment stood at 20.6 per cent, for example, as against 13.3 per cent in the US and 5.1 per cent in Japan. The share of long-term unemployment stood at 42.2 per cent of the total in the EU, but 11.2 per cent in the US. Employment has hardly grown in the EU since 1960, while it is up more than 80 per cent in North America. Yet all is not well in the US. Real wages of low-paid workers fell by more than 1 per cent a year in the 1980s, while wage differentials have risen considerably. The US then has a real income problem, just as the EU has an unemployment problem. Since the aims must be higher employment, lower unemployment and higher real wages, this seems to create a nasty dilemma. Is a growing army of the working poor a necessary result of successful policies to promote employment? Growing gap The OECD is not that pessimistic. Naturally and rightly, it rejects protectionism or policies to slow technological change. It insists, instead, that 'the single most important cause of rising unemployment, as well as a growing incidence of low-wage jobs, is a growing gap between the need for OECD economies to adapt and innovate and their capacity and even will to do so'. Its array of policy recommendations include macroeconomic stability, faster diffusion of technological know-how, increased flexibility of working time, nurturing entrepreneurship, making wages and labour costs more adaptable to market conditions, reforming employment security provisions, making labour market policies more pro-active, improving skills and competences and, most important of all, reforming benefit and tax systems, to ensure that social objectives are achieved in ways that impinge less on efficient functioning of labour markets. Every country should examine all these policies, to improve the trade-off between high employment, on the one hand, and rising and reasonably equal real incomes, on the other. Yet dilemmas remain. Education and training are long-term policies. In the meantime, jobs offered to the unskilled must be profitable for employers, and remunerative to employees. There are two possible strategies: restricting the availability of social benefits or shifting them sharply towards job-promotion. The former is ruthless, the latter expensive. A third possibility consists of leaving things in the EU largely as they now are. But if EU members remain determined to preserve their current welfare states and labour market protection, they may find unemployment rising still further. In the long term, that could well be the most socially damaging choice of all.</p>

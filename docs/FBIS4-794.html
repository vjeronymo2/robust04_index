			<p>BFN     [Text] Army and RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] leaders met  this afternoon for the first time in eight days, since the  fighting broke out. Their talks lasted about one hour, and they  are due to resume tomorrow. For now, no agreement has been  reached, no cease-fire signed. On the ground, things seem to be  calming down, as Colonel Luc Marchal, commander of the Belgian  UN peacekeeping forces, explained to Thierry Perret:    [Begin recording] [Marchal] We have seen a certain  stabilization, which means that the fighting has died down  somewhat, one could say that it has all but stopped, though  there have been a few flare-ups. A series of political  negotiations are going on, which should allow them to clarify  their positions. It is clear that with what has happened in the  last 10 days, I do not know, we cannot expect things to  stabilize overnight, but, well, I am quite skeptical at the  moment as to the chances of a solution or a definitive status  quo [sentence as heard].    [Perret] Do you have the feeling in Kigali today that the  RPF  can take the town?    [Marchal] The RPF has massed to the north of the town. It  has brought in regular units which progressed quite normally. I  think that it had hoped that these battalions could infiltrate  and win a victory from within, but it seems that these units  that have been infiltrated have got as far as they are likely to  get, and that in order to take the city, the RPF will now have  to use all its available means.

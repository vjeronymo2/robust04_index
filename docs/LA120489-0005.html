			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE'S FAITH IN COMMUNISM UNSHAKEN DESPITE CHANGE  </P> <P> Three decades after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev promised to bury capitalism  and the West, the people of Eastern Europe have instead all but put the  tombstone over communism's grave.  </P> <P> The dizzying turn of events in countries such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary,  where the word communism has been eradicated from the lexicon, has left  American communists such as Art Edelman and his wife, Esther Auerbach, confused  and rethinking their beliefs of the past 40 years.  </P> <P> But, while Communist parties are quickly becoming anathema in Eastern Europe,  Edelman and Auerbach's faith in communism remains unshaken. To them, communism  is not the anachronism that many critics, including the FBI, say it has become  in the United States.  </P> <P> "Very frankly, this has been a confusing period. This is a new experience,"  said Edelman, 64, a party member since 1947. " . . . When our comrades in the  United States see what's taking place in Europe, they have questions and  debates. But they have confidence in socialism."  </P> <P> Edelman and his wife acknowledge some of communism's failures. But they argue  that capitalism itself has failed in the United States. The widening gap  between rich and poor, the growing homeless problem, the conservatives' war  against trade unions and other "inherent contradictions" will eventually steer  this country to the same reforms that are enveloping Eastern Europe, they say.  </P> <P> In a recent interview in their comfortable, College Area apartment, Edelman and  Auerbach spoke candidly about the recent events in Eastern Europe, and how  those changes have confirmed or clashed with the ideology they were taught or  believed in for several decades.  </P> <P> Lured by the weather, the couple moved to San Diego last year from New York,  where they worked at the Communist Party USA's national headquarters. Their  well-furnished home and quick wit are in stark contrast to the picture of the  stoic, ascetic agitators that many people may have of communists. While meeting  with a reporter, the conversation was briefly interrupted by a UPS delivery  man, who was bringing them Christmas packages from relatives on the East Coast.  </P> <P> Aside from the fact that they are communists, Edelman and Auerbach said, they  are like most American couples. Because of his East Coast roots, Edelman likes  hockey, follows the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, and counts Frankie  Brimsek, a goalie for the Bruins during the 1940s among his heroes. Auerbach,  who works in an office, said she likes parties, "not necessarily communist,"  and dancing.  </P> <P> Despite being jailed for his beliefs, and harassed by the FBI and the defunct  House Un-American Activities Committee, Edelman said, he has never regretted  becoming a communist.  </P> <P> Membership in the party subjected him to constant FBI surveillance, Edelman  said, which led to frequent job dismissals when agents visited his employers.  </P> <P> In the early 1950s, he was dragged before the activities committee in  Pittsburgh, where he lived. On another occasion, he was jailed for eight months  for "painting peace signs" in New York. The signs, which were painted in public  places, read "Peace No H-Bombs." Edelman said he viewed those hardships as "the  price I paid for being a good American."  </P> <P> "Communism has helped me be a good American. . . . It's made me sensitive to  working people and taught me values that helped me fight against racism," he  said.  </P> <P> Auerbach, who was a "red diaper baby," meaning she was the child of communists,  joined the party in 1962, but her elderly parents have been members most of  their adult lives. Auerbach, 47, said the move for democracy in Eastern Europe  was a natural one and part of communism's evolutionary process. But she also  was surprised by its suddenness.  </P> <P> But does the democratic movement overseas mean communism has been a failure?  Was communism in fact already failing when Khrushchev issued his threat to the  West? Do the events in Eastern Europe prove that communists, including Edelman  and Auerbach, have been wrong for 40 years?  </P> <P> The American couple say the answer to those and similar questions is yes, and  no. While acknowledging that mistakes were made by communist leaders in the  past, they said that the errors were understandable and, in some cases,  expected.  </P> <P> Edelman, a retired carpenter and World War II Navy veteran, said communism's  hard line of the past was prompted by the U.S. policy of containment during the  Cold War. He credited Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and "Gorbymania" for  laying the groundwork for democracy in Europe and the world, including the  United States.  </P> <P> "The movement for peace in the world has been led by Gorbymania," Edelman said.  "These are the ideas that are moving Europe and the world today. Some leaders,  communist and non-communist, are unable to grasp these new concepts. . . . The  cultural exchange (between San Diego and the Soviet Union) proves that people  in San Diego and the United States want peace and friendship with the Soviets."  </P> <P> Instead of rejecting communism, Auerbach argued that the reform movement in  communist countries is nothing less than "a continuation of socialism and  furthering of democracy."  </P> <P> As to arguments that Gorbachev's reforms prove that communism has been a  failure, he said:  </P> <P> "Gorbachev says exactly the opposite. He says that the history of the Soviet  Union is a glorious history, and the history of socialism is a feat  unparalleled in the world."  </P> <P> Auerbach believes that the United States will eventually end up in the path of  the current reform movement.  </P> <P> "Capitalism is not serving the needs of the people. . . . My concern is that  democracy needs to be improved here," she said. "I believe that socialism is  the way to do this. Socialism, with whatever flaws it has, can do these things  better."  </P> <P> Throughout their meeting with a reporter, Edelman and Auerbach never talked  about the proletariat or bourgeoisie, familiar communist buzzwords denoting the  workers and the capitalists. Their continual promotion of socialism provided  the only hint of the uncompromising dogma endorsed by the party in the United  States for more than half a century.  </P> <P> Today, communists endorse and actively support "progressive" candidates when  party members are not on the ballot.  </P> <P> "We can't influence the policies and events in Eastern Europe," Edelman said.  "But we can influence what's happening in the United States. . . . It's  perfectly logical that we support progressive candidates, even if they aren't  communists."  </P> <P> Auerbach and Edelman scoffed at the prevailing view of non-communists that U.S.  communists take their orders from Moscow and are disloyal Americans.  </P> <P> "We view problems in the U.S. from our perspective as Americans," she said.  "Nobody gives us marching orders. Each country, including the U.S., will travel  the road to socialism based on its own tradition."  </P> <P> "All communists, no matter where they live, are loyal to their country," said  Edelman, whose first wife was also a communist. "If any nation -- any nation --  were to threaten the U.S., I would defend my country, just like I did in World  War II."  </P> <P> That the pair ended up as communists is hardly surprising. Edelman's family  came from the Ukraine. While he was growing up in Queens, New York, his father  was "an old socialist." Eventually, another brother and sister joined the  Communist Party. But Edelman himself was a rabid anti-communist while he was in  the Navy, he said.  </P> <P> "I was young and influenced by the government's campaign against communists. I  too ridiculed them for being bomb-throwing anarchists. I hated them," Edelman  said.  </P> <P> Auerbach, also a New York native, was an only child, and her communist parents  live in New Jersey. While she was growing up, her parents made it a policy to  always live in integrated neighborhoods, she said.  </P> <P> "I'm a red-diaper baby. But just because my parents were communists didn't  automatically make me a communist. . . . I had very little interest in  communism until 1962, when we were confronted by the Cuban missile crisis and  the threat of nuclear war," she said.  </P> <P> Auerbach's two sons are party members, but none of Edelman's four children  joined the party.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry to say they are not communists, but they are not reactionaries,  either," he said. "Well, they're Democrats."  </P></p>

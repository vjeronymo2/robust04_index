			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Body Shop defends position on ethics Body Shop International, the cosmetics group whose watchword is environmental soundness, yesterday defended itself against reports over the weekend which raised questions about its green credibility and ethics, Alan Cane writes. An article in the Financial Times on Friday which reported that Franklin Research Development, a US ethical investment fund, had advised its clients to sell Body Shop shares 'did not fairly represent the position', Ms Angela Bawtrie, in charge of investor relations, said. Mr Gordon Roddick, Body Shop chairman, was not available for comment but is believed to be writing to the FT to set out his interpretation of the situation. Reports in other newspapers that Body Shop paid two US businesswomen Dollars 3.5m in 1987 for the Body Shop name and that a US journal Business Ethics will shortly publish an article critical of the company's Trade Not Aid policy - buying supplies from indigenous people in developing countries - were not denied but shrugged off as 'old news'. Franklin, which manages about Pounds 350m in funds on behalf of 300 clients interested in ethical investment, changed its recommendation for Body Shop shares on July 15. It is understood it had been concerned about increasing competition in the company's core markets coupled with worries about forthcoming press reports. Over the past few weeks it has sold about 50,000 Body Shop shares. Ms Bawtrie said yesterday that Body Shop had been told by Franklin that it would not be against buying the company's stock again. Body Shop does not dispute that Franklin changed its recommendation, but argues its relationship with the fund is sound and that it is working with Franklin on a new company analysis. Its shares slipped 4p to 238p on Friday.</p>

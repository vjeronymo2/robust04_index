			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 3 SAPA -- Western Cape premier-elect  Hernus Kriel on Tuesday [3 May] pledged himself to  reconciliation with political opponents and co-operation with  the central government.    At a press conference Mr Kriel, who led the National Party  to  its only regional victory, said he had already had cordial  telephonic discussions with African National Congress Western  Cape leader Allan Boesak.    He was optimistic they would have a good working  relationship. At a meeting on Tuesday afternoon they would  discuss matters such as the composition of a 10-member  provincial cabinet. The NP would have six members and the ANC  four. He did not foresee problems in co-operating with the  ANC-dominated central government. Its rights and powers would  be respected, but those of the region would be jealously guarded.    The government of the Western Cape would work together with  the central government in a spirit of reconciliation and  co-operation. "There is no animosity from our side whatsoever."  He was aware of racial tensions as the result of the elections  in the Western Cape and developing a reconciliation programme  would be a priority.    "We will have to work out a plan of action to tackle that  problem, but it is something we have to do along with the ANC  and this will be started as soon as the new cabinet meets. We  must put our political fight behind us and become  task-orientated in serving the community. We want to make the  Western Cape the jewel province of the new South Africa."    He expressed appreciation for calls by ANC leader Nelson  Mandela and the Congress of South African Trade Unions for  acceptance of the result. He would meet community leaders soon.  "I will go out of my way to meet leaders to assure them of the  good intentions of the National Party. In the final analysis we  will have to prove ourselves, and we intend doing that."    Other priorities were social upliftment, economic  development, peace and security. He was not averse to the ANC's  Reconstruction and Development Programme but it would have to be  adapted to resouces in the Western Cape. Affordability and  timeframes would be factors.    Mr Kriel said he would seek support of the other parties to  change the name of the area to "Cape of Good Hope", but this  would not be done unilaterally.</p>

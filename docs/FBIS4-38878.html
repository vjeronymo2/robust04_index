			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Tereshchenko of Moscow City Hall Press </F> Center: "Do You Want to Become a Muscovite? Then Pay Up!"]    [Text] The Moscow government has issued a decree "On the  Taxation of Citizens Coming To Live in Moscow." The authorities  have decided to take this step on the basis of the following  fact (and, as we know, facts are stubborn things): Thousands of  new arrivals who have bought themselves Moscow accommodations in  recent years are, one way or another, living in the capital  without a permit. The situation clearly cannot be rectified by  countermeasures in the old "Stalinist" spirit, and that is  obvious to everyone. City Mayor Yu. Luzhkov tilted the balance  in favor of a civilized approach by ratifying a procedure for  examining questions of the registration of foreign citizens in  housing space which belongs to them on the basis of ownership  rights.    Now, as of 1 June, it is planned to introduce this type of  tax for people arriving from regions of the Russian Federation  (with the exception of Moscow Oblast) and from foreign countries  near and far to live permanently in Moscow. According to the  document, the money paid by people coming from other cities will  go into compensating expenditure on Muscovites' material and  consumer facilities and other items of expenditure.    The Moscow government has determined three categories of  taxpayer: Russian Federation citizens; citizens of CIS  countries; and foreign citizens and people with no citizenship.  Correspondingly, there are three rates of taxation: an amount  equivalent to 500 times the monthly minimum wage established by  the Russian Federation law for Russian Federation citizens;  1,000 times for CIS citizens; and 2,500 times for foreigners and  people without citizenship. However, the authorities have not  ruled out the right to fix a preferential taxation rate. Only  the Moscow government commission for housing questions, permits,  and discharges can grant this right -- if there are valid  reasons.    A "new-fledged Muscovite" will have to pay the taxes on his  own initiative, via banking or any other Moscow credit  institutions.    One small thing is lacking: The Moscow City Duma has yet to  give the go-ahead for the imposition of the tax as of 1 June or  ratify the Moscow City draft law "On a Targeted Tax for  Compensating City Budget Expenditure on the Development of the  City's Infrastructure and Provision for Social and Living  Conditions of Citizens Coming to Moscow City."    What does the draft law deal with?    The owner of housing space (individual) and members of his  family with whom he (they) has been registered before arriving  in Moscow will receive the right of registration in Moscow  (permit).    At the same time, the housing space acquired as property  must  be located in buildings which are not subject to evacuation in  connection with demolition or reconstruction, and must  correspond to the established housing standard of at least 9  square meters of housing space for each member of a family.  Incidentally, the payment of the city tax for the right of  registration (permit) in Moscow does not entail any commitments  on the part of the municipal housing department or other housing  organs in terms of the allocation of housing space to people who  come from other cities.</p>

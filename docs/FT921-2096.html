			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Brazil 'close' to Dollars 40bn debt rescheduling BRAZIL's chief debt negotiator said yesterday he expected to announce an agreement soon on an outline accord to restructure over Dollars 40bn of medium-term debt the government owes to international banks. Mr Pedro Malan told the Financial Times yesterday: 'We've made very significant progress and there are no major obstacles left .. We hope to be able to announce something shortly'. Mr Malan was due to meet with the full advisory committee of creditor banks in New York last night. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which leads the advisory committee, said yesterday: 'The negotiations are progressing well and we are getting close to an agreement.' Bankers said there were important differences to resolve, including the interest rate to be paid on one type of bond to be issued under the restructuring. The restructuring will follow the lines of the Brady plan, under which banks are given the choice of exchanging existing debt for a variety of new concessional bonds, some of which carry guarantees of principal payments and of interest. Banks can also opt to make new loans. A discount rate of 35 per cent - the same as that achieved by Mexico in its landmark debt restructuring two years ago - has been accepted by both sides. Some Dollars 40bn of previously restructured debt will be covered by the agreement, along with Dollars 3.3bn in new loans made in 1988, which will be treated more favourably. Brazil carries the largest foreign debt in the Third World, totalling Dollars 116.2bn at the end of 1990. According to one banker the most important concessional bonds on offer will carry a 12-month guarantee of interest payments and a guarantee of principal repayments. One sticking point has been the volume and timing of guarantees on the new bonds. The Brazilians have now offered Dollars 3bn in guarantees, helped by a spectacular increase in foreign reserves, thought to be over Dollars 13bn. Bankers say the government has requested a Dollars 700m bridging loan from the banks to help finance guarantees.</p>

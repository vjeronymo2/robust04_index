			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Monitoring role of EC's 'ice-cream men' crucial CALLED the ice-cream men by their supporters, but lackeys of Germany by their opponents, the white-uniformed EC observers have played a crucial role in trying to monitor 15 ceasefires since arriving in Croatia last August. The 170 unarmed monitors have worked indefatigably from their headquarters in Hotel 'I' in Zagreb. Moreover, because this is the first time that the EC has sent monitors to any country, they have had no previous experience or standards to adopt. Their task initially was to supervise the implementation of ceasefires forged by the EC with the federal army, Croatia's national guard, and Serb and Croat paramilitary units. But, since September, the monitors have been involved in setting up negotiations to secure the peaceful withdrawal of soldiers from federal army garrisons in Croatia. In addition, the monitors set up many local ceasefires to secure the safe passage of relief and medical supplies, and some reprieve from the war for civilians. Above all, the monitors have attempted to set up confidence-building measures. 'It has not been easy. We have been manipulated by Croats, Serbs, and the federal army. We have been shot at, our helicopters were fired on in the autumn, but we feel we have made substantial progress. We must continue,' said one Zagreb-based monitor.</p>

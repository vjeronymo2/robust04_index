			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: 'BEIN' WITH BEHAN' AT WEST END PLAYHOUSE  </P> <P> The three set pieces on stage at the West End Playhouse quickly place a frame  around Michael L. Kavanagh's one-man "Bein' With Behan." A battered upright  piano, a table with a half-empty tumbler of Guinness beside a battered  typewriter and an old-fashioned booth partition with a bare wooden seat place  the time (a good while ago) and the place (McDaid's Pub in Dublin).  </P> <P> McDaid's is a writers' hangout and no one hung out more (or was more hung over)  than Brendan Behan -- Irish poet, playwright, bon vivant and legendary IRA  scrapper. His life was the stuff of romance: imprisoned at 16 for transporting  IRA explosives to Liverpool; jailed again at home for further revolutionary  indiscretions and released in the general amnesty of 1946; internationally  acclaimed for his prose ("Borstal Boy") and plays ("The Quare Fellow," "The  Hostage"), and through it all celebrating the Irish spirit as grandly as  O'Casey and Synge.  </P> <P> In the years Kavanagh has been doing this piece he has allowed Behan to inhabit  his being. Or is it the other way round? He is discovered hunting and pecking  at the typewriter, slugging amiable mouthfuls of stout, turning to the audience  as though it were another patron of McDaid's approaching him.  </P> <P> Kavanagh, as Behan, grabs at the opportunity. He talks about his youth as a  house painter's apprentice, about his mother ("a peasant once removed" who  "died regularly every week for years") and the harsh reality of the Dublin  working class in the first half of the 20th Century ("To get something to eat  was an achievement; to get something to drink was a complete victory").  Kavanagh takes us with Behan through the prison terms and skirmishes on the  embattled streets of Ireland, through personal traumas and the beginnings of  creative fulfillment.  </P> <P> Behan is difficult to stop once he gets going -- he is a Celt, after all -- and  only interrupts himself when the urge overcomes him to have another Guinness  and break out with a haunting Irish melody.  </P> <P> Kavanagh knows the humor of his subject, and his sadness, and his will to  further the cause -- of both Behan and the IRA. Under Bruce Heighley's  direction, it is a performance full of humanity and a ripe understanding of the  skyrocket that was Behan.  </P> <P> The viewer who approached Behan at the beginning feels a little lonely when the  great man drains another glass and turns back to his typewriter.  </P> <P> At 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5  p.m.; ends Feb. 4. Tickets: $15; (818) 904-0444.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Orpheus in New Orleans' at Inglewood Playhouse  </P> <P> "Orpheus in New Orleans" is an ambitious project. At the Inglewood Playhouse,  those ambitions are barely realized. The production suffers primarily from the  bane of musicals, a less than adequate book.  </P> <P> There is a story, a modern reworking of the Orpheus legend centered around  Mardi Gras and involving prostitution and voodoo. But the characters in Henry  Adams' skimpy book don't rise above comic book level. They act and react on the  most simplistic impulses. The viewer is never drawn into their problems and  doesn't leave with much concern for their traumas.  </P> <P> The score (music by Alfred Johnson and Henry Butler, lyrics by Johnson and  Martin Kibbee) is lively, often amusing ("Good loving just don't last, but good  cookin' do" sung by an overweight hooker) and contains a couple of affecting  ballads ("Say You Will" and the heroine's lament "Alone"). But it doesn't have  the size that this type of musical requires.  </P> <P> The evening is almost made worthwhile by some of the performances, particularly  Valerie Washington's Mama Roux, madam and voodoo maven; Mironda Lewis' simple  heroine Eulalia; Arthur Burghardt's medicine-man-styled narrator, Bayou John,  and Phillip Lewis' cool and jazzy ne'er-do-well Willy. Their vocal work is  outstanding. But the material they have to deal with does little to keep the  legend alive.  </P> <P> In Centinela Park, off Warren Street, Inglewood; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.;  Sundays, 3 p.m.; ends Jan. 28. Tickets: $10; (213) 936-7600 or (213) 281-1914.  T. H. McCULLOH  </P></p>

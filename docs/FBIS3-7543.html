			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the midst of a threat from the United States to  withdraw most favored nation (MFN) status from China, Foreign  Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday said it would be  unwise for Washington to use its MFN tool on Beijing now that  the nuclear threat in the Korean peninsula continues to be  alarming. Mr. Romulo pointed out that North Korea's relations  with Beijing as its last remaining ally should be viewed with  serious concern by the United States because "Beijing is a key  player in maintaining equilibrium in this region." "We hope  Washington would soon come to an understanding of what their  position is vis-a-vis China," Mr. Romulo said, referring to the  disconcerting dispute on Washington's move of linking the  granting of MFN status to Beijing over alleged human rights  abuses. "I understand and sympathize with their concerns on  human rights abuses but I do not believe that they should use  MFN as the big stick. In this particular instance, unless and  until the Unites States comes to a resolution of what their  policy is, I think the big stick approach is inappropriate  because it might generate a certain level of instability in this  otherwise unstable region. [sentence as published] And the only  people who will suffer in this are people like us who are in  this region. That's why we are asking the United States to look  at their policy and come up with a responsible approach so that  it does not generate disequilibrium in this part of the world,"  he said.</p>

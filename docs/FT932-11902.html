			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown finance director resigns HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food group, has lost the finance director it appointed only last June. Mr Simon Moffat resigned because his appointment 'has not worked out as envisaged by either side', the company said yesterday. He is expected to receive compensation but the amount has yet to be agreed. Sir John Nott, who yesterday took over as chairman from Sir Harry Solomon, told shareholders of the departure at yesterday's annual general meeting. Mr Moffat is being replaced by Mr Ray Mackie who joined the group in January as corporate affairs director. He came from KPMG Peat Marwick, the group's auditors, where he was corporate finance partner. Sir John refused to elaborate on the reasons for Mr Moffat's departure, but suggestions were that the personal chemistry had not worked out. Sir John also told shareholders that 'the current year has started reasonably well for the company. Trading is up to our expectations'. Analysts are forecasting a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 154.1m to about Pounds 170m-Pounds 175m. Sir John said it was too early to make firm predictions but he was confident over prospects. After the meeting Sir John said the sharp increases in input costs following sterling's fall last autumn were now beginning to settle down. He said that the group had decided not to float its housebuilding business this year after all. The division was doing well and its earnings and cashflow were more important to the group than the funds which might be raised from a flotation, he added. Similarly, sales of parts of the furniture division might be delayed as the business was performing well. However, other asset disposals were progressing, he said. A number of shareholders thanked Sir Harry for his contribution to the group which he co-founded in 1975. He remains a non-executive director. Sir John said that Hillsdown had been through a period of difficult trading but nevertheless under Sir Harry's leadership profits had risen from Pounds 1m in 1980 to over Pounds 150m in 1992.</p>

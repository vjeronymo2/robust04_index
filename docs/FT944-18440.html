			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Battleground of bruised egos and shortening tempers - Neither the party leader nor the unions are in any mood to give way Years of retreat may have left Labour's union barons diminished figures with bruised egos, but they remain a force at the party conference and Mr Tony Blair cannot afford to ignore them. Mr Bill Morris and Mr John Edmonds, general secretaries of the TGWU and GMB general unions respectively, have already made clear this week in Blackpool that the unions are in no mood to sit quietly on the sidelines in the 'new' Labour party. They may no longer be able to hold up their block vote cards to show who has the muscle in making party policy. But they lost little time in pointing out that this year's rule allowing union delegates to decide how they should vote does not mean they can do as they like. As Mr Edmonds, a former moderniser, pointed out, his delegates are mandated to represent union policy and not their own opinions. This seems unlikely to change as long as the unions retain a collective voice at the party conference. They still account for 70 per cent of the total votes, and unless Labour's mass membership grows rapidly, they will maintain a dominant position. Three weeks ago Mr Blair warned in forthright style at a private TUC dinner that he would not bow to the power of the unions, restore their lost privileges or govern in their sectional interest. It is not the kind of language union leaders are used to hearing. Last year John Smith signed up to their policy agenda without a qualm. Mr Blair does not intend to do the same. He has accepted that there must be a commitment to the aspiration of full employment, to the introduction of a national minimum wage and to laws for extending employees' rights at work. However he dislikes being pinned down to the detail at this stage. Yet this is what Mr Morris and Mr Edmonds appear to want. The GMB leader is demanding a precise target for full employment while the TGWU general secretary insists on a national minimum wage set at half of the median level of male earnings. There was a threatening tone in their speeches to the conference yesterday. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, deputy general secretary of the public service union Unison, did not sound any less threatening. There is more than an air of unease about their views on Mr Blair. Should he be concerned about this? The Labour leader is not anti-union, but neither is he inclined to pander to the egos of union leaders. As an outspoken champion last year of the one-member-one-vote principle for choosing Labour parliamentary candidates, he has no time for union special interests. He has every reason to believe he is more in touch with rank-and-file workplace feelings than the union leaders. It is worth remembering that members of 23 of the 29 unions affiliated to the party voted to elect him leader in defiance of many union leaders. Mr Edmonds preferred Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former deputy leader of the party, but 56 per cent of his members voted for Mr Blair. The left-leaning TGWU union executive urged its members to support Mrs Beckett, but Mr Blair secured 44 per cent of their vote while only a third backed her. In Unison, 53.5 per cent voted for Mr Blair. 'Those amazing results raise the serious question of who the union leaders really believe they speak for,' reflected one official. However in the conference yesterday they still claimed to be speaking for what they called 'our people'. Union leaders believe they are not a liability in the 'new' Labour party, and that recent public sympathy for the striking signal workers showed how times have changed. Some argue that Mr Blair should not turn the unions' link with the party into a problem. One senior union official said: 'If you keep gnawing at the union link, it just reminds people that it exists. Blair should recognise it is a political reality and move on.' But most union leaders recognise they have no real alternative but to rally behind Mr Blair. Even the most intransigent recognise that only he can deliver a Labour victory at the next general election and possibly save them from oblivion.</p>

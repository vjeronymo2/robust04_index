It first deals with the situation in the school sector and  reads as follows:    Since early March, a latent crisis has been simmering at  Niamey University over the modalities for the payment of  1992-1993 scholarship arrears. In an effort to resolve that  crisis, a meeting took place on 3 March between Education  Ministry delegates and representatives of Niger students from  Niamey University and foreign faculties. The true facts must be  outlined. At that meeting, it was agreed that priority should  be given to the payment of 1992-93 scholarship arrears totaling  440 million CFA francs: 124 million CFA francs for Niamey  University and 316 million for students in foreign faculties.  An amount of 240 million was released and distributed on 3  March. Niamey University students received 80 million while  those in foreign universities received 160 million. Payment of  the remaining 200 million was scheduled for this week. On 10  March, 100 million was released and is available for  distribution.    Unexpectedly, Niamey students issued an ultimatum to the  government on 10 March at 0900 -- I repeat at 0900 -- demanding  the payment of arrears due for the first quarter of the 1993-94  academic year. They said payment should be made by 1400,  failure of which, quote, the students will mobilize in order to  come to grips definitively with the government of the Third  Republic, unquote. To press for their demand, they erected  barriers, as promised, across Kennedy Bridge -- near the former  police station -- and in front of the main gate of the  university campus. The gathering at the barrier blocked traffic  and prevented peaceful citizens from crossing the bridge.    This demonstration was not only illegal. It was obviously in  violation of the agreement reached with the students'  representatives, namely that priority should be given to the  payment of 1992-93 scholarship arrears. You will recall that  the 6 and 7 January strike that resulted in the closure of the  campus was prompted by the government's decision to primarily  pay the scholarships for the current academic year and to  gradually clear the arrears. Now, as you can see, the students  are calling for the opposite of what they wanted.    In the face of these disturbances, the law enforcement  agencies moved in to disperse the demonstrators, remove the  barricades, and to allow free flow of traffic across the bridge.  During the intervention, the students stoned the security men  and threw Molotov cocktails at them. In response, the security  men threw tear gas at the students. Unfortunately, during this  law enforcement operation, five persons were wounded, including  two security men and three students, one of whom died from his  wounds at Niamey Hospital this morning. The deceased is Harouna  Tahirou, a first-year student in the Department of Philosophy at  Niamey University. He was hit in the face by a teargas  splinter. The government deplores the incident and extends its  deepest condolences to the bereaved family, the university, and  partners in education.    Anxious to safeguard social peace and to ensure a smooth  academic year, the government appeals to all those involved in  the educational sector and to the entire population to remain  calm. It reiterates its willingness to give priority to  dialogue in the settlement of any social dispute.    Concerning the other report on a so-called coup d'etat, the  11 March edition of (AL-HAVAR) newspaper carried a story on an  abortive coup d'etat in Niger. The government informs the  national and international community that the story is baseless.  The Niger Army is a Republican Army, which is committed to the  institutions that the Niger people have freely established. The  government warns those who, through manipulation,  misinformation, and false rumors, are attempting to destabilize  the republican institutions, especially by undermining the  harmony of the Niger Armed Forces at a time when their mission  of defending territorial integrity and protecting lives and  property constitute the essential preoccupation of the  government of the Third Republic and its Army, to desist from  such practices. I thank you.</p>

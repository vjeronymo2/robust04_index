			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko commentary under the "Postscript: </F> Events and Commentaries" rubric: "Kazan Has `United' With  Moscow Once Again, This Time on the Basis of Two Constitutions  and the Treaty on the Demarcation of Areas of Responsibility and  Powers"]    [Text] It is three years since Tatarstan declared its  sovereignty. The whole period since then has been dominated by  a single fundamental question: "Is Tatarstan part of Russia or  not?" And all that time Kazan has issued one and the same  answer, albeit with variations: The question of leaving or  entering the Federation is not under discussion. Mintimer  Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan, has expended  considerable effort and time trying to explain to worried  Russians that this is a question not of the republic's flight  from the Russian Federation but of a change in its status and a  precise demarcation of spheres of responsibility and influence.  But within Russia.    Tatarstan's aspiration was somewhat hard to understand in  Russia. Distrust gave way to suspicion, which in turn led to a  desire to sort things out.... This slow-moving crisis in  relations between Kazan and Moscow with uncertain prospects in  the future forced the Russian Federation leadership to decide do  something. Then came the failure of the second all-Russia  referendum in Tatarstan and the elections to the Federal  Assembly. And the realization dawned that it would be easier  and more beneficial to negotiate with Kazan.    Now the treaty "On the Demarcation of Areas of  Responsibility  and the Mutual Delegation of Powers Between Organs of State  Power in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan"  has been signed. Of course, Kazan had to pay a price for the  signing of this treaty. For example, the renunciation of the  words "sovereign state" and "subject of international law."  This also affected taxes: It had to abandon its former desire  for a single-channel system and accept the general federal  scheme. The important thing for us is that questions of defense  remain in Russia's control.    When speaking about the treaty, Russian President Boris  Yeltsin stressed that it "enshrines the really existing unity of  the Russian state." And that is the main thing now. Tatarstan  President Mintimer Shaymiyev declared in his turn that the  treaty "affirms a new model of relations founded on the  principles of law and justice." And he echoed Boris Yeltsin's  words: "The treaty meets the urgent need to preserve integrity  and stability in the Russian Federation." I am bound to recall  the words of Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation minister for  national and regional policy: "The object of the treaty," he  said, "is not the special status of Tatarstan but the sphere of  legal regulation...." And he added: "Regional policy will be  developed on such principles as the equality of the components  of the Russian Federation and the unity of the economic area."  In other words, the minister was letting it be known that "the  process has begun." Who is next in line? In all probability it  will be Chechnya, where life in a state of legal chaos is  becoming increasingly intolerable both for Chechnya itself and  for Russia.</p>

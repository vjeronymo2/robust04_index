			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stella van Rijn: "Entire Curacao Island </F> Executive Council Resigns -- Dissatisfaction in Liberia-Peters'  Party Leads To Conflict"]    [Text] Curacao's entire Island Executive Council has  resigned. All the deputies tendered their resignation yesterday  [2 Jun] because they were in danger of losing majority support  in the Island Council. The biggest party, the PNP [National  People's Party] of former Prime Minister Liberia-Peters, will  now try to form a new coalition.    Formally Curacao's Island Executive Council fell over an  education issue. The deputee responsible for education wanted  to expand the size of classes to 36 pupils in order to save  money. However, there was considerable opposition to this  measure within the education system and the trade unions. Three  PNP members also threatened to vote against the proposal, which  would have ended the coalition's majority in the Island Council.  The deputees resigned before things reached this point.  However, the real problem is primarily a party political  affair. By voting against the measure, the three dissident PNP  members wanted to express their dissatisfaction. After its  defeat in the recent parliamentary elections, the PNP is in the  middle of large-scale party reorganization. The three Island  Council members would no longer be included on the PNP's list of  candidates in next year's elections for a new Island Council.  An attempt by the PNP leadership to talk with the dissidents  has failed. They are now keeping their seats in their own names.    At present the PNP has seven seats. It is looking to work  with its present coalition partner, the Democratic Party, and  with the MAN [New Antilles Movement] opposition party. Early  elections for the Island Council are legally impossible. The  next elections are scheduled for April.    The Antillean Prime Minister Pourier has reacted with  disappointment to the Island Executive Council's resignation.  He was afraid that it would hamper the negotiations with  Venezuela on the further existence of the refinery. "That is a  crucial point about which we must reach agreement before the end  of the month. The refinery is of national importance," Pourier  said. Economic Affairs Minister Mendes had a different view.  "The government does not have an outgoing status," he said.  "We will continue to exercise our duties until a new coalition  is formed."</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMO: WHAT'S ON THE LINE  </P> <P> Bellcore, the research laboratory in Livingston, N.J., owned jointly by the  Baby Bell phone companies, is experimenting with the "next generation" of voice  mail services.  </P> <P> The services being tested by 60 residential and business customers enable users  to answer calls to their home from anywhere while the caller is still on the  line, have their telephones ring at more than one location and let through only  selected callers while directing others to leave a message.  </P> <P> "We're learning how potential new services might be constructed and operated in  future telephone networks and whether customers will be able to use these  services easily and effectively," said project manager Maurice Lampell.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell is just starting its effort to sign up residential customers and  small businesses for new telephone answering and messaging services. And  California's second-largest local phone company, Thousand Oaks-based GTE  California, has postponed "indefinitely" its commercial tests, according to  spokesman Larry Cox.  </P> <P> But out in the hinterlands, Contel of California has offered voice mail  services for more than a year, though with modest results -- about 2%  penetration in four markets: its headquarters city of Victorville and the  resort areas of Big Bear, Mammoth Lakes and Stateline, Nev.  </P> <P> Contel offers two levels of service: Basic answering service at $4.95 a month  provides capacity to record 58 five-minute messages in a month; enhanced  service, at a monthly flat rate of $19.95, receives and sends messages,  automatically "stamping" each with the date and time, and enables customers to  route a single message to up to 10 local numbers. (With special arrangements,  Contel can compile message lists of up to 150 parties.)  </P> <P> Pacific Bell is using Octel Communications' voice-messaging equipment, produced  in Milpitas; Contel employs four machines from VMX Inc. in Dallas.  </P> <P> The entry of the so-called Baby Bells phone companies into the budding voice  mail market became possible only in March, 1988.  </P> <P> A federal court in Washington ruled that the local phone companies could use  their networks to carry voice mail and other electronic information services as  long as they met two conditions: They could not produce the information  services themselves and they had to treat all suppliers of information services  equally.  </P> <P> The court and the Federal Communications Commission required the companies to  modify their phone systems to assure that all outside vendors offering services  requiring use of the local networks pay the same prices for equal levels of  service.

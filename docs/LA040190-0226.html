			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS  </P> <P> Desert Bloom (HBO Sunday at 11 a.m.): In his overlooked 1986 film,  writer-director Eugene Corr does what you never thought possible: He makes you  feel nostalgic about being 13 in the 1950s. Corr deftly parallels a  coming-of-age story with the dawning of the nuclear era.  </P> <P> The setting is Las Vegas, the heroine is lovely Annabeth Gish and the cast  includes Jon Voight, Ellen Barkin, JoBeth Williams and Allen Garfield (as the  one man in the story who views the first above-ground A-bomb test with  appropriate alarm).  </P> <P> The Women (TNT Saturday at 11:30 p.m.): This 1939 classic, directed by George  Cukor and based on Clare Booth Luce's play, stars Norma Shearer as the perfect  suburban wife whose husband has nevertheless been snared by a hard-as-nails  Joan Crawford. There's not a man in sight in this delightful comedy, but its  array of stars includes Paulette Goddard and Rosalind Russell. Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

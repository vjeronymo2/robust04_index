			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Observer Manki Ponomarev "Opinion" article: "Did the </F> Brussels Session Justify Expectations?"]    [Text] More than a week has passed since the extraordinary  NATO Council session held at the level of the heads of state and  government of the countries of this military-political bloc  ended in Brussels. The stir in the mass media has abated, the  drumrolls and fanfares have died away, and the ink has dried on  the hurried commentaries hot on the heels of the event. The  time for in-depth analysis of the positions of the session  participants and the decisions adopted there is approaching. It  is already possible to try to give a more or less detailed reply  to the question: Did the NATO summit justify the expectations,  which had become widespread long before it began?    These expectations were associated, above all, with the  question of whether the North Atlantic alliance would manage to  find its place in a world where there is no longer room for  "cold war" and confrontation between the two systems. This was  how not only political observers but also the very statesmen of  the member countries defined the session's task. To chart the  correct course in a rapidly changing world and to specify the  bloc's political guidelines -- this was the chief purpose for  which the top-level meeting was convened.    This was the chief task. But by no means the only one. The  United States --and President Clinton spoke frankly of this --  sought to strengthen its political leadership within NATO and in  European affairs on a new basis while not tying itself down with  overly onerous military obligations. The West European members  of the alliance in turn set a dual goal -- to expand their own  role within the bloc's framework and at the same time to prevent  the weakening of Washington's military presence on the European  continent, which was becoming increasingly noticeable.    Central and East European countries, which were members of  the Warsaw Pact, and also some others -- Albania, Macedonia, and  Lithuania, for example -- took a special interest in the  Brussels session. They were pinning their expectations on the  fact that the NATO leadership had to decide the question of  their admission to membership of the North Atlantic alliance and  provide them with appropriate security guarantees.    Russia also expressed its position repeatedly. It was  resolutely opposed to expanding NATO to include East European  states. Not only because this would result in the bloc's  military infrastructure being moved up toward Russia's borders  -- which would require us to take serious and costly measures in  the defense sphere. The point is also that the admission of  some countries to the alliance would automatically mean the  nonadmission of others. This would lead to a new split in  Europe, form a deep ditch on the body of the continent -- much  further to the east than the "iron curtain" of the "cold war"  times -- and undermine the European security system, which is  still fragile and has not yet become finally established.    Did the Brussels session succeed in resolving these, at  times, mutually exclusive tasks? Probably the most laconic  answer to this question was found by a Greek newspaper, which  gave an article on the results of the NATO Council session the  headline: "Yes, But...."    Yes, Bill Clinton was without a doubt the dominant figure at  the Brussels summit. The dynamic U.S. President did a great  deal to restore and strengthen U.S. leadership of the bloc  allies. But experienced European politicians -- French, Dutch,  Belgian -- with the support of other partners in the EC and the  Western European Union, found their own countergambit. They  forced the session participants to devote great attention to the  Bosnian problem, which had not been on the agenda before, by  raising the question of making air strikes against Serbian  positions in the Sarajevo region. This additional item on the  agenda loomed large in the discussion and to a certain extent  put Washington in an ambiguous position. Whereas last summer  the Americans were insisting on such bombing raids in the  knowledge, however, that the Europeans would not countenance  this, they have now been forced to agree in principle to  punitive actions against the Serbs, but with an important  proviso -- only on a mandate from the United Nations, not NATO.    At the same time the United States secured the unanimous  approval of all the North Atlantic alliance members for its  initiative -- the "Partnership for Peace." Elaborated in  Washington, it is aimed at resolving several tasks at once.  Above all, gaining time and preventing the weakening of the  North Atlantic bloc as a tool of U.S. policy. In addition,  preventing the admission of East European countries to NATO by  offering them closer military-political cooperation instead -- a  kind of probationary period with no definite time limits.    True, far from everything is clear yet with regard to the  actual idea of the "Partnership for Peace" program and the ways  to implement it, including, let us say, for Russia, which is  also being offered a part in it. For a number of conditions are  stipulated for involvement in it -- such as, for example,  greater openness in military organizational development and in  the military budget, the establishment of civilian control over  the armed forces, participation in peacemaking actions  implemented under NATO auspices, and others. A careful study of  all this still has to be made. The NATO program is being  studied attentively at various levels, including, as far as I  know, in both the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and the  Russian Armed Forces General Staff.    At the same time the NATO Council's adoption of the  "Partnership for Peace" program came as a considerable shock to  the Central and East European states. Putting a brave face on a  sorry business, they welcomed this program with greater or  lesser enthusiasm and declared that they were ready to  participate in it. This was their official line. But at the  same time President Lech Walesa of Poland, for example, did not  even deem it necessary to hide his disappointment and rated both  the program and the fact of its adoption as blackmail and as  affording Moscow the right to "veto" decisions of the North  Atlantic alliance. This disappointment is primarily associated  with the fact that East European countries regarded entry to  NATO as recognition of their affiliation with (West) Europe and  as an opportunity to join the European Union [EU] and be  involved in economic integration in the EU.    That this really is so is evidenced by the fact that on the  eve of the session Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, and Bratislava were  not even able to give clear expression to which alliance they  would like to join -- NATO's military organization with  multinational troops on Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak  territories and with U.S. nuclear weapons, or a vague alliance  granting certain guarantees but demanding practically nothing in  exchange. Little consolation was provided by the claim made in  Brussels that if any East European country, not a NATO member,  is attacked in the future by some "expansionist" power, then the  bloc "will almost certainly intervene."    When assessing the results of the extraordinary NATO Council  session in Brussels as a whole, it has to be stated that,  despite all their importance, they did not entirely justify the  hopes pinned on it. The session's decisions were not crucial  for NATO. The search for its place and role in the  postconfrontational world is proceeding with all too much  difficulty and too slowly.    On the eve of the Brussels summit the Hamburg weekly DIE  ZEIT  cited the words of the famous English military leader, the Duke  of Wellington, the victor of Waterloo: "Nothing except a battle  lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won." This is what  has happened to NATO. Having achieved the aim proclaimed back  in 1949, it has exhausted itself in its old form. Now the North  Atlantic alliance is seeking a new purpose, a new raison d'etre.    Brussels showed once again -- yes, it really is seeking. But  it has not yet found it. Maybe it should not even search?</p>

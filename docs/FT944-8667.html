			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard tops expectations Hewlett-Packard's share price reached a 10-year high yesterday when the computer and electronics company reported even stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Earnings rose 60 per cent on a 23 per cent increase in revenues. H-P, the second-largest US computer company after IBM, is setting the pace in the market for 'client-server' networks of computers, and also dominates the rapidly-growing market for printers used with personal computers. Fourth-quarter sales and order growth was 'outstanding and well balanced across all geographies', said Mr Lew Platt, chairman, president and chief executive. Net earnings for the quarter, to end-October, were Dollars 476m or Dollars 1.83 a share, up from Dollars 298m or Dollars 1.18, in the same period last year. (Earlier this year H-P changed its earnings per-share calculations to include employee stock options, increasing the effective number of shares outstanding by about 6m to 260m.) Net revenue for the quarter was Dollars 7bn, an increase of 23 per cent over the same quarter last year. US sales were Dollars 3.3bn,up 20 per cent, while international sales rose 26 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn. H-P said new orders booked during the fourth quarter were valued at Dollars 6.9bn, an increase of 25 per cent over the same period last year. The order growth rate signals continuing strong performance in fiscal 1995. As a percentage of net revenue, cost of goods sold rose to 62.2 per cent from 61.4 per cent in last year's fourth quarter. However, the ratio of operating expenses to revenues declined to 26.8 per cent from 30.2 per cent. For the full year, H-P reported a 36 per cent increase in net earnings to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 1.2bn. Net earnings per share were Dollars 6.14, up from Dollars 4.65. Net revenues for the year rose 23 per cent to Dollars 25bn from Dollars 20.3bn. Mr Platt said H-P was starting 1995 in a strong competitive position, but that 'given our size, and the fact that our growth rates have exceeded those of many markets in which we compete, we're not assuming that our recent order-growth rates will continue'. In mid-session yesterday H-P shares were trading at Dollars 101 3/4 , but fell back to Dollars 100 by the close for a net gain on the day of Dollars 1 1/2.</p>

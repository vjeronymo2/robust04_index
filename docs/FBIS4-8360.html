			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oana Stanciulescu: "Russia Will Continue To </F> Deliver Arms to Romania"]    [Text] On the occasion of the visit that Russian General  Pavel Grachev paid to Bucharest, Romania and Russia agreed to  continue with the delivery of spare parts for the three types of  military technology in which we are still dependent on the  ex-Soviet industry, namely radar, air-to-air missiles, and air  force, government sources informed us. However, Russia was not  successful in its efforts to sell us artillery technology and  armored vehicles. As far as armored vehicles are concerned,  General Grachev was taken to witness a military drill of an  armored unit to shatter any illusions he nurtured in this area.    Nevertheless, Romania shows interest in purchasing air force  equipment. Romania is counting on the McConnel Amendment to the  draft federal budget of the United States for 1995, which  represents the legal basis for loans and military assistance  promised to our country by the United States when Romania joined  the Partnership for Peace.</p>

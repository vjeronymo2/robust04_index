			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: PLAN AHEAD TO HELP ENSURE YOU HAVE A HAPPY CAMPER  </P> <P> Very soon, the exodus begins. About 5 million U.S. children will pack their  little suitcases and head for summer camp.  </P> <P> Off they go to more than 8,500 day and residential camps to make new friends,  eat gooey marshmallows and gather anecdotes for next fall's school essays.  </P> <P> What can parents do before their offspring leave to be sure they are healthy as  well as happy campers?  </P> <P> First, check out the camp, says the American Academy of Pediatrics. Ideally,  every camp should have a staff nurse and a physician who is not only on call,  but also a regular visitor. All camp counselors should be trained in first aid.  </P> <P> "Be sure your children's immunizations are up-to-date before they leave" -- and  that includes tetanus shots, said Dr. Loraine Stern, a Los Angeles-area  pediatrician.  </P> <P> "Pack sunscreen and tell them how to use it. Put some insect repellent in their  suitcases, too. Stick to lotion or stick form. I don't trust kids with sprays,"  said Stern.  </P> <P> Parents should also be certain their children are psychologically ready for  camp. Most boys and girls are ready to go to day camp at age 6 or 7 and  residential camp at age 9 or 10, although experts say readiness varies from  child to child.  </P> <P> Children who enjoy class trips, invite friends to sleep over at their homes and  who respond positively to adult supervision seem to do best at summer camps.  </P> <P> Parents can build emotional readiness if it seems to be lacking. "Be supportive  and tell the child you are proud he or she is becoming independent," said Karol  Fishler, a clinical psychologist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. "Once the  child is at camp, send a post card or two. Think about sending one ahead of  time, so it will be there when the camper arrives."  </P> <P> "If children are age 8 or younger, pack a familiar object like a teddy bear,"  suggested Stern. "If they are embarrassed, they can always keep it hidden in  the suitcase." Family pictures, tucked into a suitcase, might also quell  feelings of homesickness, she said. Kids who are adamantly opposed to going to  camp probably are not ready for the experience, experts agree.  </P> <P> Summer camps should be viewed as more than a vacation. The best camp programs  help children gain a broader perspective of life, become less self-centered and  develop special skills such as art and mathematics, say psychologists.  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Letting up on house pressure Sir, Your editorial (Housing and inflation, April 16) suggests that lowering the value of housing would help to curb inflation. The only sound long-term way of reducing price pressure on housing is to increase supply, and that would naturally follow a full revival of the letting sector. Sadly, that can happen only when all political parties are in agreement, since too many fingers have been burnt for landlords to enter the letting market with confidence. In the meantime you can hold back house price inflation with high interest rates in the same way as a dam holds back water - the pent-up demand is still there, and will manifest itself when it is able to.

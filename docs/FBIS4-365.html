			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by T Mbengo] </F>   [Text] Cape Town April 7 SAPA -- Former Western Cape MK  [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  commander and ANC Regional Secretary Tony Yengeni on Thursday [7  April] night said he was communist and always would be one.    Addressing more than 1,000 ANC Western Cape Youth League  members he said the organisation had planned a weekend full of  events to mark the first anniversary of the assassination of SA  Communist Party [SACP] Secretary-General Chris Hani.    SACP Chairman Joe Slovo is to address rallies in Guguletu  and  Khaylitsha this weekend. There will be an ANC/SACP alliance  march from Guguletu to the Manenberg police station.    Mr Yengeni called on the Youth League members to pull up  their socks to explain to coloured people the position of the  ANC and spread the organisation's word on trains, to "reduce the  tensions between African and coloured people" in the peninsula.    "I am a communist and I have always been one. I will  struggle and also die for the interests of the workers in this  country as Chris did," Mr Yengeni said.    An MK leader representing the Western Cape region at ANC  headquarters in Johannesburg, James Makhaya, who lived with  Chris Hani said it was Hani who solved the 1982 MK mutiny in  Angola. He said: "Chris was like a messiah and Jesus to many  comrades in exile. He would solve any problem."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After a meeting that lasted all day long yesterday,  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso hosted an exclusive  press conference on the "Fantastico" program. The minister  clarified the main doubts about the new index, emphasizing that  financial investment and savings will remain unchanged:    [Begin Cardoso recording] We were careful to guarantee that  savings account owners and those who have invested their money  will have nothing to fear. Nothing at all has changed. This is  an old promise. We will not confiscate savings accounts, freeze  salaries, or freeze the funds of workers, housewives, or anybody  else. We will not do anything to disturb the Brazilian people's  routine lives. [end recording]    Interest rates:    [Begin Cardoso recording] The trend of the program is to  make  interest rates drop, as the program has been designed to deflate  the economy and produce a currency with real value. Interest  rates will then stand at a normal level. From the beginning of  this process nominal interest rates will drop. [end recording]    New contracts:    [Begin Cardoso recording] New contracts will be based  entirely in URV's [real value units]. Yet this will not be  enforced immediately, in order to let people become accustomed  to it over a period of 15 days, so as to learn how it operates.  After this period the standard will be the URV -- that is, a  fixed, stable standard. This will remain valid for one year.  Contracts may not have adjustment clauses.    As for old contracts, it will depend on what the contracting  sides want. There will be time to agree to new terms. [end  recording]    Installments paid by home buyers:    [Begin Cardoso recording] They will remain unchanged until  further notice. There is no reason for any concern about it.  Installments will be paid in real cruzeiros, based on the old  rules. [end recording]    Health plans:    [Begin Cardoso recording] We expect that terms will be  renegotiated. It will be more advantageous, because contracts  can be for one year, as I said here, in URV's. It will be more  practical, and if there is any problem we will solve it. [end  recording]    Credit cards:    [Begin Cardoso recording] There will be no modifications.  Everything will remain unchanged. [end recording]    Purchases on credit:    [Begin Cardoso recording] There will be no devaluation scale  whatsoever. New contracts on credit will be specified in URV's.  We will respect the terms of old contracts. [end recording]    Postdated checks:    [Begin Cardoso recording] They will be honored. Now, as we  reach the time for implementation of the URV, we will give the  rules. In any event, postdated checks will be honored. [end  recording]    Minimum salary:    [Begin Cardoso recording] The previous law set the minimum  salary at 55,500 cruzeiros, as I have just said. Well, if a  person collects a minimum salary on the fifth working day of the  following month, the URV conversion will make him collect 62,800  cruzeiros. If a retired worker were to collect 55,537 cruzeiros,  which is the minimum salary under the old law, under the terms  of the new law he will collect 70,600 cruzeiros.    The important thing is this comparison in cruzeiros, right?  The URV, as we said, is approximately equivalent to one dollar.  One dollar, one URV, right? Therefore, in dollars, if the URV  is compared to the dollar, the result will be of approximately  $64. But this amount, the day it is collected, in cruzeiros,  will be much more valuable than on the first day of the month.  This is the difference, and this is the real gain for workers.  [end recording]    Past losses:    [Begin Cardoso recording] I don't know what past losses are  all about. Things will depend on the calculation method. From  now on, negotiations will be free.    The government did not order any constraint; it is not  forbidding negotiations with unions, with employers. Therefore,  if there is any loss that was not caused by this law,  negotiations will continue the way they were being implemented,  and compensations will be agreed upon on the collective  agreement renewal date. Yet this will the last time, because  from then on there will be no losses, because of what I said --  that if prices go up, salaries will also immediately go up,  because of the three indexes that I mentioned here.  Consequently, I do not know whether there will be actually any  losses.    For example, in the case of public workers, in order to  avoid  additional complications we granted a bond for February, which  was included in the basis for calculation of their salaries.    Therefore, if the inflation rate were 40 percent in March,  public servants will not lose anything, not even in March.    In April, when public servant salaries would not be  adjusted,  they will be adjusted for inflation, by whatever rate, 40, 35,  or 30 percent, whatever the rate.... This law is actually much  better.

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / EC takes 'significant step' to save steel industry INDUSTRY MINISTERS for the European Community yesterday agreed on a broad strategy to support Europe's ailing steelmakers, but divisions emerged over which countries should bear the brunt of deep cuts in capacity. Ministers and the European Commission said it was now up to EC steelmakers to put forward concrete proposals for wide-ranging capacity cuts by the end of September. Except in special cases, closures - which could cost EC producers 50,000-100,000 jobs - will have to be carried out by the end of 1994. The Commission believes 30m tonnes must be cut in crude steel, and 20m tonnes in rolled products. The Commission is expected to submit formal proposals to ministers at their meeting in May, but Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, welcomed yesterday's agreement as 'a very significant step' towards the salvation of the EC industry. French and British ministers leapt to the defence of their own industries. They suggested the main burden of capacity cuts would be borne by Italian, Spanish and east German industries, which they said had yet to carry out necessary restructuring programmes. In return, Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the Italian industry minister, said Rome would not be prepared to approve an EC-wide plan, unless the Commission and member states backed his government's proposals for a L650bn (Pounds 296.5m) recapitalisation of state-owned steel producer, Ilva. Mr Claudio Aranzadi of Spain said his country was committed to its controversial plan to subsidise steelmaking in the volatile Basque country in return for capacity cuts elsewhere. The Commission has indicated that the balance between aid and cuts in Spain will have to be altered. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, distanced himself from German industry predictions that up to 40,000 jobs would be lost in the domestic industry, and said it was up to steelmakers themselves to decide where cuts should be made. But he admitted the German government might soon be faced with difficult decisions about the future of its lossmaking east German producer, Ekostahl. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said if steelmakers approached national governments for extra subsidies, they could trigger a futile race to subsidise national industries. Ministers were firm on the need for protection from cheap non-EC imports, although they stepped back from the Commission's suggestion that it should negotiate three-year tariff or volume restrictions on imports from eastern and central Europe.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (1): A pervasive influence  -Industry and the consumer both have an interest in the development of internationally recognised standards. In this special survey, which coincides with the 24th annual International Standards Day, Charles Batchelor reports on progress STANDARDS, and the international agreements that underpin them, have a pervasive influence on our daily lives. They help determine the shape and size of our credit cards, the symbols on the dashboard of our cars, the speed codes for the films in our cameras and the paper sizes we use at the office. No less important for the industrial or commercial user is the international system for grading screw threads, the agreement on a standardised size for freight containers and a common format for the numeric representation of dates and times. The absence of an international, or even a European, standard for electric plugs and sockets, is one of the most obvious failures of the standards industry. A study has finally begun into finding at least a Europe-wide answer to a cause of constant annoyance for the international traveller, and of cost to manufacturers. Yet, in spite of its powerful impact on our lives and the economies of nations, the standards world remains a curiously low key one. The reason is not far to seek. Creating standards is the humdrum task of armies of committees around the world. Much of their time is spent debating almost imperceptible tolerances of machinery and systems of little interest to the non-specialist. The picture is made no clearer by the range of overlapping national, European and international bodies involved and the pea-soup of acronyms used to label the organisations and the standards they produce. In Britain, for example, the British Standards Institution, co-ordinates the writing of new standards. At the European level most standards are set by CEN, the European Commission for Standardisation, although electrical products and telecommunications have their own organisations. International standards, in turn, are set by the Geneva-based International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). Once again, however, electrical products are the responsibility of another body, the International Electrotechnical Commission. These overlapping organisations result in the same standard appearing in many different guises. BS5750, a British quality assurance standard, has been adopted internationally as ISO9000 and in continental Europe as EN29000. Despite the barriers thrown up by the bureaucratic nature of much standards work, there are signs that neglect is making way for a period of closer public interest. This interest is fuelled by a number of important factors: The growing importance of regional trading blocks which require harmonised standards if industry is to benefit fully from the removal of internal barriers. The formal launch of the single European market last January gave an added impetus to the move towards harmonised European standards which had been under way since the early 1980s. The creation of the North American Free Trade Area has similarly given additional urgency to the search for harmonised standards and is prompting closer working between Canadian, Mexican and US organisations. The ultimate aim of industry and the standards writers is to create international standards. Pressure from third world countries, no less than from the industrialised world, is for standards which will get their products into all the world's markets. But the range of conflicting interests - manufacturers, consumers, regulators - which have to be reconciled to create truly international standards mean that national standards may initially be replaced by regional standards. A growing awareness of the economic advantage which can be won by ensuring that your national standard forms the basis for an international standard. Britain, France and Germany each head about one third of the ISO committees set up to establish new international standards, a position which allows a considerable influence on the shape of the ultimate standard. The Canadian Standards Association felt it had achieved a sizeable benefit when it was allocated the secretariat of a new ISO committee to write environmental standards. A move to the writing of what are sometimes known as horizontal standards, covering such areas as quality assurance and environmental management. ISO9000, the first such standard, has provoked much controversy. Some parts of US industry fear that ISO9000 will be used to buttress fortress Europe, while countries such as Germany, where more reliance is placed on product testing, are suspicious of the value of monitoring procedures. Horizontal or systems standards, applicable across broad swathes of industry, are more wide-ranging in their impact than standards applicable to a single product or industry. The most significant impetus for harmonised standards has come from Europe in recent years, largely due to the fact that the fragmented European market place has had most to benefit. The US and Japan, with their larger, homogenous home markets had less need to join the move to greater harmonisation. But if Europe continues to dominate the creation of international standards through ISO, the US and Japan could start to come under pressure. ISO9000 is starting to make inroads into the US market, complementing and even possibly usurping manufacturers' quality assurance standards. With more than 400 industry-based standards bodies resulting in a highly fragmented sector, the US is at a disadvantage in international standards making. Not that Europe's move to greater harmonisation is without its problems. The harmonised product directives which began emerging from the European Commission in the late 1980s have prompted a veritable frenzy of standards making. The directive covering personal protective equipment - head, eye and foot protectors and the like - is expected to require 200 harmonised standards, the construction products directive no fewer than 2,000 new standards. The so-called new approach directives give greater flexibility than their predecessors, which laid down detailed technical requirements. But they do require a welter of standards-making to back them up. Some of those involved fear that the scale of the work involved is leading to a decline in the quality of the standards which are being written. 'Standards are being rushed through. They are poorly drafted and open to misinterpretation,' commented one participant in the standards-writing process. Nor is industry entirely happy with every aspect of the new directives and their supporting standards. The certification and testing bodies in the different countries - the public and private organisations and laboratories which confirm that a particular standard has been met - frequently differ in their interpretation of a standard. To overcome this problem the European Organisation for Testing and Certification was set up in January 1993. The EOTC has already established groups in the fields of electrical products, information technology and water supply to ensure that testing laboratories and certification bodies recognise each others' work and more than a dozen other groups are being established. Even so, companies with an established product range and a good safety record frequently find the new directives unduly complex, bureaucratic and costly to conform to, according to Mr Mo Masri of SGS, a large testing and certification company. Introducing standards into a new area, or modifying the existing standards framework, can have a powerful knock-on effect on industry. Manufacturers may be forced to modify their product ranges, cutting out marginal items which do not justify the cost of testing or certification, and designing new products to meet the standards. The European Toy Directive put a lot of toy manufacturers out of business. The standards industry also faces a considerable shake-up. There are an estimated 10,000 independent testing laboratories in Europe as well as a large number of certification organisations. The new EC directives are creating more work in the short term but if the EOTC is successful in promoting mutual recognition of test certificates then closures and mergers are likely. The pressure for standards, national, regional and international is inexorable. The benefits to the consumer, industry and trade are indisputable. But there is equally no doubt that the standards revolution will claim its casualties. Standards have become another risk which companies must learn to manage.</p>

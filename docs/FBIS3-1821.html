At the Spring Festival party and inaugural ceremony for the  43d Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform  Association last night, Zhu Yucheng said: On the airport issue,  the Chinese side has always acted in accordance with the  Memorandum of Understanding on the Airport, but it was only  after a very long delay that the British side put forward the  fourth proposal. There is still the big question of a more than  HK$20 billion [Hong Kong dollars] debt in this financial  proposal.    He said: By making the Airport Authority into a company, the  British Hong Kong Government wants to shift the debt onto that  company. The Chinese side has pointed out that, like the Mass  Transit Railway Corporation, the Airport Corporation is a  company which is fully funded by the Hong Kong Government, and  the debt will ultimately be shouldered by the government of the  future special administrative region. Therefore, the Chinese  side maintains that, regarding the airport issue, there must be  a supervisory organization, that the airport authorities cannot  be allowed to spend money indiscriminately, and that the  supervisory organization must reflect the will of the Hong Kong  people. In response to a reporter's question as to whether the  Airport Consultative Committee could play a supervisory role,  Zhu Yucheng said: It depends on whether its composition  represents the will of the Hong Kong people, and this must be  considered in light of the situation at the time. The  composition of the Airport Consultative Committee itself has yet  to be studied. He said that the new airport has four essential  elements, the airport runway, airport support facilities,  airport control system, and airport traffic system. He said  that the British Hong Kong Government's practice of offering  these services as separate contracts, as opposed to approving  them as an integral whole, is not conducive to the management of  the airport. He pointed out that the Chinese side does not want  the various elements of airport management to be separated,  because an airport is different from other types of businesses.  He said that all one can do is wait and see how the Hong Kong  Government divides up the new airport.    Zhu Yucheng said: The Hong Kong people should pay special  attention to these areas. The goals of the British before their  withdrawal are very clear: Economically, they want to reap the  maximum benefit. Politically, they are preparing their own  people in an attempt to force the government of the special  administrative region to accept the exercise of British rule  without their presence. He said: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  discussed these problems very clearly before. The problems he  mentioned have now occurred one after another. The current  problems between China and Britain are something that the  Chinese side does not wish to see." He hoped that the Hong Kong  people will stop dreaming and said that they can no longer  expect a colonial official to leave anything good for the Hong  Kong people. He said that the British officials will only grab  the maximum benefits for the British side and cited a proverb,  saying that it is easier to move mountains and change the course  of rivers than for one to change one's character. Zhu Yucheng  added: The Chinese side has already made it very clear that, on  the airport issue, the British Hong Kong Government has to  conform to the Memorandum of Understanding by leaving HK$25  billion to the government of the special administrative region  and by borrowing no more than HK$5 billion. He said: The  question should have been settled, but the British Hong Kong  Government is playing a game of figures by putting forward this  and that proposal and intends to pass the debt on to the  government of the future special administrative region after all.    In response to a reporter's question as to whether the  airport issue is being affected by the Sino-British dispute and  by the deterioration of relations, Zhu Yucheng said: In the  past, the Chinese side always hoped that politics and economics  would be separated. But it appears that the road the British  Hong Kong authorities are taking has completely blocked the road  of Sino- British cooperation. Therefore, it will be very  difficult for China and Britain to travel on the road of  cooperation again in the next three years or more. Since the  first day of his arrival in Hong Kong, Chris Patten has chosen  the path of Sino-British confrontation, and now it seems that he  will continue this confrontation to the very end. This will  surely have an impact on cooperation in all areas of the Hong  Kong economy. He said that there is a Memorandum of  Understanding for the airport and that it is now up to the  British side to abide by it. Zhu Yucheng said: In the past, we  had the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the  agreements reached between the foreign ministers of the two  countries before, but the British side has ruined these three  foundations of cooperation. Now let us see whether the British  side will abide by the Memorandum of Understanding.    In addition, regarding the White Paper published  unilaterally  by the British side, Zhu Yucheng said that the British side has  unilaterally violated the principle of confidentiality. He  said: "Last time, I said that the British side did some editing  and merging, and you editors should be aware of this. They  themselves have also admitted that they have not released the  whole story; that is to say, they took those elements that they  needed, but did not reveal the entire real substance of our  talks."    Zhu Yucheng said: The Chinese side set forth a five-point  foundation at the beginning of the talks, which Deputy Director  Zhang Junsheng has also discussed publicly. The Chinese side  had discussed these issues, but the British side did not keep  its promise. He said: "As a government, it has to be  responsible. It must not be irresponsible in the remarks it  makes. It is not good if one says one thing today and then says  another tomorrow. A government must be responsible, must admit  when it has said or done something, and must be honest. We say  we all speak the truth and we must not act like they do." Zhu  Yucheng added that whatever the Chinese side says is true, and  the Chinese will make a response very soon. He urged the  reporters to be patient and said that a comprehensive reply  would be given very soon.</p>

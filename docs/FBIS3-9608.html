			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A convoy of the U.S. humanitarian organization (CRS)  was stopped today along one of the recently opened blue roads  from Visoko to Sarajevo at a control point of the Serbian  aggressor's side near Ilijas. The reason the convoy was  stopped, according to the announcement by the Information  Ministry, was the demand by the Serbian side to be given 30  percent of the goods from the convoy as a toll for passing  through the territory under its control.    Such a gesture by the Serbian side at a time when the  international community is exerting new efforts to find a  peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina not only shows that  these efforts are being ignored but that the aggressor has no  intention of renouncing its blackmailing methods. By making it  impossible for a convoy to pass through, one threatens the  freedom and rights established by the agreement on opening blue  corridors and thereby the basic principles of international  humanitarian rights, it is said, among other things, in the  information issued by the Information Ministry of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan will send a group of  experts on wildlife protection to the Galapagos Islands,  Ecuador, from Friday to June 27 to help survey damage caused by  a forest fire, the Foreign Ministry said Monday [30 May].    The government will send six experts through the Japan  International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in response to a  request from the Government of Ecuador, the ministry said.    The group, comprised of experts on birds, reptiles and  botanical ecology, will visit Isabela Island, the largest of the  Galapagos group, to survey the effects on wildlife of the  prolonged forest fire that has been burning since April 12, it  said.    The experts will also offer advice to Ecuador's presidential  panel for disaster prevention on measures to protect and  increase reproduction of wildlife, to repair damage, and on  monitoring the natural environment, the ministry said.    The forest fire on the 460,000-hectare Isabela Island has  not  yet been completely extinguished. As of April 26, some 10,000  hectares had been devastated by the fire, it said.    Wildlife peculiar to the Galapagos Islands, such as iguanas  and giant tortoises, is endangered by the fire. The island's  ecosystem is also seriously affected, the ministry said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] I have come to give myself up to the law. That, in  essence, was what former President Andre Kolingba said after  holding discussions with President Ange Felix Patasse at the  Palais de la Renaissance in the presence of Ngoupande, secretary  general of the Central African Democratic Rally [RDC], whose  founding chairman is Kolingba. Also present at the audience  granted by President Patasse were Prime Minister Jean-Louis  Mandaba, Defense Minister Jean Mete-Yapende, Interior Minister  Jean-Claude Dobanga, Justice Minister Jacques Mbosso, and some  advisers at the Presidency of the Republic.    The discussions centered on the insecurity that prevailed  before and after the time the Central African people chose to  live in peace (?and to enjoy) the democracy for which many  compatriots lost their lives. In this regard, the former head  of state gave the following explanations:    [Begin Kolingba recording] I came to meet President Patasse  and to give myself up to the law. That is what I told him. But  then, why did I say that? I said that because people are seeing  or feeling threats of coups d'etat because [words indistinct]  indiscriminate distribution of war weapons. In fact that is  understandable but since only the RDC and its supporters are  harassed, I believe that I am the one targeted, and this is why  I came to see the head of state to give myself up. However,  President Patasse (?fraternally) and politely rejected this idea.    I believe I did the impossible and I withstood the  impossible  [word indistinct] to establish the multiparty system in this  country [word indistinct] without bloodshed but today, we note  -- and this is my opinion -- some flagrant abuses that are  dangerous for our young democracy. This is happening without  any reaction at all from those very people who claim to be  advocates of human rights [words indistinct] and today we are  hiding behind the most striking mutism. I would like to take  the people to witness and say that if there are bloody  disturbances in the country I, as of today, reject every  responsibility for them. [Words indistinct] I did it for 12  years to bring peace to the country.    That in brief, is what we discussed. We also reviewed many  other domestic issues. We understood each other perfectly, and  I think that President Patasse will find solutions and responses  to the problems within a relatively short time. [Words  indistinct] I thank you. [end recording]    Shortly after the discussions with his predecessor,  President  Patasse accompanied by Prime Minister Mandaba and his cabinet  members inspected a war arsenal seized from groups of  unidentified armed men carrying out military operations in the  eastern part of our country. President Patasse called on the  Africa No. 1 radio delegation currently visiting Bangui to also  inspect the arsenal and to inform the international opinion  about his good faith.    President Patasse stated, quote, I have learned that  President Patasse harbors troops opposed to governments of some  sister countries on his national territory. Here is proof that  the allegations are false and that President Patasse can never  allow armed groups (?to operate) on Central African Republic  territory, unquote. At the end of the inspection, Colonel  Wanfiou, chief of Army staff spoke to our reporter, Fidinguere  Yedi:    [Begin recording] [Wanfiou] On 22 February everybody learned  on the radio about an incursion of foreign troops into our  country, mainly in the east. I immediately dispatched troops  from Bangui to the region, while our detachment which was at  [name indistinct] was [words indistinct]. After 48 hours of  fighting, we succeeded in driving the adversaries away. In  fact, they were [word indistinct] Sudanese rebels who  infiltrated our national territory. We halted [words indistinct]  and we seized a sizable consignment of weapons and ammunition.  Now, calm has returned to the area [words indistinct] and I  have already brought back the (?elements). If you have more  questions, I am ready to answer them.    [Yedi] Col. Wanfiou, are you still at the scene of the  fighting?    [Wanfiou] Yes, actually we are still at the scene. [end  recording]</p>

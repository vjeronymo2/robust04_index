			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / FT Latin American Capital Markets: Markets face rash of new issues from Latin America INTERNATIONAL financial markets will face severe difficulties absorbing prospective new issues of debt and equity planned by Latin American entities, a Financial Times conference was told yesterday. Mr Stephen Dizard, head of trading in Salomon Brothers' emerging markets department in New York, estimated that Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.2bn) of new bond issues were being lined up for issuance over the next 12 months, with about Dollars 4bn due to come to market in the 10 business weeks before the end of the year. He doubted such a volume could be accommodated in this time, which would then push this year's new issue calendar into 1993. He also said the desire by some issuers, including banks, to bring riskier new structures to the market was likely to be disappointed in the short term. Such structures included attempts to bring convertible bond issues to market and subordinated debt to boost capital. He said the market in Latin American bonds was undergoing a transition, under which big institutional investors could play a more important part. So far the market has been dominated by speculators and individual buyers. The conference on Latin American Capital Markets was overshadowed by the recent instability in financial markets in the industrialised world. This was viewed as discouraging investors from looking into the supposedly riskier emerging markets in Latin America and elsewhere. Several speakers said the unreliability of international capital markets underlined the importance of developing domestic capital markets in the region and the need for pension fund reform, which would help achieve this end. Ms Jane Moncreiff, head of emerging markets for J P Morgan in London, noted that most new Latin American issues in the international equity market were trading below their issue price as a result of market falls. The Argentine stock market has fallen 52 per cent from its highs earlier in the year and the market in Brazil is down 30 per cent. She and other speakers said that, in view of the tendency for issuers of equity and debt to attempt to raise money at the same time, Latin American governments should consider introducing a queuing system for would-be issuers. Mr Lincoln Rathnam, managing director of the fund managers Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, said he believed that Latin debt markets constituted a 'far surer play' than the Latin equity markets as the outlook for equity investment in Latin America was so uncertain.</p>

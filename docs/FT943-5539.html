			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Gatt chief warns on accord delay: Uruguay Round ratified so far by only 26 of 125 signatories Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday launched a strong appeal to the leading trading powers to ratify the Uruguay Round global trade accords without delay. The accords, including the establishment of a World Trade Organisation, are due to take effect on January 1 next year. Addressing a business audience in Italy, he said the biggest trade-liberalising package in history - worth Dollars 755bn (Pounds 487bn) a year in extra merchandise trade - was 'little more than an uncashed cheque' until ratified and implemented. 'Any delay in the entry into force of the WTO and the agreements it encompasses will cost real people everywhere real money,' he said. Only 26 of the 125 countries taking part have so far ratified or otherwise approved the Uruguay Round agreements signed in Marrakesh in April. Most are waiting for ratification by the three biggest traders - the US, the European Union and Japan - whose participation is essential. While Mr Sutherland expressed concern over procedural delays in the EU and Japan, he is most alarmed at the confused situation in the US. The Clinton administration is still wrangling with Congress over details of the implementing legislation and there is a strong current of congressional opposition to ratification this year. The Gatt chief said the window of opportunity, from the time Congress resumes on September 12 to early October when it adjourns ahead of mid-term elections, was a narrow one. 'If it is missed, the risks of a long delay are serious.' In addition to intensifying personal contacts with key participants, Mr Sutherland plans a multilateral review on implementation which would enable the September 22 meeting of the WTO preparatory committee to identify recalcitrants.</p>

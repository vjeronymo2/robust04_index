			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Outhwaite gives expert evidence in Gooda case Mr Richard Outhwaite, the Lloyd's underwriter, agreed in the High Court yesterday that he could not vouch for the competence of underwriters on three Gooda Walker syndicates. Mr Outhwaite was giving evidence as an expert witness for the Gooda Walker agency which is being sued for negligence by 3,095 Lloyd's Names. He agreed that, when he submitted reports to the court before the hearing began, he had considered that Mr Anthony Willard, an underwriter on syndicate 299, and Mr Stanley Andrews, an underwriter for syndicate 298, had acted reasonably competently. His one reservation had been the scale of liabilities to which Mr Andrews had allowed syndicate 298 to be exposed. These, he had said in his report, were 'in excess of what I believe to be reasonable'. However, under cross-examination by Mr Geoffrey Vos, QC for the Names, he later agreed that he could not form a view of Mr Andrews' competence. Questioned on his present view of Mr Willard's competence as an underwriter, Mr Outhwaite replied: 'I am not expressing any opinion on that particular topic.' He was also unable to express any view about the competence of Mr Derek Walker, the former Gooda Walker managing agency chairman and underwriter on syndicate 290, he told the court. Mr Outhwaite was later asked whether it should be a basic principle of sound underwriting practice that a balance should be kept between the income from premiums and the risks to which syndicates were exposed. He agreed that a syndicate should not be placed at risk of collapsing in the event of a single substantial claim. However, he insisted that the concept of 'balance' was almost meaningless in the context of high-risk syndicates.</p>

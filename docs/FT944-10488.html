			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Observer: Gegarbaged The French may be building barricades to preserve their language from Anglo-Saxon barbarisms - but what about the Germans? The language of Goethe, Schiller and Boris Becker is in danger of being eroded by influences from beyond Europe's mainland. Gefounded and gementioned - as in 'our company was gefounded' (founded) or 'will we be gementioned?' (mentioned) - are two newcomers assaulting sensitive German ears. Gemanaged is an old one, as are gehandikapt and gekidnappt. Any suggestions for others? Gebreakfasted, getroubled and gesacked immediately spring to mind.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sirdar ahead in spite of yarns' losses Sirdar, the textile group, lifted interim pre-tax profits in spite of operating losses of Pounds 541,000 in its hand-knitting and machine yarns division. Profits for the six months to end December were Pounds 2.81m, up from a previous Pounds 2.67m. Total turnover edged ahead from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 27.6m. The losses on yarns were incurred on turnover down from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 10.1m and compares with previous profits of Pounds 86,000. Mr Gerry Lumb, chairman and managing director, said the company was responding to a lack of volume in the hand-knitting market by switching its emphasis to machine yarns. Other textile products improved operating profits from Pounds 2.81m to Pounds 3.37m. This division, comprising Eversure ready-made curtains and Burmatex floor coverings, had achieved good results in difficult markets, said Mr Lumb. The group's share of profits from its 50 per cent stake in Acropolis Hotels fell from Pounds 158,000 to Pounds 128,000. Interest payable fell from Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 156,000, and the tax charge eased to Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 1m). Earnings per share were ahead at 3.41p (3.12p), while the interim dividend is increased from 1.65p to 1.72p.</p>

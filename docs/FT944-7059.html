			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Labour attacks 'covert' links Labour yesterday accused the government of 'covertly encouraging' business links between Britain and Iraq in violation of United Nations sanctions. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'We know that a number of British businesses have encouraged Iraqi industrialists to talk about contracts. All this seems to be an abuse of UN mandatory economic sanctions against Iraq.' Mr Cunningham was responding to a report in yesterday's Financial Times that British companies were preparing - with the approval of the Department of Trade and Industry - to resume trade with President Saddam Hussein's regime when sanctions are lifted. The DTI has issued licences to the British organisers of two trade fairs in Baghdad due to start tomorrow. The DTI said last night that it had issued the licences to allow the companies to talk to the Iraqis about humanitarian aid. The department added: 'We consider this falls within the boundaries set by the UN sanctions regime.' Other government departments yesterday distanced themselves from moves to build stronger trade links with Iraq. The Foreign Office said that Mr Stephen Crouch, the director-general of Iraqi British Interests Group, a commercial lobby association, did not represent the government's position. Mr Crouch was in Jordan on September 3 with Mr Henry Bellingham, the parliamentary private secretary to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. Mr Michael Colvin, chairman of the Conservative foreign affairs committee, said yesterday that he had met Mr Crouch 'two or three times' and that he had given informal advice to him relating to UN sanctions. He said: 'What I have been saying to Crouch is build up contacts with businesses in Iraq if you want, so when sanctions are lifted you are in a position to go.' Reports of these growing business links drew an angry response from the Iraqi opposition last night. Mr Hoshya Zebari, an executive council member of the Iraqi National Congress, the main opposition grouping, said: 'Trade delegations by British and other European businessmen are very detrimental to the cause of the majority of the Iraqi people. This kind of business-as-usual attitude has encouraged Saddam to go to war in the past.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At an ordinary prefectural assembly session on the  morning of 4 March, Shinsuke Tomoyose (a member of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan) posed questions concerning a U.S.  base issue, a law on special measures for promoting diversion of  military-occupied land, measures to close the gap between the  pension system on Okinawa and that on the Japanese mainland, and  the promotion of administrative measures for peace. With regard  to the base issue, Tomoyose said he had obtained a report on the  environmental impact assessment at U.S. Forces facilities on  Okinawa, which was prepared by the U.S. Marine Corps [USMC] in  accordance with a U.S. law. He proposed that "the prefectural  government should demand disclosure of the results of such an  assessment at U.S. Forces facilities on Okinawa."    As an example of the destruction of nature by U.S. Forces,  he  cited U.S. live-shelling exercises across a prefectural highway,  saying: "It is necessary to take up such matters as  environmental problems." He pointed out that the USMC conducts  environmental impact assessments at U.S. Forces facilities in  accordance with a U.S. "national environmental policy law." He  stressed that the prefectural government should demand that the  U.S. Forces conduct an environmental impact assessment at major  U.S. Forces facilities -- such as Kadena Air Base, Futenma Air  Station, the live-shelling training area in Camp Hansen, and the  Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, where parachute training is  conducted -- and disclose the results of the assessment.    The report obtained by Tomoyose contains the results of the  environmental impact assessment made by the USMC in 1987 on a  project to construct a landing pad for Harrier jump jets in the  northern training area. It notes that the assessment was made  by the USMC Headquarters on Okinawa in accordance with the  "national environmental policy law."    Also, in connection with efforts to enact a law on special  measures to promote diversion of military-occupied land,  Tomoyose said: "It should be stipulated in the law that the  U.S. forces and the Japanese Government are responsible for  environmental protective measures, including antipollution  measures on U.S. bases."</p>

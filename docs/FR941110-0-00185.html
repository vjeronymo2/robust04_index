			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One provider organization recommended revising the notice of penalty section to specify that the State sends the notice via certified mail in all cases except State operated facilities and other facilities when HCFA is imposing the penalty based on a validation survey. This comment also listed specifics to be included in the notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter recommended that the notification requirements HCFA uses when it imposes the civil money penalty must also be the minimal standards applied to the State, instead of allowing the State's notice to be prepared in accordance with State's procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are not accepting the suggestion that the notice be sent via certified mail because this would preclude sending a valid notice via other means, such as telefax, telegram, commercial overnight delivery services, or other means that may be faster. In fact, for these reasons we are revising this section of the rule to eliminate the requirement that the notice be sent by mail with a return receipt requested. Also, to have the State send the penalty notice to Medicare participating facilities and to dually participating facilities, as the commenter suggests, would be inappropriate as HCFA provides notices for Medicare facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We accept the comment to require that the contents included in the HCFA notice of penalty be contained in the State notice of penalty. Accordingly, as stated in a previous response, we are revising redesignated &sect;488.434 to provide that the State must notify the facility in accordance with State procedures for all non-State operated NFs when the State takes the action; however, the State's notice must be written and must include, at a minimum, the information specified in redesignated &sect;488.434(a). This revision is consistent with existing policy in prescribing the content of State notices in Medicaid provider termination cases and other Medicaid and AFDC matters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.436&blank;Waiver of Hearing; Reduction of Penalty Amount <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received many comments opposing the facility's opportunity to have a 35 percent reduction in the civil money penalty if the facility waived its right to a hearing. Commenters said that this provision is inappropriate in the regulatory process, not reflective of Congressional intent, insulting, tantamount to blackmail and plea bargaining and without statutory basis for offering a bonus to providers who waive their appeal rights. Some commenters objected to the 35 percent reduction if a facility waives its right to a hearing because they felt a justified penalty should be imposed without any compromise or reduction. Another commenter stated that, if the penalties reflect the deficiencies, then reducing the penalty amount makes the penalty lose some of its deterrent value. One commenter was concerned that the waiver of hearing provision, as written, may induce HCFA or the State to inflate the penalty. Then, if the penalty is reduced 35 percent because of the waiver, the fine amount is the amount it would have been before the reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter agreed with this regulatory provision on waiver of a hearing and stated that this is appropriate since informal conflict resolution can be used to eliminate misunderstandings or deficiencies that are not supported by the evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 35 percent reduction in the civil money penalty afforded providers for waiver of right to appeal is based on a State model (&sect;488.436). Providers are free to reject the option to waive the right to a hearing. The intent behind this regulatory provision is to encourage facilities to carefully consider their position in terms of substantial compliance, as well as the costs they will incur in litigating the matter, before tying up already overburdened hearing resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, if we are not confronted with the administrative costs of litigation, we believe we should consider offsetting civil money penalty amounts accordingly. On its face, these waiver provisions could seem to lessen the deterrent value of the civil money penalty. However, a 35 percent reduction of a $10,000 per day civil money penalty leaves a penalty amount of $6,500 per each day of noncompliance, and this is a significant deterrent to continued noncompliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree with the comment that the waiver provision may induce HCFA or the State to inflate the penalty because the per day amount of the civil money penalty will be determined before the facility would have the opportunity to exercise its option to waive a hearing. This is because the notice of the intent to impose the penalty includes the amount of the penalty per day of noncompliance, as well as the option to waive the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding dispute resolution, we appreciate the support of this commenter and agree that dispute resolution is an appropriate vehicle afforded the provider to address survey finding issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the waiver should not permit the facility to deny the existence of the deficiency for the purpose of determining whether repeat violations exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bailey sells 4.4m Bristol Ship shares MR CHRISTOPHER Bailey, outgoing chairman of Bristol Channel Ship Repairers, has sold 4.4m shares owned by his family interests at 10p each to the Norwegian company which won control of the UK ship management company earlier this year. The shares were suspended at 8p on Thursday at the company's request because it had started talks with Mr Andreas O Ugland, chairman-designate, and other members of his family, regarding the proposed acquisition of a fleet of vessels and a ship management business. The Ugland family interests now have a total of 23.7m shares, some 29.7 per cent of the share capital.</p>

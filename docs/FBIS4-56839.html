			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the international observers invited to </F> monitor the Panamanian elections by the Episcopal Conference of  Panama and the Peace and Justice Commission; in Panama City on 9  May; read by former Colombian President Belisario Betancur --  live]    [Text] We, the 11 observers from Latin America and Europe  invited by the Episcopal Conference of Panama and the Justice  and Peace Commission of Panama, have had the opportunity to  observe the electoral process in the Republic of Panama for one  week. Upon concluding our mission, we hereby forward the  following observations to the international community and the  Panamanian public:    1. We were provided with all of the information we needed to  learn about the country's electoral system. Furthermore, we  were able to interview and obtain information from members of  the Justice and Peace Commission itself, as well as other  electoral experts. They briefed us on electoral legislation and  practices in Panama.    2. The Magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal welcomed us on  several occasions to fully explain the system of guarantees and  controls established to ensure the Panamanian people's  democratic participation in the election and the respect for the  will of the people as reflected in the polls. We would like to  express our highest praise and strongest applause for the  Electoral Tribunal for its impeccable performance during this  important task in the interest of the country.    3. We examined the procedures that guaranteed a swift and  trustworthy vote count. Our highest congratulations go to the  National Vote-Counting Board and to the Justice and Peace  Commission.    4. We interviewed the presidential candidates. We discussed  their platforms, their willingness to respect the final results  of the elections, and their willingness to offer the winner  their personal cooperation and the cooperation of their  respective parties. We thank the candidates for finding time in  their very busy schedules to see us.    5. On 8 May, the team of international observers visited  various areas of the country. The idea was to confirm election  results directly. Thanks to the Justice and Peace Commission's  excellent planning and the outstanding cooperation offered by  those Panamanians who accompanied us during this time, we were  able to visit a large number of voting tables all across the  country.    There, we observed the smooth progression of Election Day  events, from the opening of the voting tables to the closure and  tallying process. We did not observe one case in which there  was any evidence of an attempt to distort the will of the  Panamanian people. We believe that the legal mechanisms, the  instructional efforts prior to the election, and the people's  enormous desire to participate freely and democratically made it  possible to experience an Election Day we can only describe as  exemplary.    6. As international observers fulfilling our mission, we  hereby state before the international community and the  Panamanian public that the 8 May 1994 elections in the Republic  of Panama were carried out with all necessary guarantees. The  process has allowed the people of Panama to express their  political will in complete freedom.    7. Last, we ask that all Panamanians and their political  leaders unite and build an even more just, free, and fraternal  Panama -- a Panama capable of resolving its domestic problems,  particularly poverty, while broadening its relations of peace  and cooperation with the countries of the region and the  international community in general.    To do so, Panamanian society, led by its political  authorities with the support of the Catholic Church and the  Justice and Peace Commission, and within the framework of the  Ibero-American nations' will to build and strengthen their  democratic systems, must be aware of challenges as outlined by  the admirable Panamanian people, who expressed their will with  outstanding civic and democratic maturity. To all of the  Panamanian people, we wish to express our admiration and  gratitude.    [Issued] Panama City, 9 May 1994</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Main points of the Autumn Statement Base rates down one percentage point to 7 per cent. Government spending in 1993-94 remains on target for Pounds 243.8bn. Targets are Pounds 253.6bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn for 1995-96. This means average growth of 1.4 per cent in public sector spending over the next three years, half the average growth rate of the past three years. National Insurance Contributions will stay at 9 per cent of relevant earnings. Upper and lower earnings limits will be indexed as usual. Hence the lower earnings limit moves to Pounds 56 per week from Pounds 54, while the upper earnings limit will rise from Pounds 405 to Pounds 420. The maximum possible increase in contributions per week will be Pounds 1.21. Social security benefits The real value of unemployment benefits and pensions will be maintained. Most social security benefits will increase by 3.6 per cent in April, in line with the increase in the retail prices index to September this year. Housing market measures involve giving housing associations an extra Pounds 750m this year to buy currently unoccupied accommodation. This will then be rented. There will be a temporary relaxation of controls on local authority receipts realised between today and the end of next year, including receipts from council house sales. The measure is expected to stimulate extra capital spending of Pounds 1.8bn. Car tax abolished altogether. This should provide a saving of around Pounds 400 on a Pounds 10,000 car. Gross Domestic Product is forecast to contract by 1 per cent this year, followed by growth of around 1 per cent next year. Public Sector Borrowing Requirement is expected to rise to Pounds 37bn this financial year, up from the Budget forecast of Pounds 28bn and higher than independent forecasts. In 1993-94 PSBR is expected to rise to 7 per cent of GDP, about Pounds 44bn. General government expenditure, which includes central government and local government spending and debt interest, is predicted to rise to 44.75 per cent as a share of national income this year 'mainly as a result of the recession'. It is projected to rise to 45.5 per cent in 1993-94 before dropping to 45 per cent the following year and 44.25 per cent in 1995-96. Public sector pay settlements will be restricted to a maximum increase of 1.5 per cent. Moves for businesses include increase in capital allowances for plant and machinery from 25 per cent to 40 per cent for one year. Initial tax allowance of 20 per cent for new industrial and agricultural buildings introduced for a year. The statement included a new initiative on private finance to enable public and private sectors to work more effectively together, particularly on infrastructure projects. Privately financed projects which can be operated profitably will be allowed to proceed. No comparison with a theoretical public sector alternative will be required. Spending on transport includes maintained cash plans for the national roads programme - the number of new schemes next year should be double this year's levels. British Rail will be allowed to lease about Pounds 150m of new rolling stock orders over the next three years. Funds of Pounds 1.2bn will be made available for London's Jubilee Line Underground extension, provided negotiations with the private sector are completed successfully. Local government will receive an extra 3.7 per cent of central government support in England next year, when the council tax will be introduced. Other news this week Small company shares continued their recent rally this week. The Hoare Govett Index (capital gains version) rose 1 per cent to 1111.5 over the seven days to November 12, and the County index also rose 1 per cent to 857.9 over the same period. Sun Life has launched an Ecological Portfolio within its Luxembourg based Global Portfolio range. The fund will aim for capital growth by investing in an international spread of companies likely to be involved in environmentally sound activities such as recycling, water purification, pollution control and waste management, according to Sun Life. The minimum investment is Pounds 3,000 and additional investments have to be in minimum sums of Pounds 500. The initial charge is 6.5 per cent of the offer price and the annual management charge 1.5 per cent. Bradford &amp; Bingley is offering a two year bond which it guarantees will pay at least 6 per cent gross above the base rate on its Timesaver account. Investors should not get too excited, however, since this is paying 1 per gross at the moment. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000 and interest can be taken annually or on a monthly basis. The bond is currently paying 9.10 per cent gross up to Pounds 24,999 and 9.8 per cent gross on higher amounts. The corresponding rates for those taking monthly income are 8.85 per cent gross and 9.4 per cent gross respectively. Bradford &amp; Bingley is holding these rates until the New Year. Savers are only allowed one withdrawal during the two years without giving prior notice, provided Pounds 5,000 remains, but they will lose 90 days' interest if they do so.</p>

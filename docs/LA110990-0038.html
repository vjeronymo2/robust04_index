			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE FRAUD RINGS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner is to be congratulated for uncovering  one of the biggest auto insurance scams in the country (Metro, Oct. 18).  </P> <P> Doing more real investigative work than anyone else anywhere, Reiner has  indicted dozens of people who have been reportedly bilking the insurance  industry of millions of dollars. I hope these people understand that by  committing this kind of massive fraud they are stealing from every single  California driver.  </P> <P> According to the DA's estimates, if the state were rid of this criminal  element, auto insurance premiums could be reduced at least 50%, making  insurance affordable without taking away the rights of people with legitimate  claims.  </P> <P> The California Trial Lawyers Assn. is particularly interested in this issue  because it has repeatedly supported the toughest anti-fraud legislation  anywhere in the United States. Unfortunately, these bills have consistently  been vetoed after passing the state Assembly and Senate.  </P> <P> Consumers in this state should not be forced to abdicate their rights so  criminals can act with impunity and pocket millions, perhaps billions, of  dollars in fraudulent auto insurance claims.  </P> <P> I hope law enforcement agencies throughout California join in the effort to  uncover these scams, put these criminals behind bars and stop the endless  effort to destroy our civil justice system and inalienable right to a jury  trial.  </P> <P> It's time we put the rights of consumers ahead of the rights of criminals.  </P> <P> LARRY DRIVON, President  </P> <P> California Trial Lawyers Assn.  </P></p>

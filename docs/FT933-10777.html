			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Heron gains court approval for refinancing Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, has won approval for its Pounds 1.4bn refinancing plan from the High Court in London. The plan has already been ratified in Heron's two other jurisdictions - the Netherlands and Netherlands Antilles - and has been approved by a substantial majority of creditors. However, before the refinancing can go ahead, Heron faces an appeal this week against ratification in Netherlands Antilles from creditors claiming unpaid debts of Dollars 42m.</p>

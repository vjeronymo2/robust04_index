			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ** 1/2 BOOM CRASH OPERA, "THESE HERE ARE CRAZY TIMES," GIANT/WARNER BROS.:  ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> The best songs on this Aussie band's second album sound like an apolitical  Midnight Oil. The political songs sound like average INXS. Catchy stuff -- even  rocks good at some turns. But what's the point of an apolitical Oil or a  political INXS? Steve Hochman  </P></p>

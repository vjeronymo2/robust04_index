			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Smith kills charge of concealed tax horrors AN election-winning Budget it was probably not. There was too much detailed talk of complex, voter-unfriendly concepts such as thresholds and National Insurance for that. However, Labour's unprecedented shadow budget extravaganza cannot be written off as a merely defensive public relations gesture. As one of the party's senior number-crunchers put it: 'We have been playing a lengthy game of poker - as far as I am concerned, we have won.' That, too, is premature. Only on April 9 will the game be formally judged. In the meantime, just as a real budget demands a decent interval before the initial verdicts become clear, so must that unveiled yesterday by Mr John Smith. But as the economists pore over the figures, some political conclusions can be drawn immediately. First and, arguably, foremost, the shadow chancellor's detailed presentation kills the charge that Labour has been concealing a confidential folder of tax horrors from the electorate. Asked directly by the Financial Times yesterday whether he had further proposals under his desk, Mr Smith swallowed, then gave his pledge that there was no more to come, at least, in his first Budget. The Conservatives' claims that there is a buried 'Tax Bombshell' - an average of Pounds 1,000 per head was the politically powerful charge in January - have effectively been defused, however much it may still be repeated in the election campaign. Furthermore, Mr Smith's calculation that somewhere between 80 to 90 per cent of taxpayers will either be beneficiaries or unaffected will be a statistic deployed time and again by Labour canvassers. If Mr Smith's figures are right, their revenue-raising impact will give a Labour government a total of Pounds 5.4bn to play with up until the end of its first full year in government - that is until April 1994. This not only provides the funds for Labour's Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme. It makes way for the party's plans to allocate Pounds 1bn for the National Health Service and Pounds 600m for education, with plenty to spare for other schemes. Months of Tory attacks along the lines of 'there they go again, spending money they haven't got' should, in theory at least, now fall. Above all, Mr Smith's fully-patented remedy for Britain's ills at least appear to address the parts Labour policies are intended to reach. Its strongly redistributive underlying theme will go down extremely well in all quarters of the party from right to left. Whether, however, the Budget also 'sells' Labour to the country's crucial floating voters remains the huge and, until the opinion pollsters do their work, wholly unanswered question. The political calculations behind the Budget-making exercise focused on how to counter the Tories' negative campaigning on the then-undisclosed details of Labour's tax and spending agenda. The findings of private polling revealed the powerful impact of Tory Central Office's January tax offensive on what one Labour official described as Basildon man. 'We discovered that a group of people earning between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 16,000 a year who had nothing to fear at all from us, believed what the Tories were saying about 'Labour's Tax Bombshell'. We had to deal with that.' Mr Smith also dealt with fierce hostility - particularly from the recently redundant - to his plans to apply a 9 per cent National Insurance levy to unearned income over Pounds 3,000. On the advice of his postbag, he dropped it. But none of this frees Labour from Tory charges that it is essentially hostile to the better-off. Many not-so-rich Basildon men will be affected. What is more, those that simply aspire to salaries over and above the relatively modest sum of Pounds 21,060 - the point at which the NIC measure bites - will also be wary. The shadow chancellor was honest enough to deal with that head-on yesterday. 'We have had 13 years in which people at the top got preferential treatment,' he said. 'In this budget, we are starting to take back something for the average taxpayer and the average family.' The task now lies with Labour's campaign propagandists to present the shadow Budget as a new battleground on which voters must choose between the two parties. Yesterday's unprecedented exercise - a historic first for any opposition party - gives voters more detailed data from which to make their decision than ever before. Inspite of all the razzmatazz, there are still no guarantees that the electorate will thank Mr Smith for that. Editorial comment, Page 20</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Economy Mourad Benachenhou by </F> unidentified correspondent, in Algiers on 12 January -- live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] We have with us here Mourad  Benachenhou, the minister of economy. Welcome, Mr. Minister, to  Radio Algiers. To begin with, we would like you to talk to us  about the economic and financial situation of Algeria.    The first question is about the policies of the treasury.  Algeria's budget deficit in 1993 was estimated at 190 billion  dinars; this year's budget deficit is estimated at 125.3 billion  dinars. This question is how is this deficit going to be met,  and what are the repercussions of it on the inflationary  pressures which are quite high anyhow.    [Benachenhou] One should start by saying in the name of God,  the merciful, the compassionate, before anything else. I would  like to thank the radio for giving me this opportunity to  explain a number of matters of interest relating to the  citizens' daily life, including economic and financial problems.  Your question was a direct and clear one and I can answer in  two parts. I will be talking in the first part about the state  expenses and in the second part about the revenues to finance  such expenses. [passage omitted]    In order to find new revenue we have carried out a study of  the economy and found new resources which have never been used  before. We have included them in this year's budget. Thanks to  these measures we have managed to reduce the budget deficit for  this year. Nevertheless, we cannot say that we are fully happy  with such a reduction; we would have liked to cut the deficit  even further because the more we cut the budget deficit the  better we can control inflation. However, we cannot go back  overnight on our economic and social commitments.    [Correspondent] The 1994 budget was drawn up on the basis of  an oil price of $18 per barrel. Some say that this price is  very optimistic, in view of the current situation of the oil  market and the expected development. If this price is not  achieved in the market, what measures does the government intend  taking to face this, because this will lead to a reduction in  oil revenue, and ultimately perhaps increase the deficit?    [Benachenhou] At any rate the government has these  expectations on the basis of studies carried out by two  international organizations, the IMF and the World Bank. The  studies of these two organizations are taken into consideration  by all the states which export raw materials, that is,  industrial and advanced states or developing states such as  Algeria. We based the $18 price on official reports prepared by  professional people working in the World Bank and the IMF.  There is in fact a reduction in oil prices; there is a  fluctuation. We do not know whether the price will go up or  down. We had to make a decision in order to prepare the budget  of this year and this decision -- as I have said -- was based on  international studies which are internationally guaranteed for  their feasibility. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent ] This year's budget includes for the first  time a clause on bankruptcy and legal settlement with regard to  public enterprises; is this clause an indication of an effort to  overcome the problem of the fate of the public sector and public  enterprises?    [Benachenhou] We can say two things regarding the role of  the public sector in the economy. First, the public sector's  share of this country's production is 65 percent. Second, the  public sector, including the administrative and industrial  sectors, employs about one third of the work force in the  country. When we start talking about the reorganization of the  public sector we are talking about the reorganization of almost  the whole of the Algerian economy, and even the reorganization  of Algerian administrative departments. There is no economic  scope for a country in which there is no direct or indirect  intervention. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Still with the budget law: This year's  budget has envisaged reduction of some taxes, i.e. the tax on  companies profits, and the reorganization of the income tax as  well as a reduction in VAT [value added tax] and the abolition  of compensatory tax. Also this year's budget envisages for the  first time the provison of extra revenue, about 50 billion  dinars, through combating tax evasion. Will the tax authorities  have the material and human resources to be able to face up to  tax evasion? Also, aren't you afraid that tax reduction will  lead to less revenue for the state?    [Benachenhou] I would like to stress here that this  government is determined to fight tax evasion; tax is a duty and  a right. [passage omitted]    As far as your second question is concerned I can tell you  that there is no direct link between tax revenues and the level  of tax imposed on economic activity, which is subject to  taxation. In many instances it is better, in order to increase  tax revenues, to reduce the percentage of the tax. And this is  what we have done. There are instances when the high level of  taxation would convince people that it is worthwhile to try to  hide their earnings all together from the tax people in order to  pay no tax at all. Hence, although we have reduced taxes, we  are convinced that such a reduction will increase tax revenues  because people will be more inclined to pay them.    [Corresponden] [passage omitted] What is the way, in the  opinion of the government or the Ministry of Economy, for  reviving the national economy?    [Benachenhou] Since its formation, the government has taken  several measures to raise the confidence of the private sector.  This is because, with regard to the public sector, there is a  direct and continuous intervention by the state so that the  level of production capability will not be lowered further than  the current level. The government's idea is that the private  sector has capabilities, that is to say, bigger participation in  the revival of the economy.    Therefore, the government enacted the law on investment  which  provided tax and financial concessions, so that people in the  private sector who have the entrepreneurial spirit and have  ideas on investment will be encouraged and take the necessary  measures to begin investment. This is the first thing. The  other thing is that one knows that banks play a major role in  the economy. The government therefore has taken several  measures to improve the working and management conditions of  banks so that they will participate in a more effective way in  financing the economy and particularly in financing investments.  The government has been working for five months only, during  which it took legal measures, as I outlined earlier, which  concern the financial sector and measures within the framework  of the financial law. All these measures require time before  they begin to have noticeable results in the market. What have  we noticed? Generally speaking, we noticed that some kind of  revival has taken place. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] On 15 January, an important date, talks  resume with the IMF. For the first time since the start of the  debt crisis in 1982, Algeria is officially announcing that it is  unable to pay its debt service on time and guarantee a minimum  level of imports to meet its food needs while continuing its  other matters. What are the proposed solutions to surmount this  problem, especially as we notice that several expressions and  concepts are being used: some people are talking about  rescheduling, others are mentioning a multilateral  restructuring, and others are suggesting the cancellation of  part of the debt?    [Benachenhou] The question you have just asked is extremely  complex, and I have no immediate answer for it because we are  still talking to the IMF and intend to be very thorough at these  talks. We will have to discuss almost every sentence included  in the reports presented by us and by the IMF. We must also  discuss the figures which will define the country's internal  financial situation and the figures which will give an idea on  the external financial situation. When we have drawn some kind  of a joint conclusion, which can only be drawn after we have  resumed our talks with the IMF in the second half of January, we  will then decide what the most effective way will be to reduce  the external debt, because the most important thing is to  alleviate the burden of the debt service, irrespective of the  expressions used. This is as far as our relations with the IMF  are concerned.    Moreover, there are states and international banks and  financial institutions which have granted us loans. We must  also hold talks with these sides in order to reach a formula  which will take into account Algeria's interests and our  interests [as heard]. We must now stress that the government's  objective is to reach a formula which will enable us to  alleviate the burden of our external debt.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you have touched on the  relations or the talks with the IMF and you have said that these  talks are both complex and thorough. On the other hand, we know  that the IMF, as a financial institution which has experience in  negotiating with countries, has almost a model prescription  which is well known; namely, a devaluation of the dinar, a  reduction in state intervention, and redundancies. On the basis  of these facts and this prescription, what room for maneuver  does the government and Algeria have in light of lower revenues  and the collapse of oil prices?    [Benachenhou] I have talked about negotiations and I have  not  talked about obeying orders from an institution. In any case,  Algeria is an independent country and a member of the IMF.  Within the framework of its participation in the IMF, it has  duties and it also has rights. These duties and rights exist in  the context of an international agreement. There is no  international institution which can force Algeria to take  measures that are not in its interests or that transcend the  international relations and legal foundations which exist  between our country and the IMF. I should have stressed this at  the onset. This means that Algeria has total freedom for  maneuver, regardless of the financial and economic difficulties  which it is experiencing. In the end, it is for Algeria to  decide whether it is economically, financially, socially, and  politically able to absorb the IMF's proposals and  recommendations or whether these proposals are acceptable.  Algeria is totally independent of the IMF regardless of its  financial circumstances.    You talked about a unified model. I would like to say that  this model is not a model that can be exported directly from one  country to another. Every country has its own peculiarities  regarding its economic and financial structure. Any measure  that will be taken or that is agreed upon in the framework of an  IMF program must take into account the country's social,  financial, and economic peculiarities and also the country's own  economic and financial structure. If we had found ourselves in  the clear situation which you talked about and in which there  would be a unified formula that is applied to all the countries,  then there would be no need for talks and we would ask the IMF  to send us the list of its measures and we would start  implementing them. Then we would ask the IMF: Please send us  the money. This is clear. Negotiations are taking place in the  real sense of the word.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you spoke about  negotiations with the IMF and stressed that they were  negotiations and not a model prescription. But no doubt the  issue of the national currency will be raised with the IMF. We  note in the market that there is a wide gap between the official  rate, which is about 4.5 dinars to the franc, and the black  market where the rate sometimes reaches 13 dinars to the franc.  How will the problem of the dinar be settled with the IMF,  bearing in mind that there are people who are saying that the  dinar should be devalued by 50 percent, and others who say that  the devaluation should be gradual, 1 percent per month? How  will the problem be settled?    [Benachenhou] Regarding this problem, it is linked to  several factors; there is no direct solution, nor a direct  decision with regard to the value of the currency because this  rate is linked to other things, including issues which we spoke  about earlier, such as the financial deficit and how to finance  the deficit. The problem is not that of a financial deficit,  but of financing it by existing revenues. In other words, the  financial deficit has no influence over the value of the  currency. I do not want to conceal from you that when we speak  to the IMF we cover all issues relating to the economy and  finance, including the budget, foreign trade, the value of the  currency, and so on. But the value of the currency is the  result of the influence of several factors which are linked to  the method of issuing the currency to finance the economy and to  the way in which the economy functions and its effectiveness,  meaning the production capability available in the economy.  People have noticed a kind of fall of the dinar in the black  market. I wish to stress two things with regard to the black  market: one, what is the value of the deals which are being made  within this black market? I do not know. Are these deals  marginal in comparison with the volume of all the deals which  are made within the economy? Has the parallel market got a  bigger role than one can imagine? No one can provide you with  an analysis of this. We know and cannot deny that there is a  black market, and that the value of the dinar in the black  market is less than the official value of the dinar. But there  is no direct connection between this black market value and the  real value of the dinar. If we tomorrow totally free the value  of the dinar; if, for example, tomorrow the Central Bank decides  to totally cease fixing the value of the dinar, will this value  fall to the level of the black market value or not? No one can  tell you. Besides there are no capabilities to estimate or  calculate this. What concerns us at this time is to know that  the government within the framework of negotiations with the IMF  does not accept suggestions which cannot be economically,  financially, and socially absorbed, no matter what these  suggestions may be, and even suggestions relating to the value  of the dinar.    [Correspondent] We must not forget that there is a  psychological facet concerning the dinar which is greater.  Maybe the situation would change if the Central Bank declared  its revenue.    [Benachenhou] This is true. There is a psychological facet.  We can say that there is a flaw in the method of financing  revenues in this country. There are matters [word indistinct]  linked to trade which could influence the value of the dinar in  the black market. Consequently, we must not take that value as  a gauge. We must set the real value of the dinar within the  framework of the market where there is supply and demand for the  dinar and for hard currency.    [Correspondent] The other issue which is always raised with  that of the IMF is the issue concerning public sector  enterprises. In this year's budget, nearly 80 billion dinars  have been earmarked for the financial reform of these  enterprises and their restructuring. This restructuring  requires a mass reduction in the workforce. Has any final  decision been taken by the government and the Economy Ministry  and what are the expected effects on the unemployment rate,  which is already high at nearly 25 percent?    [Benachenhou] Indeed, 76 billion dinars have been earmarked  in this year's budget for the reorganization of the public  sector enterprises. This huge amount of money highlights the  state's commitment to take all the necessary measures to  revitalize this sector and maintain the economic and social role  it is playing at the moment. Moreover, the problems concerning  the restructuring of the public sector are very marginal for the  IMF institution gives us some recommendations on ways to come  out of the crisis. It is our duty as a state to take all the  necessary measures to enable this sector to contribute more to  the revival of the economy. This contribution is linked to the  difficult conditions which the Algerian economy is going through  and also to the way these enterprises are managed internally.  What are we going to do? We are going to adapt these  conditions imposed on the public and private enterprises alike.  However, these public enterprises must, as independent  enterprises, also take numerous measures to improve their  management and reduce the costs which are not directly linked to  their production capacity. In any case, we cannot say that  these enterprises are waiting for the IMF recommendations to  take these measures; several measures have been taken with the  collaboration of the social partners. I must once again stress  that the restructuring and reform of the economy will not be  done at the expense of a given social category. This must be  clearly understood.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, still on the same subject.  When we compare figures of the study for 1992, we find that the  amount earmarked for financial reforms was 160 billion dinars,  in 1993 it was 83 billion, and this year it is estimated at 76  billion. Every year, since 1990, we have been saying that the  reorganization of public enterprises would be completed that  year. Yet, every time the same problem is raised in the same  way. For example, workers' wages are not being paid by many  enterprises. Is it possible for the state to continue financing  them in this way?    [Benachenhou] The state has decided on new bodies for the  running of public enterprises. I am talking about the 1989  laws. Their aim was to raise the level of economic and financial  responsibility of those enterprises. Within this framework, the  state set in motion a number of financial measures in order to  restore some financial balance and organization in those  enterprises to enable them to become independent.    The state has played its role to make those enterprises have  an independence built on clear and rational bases. However, for  many reasons, some of which are internal to the public  enterprise and others connected to the difficult financial and  economic conditions experienced by Algeria, those enterprises  were not able to reach the required financial balance.  Therefore, the state continued to contribute to the financing  or refinancing of those enterprises from the funds allocated in  the budget for financial assistance.    As a government, we are hoping that the time will come when  the enterprises will be able to contribute more toward the state  budget than allocated to the running of the enterprises.  However, circumstances make it necessary for us to support  public enterprises for economic reasons because they have a  great production capability, and for social reasons too. Those  enterprises employ a large number of people and the rate of  unemployment would rise if those people were not employed.    [Correspondent] Negotiations started recently with the  General Union of Algerian Workers. Some are saying or proposing  that, since prices are rising rapidly and that there is shortage  of numerous basic commodities, wages should be index-linked and  raised. What does the Economy Ministry think about this  proposal? Will this lead, for example, to an inflationary  spiral?    [Benachenhou] Negotiations are currently under way with the  trade union, the General Union of Algerian Workers, which has an  important and essential role to play in providing social  protection for the workers. The government is listening  seriously to all the analyses which are made by this trade union  and which are linked to its role and mission. Several in-depth,  frank, and lengthy discussions have taken place with this trade  union. These discussions will continue until we reach a formula  which will take into account the country's economic and  financial conditions, because we cannot take any measure which  could have a negative impact on the economic balances and which  could lead to a rise in the inflation rate. Any rise in the  inflation rate would make the social situation of the workers  worse. All I can say is that we are talking to the trade union  with an open mind, but we are talking under complex and very  difficult circumstances.    [Correspondent] The minister delegate of commerce has  announced that Algeria has expressed its intention to join GATT,  the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade. What are the  reasons behind this request, and, if Algeria was to be allowed  to join GATT, what would the expected effects be on the national  economy, since we know that Algeria exports only hydrocarbons at  the moment?    [Benachenhou] In any case, several international  organizations are in charge of financial, economic, and  commercial affairs worldwide. Algeria is probably one of the  very few countries which did not participate in GATT, despite  the fact that the latter comes under the same general agreements  governing the creation of the IMF and the World Bank. Therefore  it was necessary for Algeria to complete its membership in these  economic institutions and join GATT. We had to join GATT as a  complement to our participation in the IMF and the World Bank.    In regards to the second part of your question, you are  right  in saying that Algeria exports on the whole only petroleum and  hydrocarbons, but it must organize its foreign trade in order to  give itself the opportunity to create and develop other exports.  Its participation in GATT would also enable it to take part in  the negotiations which are under way on the organization of  international trade to the benefit of countries which have  products to export, whether these products are raw materials or  products that can be linked to services. In any case, GATT has  very complex rules and arrangements which cover problems  pertaining to the protection of the domestic market. We should  not play down the results which we could obtain from our  participation in GATT. Thank you very much.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Minister, and goodbye.</p>

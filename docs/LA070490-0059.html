			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REPRIMANDED NAVY DOCTOR CITES EXAMPLE OF WASTE;  </P> <P> SURGERY: MITCHELL J. GRAYSON SAYS A RECENT $25,000 OPERATION SHOWS JUST HOW  PETTY IT WAS FOR THE NAVY TO CRITICIZE HIS USE OF ITS MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS TO DO  CHARITY WORK IN TIJUANA.  </P> <P> The admiral in charge of the San Diego Navy hospital sent a servicewoman to  Atlanta this year for $25,000 in surgery that could have been done at the  hospital here at no extra cost to the government, according to a former Navy  physician who said he had offered to do the surgery in San Diego.  </P> <P> Rear Adm. R.B. Halder authorized the surgery because the woman had become  disgruntled over being turned down for surgery by a visiting Atlanta expert  when he visited San Diego on a teaching trip last August, said the former Navy  doctor, Mitchell J. Grayson.  </P> <P> "I knew that someone was intervening on her behalf," Grayson said. "I'm not  sure whether someone told me or whether I just kind of knew -- I mean, that's  the way the system works."  </P> <P> Grayson made the charges public this week after receiving final notice that his  ties with the Navy are severed. Grayson was held in the Navy beyond his  original February discharge date until an investigation of his use of Navy  surgical instruments for charity care in Tijuana was completed.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that he is bitter over a subsequent reprimand from Halder for  "inexcusable" conduct, Grayson said the case of the $25,000 spent for  out-of-state surgery points out how petty the investigation of him was.  </P> <P> "This really points out the hypocrisy of the Navy, and particularly of my  commanding officer (Halder)," Grayson said. Pointing to a Navy regulation, he  added, "The same gentleman who castigated me is I think guilty of the waste,  fraud and abuse that is defined in that Navy handout."  </P> <P> The incident Grayson detailed is supported by letters between him and the  Atlanta doctor, whom he declined to identify. However, The Times learned  elsewhere that the plastic surgeon was Dr. Carl Hartrampf Jr.  </P> <P> Hartrampf could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> A letter from Hartrampf, dated June 15, said the Navy woman was sent to Atlanta  three times for the surgery and follow-up procedures.  </P> <P> The woman had her initial breast reconstruction operation "on Feb. 1, 1990, and  her nipple/areola reconstruction on March 20," the letter says. "She is  scheduled to return for her nipple tattoo this month, and I am happy to report  that she is doing well. The Navy paid my usual fee for the breast  reconstruction and nipple/areolar reconstruction."  </P> <P> The operation the woman had is called a TRAM flap; the acronym stands for  "transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous." In this surgery, part of a  lower-abdominal muscle and abdominal skin are partially detached, rotated and  then reconnected to blood vessels in the chest.  </P> <P> The muscle tissue is used to reconstruct a cancer patient's breast after  mastectomy, said Dr. Jack Fisher, head of the division of plastic surgery at UC  San Diego Medical Center. In some women, the method is preferable to artificial  implants, he said.  </P> <P> Plastic surgeons at the Naval Hospital are "very high quality" and are easily  qualified to do the TRAM operation, Fisher said.  </P> <P> The surgery has been in use for several years, and Hartrampf is one of its  developers, so he teaches classes in it for plastic surgeons, Fisher said.  </P> <P> During a teaching visit to San Diego last August, Hartrampf arranged to do a  demonstration of a TRAM flap operation at Naval Hospital, Grayson said.  </P> <P> Grayson found one 56-year-old woman who appeared to be the perfect candidate  for the surgery, and asked a second woman -- an active-duty Navy servicewoman  in San Diego -- to be ready for surgery that day in case the first patient  couldn't be used, he said.  </P> <P> On the day of surgery, Aug. 24, the Atlanta doctor concluded that the  56-year-old woman was indeed an ideal candidate, so the second woman was sent  home, Grayson said.  </P> <P> Grayson, who was head of the plastic surgery division at Naval Hospital, wrote  in a Sept. 6 letter to Hartrampf that this woman had lodged a formal complaint  about not having the surgery done.  </P> <P> Grayson said he had several conversations with Halder and a patient advocate at  the hospital about the woman's case, and it was clear to him that this was  being treated as a special case. He recounts them this way:  </P> <P> "Our first interviews were, 'What happened?' Then the thrust came, 'Can we take  care of her expeditiously?' And so we got her scheduled promptly (at Naval  Hospital) for Sept. 21," Grayson said. "Then, the next conversations were that  (the Atlanta doctor) had agreed to do the operation for half price, and it's  just going to cost us $25,000, so we'll send her over there for three or four  trips."  </P> <P> He was surprised by the action, Grayson said, because the operation could have  been done at the Naval Hospital or -- if a civilian doctor was deemed necessary  -- by other plastic surgeons in San Diego.  </P> <P> Dr. Stephen Krant, a La Jolla plastic surgeon who is head of the division at  Scripps Memorial Hospital-La Jolla, agreed.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of very well-qualified plastic and reconstructive surgeons in  San Diego who are well qualified to do a TRAM flap," Krant said.  </P> <P> Contacted for comment on the case, Adm. Halder said patients at Naval Hospital  can be referred out for civilian care under a variety of mechanisms and  circumstances. He declined to comment on any specific case, he said, because of  legal restrictions on invading patient privacy by talking about their cases.  </P> <P> He also declined to comment on whether he had authorized $25,000, including  travel costs, to be spent on a breast reconstruction, again citing privacy  restrictions.  </P> <P> Officials of the Navy branch for which the woman works could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Grayson was reprimanded by Halder on May 24 for using $4,472 worth of surgical  equipment in Operation Smile, a charity effort to correct cleft lips and  palates in Tijuana children. Halder's citation against him said this "wrongful  appropriation is inexcusable and falls well below the moral standards expected  of a Naval officer."  </P> <P> Grayson accepted the reprimand, but still protests that he returned all the  instruments and that hospital officials had been aware all the time that he was  borrowing them.  </P> <P> Indeed, his performance review for the year that ended in August, 1989, cites  him for "outstanding" surgical performance and for his Operation Smile work  because it "has brought much favorable publicity to Navy medicine."  </P> <P> Grayson, released by the Navy last month, plans to move later this month to  take a job at Pennsylvania's Guthrie Clinic.  </P></p>

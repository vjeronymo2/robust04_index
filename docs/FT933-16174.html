			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / People: Economists at Shell and BA from the distaff side There are even fewer female economists at the top of big business than there are female politicians in top positions of government, so the probability that Shell International's outgoing chief economist, DeAnne Julius, would be replaced by another female of the species might seem pretty slim. However, DeAnne Julius, a 44-year-old American who has done the job for four years, helped draw up the short list of candidates to succeed her, and ensured that the name of Heidemarie Sherman of the Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung in Munich, was included. The two of them had co-authored a book together, the Monetary Implications of 1992, when Julius was director of economics at Chatham House. Julius, a former World Bank economist who is married to Ian Harvey, chief executive of the British Technology Group, is expected to join British Airways in September. The airline has plenty of economists but it is understood that Julius will be taking on a newly created post of chief economist. She sees plenty of similarities between Shell and BA. They are both in long-term capital intensive industries and have an important interface with governments. In addition, both companies face competition from state-owned rivals. However, BA is a much smaller company than Shell and Julius says that one of the attractions of her new job is that she will be much closer to the business. She will report to Roger Maynard, BA's director of corporate strategy. There is far more to running an airline than picking the fastest growing routes and negotiating cosy deals, says Julius. She is particularly looking forward to being involved in the airline business at a time when the European industry is undergoing big structural shifts. Sherman is the latest in a long line of well regarded outside economists to occupy the chief economist's slot. It is one of the very few positions at Shell where the company brings in outsiders for relatively brief periods. Oxford University's Peter Oppenheimer did the job for a couple of years and the World Bank has often provided candidates.</p>

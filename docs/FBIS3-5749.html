			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- The Food Agency said  Thursday [10 March] an additional 30,000 tons of rice, harvested  in Japan, will be supplied to the market between this month and  June as an emergency measure to meet a shortage.    The 30,000 tons, equivalent to two days' national  consumption, are part of the agency's prefectural branch stocks,  agency officials said. However, it is up to prefectural  governments to determine when to put the extra rice on the  market, the officials said.    The shortage is caused partly by delayed imports of foreign  rice, they said.</p>

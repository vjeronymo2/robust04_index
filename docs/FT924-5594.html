			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / S Africa investment up - but so are the outflows: Disinvestment and investments abroad amount to more than double inward flows SOUTH AFRICA'S business leaders seldom waste an opportunity to lecture the politicians that without political stability there will be no foreign investment in the country. Recent evidence suggests they are at least half right. A study* by the London School of Economics shows that while South Africa has enjoyed a renewal of foreign direct investment since President F W de Klerk embarked on reforms in late 1989, it has been less than half as much as disinvestments and investments abroad by South African companies in the same period. Indeed, the impact of this investment outflow is probably the main reason behind the recent weakening in the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners investing in South Africa, and South Africans investing abroad. Yesterday the currency closed at R5.00/Dollars 1 - a 40 per cent discount to the commercial rand rate of exchange of R3.00/Dollars 1. The discount, which is a barometer of investor confidence in the country, was only 13.5 per cent at the end of 1991. The recent trend to invest abroad is being investigated by Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance and trade and industry, and it is possible changes in exchange control regulations may follow. Another recent study, by the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC), concludes, however, that the trend of disinvestment has been reversed over the past year. The IRRC report on International Business in South Africa, notes that 508 non-US companies have direct investment or employees in South Africa, up from 454 a year ago. US companies have returned in smaller numbers, increasing to 111 from 106 a year ago. There has also been a considerable upsurge in foreign companies having non-equity links (such as licensing or distribution arrangements) in South Africa. A longer term perspective on capital outflows from South Africa was recently offered by Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of brokers Smith New Court. He noted that since 1959 capital inflows have totalled R100bn, in 1990 values. During this period, disinvestment has taken R84bn back out. He speculates that without spells of heightened political tension, South Africa could have expected capital inflows to have continued, as they did between 1946 and 1959 and between 1965 and 1976. He calculates that this might have added another R104bn, in 1990 terms. It has often been pointed out that South Africa is not so much short of funds to invest, but of attractive investment opportunities. Continued current account surpluses, and large sums raised on the stock exchange, testify to the former. Reserve Bank figures, showing that real investment by the private sector shrunk by 9.5 per cent from the end of 1989 to mid-1992, are evidence of the latter. It is hardly surprising that foreigners are also holding back. Business confidence - reported recently by the Bureau of Economic Research to be at its lowest level since ex-President P W Botha's disastrous Rubicon speech in August 1985 - is clearly the key factor, with political uncertainty one of the main contributors. But there are also important economic realities which are a disincentive to investment for domestic and foreign businesses alike. Mr Ted Osborne, group economist at the Nedcor group, listed them earlier this year as including such factors as 'high tax rates, high wage rates in relation to skill and productivity levels, shortages of skill, a less than demonic work ethic, highly politicised trade unions, and high inflation'. He also mentioned the limited size of the South African market and its growing exposure to international competition as tariff walls are lowered. These factors, together with a logical desire to spread risk and access new markets, explain the recent upsurge in investments abroad by South African companies. These include large investments by the country's two forest products groups, Sappi and Mondi, acquisitions by First National Bank and the Standard Bank group and the proposed takeover of Del Monte Foods International by the Royal Group and Anglo American. Large disinvestments this year appear to have been more a function of internal strategic issues within the companies concerned than any particular view of the South African economy. At the same there has been a steady flow of mostly smaller inward investment flows. The LSE study (which does not pretend to be exhaustive, especially of smaller projects) identifies a total of 51 new investments made in South Africa since late 1989. The 20, to which an exact size could be put had a cumulative value of just more than Dollars 700m. The authors say they believe it unlikely that the total new inflow to South Africa as a result of these new investments will exceed Dollars 1.5bn. Although economists caution against trying to establish a relationship between capital inflows and economic growth, figures from the Central Economic Advisory Service, a government economic research body, suggest that if the country is to achieve an average GDP growth rate of 3.5 a year between now and the end of the century - the minimum necessary to absorb new entrants to the labour market - then an annual capital inflow of 1.5-2 per cent of GDP (R4.5bn-R6bn in 1991 terms) is necessary. *Centre for the Study of the South African Economy and International Finance, London School of Economics, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, Tel: 071 955 7280</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori announced today the arrest of a "very important" leader  of the Shining Path [SL] terrorist group, whom he identified as  Moises Simon Limaco Huayuscachi. Fujimori said that Limaco  Huayuscachi was coordinator of the Shining Path's Central  Directorate and was regarded as "the right arm" of Oscar Alberto  Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano," currently the top leader of  the Maoist group.    The Peruvian president said that Mario Vasquez, known as  "Comrade Roberto," another ranking leader of the subversive  organization, was also arrested. He is the one who occupied the  post of Martha Huatay, who was in charge of the SL's "People's  Aid" organization.    Huatay, one of the main terrorist leaders surrounding  Abimael  Guzman, the group's founder, ideologue, and foremost leader, was  captured shortly after Guzman, who was arrested by policemen on  12 September 1992.    Fujimori told newsmen that both terrorists were captured  today in Comas district in the northern sector of Lima. He added  that Limaco Huayuscachi was responsible for logistical support  for "Feliciano" and said that his capture "will further weaken"  the Shining Path organization, whose members have rejected the  peace proposals made by Guzman to the Fujimori government and  have chosen to pursue the path of violence.</p>

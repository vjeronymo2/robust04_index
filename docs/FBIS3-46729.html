In his report at the meeting, Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the  Central Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of  Korea [LSWYK], said the classical work of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il is a highly important work of great  significance in rallying the young people around the party in  one mind and firmly preparing them to be young vanguards who  defend the party and the leader with their lives and to be  lifeguards and death-defying corps who defend and exalt  Korean-style socialism centred on the masses, in face of the  vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries to  isolate and stifle our country, the bastion of socialism.    The reporter noted that the dear leader called upon the  young  people to remain loyal to the socialist cause, supporting the  party's ideas and leadership and play the vanguard role in the  nationwide struggle for the reunification of the country and  advanced tasks to develop the overseas Korean youth movement and  strengthen unity and solidarity with the progressive youths of  the world.    "It is a heavy yet honorable task facing the youth league  organisations and officials to unite the young people around the  party and the leader in one mind, prepare them to be rifles and  bombs defending the party and the socialist system in the van  with their lives and put them at the head of the drive to  implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy for  hastening the final victory of the socialist cause and the cause  of national reunification", the reporter said.    Stating that the dear leader's guidance is the life and soul  of the LSWYK and the source of unconquerable might, the reporter  said the whole league should thoroughly establish a strong  revolutionary discipline of acting as one under his unitary  guidance so that the party's line and policy can be the faith  and will of the young people at all times.    The meeting was attended by Secretary of the Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Chung-nin.</p>

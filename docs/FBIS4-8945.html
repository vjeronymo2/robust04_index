			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Leading parties of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on Tuesday [19 April] said  that talks are the only way to resolve the conflict in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Democratic Party of Socialists of  Montenegro, the ruling party in that Yugoslav republic, said  that the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina had real chances to  succeed provided the United Nations and NATO abandon the hasty  and disastrous military operations against Bosnian Serbs and  that the legitimate interests of all warring sides be equally  respected in the diplomatic activities.    This party, whose delegates are in federal parliament,  assessed on the basis of a report on Yugoslavia's diplomatic  activities presented by Republican President Momir Bulatovic,  that efforts should continue unabated to contribute to the peace  process and lasting solutions. The lifting of the international  sanctions against Yugoslavia is an integral and inseparable part  of a global agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the party said.    The opposition Democratic Party, whose delegates are present  in the federal and Serbian parliaments, is convinced that the  establishment of peace in the entire territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is mostly in the interest of the Serb side,  and an immediate ceasefire around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in  southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, is the first step towards this.    In a statement for the public, Democratic Party President  Zoran Djindjic said it was necessary to respect the agreement on  an immediate ceasefire in Gorazde, that both sides accept the  immediate arrival of U.N. observers, that the U.N. Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) immediately demilitarize Gorazde as a protected  area, and that the international community pressure the Moslem  side to accept the Serb proposal on a truce in the entire  territory of the republic. The Democratic Party's information  service said that Djindjic had telephoned Bosnian Serb president  Radovan Karadzic to consult him and that the statement for the  public was based on this phone conversation.    Serbian Renewal Movement President Vuk Draskovic told a  press  conference that the only solution for the Bosnian crisis was an  end to all military activities and the signing of a peace  accord. `We are now on a crossroads - peace or escalation of  war,' Draskovic said, adding that he believed there would be no  more NATO air strikes. The leader of this opposition party,  whose delegates are present in Serbian parliament, believes that  it is necessary to place the heavy weapons of all three sides --  Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- simultaneously under U.N. control,  and later to demilitarize the entire area, and that only then  should a political solution be sought. Draskovic believes that  it is in the national and state interest of Serbs to `distance  themselves from the war-crazed minority, to brand war-mongers  and war profiteers.'</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING FOR A WAY AROUND THE TERRITORIAL DISPUTE ;  </P> <P> JAPAN: SOVIET CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN KURIL ISLANDS HAS KEPT TOKYO AND MOSCOW  FAR APART SINCE 1945. BUT THERE ARE SIGNS OF WARMING THAT SKIRT THE ISSUE.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro  Nakayama have described their three-day meeting in Tokyo this week as a  potential "turning point" and a "beginning in earnest."  </P> <P> Their agenda is to prepare for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's state  visit to Japan next April. Japan's first priority is still the "northern  territories" -- the handful of small islands at the southern end of the Kuril  chain -- claimed by Japan but occupied by the Soviets since 1945. This is  virtually the only territory still disputed by World War II combatants.  </P> <P> Tokyo's official position remains that the islands, within sight of the  northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, must be returned to Japanese sovereignty  before there can be any real improvement in relations, or a bilateral peace  treaty formally concluding World War II. But some key leaders of the ruling  Liberal Democratic Party have recently signaled greater flexibility.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu acknowledged this summer that it would be "too  stubborn" for Japan to refuse any significant increase in ties before settling  the territorial issue. He offered a variety of exchange programs and,  particularly welcome in Moscow, increased Japanese help with the Chernobyl  nuclear cleanup. Hard-liners in the finance and foreign ministries continue,  however, to resist credits for the Soviets until settlement of the territorial  dispute is in sight.  </P> <P> Japan may underestimate the intensity of Soviet, or at least Russian,  nationalism on such territorial issues. Nikita Khrushchev or Leonid Brezhnev  would have had the unilateral power to give up the islands, but no agreement  yielding Soviet territory to Japan will easily pass either the national or  Russian republic legislatures of today. A Soviet poll earlier this year  allegedly showed 85% opposition to surrendering the islands.  </P> <P> Russian Republic President Boris Yeltsin proposed late last month putting off a  resolution for 15 to 20 years. Then, after joint Japanese-Soviet development of  the islands and their eventual demilitarization, a "new generation" of Soviet  and Japanese leaders could deal with ultimate sovereignty. This is totally  unacceptable in Japan. But there may be a basis for discussion in other Soviet  variations that include shorter time periods and options such as U.N.  trusteeship, U.S. mediation and major Japanese economic and financial  assistance to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Moscow knows it must reach an understanding with Asia's most influential state  if it wants to play a role in the Asian Pacific over the long run. Japan  realizes it has to deal with Moscow if it wants political and military security  in northeast Asia.  </P> <P> It is striking that both countries for the first time will discuss military and  security issues, including confidence-building measures and arms control.  Official Japanese suspicion of Soviet military objectives remains high, but  parallel Japanese and Soviet policies on Cambodia and the Persian Gulf crisis,  as well as signs of thinning Soviet forces in the disputed islands (and  assurances that there are no nuclear weapons there) make discussions easier.  </P> <P> Japan does not want its security policies to get ahead of Washington's, but it  is beginning to reassess its own positions and interests. Lower tensions  between Japan and the Soviet Union could diminish Japanese political support  for U.S. bases (and for Japan's payment of 40% of the cost of the bases),  reduce consensus on Japan's $30-billion defense budget, and even undermine the  rationale for the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Most Japanese politicians, other  than the Socialists, seem convinced that all of this can be managed.  </P> <P> Moscow insists, in the words of a Soviet deputy foreign minister, that improved  Soviet-Japanese relations will "in no way damage the existing security  framework between Japan and the United States." This is an important message  and as close as the Soviets are likely to come to saying that the arrangement  contributes to stabilizing Japan's role in Asia.  </P> <P> The U.S. position is clear. It will not interfere in the Japanese-Soviet  negotiating process. Easing of Soviet-Japanese tensions should facilitate  further reduction of Soviet forces in the region and ultimately contribute to  similar easing on the Korean peninsula. And the importance of U.S.-Japanese  relations goes far beyond mutual concern about the "Soviet threat." The  U.S.-Japan treaty provides for consultation, cooperation and collaboration on  political, economic and security issues and will continue to be as vital for  both sides after Soviet-Japanese detente as before.  </P></p>

Complete Contributor Identifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Treasurers of political committees, including authorized committees of Presidential candidates, are required by 2 U.S.C. 432(i) and 434(b) to use their best efforts to obtain, maintain and report the name, address, occupation and employer of all contributors who give over $200 per calendar year. The Commission recently issued revised rules regarding this reporting obligation. See 58 FR 57725 (Oct. 27, 1993). During that rulemaking, two commenters suggested revising 11 CFR 9036.2 so that Presidential primary candidates would only receive matching funds for contributions exceeding $200 containing complete contributor information. While full contributor identifications are required for such contributions in threshold submissions under 11 CFR 9036.1(b), they are not currently required under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1)(v) for additional submissions for matching funds. Accordingly, comments are requested on whether to delete section 9036.2(b)(1)(v), thereby requiring complete contributor information for all matchable contributions exceeding $200. In the alternative, comments are sought on only matching these contributions if committees can provide evidence demonstrating they made their best efforts to obtain the information. Please note that neither of these alternatives is included in the proposed regulations which follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. NOCO Statements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9034.5(a) of the regulations requires the candidate to submit a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations [``NOCO''] within 15 days of his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9034.5(f)(1) also requires the candidate to submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations with each subsequent matching payment request. These NOCO statements provide the Commission with an indication of the campaign's financial status. The Commission uses these statements to determine whether the candidate is entitled to receive any additional matching funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some circumstances, the NOCO statements do not provide adequate information about the candidate's remaining obligations. For example, many NOCO statements list the candidate's estimated necessary winding down costs as a single lump sum, making it difficult for the Commission to review the cost estimate to determine whether the candidate is entitled to receive the entire estimated amount. In addition, because several weeks now elapse between submission of the NOCO statement and certification of the matching payments due to changes in the Treasury Department's payment policy, the certification often does not reflect the true financial status of the committee at the time of certification. The candidate's financial situation invariably changes during this period, and any change in the committee's net outstanding campaign obligations should result in a change in the committee's entitlement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule seeks to address these problems. Section 9034.5(b) would be amended to require a breakdown of the estimated winding down costs listed on the NOCO statement by category and time period. This breakdown would include estimates of quarterly or monthly costs for office space rental, staff salaries, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing, and storage from the date of the NOCO statement until the expected termination of the committee's political activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would also require a candidate who submits a matching payment request and accompanying NOCO statement after his or her date of ineligibility to submit an additional revised NOCO statement. This statement would be due just before the certification date, on a date that would be published by the Commission with the dates for matching fund submissions and matching payment certifications. The candidate would be required to prepare the statement so that it reflects the financial status of the campaign three business days before the statement's due date. The Commission would then use this statement to determine whether the amount of matching payments to be certified should be adjusted to reflect a committee's changed financial situation. This would ensure that the amount certified accurately reflects the committee's financial situation at the time of certification. The Commission welcomes comments on these proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

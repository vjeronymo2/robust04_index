			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Primerica takes stake in Travelers SHARES in Travelers Corporation jumped on US stock markets yesterday on the news that Primerica, the financial services group, had taken a big stake in the troubled insurance company, and Mr Sanford Weill, Primerica's chairman, would assume a significant role in Travelers. By the close, Travelers' share price was up Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 20 5/8 in heavy trading after the announcement that Primerica would invest Dollars 722.5m (Pounds 408.1m) in Travelers in return for a 27 per cent stake. Investors and analysts welcomed the deal. Mr Weill's appointment to Travelers' board was seen as a much-needed vote of confidence. The insurer, suffering big losses on property investments, agreed to elect Mr Weill to its board and as chairman of the finance committee. Travelers unveiled a restructuring involving 3,500 job losses, or 10 per cent of its workforce. It will take a Dollars 132m after-tax charge in the third quarter to pay for the lay-offs, but it will also report a special net gain of Dollars 135m as a result of an accounting change. The agreement, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, gives Primerica 38m shares of Travelers common stock, valued at Dollars 19 a share, in return for Dollars 550m cash, a 50 per cent equity stake in Primerica's Gulf Insurance property-casualty subsidiary and 100 per cent in health insurance operations of Primerica's Transport Life/Voyager Group. The deal increases to Dollars 1.4bn the capital Travelers has raised this year to shore up its shaky position. In the first half of this year it sold Dollars 675m of stock and bonds. More than a third of Travelers' Dollars 13.8bn book of property loans was characterised as underperforming by the end of the second quarter.</p>

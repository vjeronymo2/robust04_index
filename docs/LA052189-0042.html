			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SAY THE G-WORD,' SHERIFF IS URGED  </P> <P> So (Sheriff) Sherman Block has said for what he hopes "is the final time" that  his department does not discriminate against any group. It's not the last time,  not yet (Times, May 11).  </P> <P> Until he says publicly that the Sheriff's Department does not discriminate  specifically against gays and lesbians, and until he says publicly that he and  the department will not tolerate harassment of open lesbians and gays on the  force, no one will begin to believe him.  </P> <P> He has warned in advance that this would be the case, and, indeed, so far, it  has.  </P> <P> Rather than prolong the process, Mr. Sheriff, why not just say the G-word and  the L-word and prove you mean what you claim to say?  </P> <P> BILL WUZZY SPAULDING  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

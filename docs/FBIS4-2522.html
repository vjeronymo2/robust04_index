			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Ping; from the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] At a recent international seminar in Kunming on  copyright protection and economic and cultural development in  Asia, this reporter learned that China has made major progress  in protecting intellectual property rights. China has  preliminarily brought in line with international practices its  own legal system regarding copyright protection, thus showing  that China has basically established a copyright system.    Since last year, the State Copyright Administration and  local  copyright administrations have formulated and perfected a series  of regulations and operating procedures governing copyright  administration. At the same time, they have strictly enforced  relevant laws on copyrights and have cracked down on all kinds  of serious copyright infringement cases. Over the past year,  while investigating and dealing with a batch of key copyright  infringement cases concerning foreigners, the State Copyright  Administration took disciplinary actions against 11 domestic  units and individuals.    Modern copyright protection systems such as the collective  copyright administration system and the copyright agent system  have been established and gradually perfected in China. The  Chinese Association for Music Copyrights has gradually  standardized its operations. The Chinese Transaction Center for  the Payment of Copyright Use has scored preliminary results and  has effectively protected the legitimate rights and interests of  more than 300,000 authors. At present, 16 copyright agencies  have been set up and authorized to serve as a bridge for  introducing Chinese works to overseas markets and for bringing  excellent foreign works into China.    Since promulgating the Copyright Law in September 1990,  China  has signed major copyright conventions, including the Bern  Convention, the World Copyright Convention, and the Phonographic  Record Convention, and it has established ties with more than  100 countries to protect mutual copyrights.</p>

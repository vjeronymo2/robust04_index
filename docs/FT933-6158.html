			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Red Cross to toughen stand over war crimes MR Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, warned yesterday that modern warfare would descend into 'absolute chaos' if governments did not stop violations of humanitarian law. Opening a three-day conference in Geneva on the protection of war victims, Mr Sommaruga stressed that signatories of the 1949 Geneva conventions and the 1977 protocols protecting non-combatants were committed not only to upholding the rules themselves but to ensuring others also did so. The ICRC and the Swiss government, depositary state for the conventions, called the conference at a time of mounting violations of international humanitarian law. Red Cross and United Nations aid officials have described the fighting in former Yugoslavia as the most savage in recent memory, but many other conflicts reveal a similar picture of carnage and brutality. The ICRC is particularly alarmed by two new developments: the targeting of civilians as a war objective and the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts, including attacks on aid workers and contempt for the Red Cross emblem. Ministers and officials from some 160 countries attending the conference are expected tomorrow to endorse a declaration backing outside intervention to prevent violations of humanitarian law and supporting UN moves to establish a permanent war crimes tribunal. The ICRC, which monitors the Geneva conventions, admits it faces a paradox. While urging signatory states to enforce the conventions, it maintains a neutral stance that prevents it from exposing specific wrongdoing or giving evidence to a war crimes tribunal. 'If they thought we were there to collect information they would not allow us to fulfil our mandate,' Mr Sommaruga said recently. However, this policy is being debated within the ICRC, which has been stung by criticism that it was slow to reveal the existence of detention camps in Bosnia. Another paradox is that many of those involved in current, mainly civil, wars are not attending the conference. Invitations went only to UN members and observers.</p>

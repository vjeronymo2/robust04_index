			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Shares in top Adsteam offshoots are suspended THE AUSTRALIAN Stock Exchange yesterday suspended shares in the three top Adelaide Steamship companies, Adsteam, David Jones and Tooth and Co, pending further information on the confused position of their proposed reconstruction. On Wednesday, Adsteam called off its ambitious ADollars 6bn (USDollars 4.6bn) reconstruction in which the companies were to be merged, stating there was 'little or no equity' for shareholders. The merger of these three technically insolvent companies would have brought together their three-way ownership of the profitable Industrial Equity which owns Australia's most successful retailer, Woolworths. The position of the banks, owed ADollars 6bn, and the chairman of the committee overseeing the proposed merger, Mr David Crawford, of KPMG Peat Marwick, was still unclear yesterday after strong rumours that Mr Crawford would take over the group as a court-appointed administrator. Unconfirmed reports yesterday suggested that the banks were inclined to return to the merger proposal abandoned the day before by the group. The suspension of the Adsteam shares, however, shows just how far these companies have fallen. Last year, when the exchange threatened to suspend trading in the shares after the group resisted a stock exchange demand for a consolidated balance sheet, former managing director Mr John Spalvins threatened to make massive legal claims. The exchange backed away. Mr Spalvins was 'terminated' by his board in March when the group was obliged to announce a half-year loss totalling ADollars 3.7bn, mainly through write-downs in the value of group cost shareholdings. The dramatic fall from grace of this once powerful industrial conglomerate, which was Australia's largest food producer and second largest employer, has been a traumatic experience for the investment community. The All Ordinaries Index dropped 12.6 points yesterday on the news of the abandonment of the Adsteam merger plan. Yet, there would be few Australian investors who would not remember the rapid rise of Adelaide Steamship under the stewardship of its fresh-faced chief executive, Mr Spalvins, who transformed the sleepy Adelaide tugboat operator into a formidable investment company from 1980 onwards. Mr Spalvins introduced a new philosophy to the Australian corporate sector as he voraciously acquired under-performing companies and turned them into cash boxes after selling their assets. He emerged from the corporate backwater of Adelaide in 1980 to acquire the upmarket department store chain known as David Jones in an audacious share market raid. With the dust barely settled, Mr Spalvins turned his guns on the struggling brewery group Tooth and Co, which he rapidly acquired before selling the main brewery assets to rival brewer Carlton and United Breweries.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GENIUS OF BELLINI THE ELDER  </P> <P> Integral to the pleasures of this season are the sumptuous art books with which  publishers tempt the holiday shopper. One of the best of this year's treasure  trove is THE GENIUS OF JACOPO BELLINI: The Complete Paintings and Drawings  (Harry N. Abrams: $195; 496 pp.), an extraordinary achievement for which both  author and publisher deserve praise. Colin Eisler offers an extensive, urbane  and richly nuanced text that elucidates the 581 high-quality reproductions.  Clarifying Jacopo's artistic contributions and providing insight into the  context and content of individual works, this lavish volume is an exemplary  vehicle for restoring this influential painter to his rightful status among the  paramount artists of the early Renaissance.  </P> <P> Though he is generally acknowledged to be the founding father of Venetian  Renaissance painting, Jacopo Bellini (c. 1400-c.1470) has been overshadowed by  his heirs. The existing literature focuses on his sons, Gentile and Giovanni,  and his son-in-law, Andrea Mantegna. They exploited Jacopo's legacy so  successfully that his work was substantially neglected. Although Jacopo enjoyed  the patronage of the church, state, and patricians of Venice, today only about  40 paintings (including one gem recently acquired by the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art) are attributed to him in the catalogue raisonne appended to this  volume. This situation, combined with the paucity of documents (also published  in an Appendix), accounts for the somewhat uneven character and frequent  recourse to conjecture in Eisler's introductory survey of Jacopo's 50-year  career.  </P> <P> If the paintings provide an insubstantial armature for an overview, remarkable  evidence of Jacopo's genius survives in two sketchbooks preserved today in the  British Museum, London, and the Louvre in Paris. They are almost unique  examples of the portfolios vital to an active quattrocento workshop and their  298 drawings constitute the largest cohesive representation of early  Renaissance draughtsmanship. The reader's access to this fragile material has  been facilitated by modern technology. The now muted beauty of the leadpoint  London drawings has been almost magically revealed by infrared photography; new  color photography enhances our appreciation for the exquisite intricacy of the  Paris sheets, drawn as they are in a most delicate medium, silverpoint on  vellum, with some subsequent ink embellishment.  </P> <P> Considered together, the albums reveal Jacopo's influential fusion of the  Byzantine and Gothic traditions prevailing in Venice with the new classicism  emerging in Florence. In the Paris book Jacopo "cherishes the wisdom of the  panorama and revels in chivalric narrative" whereas the "breakthroughs of the  early Renaissance" achieved through an "intense understanding and unrivaled  exploration of landscape and cityscape" are revealed in the London volume.  </P> <P> Unlike previous scholars who discuss the drawings chronologically, Eisler  examines them thematically, studying Jacopo's successive versions of such  traditional subjects as "St. Jerome in the Wilderness" and "St. George and the  Dragon." This strategy enables the author to trace the emergence of a new  pictorial language in landscape, portraiture, the nude, and architectural  rendering while his exegesis of individual images reveals much that is  distinctive in Venetian iconography. In addition, Eisler's allusions to social,  political, and related artistic developments (e.g., scenography and  perspective) can be explored by reference to the extensive footnotes.  Suggestive appendices invite further speculation on Jacopo's contribution to  manuscript illumination and printmaking.  </P> <P> Though he implies that Jacopo effected a revolution in Venetian painting by  harmonizing the Gothic and Classical in altarpieces of humane piety and  landscapes that can inspire acts of spiritual or physical courage, Eisler  refrains from summarizing the significance of Jacopo's career, and this is  perhaps the wisest decision. If specific elements of Jacopo's accomplishment  were carried to fruition by Gentile Bellini and Mantegna, the limited surviving  work suggests that the full scope of Jacopo's innovative genius may be  understood only in the lyrical paintings of Giovanni Bellini.  </P> <P> "The Genius of Jacopo Bellini" will certainly become the standard monograph on  this important artist and it is therefore an essential acquisition for  libraries. However, because the drawings especially are endlessly fascinating,  it is to be regretted that the understandably exorbitant price will inhibit all  but the most ardent from having a copy at home for perpetual delectation.  </P> <P> Although no comprehensive catalogue raisonne of the work of Giovanni Bellini  (Jacopo's son) has yet appeared in English, Rona Goffen has written a useful  new book on this influential Italian artist, a welcome addition to the  literature on quattrocento painting.  </P></p>

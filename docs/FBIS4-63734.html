			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 21, May 16-22 </F> 94]    [Text]  <H5>  Generation Potential </H5>   Ukraine's electricity generation potential lies primarily in  nuclear (NPP's) and fuel-fired (FFP's) powerplants with  hydro-electric plants (HEP's) operational during peak  consumption hours to preclude frequently drops below the  critical 49.5 kHz mark.    The Ukrainian Ministry for power industry has 294  enterprises  under its command, including 42 power plants and 88 enterprises,  which service power and heat transmission lines. Supply of  electric power to consumers is effected via 615 regional  networks including 493 networks in rural areas of Ukraine.    The total length of Ukraine's aerial and cable transmission  lines amounts to 1,014,342 km including 951,604 km of aerial  high-voltage transmission lines and 62,738 km of ground cable  lines. Ukrainian power lines' maximal voltage is set at 800 kV.  There are about 2,047,000 transformer substations in Ukraine  with an aggregate power of 197,062 MVA.    Power Generation   (According to the Ministry of power industry)   (Billion kWh)   Yrs     Total    Including                    FFP's    Percent    HEP's    Percent    NPP's    Percent   1990    298.5    211.6    70.9       10.7     3.6        76.2     25.5   1991    278.6    191.6    68.8       11.9     4.3        75.1     26.9   1992    252.6    170.8    67.6       8.1      3.2        73.7     29.2   1993    230.2    143.8    62.4       11.2     4.9        75.2     32.7      Ukraine's NPP's generated a total of 75.2 MWe including 27.5  MWe by the Zaporozhye NPP, 11.8 MWe by the Rovno NPP, 5.8 MWe by  the Khmelnitski NPP, 12.6 MWe by the Chernobyl NPP and 17.5 MWe  by the South-Ukrainian NPP.    Ukraine's largest fuel-fired power plants are located in  Zaporozhye, Uglegorsk, Krivoi Rog and Burshtynsk.    Electric power generation started shrinking back in 1991,  accompanying Ukraine's total production slump. Reductions in  power generation have been, since then, mirroring rather pro  rata the dropping power consumption by industrial enterprises,  forced to curtail production and thus economize on electricity  in view of their products' too low competitiveness, due, among  numerous other reasons, to excessive power consumption per unit  of produce.    According to the Ministry of power industry, in 1993 Ukraine  exported 2.7 MWe, though before 1990 it used to annually export  as much as 30 MWe. As Vasiliy Protsenko, a deputy agency  superintendent with the Ministry, maintains, the sharply reduced  power export by Ukraine has been caused by the West's excessive  power generation at much lower costs and prices. Thus,  purchasing prices have dropped from 5.1 cents to 2.3 cents pr  kW, while Ukrainian electric power generation costs average 2.55  per kW.    The Ministry's forecast for 1994 is none too optimistic.  Though the State Order prescribes to generate 134 billion kWh  by Ukraine's fuel-fired power plants, not over 113.5 billion kWh  will be actually generated by them. Similarly, Ukrainian HEP's  will likely reduce their generation to the 9.46 MWe mark, and 70  MWe is expected to be generated by the Ukrainian nukes.    In addition to Ukrainian industrial enterprises' shrinking  consumption shortages of fuels will most certainly contribute to  the predicted power generation drop.  <H5>  Fuel's Break-Down in Electric Power Generation and Heat </H5> Energy Production    Ukraine's fuel-fired power plants rely on coal, oil fuel and  natural gas. Total power and fuel consumption amounted to 55.6  million tons of conditional fuel, of which coal accounted for  26.2 million tons (44 per cent), oil fuel's share was 6.5  million tons (or 11 per cent), while natural gas and  hydro-electric power accounted for respectively 23.1 (38.8 per  cent) and 3.7 (6.2 per cent) million tons of conditional fuel.  Physical amounts of fuels consumed by power plants were 42.9  million tons of coal, 4.8 million tons of oil fuel, and 20.2  billion cu. m. of natural gas.    According to Mr. Protsenko, in 1993 Ukraine imported 6  million tons of coal, basically from Russia, though this year  coal imports are expected to drop to 1 million tons, primarily  due to shortages of Russian rubles. The forecast shortages of  coal and oil fuel are estimated at 2.3 million tons and 2.9  million tons, respectively.    Before 1990, the Ukrainian power industry's annual oil fuel  requirements averaged 18 million tons. Presently, the figure is  reduced to 3.8 million tons, since 50 per cent of power  generating units are idle.    During the summer season's 30 per cent reduction in power  consumption fuel-fired power plants rely on oil fuel and natural  gas to save 800,000 to 1 million tons of coal for the  fall-winter period.    Fuel shortages threaten with emergency situations, since the  circuit's frequency drop below the critical threshold of 49.5  kHz will result in the circuit's collapse. In view of this  circumstance, the Ministry of power industry has to urgently cut  off power supply to some consumers. In this way, about 3,000  Ukrainian enterprises are daily cut off from power supply for  brief periods.    Ukrainian NPP' consumed about 24 million tons of conditional  fuel in 1992.  <H5>  Power Industry's Financial Standing </H5>   Presently, Ukraine's industrial enterprise-clients owe 9.5  trillion krb. to the Ministry of power industry. The latter's  indebtedness is estimated at 9.8 trillion krb. including 1.525  trillion krb. for coal, 1.469 trillion krb. for oil fuel, and  1.952 trillion krb. for natural gas.    According to Mr. Turos, the Ministry's agency  superintendent,  the government's credits, which were granted in late March to  the Ministries of Industry and engineering, MIC and conversion  to enable their enterprises to repay their indebtedness for  fuels, were channeled elsewhere, so the debt to the Ministry of  power industry was not repaid. As Ivan Magda, Deputy Minister  for power industry, asserts, the Ministry is a virtual bankrupt,  while its debtors repay only 50 per cent of their daily debts.    According to the Ministry's experts, the too low electric  power tariff, which was set on January 1, 1994, is the major  reason of the power industry's dire financial straits.  <H5>  Ukrainian Power Plants' Set Capacities and Internal Power </H5> Consumption, as of 1 January 1994    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Entities                 |Set capacities           |Internal power consumpti-|  |                         |                         |on                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine's national power |Total -- 52.21; Includin-|33.11                    |  |system                   |g: FFP's -- 34.7, HEP's -|                         |  |                         |- 4.7, NPP's -- 12.82    |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Associations Vinnitsaene-|Total -- 3.57; Including:|2.25                     |  |rgo                      | FFP's -- 1.84, HEP's -- |                         |  |                         |0.73, NPP's -- 1.00      |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dneproenergo             |Total -- 16.81; Includin-|7.64                     |  |                         |g: FFP's -- 8.93, HEP's -|                         |  |                         |- 2.88, NPP's -- 5.00    |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Donbassenergo            |Total -- 12.96; Includin-|7.66                     |  |                         |g: FFP's 12.96           |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kievenergo               |Total -- 6.76; Including:|4.62                     |  |                         | FFP's -- 3.72, HEP's -- |                         |  |                         |1.05, NPP's -- 2.00      |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Krymenergo               |Total -- 0.375; Includin-|1.3                      |  |                         |g: FFP's -- 0.375        |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lvovenergo               |Total -- 5.11; Including:|3.13                     |  |                         | FFP's -- 3.26, HEP's -- |                         |  |                         |0.032, NPP's -- 1.82     |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Odessaenergo             |Total -- 3.36; Including:|2.8                      |  |                         | FFP's -- 0.35, HEP's -- |                         |  |                         |0.0035, NPP's -- 3.00    |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kharkovenergo            |Total -- 3.27; Including:|3.7                      |  |                         | FFP's -- 3.27, HEP's -- |                         |  |                         |0.0048                   |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Ukraine's FFP's operate 104 power generating units including  8 of 720 to 800 MWe capacity, 42 of 282 to 300 MWe capacity,  five power generating units of turbine capacity of 250 MWe, 43  turbines of 175 to 210 MWe and six turbines of 150 MWe capacity.    Presently, about a half of the above eight associations'  power generating units have to remain idle, Mr. Turos disclosed.  <H5>  Ukraine's Electric Power Consumption Break-Down in 1993 </H5>   A total of 227.2 MWe was supplied to consumers in 1993, of  which 16.8 MWe was used for internal consumption and 22.5 MWe  was lost via heat emission by transmission lines.

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Cedras to meet Haitian PM MR Robert Malval, prime minister of Haiti, and Gen Raoul Cedras, the head of the army, will meet today in an effort to end the country's political crisis, five days before the scheduled, but unlikely, return of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president. In a meeting on Saturday between Mr Malval and Gen Cedras, the army leader said he was willing to step down to allow the president's return, but he and other military officers wanted parliamentary ratification of a general amnesty for all who led and supported the coup against Mr Aristide two years ago. Gen Cedras also repeated the army's desire for a broader-based government to include civilian supporters of the coup. Mr Malval had indicated a willingness to compromise on this, but Mr Aristide's aides have raised objections. Mr Dante Caputo, the UN mediator, said on Saturday he had received from pro-military parliamentarians 'important' new proposals for ending the crisis. Diplomats said yesterday that the proposals coincided with the demands which Gen Cedras is making of Mr Malval.</p>

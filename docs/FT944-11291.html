			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Lloyd's capacity forecast to shrink The underwriting capacity of Lloyd's of London will shrink next year - in spite of the injection of fresh capital from corporate investors, according to Mr Peter Middleton, the insurance market's chief executive. Lloyd's authorities are expected to begin work next year on a three-year business plan, to start in 1996. They hope that 1996 and 1997 will mark a decisive revival in the market's prospects after the heavy losses reported in recent years. Mr Middleton said Lloyd's had to make substantial progress in cost control if it was to ride out an anticipated downturn in insurance rates. He hinted that the trend towards direct policy writing would lead to a review of the market's relationship with its brokers. He added that one of the most decisive events would involve Newco - the company Lloyd's has set up to take over outstanding liabilities on old policies, particularly US asbestosis and pollution claims dating from the 1940s. Mr Middleton envisages putting the 1985 and prior liabilities into Newco at the end of 1995. He said the other 'open years' - 1986 and later - would be put into Newco at the end of 1996. Lloyd's leaders believe that if Newco is successful, corporate capital could be attracted back to a trouble-freed Lloyd's. That scenario, however, also assumes a settlement is reached with the loss-making Names seeking compensation in court. Mr Middleton said applications had been made by about 30 corporate vehicles to enter the market next year. But investors' appetites have waned, with shares in most quoted Lloyd's companies trading below listing price. Mr Middleton forecast corporate investment next year would be only about Pounds 250m more than the Pounds 900m committed in 1994 (the first in which corporate capital was allowed). Under Lloyd's rules determining the amount of business being underwritten, that should increase capacity by about Pounds 500m. But an estimated 1,000 Names have resigned and others are expected to reduce their underwriting in 1995. Thus total capacity is forecast by Mr Middleton to fall to between about Pounds 9.25bn and Pounds 9.5bn from Pounds 10.9bn in 1994.</p>

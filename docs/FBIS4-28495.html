			<p>CSO     [Text] Mazda revealed a new restructuring policy on 27 May.  Considering that hiring of university graduates in the spring of  1995 and 1996 will in principle be zero, it will accelerate  personnel reductions and condense fixed costs. Along with making  a 30-percent reduction by gradually reorganizing existing  vehicle classes with full model changes implemented in the  future, Mazda will increase the ratio of shared parts with old  models to over 50 percent, and proceed with large-scale cost  reductions. Making these take root, it will turn to an ordinary  surplus in fiscal 1995, and thereafter, it is prepared to aim at  "a management constitution capable of paying dividends even with  a 70-percent operation" (Vice President Makoto Miyaji).    For the new-graduate hiring program, it had worked out zero  university graduate hiring in the spring of 1995, but the policy  is to continue this in the spring of 1996 also. In the plan to  reduce employees from 30,000 to 27,000 in the three-year period  from 1993 to 1995, no more than a total of 60 university  graduate BA's and BS's were hired this spring. Zero hiring for  two consecutive years is unusual, even in the auto industry.    To decrease the cost of vehicles, it is promoting in the  mid-  to long-term 1) a 30-percent reorganization of existing car  classes (26 classes), 2) 30-percent reduction in platforms (17  types) which are the basic frame of the vehicle, and 3) making  the parts diversion from old models to new models over 50  percent. In particular, it will review existing methods from the  vehicle planning stage and have drastic cost goals, with the  idea to "aim at a profit improvement of 10 percent more than for  existing cars."    Regarding reorganization of sales channels, which has become  an urgent task, it will maintain the present five-channel  system, but improve earnings by reorganization of stores in  important sales regions and expanding the "combined sales  system" of selling the same car classes in several channels.    Regarding their relationship with Ford Motor of the United  States, it considers it "an important key supporting business in  the mid- to long-term" and is studying joint development,  reciprocal adaptability of parts, and joint enterprises overseas.    Furthermore, in the short term, at the same time as  proceeding with a move up in cost decreases such as VA (value  analysis) and VE (value engineering) activities, it will hold  the amount of facilities investment for the time being to under  50 billion yen a year. The policy also is to expand the  reduction scale for the personnel reduction of 3,000 people in  the plan by rationalization of plants.    The goal is to have a constitution which can pay dividends  even with 70-percent operation (production capability of 1.1  million cars per year) in the next three to four years.</p>

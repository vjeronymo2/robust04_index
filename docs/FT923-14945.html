			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A stirring tale of Essex enterprise - Suzanne Askham talks to two men who built a successful vending company SIT BACK. Let me tell you the story of how Gary Klein has made a success of selling millions of cups of coffee, such as the one you are about to drink, to businesses in the Midlands and south-east England. Thirteen years ago Gary Klein was selling coffee machines for a vending company. He began to think, in the way of would-be entrepreneurs: 'Why am I doing this for someone else, when I could be doing it for myself?' A junior sales colleague, Steven Murray, shared his views. Together they resigned from their jobs and founded Bru-Stir Services. They planned to provide high-quality coffee products to offices, with the added sweetener of good service. 'And that,' says Klein, 'is when our problems began.' Initially, they operated from a tiny room in Klein's home in Essex. They borrowed the small capital required - Pounds 3,000 - from Klein's mother, and split the ownership of the company 70/30 in Klein's favour, paying themselves little or no salary. 'I wouldn't go to a bank,' he explains. 'None would lend to me, I believed.' Most of the capital was spent on stock - coffee, creamers, cups - and the two partners proceeded to do what they knew best: selling. Klein now realises that their sales background led to a peculiar crisis in the first year. 'We had intended to sell table-top coffee dispensers (these look like half-sized vending machines), just as we had been doing in our old company, and have a few smaller brewing machines to fall back on for those customers who didn't want to invest in such a big machine. 'But we quickly found we were getting much more business from the coffee brewers, which turned our cashflow projections upside down.' The problem was this: the big machines were supposed to sell for Pounds 400, which would bring back cash quickly to Bru-Stir. But the more popular coffee brewers were not being sold, but lent; the idea, borrowed from America, was to let a client have a free brewer for as long as it continued to buy coffee from Bru-Stir. Although highly popular, it meant that Bru-Stir was spending about Pounds 150 per machine, and waiting perhaps 30 months before the coffee sold to supply it, at a profit of Pounds 5 per box of coffee, finally paid for the brewer. The problem got so bad that the two cut their salaries from Pounds 100 a week to Pounds 50, and Klein borrowed an additional Pounds 2,000 from his mother. Ironically, the turnover for the first year up to August 1980 was a healthy Pounds 38,800, but the profit was nil. Murray decided to sell his shares back to Klein for a much-needed cash sum of Pounds 2,000, but he continued to act as a partner. From this difficult beginning the business grew slowly but sturdily - the machines began to pay from themselves. In 1982, turnover was Pounds 131,500. Bru-Stir moved into a small office in Islington, then a slightly larger one, and, two years later, to bigger premises in Gants Hill, near Ilford, Essex. The 21-year lease with three-yearly rent reviews was going for Pounds 3,500, and for this, unusually, Klein approached his bank, National Westminster Bank, for a loan. 'We had to sign personal guarantees. It was a real performance.' Staff were being added gradually, first a driver and an office worker, and then more, to a current total of 46. The Gants Hill office proved too small, because Klein's philosophy of organic growth - 'the business has to pay for everything - and that includes the fleet of vans and cars, I don't believe in contract hire; and we have never had a bank overdraft' - was finally reaping profits. In 1985 turnover was Pounds 417,000, and in 1986 it reached Pounds 782,000. Coffee was making up about 55 per cent of the business, with teas, cups and hygiene products responsible for the rest. From the total, Klein was aiming for a return of at least 30 per cent. In 1987 turnover passed Pounds 1m and Bru-Stir moved to its current spacious property in Dagenham, Essex; 18,000 sq ft plus grounds. In a canny deal, Klein bought the 105-year head lease with 21-year rent reviews for around Pounds 140,000 on a bank loan. The company now pays Pounds 15,000 a year rent - less than its rates. Credit control is successfully dealt with in-house, and Bru-Stir is now concentrating on better marketing and advertising, particularly on its own brand of coffee, Noble Tree, which was launched in January this year. Turnover in 1991 was Pounds 2.8m, and the growth looks set to continue. Murray has bought back 10 per cent of the shares. The company has set up an office in Nottingham, taking over a failed concern, and is open to more acquisitions. 'I believe the best thing in a recession is to grow, so you're not too lean when it's over,' says Klein. 'But we'll never do it by spending more than we can afford. I like to sleep at nights.' He is not the sort to let coffee keep him awake. Bru-Stir Services, Bru-Stir House, Freshwater Rd, Dagenham, Essex RM8 1RW. Tel: 081-597-2632.</p>

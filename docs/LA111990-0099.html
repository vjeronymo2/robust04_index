			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MEANWHILE, AT HOME: Obscured for the moment by the "Keating Five" hearings in  Washington (D2), state prosecutors today will restore part of the securities  fraud indictment against Charles H. Keating Jr., former owner of failed Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. . . . An L.A. judge set aside 22 counts earlier  this month, the only bright spot so far for Keating. But prosecutors plan to  restore those and add several more accusations of lying to state officials.  James S. Granelli and Lanie Jones  </P></p>

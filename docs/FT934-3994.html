			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Italy's former communists win the day with tactical strength Mr Achille Occhetto could well afford to smile and indulge in superlatives as he watched the performance on Sunday night of his Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) in local elections. In Sunday's second round of voting, the PDS was confirmed as the one party with a solid national base, capable of moulding electoral alliances up and down the country. The PDS-dominated alliances made a clean sweep of the five major cities where polling took place - Genoa, Naples, Rome, Trieste and Venice. In the 129 towns with over 15,000 inhabitants the PDS and its allies captured 53 administrations. 'It is an extraordinary result,' said the 57-year-old politician who was instrumental in winding up the old Italian Communist party (PCI) and founding the social democrat-based PDS. 'This is the triumph of a strategy (of alliances), not just for the PDS but for all progressive forces.' Mr Occhetto has convincingly demonstrated a party need not obtain the most votes to be influential. Organisation and an ability to form a consensus round a local candidate and programme are just as important. Under the new system for local elections, approved in March, Italy switched to directly electing mayors in a first-past-the post system with a second round run-off in the absence of an absolute majority. Curiously parliament rejected the French-style run-off in the majority vote system agreed in August for general elections. Nevertheless, both new systems encourage a polarisation of the electorate - at least towards two blocks or coalitions. This polarisation has now begun, even if political formations are far from complete. As a result of Sunday's local elections and the November 21 first round, the PDS has clearly staked a claim to be the central force in a broad leftist alliance to fight the next general elections, likely before the end of March. With this head start, it must seem at this stage to be the most likely nucleus of a future government. The PDS gained the single largest number of votes in very few of the weekend's local elections, which affected 428 councils. However, it was the best organised, and the most capable of finding mayorial candidates that enjoyed a consensus among potential PDS allies. Only one of the mayoral candidates in the five big cities was a formal PDS member, Mr Antonio Bassolino in Naples. The others were independents sympathetic to the party (Mr Adriano Sansa in Genova, Mr Riccardo Illy in Trieste and Mr Massimo Cacciari in Venice) or members of other parties - as with Mr Francesco Rutelli, the Green mayor of Rome. The PDS used strategic alliances in last June's local elections, when the new electoral laws were first tested. But the need for alliances appeared less necessary at that time. Most commentators and politicians believed the future political geography of Italy would be, in broad terms, a north controlled by the populist League of Mr Umberto Bossi, the centre dominated by the PDS and the south a fiefdom of the long ruling Christian Democrats. The latest local elections witnessed the collapse of the Christian Democrat vote and of their long ruling allies, the Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. Their supporters, long labled the centrist vote, moved in broad blocks, either towards the PDS and its allies on the left, or to the League and to the neo-fascist MSI on the right. Both the League in the north, and the neo-fascist MSI in the centre and south have now demonstrated they can obtain up to a third of the vote on their own. But without alliances this will only lead to local power. Mr Bossi could well have won Genoa, Trieste and Venice if the League had not stood alone. In his first comments yesterday, Mr Bossi recognised that if he was to become a true national political figure he had to search actively for allies. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, seems convinced he can arrange a marriage with Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader now emerging as a principal contender to mop up the centrist vote. The two are improbable bedfellows but they might be able to make a marriage of necessity - Mr Bossi needs to forge allies south of the River Po and Mr Segni would be enormously strengthened by the League's support in the north. As for the MSI, the movement has performed better than even its wildest expectations of a month ago. Mr Gianfranco Fini, its 41-year-old leader, provided an exceptionally strong challenge for mayor of Rome. Although neither he nor his Neopolitan colleague, Ms Alessandra Mussolini, managed to wrest control of Rome and Naples, the MSI has become a big player as a result of the collapse of the Christian Democrats and Socialists. If Mr Fini can soften the movement's image and remove its fascist overtones, the MSI could attract permanently many disillusioned Christian Democrat voters. For the moment these are on loan.</p>

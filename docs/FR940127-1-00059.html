			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Service seeks information on the status of and trade in the various populations/subspecies of the urial distributed from northwest India, through Pakistan (except for the extreme northern portion), Afghanistan (except for the extreme northeast portion), western Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, to northern and eastern Iran. The Service may propose listing any or all of these populations in Appendix I or Appendix II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Box Turtles (Terrapene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 1992 (COP8), the New York Zoological Society submitted a proposal to the Service for its consideration, to add the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (box turtles) to Appendix II, while retaining  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. coahuila <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Aquatic box turtle, or Coahuilan box turtle) in Appendix I. The Service initially considered submitting this proposal for consideration at COP8, but decided not to due to a lack of trade data. The Service is now considering submitting this proposal, based on both biological information and trade information from the Service's Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS). While a separate code for data entry of information on trade in specimens of this genus was provided after COP8, the Service's records of exports and imports in LEMIS for species not listed in the CITES appendices are to be considered as a minimum for the numbers of specimens in trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is comprised of four species ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. carolina, T. coahuila, T. nelsoni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. ornata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), with 11 recognized subspecies;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. coahuila <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is already listed in Appendix I. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene nelsoni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has a very small and fragmented range on the west coast of Mexico.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene ornata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ranges over large sections of the midwestern United States and the Great Plains, from Texas north to southern South Dakota, and eastward to Indiana.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene carolina <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the most widely distributed species of box turtle, and is found from Canada to Mexico; its range is from Maine southward to Florida, and westward through southern Canada to Michigan, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Although widespread, the species is reported to be rare or extinct in parts of its range in Maine, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Ontario, and declining elsewhere in its range. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Box turtles are long-lived and slow-growing, with low annual reproductive output and late onset of sexual maturity (10&hyph;20 years). They also have high site fidelity, and loss of adults from a population can have a significant detrimental effect on the status of the population. Box turtles are important components of many terrestrial ecosystems. Development activities have increasingly fragmented their habitats. The sale of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. carolina <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T ornata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is restricted in several States, while allowed in others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on Service LEMIS data, 26,817 box turtles were exported from the United States in 1992, and 18,134 were exported in 1993. However, 1993 data are not yet fully entered into the computer system, and are thereby incomplete. These figures represent the number of box turtles reported to the Service as being exported; it is not possible to ascertain how many were removed from the wild. Whether or not this level of international trade in these species is detrimental to populations must take into account the numbers removed from the wild for international trade along with the numbers removed from the wild for other purposes, including but not limited to interstate and intrastate commerce, habitat loss, habitat degradation, disease, and predation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service solicits additional information on population trends, levels of trade, and the affect of trade on population status for review in deciding whether to submit a proposal to include the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Appendix II, while retaining  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. coahuila <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Appendix I. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Copperbelly Water Snake (Nerodia erythrogaster) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The northern subspecies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of this water snake is considered to be threatened. The current distribution of this subspecies is restricted to the lower Ohio River Valley and the lower Wabash River Valley in extreme southwestern Indiana and adjacent Illinois and Kentucky, and in southern Michigan northeastern Indiana, and northwestern Ohio. Due to significant population declines, especially in Michigan, Ohio, and northern Indiana, the subspecies now persists only in scattered, isolated pockets where suitable habitat exists. The total population is estimated approximately 1,530 adults rangewide, with 368 breeding pairs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed rule to list the northern copperbelly water snake as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) was signed by the Service's Director on July 26, 1993. Recently there appear to be indications that this taxon is intercrossing with another subspecies in areas of overlap of the ranges of these two taxa. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Habitat loss and fragmentation are the primary factors threatening the continued existence of the subspecies, but amateur collectors reportedly continue to take snakes from the wild. It is sought because of its rarity, its large size, its unique coloration, and its value in the pet trade. It is reported that an international commercial dealer offered $260 for a breeding pair of northern copperbelly water snakes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is seeking information on the extent and significance of trade in the species, and would consider proposing the entire species for Appendix II if there is sufficient concern about similarity of appearance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WEST GERMAN PRESIDENT WINS 2ND TERM  </P> <P> Richard von Weizsaecker, West Germany's widely admired senior statesman, was  elected Tuesday to a second term as president of the nation that was founded 40  years ago today.  </P> <P> A special federal convention made up of members of the Bundestag, the lower  house of the Parliament, and delegates from the 11 states voted, 881 to 108, to  award the 69-year-old president another five-year term.  </P> <P> He was the first of West Germany's six presidents to run unopposed and had been  endorsed by four of the five political parties represented in the Bundestag.  Only the far-left Greens party opposed him, but it declined to nominate a  candidate as each of the parties in Parliament were entitled to do.  </P> <P> Most of the negative votes were cast by right-wing political figures who have  disagreed with some of Von Weizsaecker's recent decisions that they regarded as  too liberal.  </P> <P> Von Weizsaecker, a member of the Christian Democratic Union, the senior partner  in the government coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, declared after  the vote that he tries to be above party politics without being blandly  neutral.  </P> <P> "My office is open to everyone," he said.  </P> <P> A recent public opinion poll indicated that Von Weizsaecker has the support of  94% of the West German voters. According to political analysts, he is widely  perceived as West Germany's senior statesman.  </P> <P> Rita Suessmuth, president of the Bundestag, said Tuesday at ceremonies in  Bonn's Beethoven Hall: "The president represents our country to other people in  the world. But most of all, he makes it possible for citizens to identify with  our state. We citizens need more than symbols in the form of offices, anthems  and flags. Such symbols only work with personalities that pretend to be  democrats."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wounded in WWII  </P> <P> Von Weizsaecker served in the army in World War II, was wounded three times and  decorated. He won international acclaim in 1985 when, amid the controversy over  then President Ronald Reagan's 1985 visit to the Bitburg military cemetery --  where members of Hitler's elite fighting force, the Waffen SS, are buried -- he  urged Germans to accept responsibility for the Adolf Hitler era and the  Holocaust.  </P> <P> His visit to the Soviet Union in 1987 was credited with helping repair the  damage caused by Kohl's comparison of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  with Hitler's propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, he incurred the wrath of right-wingers by pardoning  repentant German urban terrorists.  </P> <P> Von Weizsaecker's father, Ernst, a professional diplomat, was Hitler's deputy  foreign minister. The elder Von Weizsaecker was sentenced to five years in  prison at the Nuremberg war crimes trial, but he was later pardoned by  then-U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy. Richard von Weizsaecker had helped  defend his father at the trial.  </P> <P> Von Weizsaecker was the Christian Democratic mayor of West Berlin from 1981 to  1984. On assuming the presidency, he withdrew from active politics.  </P> <P> Yet he has made the presidency, largely a ceremonial post with governmental  power centered in the chancellorship, something more than it had been by  traveling widely on official visits and speaking out on humanistic issues.  </P> <P> He will give the keynote speech today at ceremonies marking the formation of  West Germany on May 24, 1949, under the guidance of the victorious Western  allies, the United States, Britain and France.  </P></p>

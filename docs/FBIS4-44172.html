			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Unidentified announcer] Finland, Sweden,  Norway, and Austria signed the European Union [EU] membership  agreement at the EU summit in Corfu about half an hour ago.  According to President Martti Ahtisaari it is important that  the EU develops in the interests of its citizens. Speaking a  little while ago in Corfu at the signing ceremony of the new  members of the EU, President Ahtisaari thought that the greatest  challenge is for the EU to develop in line with the citizens'  wishes.    This is Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's speech in its  entirety:    [Begin Ahtisaari recording] Honored chairman of the Council  of Europe, honored chairman of the Commission, honored chairman  of the European Parliament, honored ladies and gentlemen.    I have great pleasure in witnessing this historic signing  ceremony. This is an important day, not only for Finland and  the other countries seeking membership but also for the history  of the whole of Europe. We have today taken a considerable step  in strengthening the economic and political integration of our  continent. I want to express a warm thank you on behalf of the  Finnish Government to you, Mr. Prime Minister, on the resolute  work the EU under the presidency of Greece has carried out in  bringing the Finnish membership negotiations to a positive  conclusion. I also want to thank other member countries of the  Union, the Commission, and the secretariat of the Union for the  respect shown toward Finland during the negotiations.    We greatly appreciate that the European Parliament, with a  great majority, approved our membership. The negotiations  result reached will offer a good basis for Finland's membership  in the EU. In order to take care -- without big problems -- of  the changes the membership will bring, especially in the  countryside and in the outlying regions in Finland, the Finnish  Government has made a decision on national measures that will  soften the current changes and make the long-term adaptation  easier.    Debate among citizens on membership in the EU has been  lively  in Finland. The debate has brought up, among other things, the  citizens' concerns about the right to take part, about the  preservation of the Nordic way of life, and about environmental  protection.    The EU is a central factor in strengthening the security of  our continent. The security will be enhanced by social  responsibility, interaction between people, respect of human  rights and economic well being. This kind of Europe does not  have economic or social divisions but all states have equal  rights to take part in the integration development. The  expansion of the Union supports the positive development of the  stability of the whole continent. Finland supports the Union's  economic and political aims. Finland's membership would  strengthen the northern dimension of the Union, I am convinced  that this would give the Union extra strength both economically  and politically. It is very important that the Union will  develop to benefit its citizens, according to their conditions.  This is the great challenge in developing the EU in the future.  [passage omitted]    As a member of the EU, Finland wants to give its  contribution  toward its' development. We see the future of the Union as a  tolerant and secure community bringing together the nations and  citizens of the whole continent, where every citizen of the  Union feels that the Union is his or her own. [end recording]    [Announcer] This was President Martti Ahtisaari. [passage  omitted]    The EU membership documents were signed on Finland's behalf  by Prime Minister Esko Aho, Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto,  Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, and Secretary of State  Veli Sundbaeck. The signing means that Finland will become an  active partner in the EU's work, however, without the authority  to make decisions so far. The change will show in the fact that  in the first session of the Corfu summit in the early afternoon,  President Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Aho will sit at the  summit table with the leaders of the EU countries.    It seems so far that President Ahtisaari will have one  bilateral meeting at the Corfu summit. He will have talks in  the afternoon with Austrian President Thomas Klestil. [passage  omitted]</p>

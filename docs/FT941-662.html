			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Inchcape profits hit by yen strength Inchcape shares fell 37p to 515p yesterday after it reported 1993 profits adversely affected by the yen's strength and weak demand in many markets. Investors also took fright at remarks by Sir David Plastow, chairman, suggesting 1994 would be another difficult year. Analysts reduced profit forecasts. Sir David said the weakness of economies in continental Europe and Japan, as well as austerity measures in China, affected demand. Inchcape acts as a distributor and retailer of cars, consumer goods and business products. He said that on average the yen had risen 26 per cent during 1993 against currencies that mattered to Inchcape. Of 1994, Sir David said, 'most of the factors that made 1993 such a challenging year still remain'. He said Inchcape did not expect a marked recovery in the business climate, nor any significant improvement in the currency position. Mr Rod O'Donoghue, finance director, said the unexpected strength of the yen cost the group Pounds 13m, as the beneficial translation effect was more than offset by the impact on Inchcape's sales of Japanese cars. Inchcape said that although Toyota, the main brand it sells, had increased market share around the world, volumes had fallen in many areas. Operating profits from motors rose 7 per cent to Pounds 177.5m thanks to retailing strength. Profits from marketing dropped 7 per cent to Pounds 58.2m. The group won more agencies than it lost, but the ending of the Rolex and Nike franchises had affected profits. Profits from services, such as insurance, shipping, testing and buying, rose 27 per cent to Pounds 53.9m. The group has yet to decide whether to exercise its option to buy Gestetner convertibles which expires on July 1. Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said the cost of taking up the option would be Pounds 41m, which would pay for itself from the interest on the convertibles. With a 14.6 per cent stake already, Inchcape could end up with 23.6 per cent. Profits before tax rose 8.5 per cent on an FRS3 basis to Pounds 271.4m, but were 4.4 per cent higher on a 'normalised' profit of Pounds 263.3m, excluding exceptional items but including property profits which rose from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 10.9m. Earnings per share on an FRS3 basis rose 9.4 per cent to 33.9p while normalised earnings were up 1.6 per cent to 32.1p. A final dividend of 9p (8.35p) makes a total of 14.8p, up 7.6 per cent.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts of interview with Mr. Goh Chok Tong, Singapore </F> Prime Minister, as reported by K.K. Katyal; date and place not  given]    [Text] From a 75-minute intensive question-and-answer  session with a small group of Indian journalists, the Singapore  Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, emerged as a clear-headed  leader. He did not hedge any query, whether palatable or  otherwise. This is evident from the excerpts of the interview,  as reported by K.K. Katyal.    [THE HINDU] A lot of expectations have been aroused by the  planning of the visit to India. I do not know how you look at  it. And how in your opinion, the economic relationship could be  enhanced. So far the tendency in India is to look westward. Now  it is to look eastward. The tendency in your case was to look  eastward. I think you are looking westward now. Could you give  us a general idea of what you expect of your visit?    [Goh] First, I look at the overall picture. Where India's  position is, India stands the risk of being marginalised unless  India opens up much more rapidly than it has done over the last  two years. Europe would be looking more and more inwards. Its  priority is to get the Single European Market going. Western  Europe would also pay much more attention to Eastern Europe  because these countries are neighbours. Western Europe would  want to see that these countries progress so that they will not  destabilise Europe.    In Asia, ASEAN and the East Asian countries are booming. We  have formed APEC. The United States will remain engaged in this  area. The United States itself is not just looking to Asia and  Europe. It is also looking south to Mexico and Chile to AFTA  [expansion not given]. So I ask myself, where does that leave  India? I came to the conclusion that India would also come to  the same conclusion. It must open up and decide how it wishes to  integrate its economy. Would it want to integrate with the West  or with Asia? Perhaps India should try and do both. In the past,  India looked towards the former Soviet Union, and the West, but  India would now see that East Asia would be booming away over  the next 15-20 years. So I think India would also therefore want  to look towards East Asia. Here I see the opportunity where  Singapore can play a part.    [THE HINDU] But Mr. Prime Minister, this question may be put  to you when you are there. We have already embarked on this  process of liberalisation and you must have watched it. What are  your impressions? You talked about opening up, but we are on the  path.    [Goh] The results are actually remarkable. But they have  been  overshadowed by the great interest shown in China's more rapid  growth.    [THE HINDU] By countries of East Asia?    [Goh] By the world. But if you examine the data for India, I  would say they are remarkable. The growth, 1990-1991, was in the  region of 1.4-1.5 per cent. After the opening up, it went up by  more than three times to over 4 per cent per annum. Your foreign  exchange reserves have gone up very rapidly. Foreign investments  have flowed into India. Much slower compared to investments  flowing into East Asia but, nevertheless, in terms of volume,  much more than investments flowing into India over the last 40  years. Inflation has been brought down.    [THE HINDU] Before your visit was finalised, at your  National  Day Rally in August, you spoke of generating "a mild India  fever." Closer to your visit, in what form do you see that  happening?    [Goh] I would want to excite Singapore investors in the  potential of India. I would want to encourage Singapore  investors to jointly invest with Indian businessmen in India,  both for the domestic market, which is huge as well as for the  export market. When Singapore investors go to India, I hope that  they would make at least 25 per cent of their production for the  export market. We also have interest in property development.  But India, of course, has its own rules at the moment which will  not allow foreign investors to buy land in India. I do not know  whether there are possibilities over here. Singaporeans, by and  large, are good in adding values to land, by putting up  industrial facilities, hotels and residential properties. I  would want to explore this area, to see how we can use our  strength in property development in India.    [THE HINDU] When people talk about India and countries like  Singapore going into India, they always compare India with  China, Vietnam, Indonesia or even across the causeway to Johor.  What do you think India has to do to generate the level of  interest as, for example, China, Vietnam and Indonesia?    [Goh] India is a giant which has not realised its own  potential. So India would have to be confident that it can  compete internationally. India would have to face this challenge  and just open up many sectors of its economy to competition,  like what China has done. China, by welcoming foreign investors,  has forced its state enterprises to be more competitive. India  could, likewise, open up its internal economy to external  competition and I believe India can compete. That confidence  India must have in itself. This message, if it comes through  strongly, will excite international interest.    [THE HINDU] Are there any specific problems that Singapore  businessmen have as far as India is concerned?    [Goh] Until recently, India had not opened up. So it was  very  difficult for foreign investors, including Singapore  businessmen, to invest in India. At the moment, there are some  concerns over some bureaucratic rules which hamper investments.  I think these are areas where one has got to learn to negotiate.  These rules are becoming more transparent and simpler.    [THE HINDU] The information technology park project in  Bangalore is encouraging (and sends) positive signals. By  contrast, there is the Madras Corridor project, I do not know  what stage it is in. What are the lessons to be learnt from the  two experiences?    [Goh] The situation is different for both projects.  Bangalore  already has a core activity. When we showed interest in the  industrial park in Bangalore, it was just adding on another  layer to what had been going on. The Madras Corridor is  something new. I would want to have more experience before we  embark further into the Madras Corridor project. It is a huge  project. We would not want to initiate an undertaking unless we  are certain that success will come out of it. So it is on the  back burner for the time being.    [THE HINDU] A question about APEC. This is the region that  the Americas think is the fastest growing. Do you think that  India can, at some stage, become a member or play a role as an  associate member?    [Goh] The question would not arise over the next three  years.  APEC has decided not to consider new applicants for the next  three years. Thereafter, it depends very much on India. If  India's economy is more and more integrated with the Asian  economy and it is also exporting to the United States and buying  from the Americans, then India should certainly be considered as  a potential member. If relations are quite limited, then it is  an academic question.    [THE HINDU] Has there been a change in your perceptions of  India politically and strategically, from the time you were  Defence Minister to now?    [Goh] Yes. Partly because of India's stance on Cambodia and  partly because of India's linkages with the former Soviet  Union... I have to confess that I was a little worried reading  reports of India's acquisition of a blue-water fleet, and  reading the remarks by one of your generals who said that India  intended to stretch its power from Singapore to Africa. Maybe  this was just rhetoric of generals. But when these remarks  appeared in cold print, you ask yourself, "What for?", "Why does  India have to stretch its power from Singapore to Africa?" My  perception has changed. As I got to understand India better, I  saw that India has a legitimate interest to want to have a good  navy to be able to defend its long coastline. Also, India is  opening up and is not spending more on defence.    [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, in this region, Japan and  China are major factors. Do not you think ASEAN and Singapore  need to strengthen the dealings with India so as to restore the  balance in the overall context, both in the security and the  political context? Is there a case for that?    [Goh] Certainly. We see China emerging as a very strong  economic giant in Asia. There is no reason why India should not  develop also into a strong giant. When you have two friendly big  economies in the area, it is going to benefit everybody.    [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, looking at South Asia, is  there any cause for concern when there are tensions between  India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or over this issue about NPT,  etc? On these issues what are your views?    [Goh] We have some concern but they are not big concerns.  Our  linkages in terms of trade and investments are not on a large  scale with that area. It does not really have too high an impact  on our own economy. Politically, the Indians and Pakistanis in  Singapore are now Singaporeans. They are much less affected by  events in India and Pakistan. This would not have been so 30  years ago when Indians and Pakistanis still felt they were part  of India and Pakistan and they would be emotionally caught up.  The key comes down to whether there are emotional links between  the two countries. If there are strong links, when things go  wrong in that part of the world, this would affect us.    [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, going back to APEC and  ASEAN,  one perception is that it should be restricted to cooperation  for economic development among countries of this region. How do  you envisage the relationship between ASEAN and APEC with other  countries in this region? Do you think you are diluting by  making APEC a superstructure and keeping some countries, like  India, out of it?    [Goh] APEC will not be at the expense of ASEAN. ASEAN is an  organisation for countries in the area and we will continue to  explore ways to integrate our economies through the ASEAN Free  Trade Area where tariffs are going to be lowered much faster and  go down to lower levels. APEC enables ASEAN to reach out to  countries with which we have strong links. It also enables us to  get United States to remain constructively engaged in the area.  They complement one another.    India is not kept out. India is not a member because its  interests so far are different. When India begins to have more  trade with APEC member countries, we would be very interested in  bringing India to our forums.    [THE HINDU] Do you think over a period of time, the  leadership will go to the hands of the United States?    [Goh] Of APEC? No, no.    [THE HINDU] Going back to China, Singapore is in a unique  position to assess the evolution of modern China. How do you see  China? Some see it as a benign military power. some see it as a  growing economic power which would take on a forward posture in  the world. How do you read what China is going to be?    [Goh] We take a realistic approach. We see both challenges  and opportunities in China's growth. The opportunities are  obvious. It is a huge market which offers us investments and  trade. The challenges, of course, would be the nagging problem  as to how a big economic power would behave in the future,  whether it would translate into military power or political  power, or a domineering China which wants to dictate other  countries' behaviour. The practical approach is to get China  constructively engaged in the political and economic processes  of the region. In that way, China will understand better the  aspirations and fears of its neighbours. Likewise, the  neighbours of China would also understand better China's  aspirations and problems.    [THE HINDU] It was in this context that I had asked earlier  whether there is a merit in an enhanced relationship with India,  so that it provides a balance vis-a-vis whatever China may be in  the future.    [Goh] I would not want to go into this geopolitics of  balance. I will just simply say that India is a giant with  tremendous potential and if India realises its potential, that  is going to bring benefits for countries in the region. If you  set out to try and encourage India to balance China, you are  creating a huge problem when there is not any.    If India becomes an economic giant, that is in our interest.  Of course we want to engage India in such a way that when India  acquires new weaponry, it will not cause its neighbours to be  overly concerned. Because you are then meshed in with the  economies and interests of your neighbours.    [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, ASEAN is a big success in  the  economic sense and perhaps in the security context also. SAARC  has yet to take off. What are the reasons for these two  developments?    [Goh] I have not done a deep study on SAARC so my  observations may be superficial. I think first, the ASEAN has a  longer history than SAARC. ASEAN is 27 years [old]. SAARC is  only about seven years old.    Secondly, in ASEAN, we have a few middle-income countries.  SAARC is still an association of rather poor members.    Thirdly, whilst several ASEAN countries have always been  outward looking, the members in SAARC, have mainly been inward  looking. In terms of economic strategy, India until recently has  been inward looking. So has Pakistan been. With such an  attitude, where is the scope for regional cooperation? In ASEAN,  Malaysia, Singapore, and, to some extent, Thailand and  Indonesia, have always been outward looking. So there are  therefore benefits and compelling reasons for us to try and link  our economies together so that we can reinforce each other and  grow faster. Also we do not have intractable problems like some  members of SAARC have.    [THE HINDU] Like between India and Pakistan.    [Goh] India and Pakistan.    [THE HINDU] A lot of countries like Singapore seem to have  completely forgiven communist countries for their past, whereas  they have not quite forgiven countries like India which were  friendly with the Communist countries. It is like being more  sinned against than sinning.    [Goh] Where do you get the perception from?    [THE HINDU] From talking to people here.    [Goh] I am very surprised.    [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, even in Japan for instance,  they have not quite forgiven us for being friendly with Soviet  Union at that time. And they still talk about expropriation or  nationalisation which has not happened for 30 years.    [Goh] I think it could be a misconception. China is  different. China is controlled by one party. If the party has  decided to change course, the question we ask ourselves is who  comes after Deng Xiaoping. Would the course be changed? And most  of us have come to the conclusion that economic reforms in China  would not be changed whoever is in charge in ten years' time.  Therefore, there is confidence that the system will continue.  For India, the democratic political processes can produce  somebody who campaigns on the basis of nationalisation. And if  that somebody wins, he is going to nationalise. So we ask  ourselves the same question we are asking ourselves of China,  would reforms in India stay on course.    [THE HINDU] What is your perception?    [Goh] If Prime Minister Rao and Finance Minister Manmohan  Singh have another four or five years, it will stay on course.    [THE HINDU] Taking that argument further, would it be  logical to say that in a situation like India--democracy is a  liability for economic reforms? If there is a possibility of  change in government then reforms cannot stay on course?    [Goh] It depends on the alternatives. If the alternative  viewpoints espoused by the opposition parties are not very  different from the present government, as far as reforms are  concerned then there is no liability. The question is who can do  the job better or faster. But if the opposition espouses another  viewpoint, talk about nationalisation when they come into power.    [THE HINDU] Or anti multi-national...    [Goh] Or anti multi-nationals in this issue. And they look  like coming to power, then of course, nobody is going to invest.  It is not a liability or a strength. I think it depends on the  reality of the situation.    [THE HINDU] There are some unflattering comments about the  functioning of the democratic system here. What do you think  about this?    [Goh] We always go by the market test. They can write what  they want. But the point is national leaders and investors still  seek to talk to us.    [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, if I have to ask a  hypothetical question if you have to look at your crystal ball  and make a prophecy--10 years from now, how do you see  India-Singapore relations?    [Goh] Ten years from now, our trade will increase several  fold. Singapore will have a bigger presence in India. Political  relations will be much warmer and closer than today. And we will  certainly see more Indian leaders visiting Singapore.    [THE HINDU] And more journalists.    (laughter)</p>

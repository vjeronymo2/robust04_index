			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: McCaw's sugar mommy American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Dollars 12.3bn acquisition of McCaw has at least the merit of tidiness. Instead of its original proposal which left McCaw equity lying about in the market, AT&amp;T has swept up the entire cellular company. A straight one-for-one share swap also makes the accounting easy. Yet the deal has the feel of the property scramble which accompanies the first few rounds of a Monopoly game. There are few strategic telecoms properties up for sale around the world, and AT&amp;T has been prepared to dilute its earnings significantly in order to acquire one of them. Still, unless McCaw gives AT&amp;T some access to local telecoms in the longer term, it will prove very difficult to justify the high price paid. Experience with radio phones will doubtless be useful once new technologies such as personal data notepads and multimedia are integrated with cellular telephony. It also gives AT&amp;T another weapon in its armoury of managing company telecom requirements. Yet such advantages will not, by themselves, provide a decent return on the investment. AT&amp;T's strategy seems to be to cast its net across many markets - from computing to radio, Europe to China - in an effort to remain in the forefront of a rapidly evolving information technology business. That may make sense at present, but not even Ma Bell can afford such breadth for long  -as its high gearing and yesterday's dilutive acquisition show. When it narrows its focus, it will do well to remember that owning networks is becoming a commodity business. It is the data which flows through them which is valuable.</p>

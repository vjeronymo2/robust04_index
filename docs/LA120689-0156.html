			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 1 RED CROSS CONCERT CANCELED  </P> <P> Promoters have called off one of two planned disaster relief concerts sponsored  by the American Red Cross because they were unable to line up performers in  time for the scheduled Dec. 17 event in the Charlotte Coliseum.  </P> <P> But the second concert to be held the same night in Los Angeles will go on as  planned. Barry Levine, a concert producer in Los Angeles, said most of the  superstars needed to fill the 25,000-seat arena in Charlotte are in recording  studios, on the road or overseas.  </P> <P> Promoters last week announced that rock stars Bruce Springsteen and David Lee  Roth were among possible acts being booked for the Charlotte concert.  </P> <P> The rock concert was planned in Charlotte to complement a variety production in  Los Angeles. Both events were aimed at raising money to replenish Red Cross  disaster funds drained by Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco-Oakland area  earthquake.  </P> <P> Officials said the Los Angeles concert at Universal Amphitheater will be  carried, possibly by CBS-TV, on that date.  </P></p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Indian banking executives quit FOUR senior executives in India of Citibank, the US bank allegedly involved in the Rs35bn (Pounds 782m) Bombay securities market scandal, have resigned following scrutiny of the bank's role in the affair. The resignations come after wide-ranging probes of Citibank and other institutions involved in the scandal by a parliamentary committee, the central bank, and the US Federal Reserve Board, the securities watchdog which sent a team to Bombay last week. The four men leaving the bank include Mr AS Thiyagarajan, who headed the bank's Indian investment banking operations until he left Bombay late last year. The three others also worked in investment banking, handling the bank's trade in securities on its own account and on behalf of clients in portfolio management schemes. A Citibank spokesman in Bombay confirmed the four men resigned on Saturday. He said there was no link with the Federal Reserve Board team's visit but declined to elaborate. The scandal, which erupted last April, has brought heavy losses to some banks, the resignation of a cabinet minister, and the arrest of about 20 people. Foreign banks, which dominated the inter-bank securities market, have been criticised for pioneering trading techniques which allegedly ran foul of regulations. Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, chairman of the parliamentary investigatory committee, accused foreign banks of initiating the fraud. Bankers said the resignations would prompt renewed demands for the parliamentary committee to investigate Citibank further.</p>

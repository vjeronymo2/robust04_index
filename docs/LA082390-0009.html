			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> EX-CITY MANAGER TAKES SALINAS POST  </P> <P> David Mora, forced to end his tenure as Oxnard city manager July 1 after five  years, has been hired as city manager of Salinas, beating out 13 candidates.  </P> <P> Mora, who was ousted on a 3-2 vote by the Oxnard City Council, will be the  first Latino to hold the $95,000-a-year job of managing Salinas' 550 employees.  </P> <P> Latinos make up about 50% of the population in both Salinas and Oxnard.  </P> <P> Mora, 45, assumes his new job Sept. 10 and may earn up to a $6,000 raise in  salary within six months if the Salinas City Council is happy with his work.  </P> <P> Roy Herte, current city manager of Salinas, said Mora's firing was unimportant.  "As a city manager, it's unusual to find someone who hasn't been fired at one  time or another. When you're at the pleasure of an ever-changing City Council  with a predetermined agenda, it's very easy to be fired. All they have to do is  say they are no longer pleased, and you're looking for a new job." LAURA PITTER  </P></p>

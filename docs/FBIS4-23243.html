			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The authorities in Mali seem determined to follow up  the peace agreement signed earlier this month with the northern  Tuareg rebels by taking tough action to clamp down on the  continued insecurity in the region. The agreement, signed in  Algiers between the Malian Government and the Tuareg Azaouad  movement, called for the dismantling of rebel military bases and  allowed for the integration of former Tuareg rebels into the  Malian Army and civil service. But the armed attacks, often  blamed on bandits, have continued, and now President Alpha  Konare has ordered a security crackdown as Mustapha Sana reports  in this telex from Bamako:    Speaking to representatives of political parties, trade  unions, and associations at a meeting at the presidential  palace, the head of state said he gave orders to restrict the  entry and circulation of weapons in the country. President  Konare said that measures will be taken with the cooperation of  neighboring countries to stem the traffic in arms across the  borders of Mali.    The president also spoke of the northern movement, (Ganda  Koi), which opposes the agreement with the Tuaregs, and which  recently made an appeal to Malians to fight the Tuaregs. He  said he understood the exasperation of the sedentary northern  population from which (Ganda Koi) draws its support but he  stressed that he refused any management of the peace accord on  an ethnic basis. Speaking of insecurity in the north, President  Konare said it was a difficult situation but not a desperate  one. He said he would not tolerate the continuation of that  state of affairs because it prevented the presence of the civil  service in northern Mali and has also impeded development  activities.</p>

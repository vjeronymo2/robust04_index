			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An American search team in the Philippines spotted the wreckage of a missing  F-16 jet fighter in the mountains north of Manila, but the pilot's fate  remained unknown. A U.S. Air Force statement said the wreckage was found by  search planes about 9 miles west of Clark Air Base. The pilot was identified as  Lt. Josh Levin, 30, of Beverly Hills, Calif., who was assigned to the 8th  Tactical Fighter Wing based at Kunsan, South Korea. Ground teams expected to  reach the crash site later today. The plane took off Tuesday from Clark, 50  miles north of Manila, to take part in exercises but failed to rendezvous with  other aircraft.  </P></p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / US links human rights to help for Peru THE CLINTON administration is delaying approval of a multinational financial support package for Peru because of its dissatisfaction with the human rights record of President Alberto Fujimori's government. It is an early indication that the new US government intends to link its foreign aid policy explicitly with human rights and democracy in recipient countries. Officials at Washington's international financial institutions confirmed that recent comments by US officials indicated that policy would link development aid with democratic government and human rights conditions. A State Department official said yesterday that US agreement on financial support has been delayed until the Fujimori government 'complies with certain conditions relating to human rights'. Some of the conditions had already been met, although the spokesman declined to be specific about what the conditions were. However, US officials sought to underline that the linkage is likely to be made less explicitly than it was under the previous Democratic administration of President Jimmy Carter. Mr Jorge Camet, Peru's finance minister, was due to discuss the delay in Washington yesterday with Mr Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary for Latin American affairs in the State Department, and Mr Richard Feinberg, his counterpart on the National Security Council. The financial support package from friendly governments led by the US and Japan was meant to help clear Peru's arrears with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - thereby allowing them to resume lending  - and to provide some finance to cover the country's balance of payments shortfall. Since Mr Fujimori's suspension of the constitution last April, concern has been growing about his autocratic style of government. He had been forced by the Bush administration and the Organisation of American States to hold congressional and local elections last year to guarantee a resumption of aid flows. The human rights conditions are likely to include those relating to reasonable conditions for, and outside access to, prisoners. Last week a furore blew up in Peru about the leak of a tape recording of a supposedly confidential meeting between the International Red Cross and Mr Abimael Guzman, jailed leader of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group. Mr Fujimori also guided ambassadors, including the US ambassador, on a tour of three prisons last week.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Customs &amp; Excise outlines its targets HM CUSTOMS &amp; Excise plans to reduce mistakes in the payment of value added tax - payments that are either under or over - by Pounds 3.3bn during 1993-94, according to its management plan published this week. That compares with estimated gross total receipts of about Pounds 280bn of VAT from traders last year. The target includes the collection of Pounds 1.5bn in net additional liabilities as a result of under-declaration. The management plan, which covers the period 1993-96, includes a detailed strategy setting out the department's objectives for the next five years. Its four commitments are to encourage openness and participation, maximise career opportunities, avoid compulsory redundancies and ensure that in-house bids for those functions to be market tested can compete fairly. It says staff numbers will be reduced by more than 5 per cent a year. The plan says it aims to ensure that three quarters of intra-EC trade by value during the first quarter of this year will be reported by May 31. Ms Valerie Strachan, who chairs the Customs &amp; Excise board, said that there was more stress in the plan on quality of service and on Customs' relationship with the professional and business community. The plan commits Customs to introducing a new pay system and grading structure delegated from centralised pay bargaining by April 1 next year. Other elements of the plan include evaluations over the next year of the movement of goods in the EC, the collection of trade statistics and dealing with travellers and anti-smuggling controls. It requires achieving improved VAT compliance by traders and, visits to all newly registered traders within three years.</p>

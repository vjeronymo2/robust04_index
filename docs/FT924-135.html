			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Donohue may acquire Domtar newsprint mills DONOHUE, the forest products unit of Quebecor, North America's second biggest commercial printer, is considering buying two newsprint mills from Domtar, a struggling pulp and paper group controlled indirectly by the Quebec government. The two mills in the Quebec city area are worth several hundred million dollars. Domtar has modernised them, but wants to concentrate its resources on its other mills in eastern Canada making business and copying papers, fine papers and other products. It is also North America's third largest producer of gypsum wallboard - a business it would like to sell when construction markets recover. 'Nothing is settled until talks are completed,' said Mr Michel Page, president of Donohue and a former senior Quebec cabinet minister. His company is one of North America's lowest-cost producers of newsprint, market pulp and timber products.</p>

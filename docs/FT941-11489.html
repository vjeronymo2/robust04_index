			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Russia acts on unsound banks The Russian central bank has closed down 19 'unsound' banks over the past year and is developing an early-warning system to minimise the risk of future banking crashes. Ms Nadezhda Ivanova, deputy chief of off-site banking supervision, said that liquidation committees were examining the banks' whose licences had been withdrawn to establish what could be recovered by creditors. The central bank, which late last year cracked down on banks which abused its overdraft facility, is a leading creditor. With 2,041 banks as of February 1, Russia's fast growing but highly fragile commercial banking business has been encouraged by exceedingly low minimum capital requirements for setting up a bank. The central bank, however, is now working on raising them. Ms Ivanova said off-site supervision, which examines data sent to the central bank by the banks themselves, was being supplemented by a growing on-site inspectorate. An agricultural support package revealed yesterday carried a price tag of Rbs14,000bn, complemented by an extra Rbs14,000bn to be spent on soft loans for food purchases, and another Rbs6,000bn in loans for farmers, according to Mr Andrei Illarionov, an adviser to the prime minister. This meant that at present exchange rates Russia would spend Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn) on becoming self-sufficient in food, 10 times more than it spent on food imports last year.</p>

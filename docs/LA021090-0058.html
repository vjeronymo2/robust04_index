			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEVINE, DREIER FILL WAR CHESTS WITH $1.5 MILLION  </P> <P> Two California congressmen, Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) and David Dreier (R-La  Verne), possible candidates for the Senate in 1992, have amassed campaign war  chests of nearly $1.5 million each -- making them the leading money-raisers in  the House.  </P> <P> At the end of 1989, Levine had $1,485,734 in the bank and Dreier had  $1,457,087, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.  While Dreier has often been among the leading fund-raisers, it was the first  time Levine's fund-raising has put him in the top ranks.  </P> <P> Most of Levine's fund-raising success during 1989 stemmed from a  $400-per-person dinner he sponsored at the Beverly Hilton last June, which  raised more than $600,000. Overall, he took in $823,252 last year -- the  largest amount raised by any House member.  </P> <P> Dreier raised $156,996 last year, most of it at a single fund-raiser in his  home district. His campaign fund had already exceeded $1 million at the  beginning of 1989.  </P> <P> Only three other House members had campaign treasuries with more than $1  million at the end of 1989. They were Reps. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) with  $1,393,258; Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) with $1,052,336 and Ronnie G. Flippo  (D-Ga.) with $1,012,832.  </P> <P> These funds far exceeded the norm. On average, House members maintained a  balance of $236,174 in their campaign accounts during 1989, according to  calculations made by an organization of consumer advocate Ralph Nader.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, most of the California congressmen who have large campaign  war chests are believed to be eyeing a race for the Senate in 1992, when the  state may see both of its seats available. Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston is up  for reelection in 1992, and the seat held by Republican Sen. Pete Wilson will  also be open if Wilson succeeds in his bid for governor.  </P> <P> Wilson spent more than $16 million to be reelected in 1988, and more than that  is likely to be spent in 1992 by each Senate candidate.  </P> <P> The Californian with the third-biggest campaign fund -- $756,099 -- was Rep.  Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), another potential Senate candidate.  </P> <P> Both Matsui and Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) have indicated that they will  challenge Cranston for the Democratic nomination in 1992. So far, however,  Boxer has only $315,484 in her campaign fund -- putting her at a disadvantage  to potential rivals.  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), who also has indicated an interest in running  for the Senate, had $504,558 in his campaign fund at the end of last year.  </P> <P> Neither Levine nor Dreier has publicly acknowledged being a candidate for the  Senate, although their names are frequently mentioned by activists in their own  parties. In interviews, Levine declined to discuss the subject. Dreier said he  has no plans to seek a Senate seat, even though he is "honored and flattered  that there are a great many people who have asked me to do it."  </P> <P> Levine and Dreier are not expecting any serious opposition for reelection to  the House in November. Traditionally, there are four reasons why incumbents  with no real opposition maintain large campaign funds: to discourage potential  challengers, to run for a higher office, to protect themselves if their  districts are altered in reapportionment, or to supplement their pension.  </P> <P> House members elected before 1980 can pocket excess campaign funds upon  retirement. But neither Levine nor Dreier can keep the money on retirement  because they were elected after 1980.  </P> <P> They said their huge war chests were designed primarily as a hedge against  reapportionment in 1992. Dreier noted that he was forced to run against another  Republican incumbent in 1982 after the last reapportionment.  </P> <P> "I said then, 'Let's concentrate on trying to have some kind of fund-raising  effort, in case that happens again in 1992,' " Dreier said. "I was a Boy Scout,  and it taught me to be prepared."  </P> <P> Unlike most Democrats, who depend heavily on political action committees,  Levine raised only 13%, or $109,700, of his contributions from PACs during  1989. Dreier raised $32,125 from PACs.  </P> <P> Federal Election Commission records show that during the 1988 election cycle,  52 House members financed their reelection entirely with PAC money, 41 of them  Democrats. And 254 House members raised half of the money they spent on  reelection from PACs.  </P> <P> Other Californians with substantial campaign accounts at the end of 1989 were  Reps. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), $720,386; Henry A. Waxman (D-Los  Angeles), $467,258; George Miller (D-Martinez), $464,268; Norman Y. Mineta  (D-San Jose), $368,526, and Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), $313,300.  </P> <P> Only two other House members raised nearly as much money as Levine in 1989.  They were House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who took in  $625,808, and Rep. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), who won a special election after  raising $638,693. Thomas replaced Rep. Dick Cheney, who became secretary of  defense.  </P></p>

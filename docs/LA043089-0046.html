			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The state chose two sites in Imperial County for new prisons that will house  4,400 inmates. The new prisons will be near Calipatria in the central part of  the county and near Mt. Signal in the southern part, Corrections Director James  Rowland said. The state already has legislative authorization for a  $208-million, 2,200-bed maximum-security institution near Calipatria, Rowland  said. The department will seek legislative authorization for the second site, a  2,200-bed medium-security facility, to be funded from a 1990 prison  construction bond issue, Rowland said.  </P></p>

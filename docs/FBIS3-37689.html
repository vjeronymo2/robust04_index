			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 20 (TANJUG) -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev Sunday rejected the possibility that NATO should  realize its threat to launch air strikes if Bosnian Serbs do not  withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo.    `We disregard the deadline. We do not take the deadline (set  by NATO) into account', Kozyrev told the press after a meeting  with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.    After accepting the Russian initiative for the deployment of  Russian peacekeepers between Moslem and Serb forces, Bosnian  Serbs Friday started withdrawing their heavy artillery from  around Sarajevo. The operation is being hindered by snow and  bad weather.    Meeting Kozyrev Friday, Czech Foreign Minister Jozef  Zieleniec said it was important that Russian forces jointed NATO  lately in establishing peace in Sarajevo [sentence as received].    Kozyrev however underlined that Russian forces in Sarajevo  can act only under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command,  adding that the peace conference would be resumed in a few days.    Kozyrev Sunday ended a two-day visit to the Czech Republic.</p>

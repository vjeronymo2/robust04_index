The former Soviet airfield in Zokniai, not far from the town  of Siauliai, is less polluted than supposed earlier, experts  said. They suggested to get rid of the waste in the upper layer  of polluted soil and to start serious cleaning work when soil  examination results are known.    The Russians took out several cubic meters of radioactive  soil before the airport was handed over to Lithuania.    Lithuanian authorities intend to transform the former Soviet  base into a free economic zone.</p>

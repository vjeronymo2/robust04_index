			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Observer: Seeing red Fresh signs of unrest in Russia where the current regime has maintained many of the perks and privileges of former Kremlin leaders - much to the irritation of Moscow's long-suffering residents. In Soviet times, a special lane was reserved in the centre of major roads enabling Politburo members to speed to and from their dachas; even now underpasses are cordoned off when a ministerial cavalcade passes through. However, there are heart-warming signs that the public is tiring of such practices. Drivers on Kutuzovsky Prospect yesterday grew increasingly frustrated at yet another ministerially-inspired traffic jam and started honking their hooters in protest. And then - horror of horrors - the cars at the front of the queue pushed through the red traffic lights blocking the way for the ministerial motors. How Brezhnev's eyebrows would have curled at such impudence.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCA STOCK PAID TO GEFFEN WORTH LESS THAN REPORTED  </P> <P> David Geffen may want to take stock of his MCA Inc. holdings.  </P> <P> In a report filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the  entertainment company says the MCA shares that Geffen received when he sold his  record company last month are worth about $110 million less than their widely  reported value.  </P> <P> By purchasing Geffen Records, MCA obtained a roster of artists that includes  Guns N' Roses, Don Henley, Whitesnake and Cher.  </P> <P> Geffen's 1 million shares of convertible preferred stock are valued at $435  million in MCA's quarterly report. When the deal was announced, however, the  shares were said by analysts to be worth about $545 million.  </P> <P> Harold M. Haas, MCA vice president and chief financial officer, said the  discrepancy is due to the encumbrances placed on the stock. "It is basically  discounted to provide for the restrictions," Haas said. "It has restrictions on  how and when he can sell it."  </P> <P> This is no surprise to Geffen, Haas added, saying, "He knows exactly what he's  getting."  </P> <P> Geffen, however, questioned MCA's explanation. He said he attributed the lower  stock value to the fact that he had distributed a portion of the shares to his  employees.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the deal, which was widely criticized as overly generous at  the time, MCA issued Geffen 1 million shares of a new preferred stock that can  be converted into 10 million shares of MCA common stock. Each preferred share  pays an annual dividend of $6.80 -- or 10 times the dividend on a common share  -- but carries only one vote.  </P> <P> The preferred stock was valued by analysts at $545 million based on the closing  price of $54.50 a common share when the deal was announced. MCA, however, said  the price was reduced by a provision that prevents Geffen from converting more  than a small portion of the shares into common stock for the next four years.  </P> <P> Geffen remains unfazed. "I got paid 10 million shares of stock," he said in a  telephone interview Monday. "Whatever it was worth is what it (the stock) was  worth at the closing that day."  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Coal crisis imperils French connection: David Lascelles on cross-Channel power in the grid ONE SOLUTION canvassed for the coal crisis is to shut off the cross-Channel cable that enables Electricite de France, the state-owned French utility, to sell power into the UK grid. The attraction is that French exports are equivalent, by the estimates of British Coal, to between 6m and 7m tonnes of coal a year. That is the output of about six or seven pits, or between 6,000 and 7,000 miners. Moreover, EdF is widely thought to enjoy state subsidies that give it an unfair advantage over UK sources of fuel, which have to operate unaided. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who is reviewing the pit closures, has promised to look at the French interconnector. So he may act to alter its role, although his scope for action is not as wide as the coal lobby seems to believe. The interconnector was opened in the early 1980s with a capacity of 2,000MW  -about the size of two large power stations. The intention was to enable the British and French grids to balance out peaks in demand. But EdF was more aggressive than the Central Electricity Generating Board and by the late 1980s the traffic was largely one-way. When the UK electricity industry was privatised in 1990, EdF became a member of the electricity pool - the market through which bulk power is sold in the UK. It also negotiated individual contracts with all 12 of the regional distribution companies in England and Wales, and one Scottish company. Those arrangements expire in March, and there is pressure from the British side to prevent EdF negotiating new ones. The Coalfield Communities Campaign, one of the most active pro-coal lobby groups, demanded at a Commons committee inquiry last month that base-load electricity imports be stopped and the link be reduced to a peak balancing role. The campaign also alleged that EdF was dumping electricity on the UK market. Other lobbyists have called for the link to be used to export UK electricity to France and beyond. Reversing the flow might create demand for an additional 15m tonnes of coal, they argue. EdF has begun a counter-offensive. Earlier this week, its head of European sales, Mr Jean-Pierre Guery, was in London for talks. He said EdF intended to go ahead with negotiations for new contracts and he rejected suggestions that his company was able to sell electricity at subsidised prices. One of his main arguments was that EdF's sales help keep UK electricity prices down, so that cutting the link would only damage the consumer. Nor would banning imports necessarily lead to more coal being burnt - the south of England, where the French connection is made, depends heavily on oil-fired stations. Although the English grid draws on all power stations, there is a bottleneck between the coal-fired stations in the north and the heaviest demand in the south. The regional companies are also keen to sign up with EdF because it widens their source of supply. Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive of Seeboard, which has an 80MW agreement with EdF, said last week he expected to negotiate new contracts shortly. The main question Mr Heseltine will have to address is whether the UK has the right to ban imports. The EC's single market officially comes into being in January and it would be hard for the UK to erect a barrier to electricity, particularly since it has been one of the champions of a single market in energy. Mr Guery pointed out that the agreement creating the link gives EdF contractual rights it would seek to protect. Mr Guery was not encouraging on the prospect for UK electricity exports - he said UK generators were unlikely to be able to price competitively in the French market. Nor could they export through France to third countries because transit costs would be too high. But he did foresee the link resuming its balancing role eventually. EdF seems intent on keeping the traffic one way, at least for the time being, and there is little the government can do about it without triggering a diplomatic incident. One measure does seem likely, though. French electricity is not subject to the UK's nuclear levy - the 10 per cent tax on electricity bills to pay for decommissioning nuclear power stations. Critics say EdF can charge prices that reflect the levy, but pocket the difference rather than hand it to the UK Treasury. Mr Guery says that does not happen. But the lure of subjecting French sales to extra taxation is one Mr Heseltine will almost certainly not be able to resist.</p>

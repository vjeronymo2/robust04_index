			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Mexican broadcaster plans Dollars 65m stock issue GRUPO Radio Centro, a leading Mexican radio broadcaster, is set to issue Dollars 65m of stock in Mexican and US markets in an initial public offering. The company is the largest radio broadcaster in Mexico City, with nine stations, and the owners, the Aguirre family, are believed to be interested in buying up two state-owned television companies due for privatisation. The equity issue would make Radio Centro the sixth Mexican company to be quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. The prospectus says proceeds will be used to pay off debt and finance potential acquisitions, although it says no such negotiations are currently pending. Radio Centro earned revenues last year of Dollars 47.6m, with profits of Dollars 12.8m. Operations have been squeezed recently by a slowdown in advertising, reflecting the weak state of the Mexican economy. Next month the Mexican government is expected to announce the winning bidder for two television networks, a film studio and theatre chain. The equity offering is being lead managed by Bear Stearns in the US, and Bursamex in Mexico.</p>

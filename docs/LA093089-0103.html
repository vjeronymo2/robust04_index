			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY SUBPOENAS BRADLEY RECORDS AT BROKERAGE FIRM  </P> <P> A federal grand jury has subpoenaed Mayor Tom Bradley's personal financial  records from a West Coast brokerage firm where a Bradley fund raiser and former  Harbor Commission appointee served as the mayor's stockbroker.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. confirmed Friday that  documents were demanded this week by the U.S. attorney's office, which has  intensified its months-long investigation of Bradley's personal business  dealings and conduct in office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trading Records  </P> <P> The records involved securities traded for Bradley by Ira Distenfield, who  abruptly resigned his Harbor Commission post last May amid inquiries by The  Times into his links to the mayor.  </P> <P> "We received a subpoena a couple of days ago," said Bateman Eichler spokesman  Gene Meeker. "They are asking for information about Bradley's account. That's  all I can tell you."  </P> <P> Meeker declined to specify the nature of the documents that federal authorities  have demanded or provide any details of Bradley's financial transactions. But  he did confirm for the first time that Distenfield was the mayor's broker and  "probably" brought Bradley's business to Bateman.  </P> <P> Distenfield was one of several brokers at various firms used by Bradley for his  financial transactions.  </P> <P> Between 1985 and 1988, Distenfield served as manager of Bateman Eichler's  Century City office, one of the brokerage house's most lucrative branches.  Several former executives of the firm have told The Times that he was hired, in  part, because of his political ties to Bradley and the prospect that his  mayoral influence could bring the firm city business.  </P> <P> The Bateman spokesman said he did not know why Distenfield was hired or whether  political connections played a part.  </P> <P> The subpoena of financial records from Bateman Eichler is part of a broad U.S.  Justice Department inquiry of Bradley that has been expanded in recent weeks  after officials in Washington determined that the case warranted serious  investigation.  </P> <P> "It's the old saying, 'Where there's smoke, there's fire,' and there is heavy  smoke here," a federal officials close to the Bradley probe told The Times.  </P> <P> Bradley, through his press secretary, declined to comment on his relationship  with Distenfield. But the mayor, in a statement released Friday, reiterated his  confidence that "there has been no impropriety on my part."  </P> <P> He confirmed receiving a grand jury document subpoena on Sept. 11 but  discounted its significance, saying it is a "routine procedure" used by the  U.S. Justice Department.  </P> <P> "The issuance of a grand jury subpoena does not mean that charges will,  thereafter, be brought against anyone," Bradley said.  </P> <P> He also protested "extraordinarily improper" comments from unnamed federal  sources regarding the seriousness of the probe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ties to Banks  </P> <P> Besides Distenfield's connection to the mayor, FBI agents and the U.S.  attorney's office are investigating an array of the mayor's business ties to  banks and investment firms to determine whether he engaged in conflicts of  interest or bought securities with the benefit of insider information.  </P> <P> Among the eight financial institutions whose relations with Bradley are under  scrutiny by federal authorities are Far East National Bank, which paid Bradley  $18,000 in consultant fees at a time when it was seeking and receiving city  business, and Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn, whose founder and vice chairman  is Abraham Spiegel, a personal friend of Bradley who has sought favors from the  mayor's office on development projects.  </P> <P> The deepening federal probe comes at a time when the mayor is struggling to put  behind him a scandal that has tarnished an image of high integrity that he  cultivated over 16 years.  </P> <P> On Sept. 13, the mayor made a dramatic, 40-minute presentation on live  television to declare that City Atty. James K. Hahn had exonerated him of any  conflicts of interest and that the controversy was finished, even though his  office said Friday that the mayor had received his grand jury subpoena three  days before his televised statement.  </P> <P> Hahn concluded that Bradley had shown an "indifference" to ethical concerns and  "clearly stepped into the gray area" between innocence and a chargeable crime.  </P> <P> The city attorney also said that his report should not be interpreted as a  vindication of the mayor, a statement that was included because Hahn knew of  the accelerating federal probe and grand jury subpoenas, his spokesman said  Friday.  </P> <P> The Justice Department's subpoenas revealed for the first time that  Distenfield's relationship with the mayor was of interest to federal agents.  </P> <P> Distenfield is one of Bradley's biggest contributors. Campaign records show  that since 1985, Distenfield has given more than $86,000 to Bradley's various  election efforts and has financed major fund-raisers.  </P> <P> Distenfield resigned his powerful post as Harbor Commission president in May on  the same day that The Times sought his comment on sworn statements that  Distenfield made in 1987 before a confidential New York Stock Exchange  arbitration hearing. In his testimony, Distenfield said he used his influence  with Bradley to obtain a hotly contested contract for the brokerage firm of  Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which employed him as an executive.  </P> <P> In a separate subpoena this month to the city treasurer, which was revealed  Thursday, the grand jury demanded documents that involved three firms that  employed Distenfield: Bateman, Smith Barney and ITD Inc.  </P> <P> Bradley has denied that he was influenced by Distenfield.  </P> <P> Smith Barney officials could not be reached for comment on whether the grand  jury had subpoenaed records from their firm.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Distenfield could not be reached for comment. But in an earlier  interview with The Times, the ex-commissioner said he has provided the mayor  with financial advice, encouraging him to join the boards of directors of  companies.  </P> <P> "I have whispered in the mayor's ear over the past couple years that I would  certainly encourage him attempting to make some time available to lend what I  think is his image and his love for business," Distenfield said in June, 1987.  </P> <P> Disclosure of the grand jury's demand for records came amid a highly unusual,  four-day absence from the public eye by Bradley. Since a tour of South-Central  Los Angeles on Monday, Bradley has made no public appearances and none were  scheduled until Monday.  </P> <P> The last such lull in his appearance schedule was in August when Bradley was  preparing for two days of interviews with police and city attorney's  investigators.  </P> <P> Bradley press secretary William Chandler said Friday that Bradley's low-profile  was "absolutely and unequivocally" not related to the expanding federal  investigation. He declined to say what the mayor has been working on, other  than he needed "office time so he could get through city-related paper work."  Chandler said he knew of no meetings this week between the mayor and his team  of defense lawyers.  </P> <P> In another development in the Bradley controversy, lawyers for Juanita St. John  filed a new motion in Superior Court seeking to head off a trial of the  embattled head of a controversial, city-financed Africa trade task force. St.  John, a Bradley business associate who is under investigation for possible  misuse of public funds, is charged with failing to produce subpoenaed records  showing how she spent $180,000 in unaccounted for task force funds. A pretrial  hearing is scheduled Oct. 24.  </P> <P> St. John, who is under criminal investigation by the district attorney's office  major fraud unit and the Los Angeles Police Department, has lost two attempts  to get the subpoena charge thrown out on the grounds that the demand for  documents made by the city controller was unconstitutional. The motion filed  Friday seeks to overturn a Municipal Court ruling last month against St. John.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Henry Weinstein, Tracy Wood and Glenn F.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] San Salvador de Jujuy, 4 April (NA) -- The  demonstration by Jujuy's Public Workers Union Front (FGE)  [Frente de Gremios Estatales] that was convened for today to  protest the veto by the executive branch of a salary increase  approved by Congress left 12 people injured, six of them  policemen. The police arrested six individuals.    The public workers protest ended, just as did last week's  demonstrations, in serious clashes that included attacks with  rocks, the throwing of tear gas, and rubber bullets.    The incidents were not circumscribed to Plaza Belgrano,  located in front of the legislature, and where the marchers  concentrated, but extended to other neighborhoods and to the bus  terminal. Here there was another clash between police and  workers, who burned and destroyed a police station.    In the morning Governor Carlos Ficoseco released a decree  vetoing the salary increase approved by Congress. This was the  cause of the protest. The governor presented an alternative  bill granting salary increases to public workers. [passage  omitted]    Jujuy police were reinforced with National Border Police and  Salta Police agents to prevent possible incidents such as the  one that occurred on 29 March.    Governor Carlos Ficoseco began his speech at the legislature  shortly before 1830, while outside the number of protesters  convened by the FGE increased.    Ficoseco's speech was scheduled to start at 1700 but started  one and a half hours later. Meanwhile, police and public  workers clashed outside.    A group of demonstrators tried to enter the Congress  building, which had strong police protection, but were repelled  by police with tear gas and rubber bullets and forced to  withdraw by some 200 meters.    The anger of the demonstrators, and the unrelenting police  persecution, forced workers to seek refuge at the local bus  terminal, where they burned and completely destroyed the police  station located in that area.

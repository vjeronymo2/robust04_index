			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea is giving definite precedence to the  coal industry, the power industry and rail transport which must  advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy.    The state budget for this year envisages a rise of 3 percent  above last year in the investments in these sectors.    In the coal industry, the coal mines will concentrate on  securing more reserve coal deposits and cutting faces by  accelerating tunnelling and pit construction and on modernizing  coal-cutting equipment.    In the power industry, the construction of large  hydroelectric power stations and thermal power plants currently  under way will be accelerated vigorously and many more minor  power stations be built in all parts of the country.    In rail transport, the existing rails will be replaced by  heavy-duty rails at an accelerated pace on the trunk lines  including the Pyongyang-Chongjin line, more sections be switched  over to electric traction and the modernisation of transport  means be hastened to increase the railway transport capacity.    The investment will be up in the metal industry 2.6 percent  on last year and the production of irons and steels will be  placed on a reinforced foundation.    Last year the investment in the preferential sectors of the  national economy went up 3.5 percent above the preceding year to  considerably increase the capacity of coal and ore production.    Power production and railway transport capacity has been  largely boosted with efforts concentrated on the construction of  power stations and the strengthening of the material and  technological foundations of railways.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Tiphook The bears have long had it in for Tiphook, but the claws must have been specially sharpened for yesterday's full year figures. What other company could have hoisted the year's dividend by a quarter - rather better than the best expectations - and then watched its shares fall 15 per cent? Tiphook, it has to be said, provided a certain amount of ammunition for the sceptics. Stated pre-tax profits of Pounds 86.4m were Pounds 10m below the most optimistic forecasts, though the disappointment was rather less for those prepared to strip out exceptionals. Tiphook's reporting is now more open, but the market may have been the more miffed that best hopes were missed given the scope for using the Sea Container provisions set up two years ago. The outlook for the containers division, moreover, suddenly looks rather less certain. No doubt Tiphook can do better in future than last year's 2.8 per cent return on capital employed in trailers - if not it should get out of the business - but a 34 per cent return from containers hardly seems sustainable. At best the activity will pause for breath, at worst it may be going ex-growth. But the balance sheet is hardly stretched, given the nature of the business, while the big dip in capital spending this year will do wonders for gearing. The shares hardly deserve the ignominy of a 5.2 times forward earnings multiple, or a prospective yield as high as 8.5 per cent.</p>

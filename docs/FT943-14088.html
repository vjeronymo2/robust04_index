			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Back from the dead and aiming high: Bundeswehr successes revive Volker Ruhe's ambitions They call the German Ministry of Defence the graveyard of political ambitions. Five postwar defence ministers have been forced to resign prematurely because of scandal, political failure or ill health. The only man to survive and rise to greater things was Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former chancellor. Few doubt that Mr Volker Ruhe, the pugnacious Christian Democrat politician who is the current incumbent, would like to emulate Mr Schmidt. He admits that his fellow Hamburger is a role model, even if he is a Social Democrat. And he has certainly proved he is a survivor. Less than two years ago, Mr Ruhe's political career seemed to be in tatters. Touted in the media as a possible heir to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he stood at the party conference of the Christian Democratic Union to become one of Mr Kohl's five deputy chairmen - and suffered the humiliation of coming sixth, at the bottom of the poll. It was a brutal setback for an ambitious politician, and one which caused the chancellor no loss of sleep. For Mr Ruhe had allowed his ambitions to become too obvious. He was suspected of plotting for a future grand coalition with the Social Democrats, and Mr Kohl suffers no rivals gladly. Ever since that day at the Dusseldorf party conference, Mr Ruhe's star has been on the wane. Yet this week he was still very much in office, exuding his old self-confidence, having just pulled off a remarkable hat-trick. He had seen the constitutional court give the green light for Germany's military forces, the Bundeswehr, to serve on peacekeeping expeditions anywhere in the world; he had persuaded the leaders of all three parties in the ruling coalition to accept his controversial plans to slim the military to just 340,000 men, and cut conscription from 12 to 10 months; and he had emerged from the latest budget round with his expenditure virtually intact, after two years of spending cuts. On the face of it, it was no mean feat. And yet practically nobody in Bonn is prepared to give Mr Ruhe the credit for it. For his success, above all in winning the battle in the constitutional court, has a fatal flaw. It means that the Bundeswehr is being given a role in the modern, post-cold war world  -the chance to participate in international peacekeeping - at precisely the moment when, largely thanks to Mr Ruhe's previous cuts, its morale is at rock-bottom and its operational capacity is overstretched. From the moment he took over the office, little more than two years ago, at 49, Mr Ruhe has been campaigning for the Bundeswehr to be allowed to serve outside the Nato area. First, he tried to negotiate a deal with the Social Democrats to change the German constitution. When that failed, he embarked on a policy of deliberately sending men in uniform out-of-area, tempting his opponents to launch a constitutional challenge. He sent military doctors to support the UN in Cambodia. He sent military observers in uniform to the former Soviet Union, and he allowed German air crews to fly Awacs airborne reconnaissance missions to police the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina. He sent a German frigate to the Adriatic to help enforce the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia. And he dispatched 1,700 men to Somalia to provide logistical support for UN blue berets. The opposition rose to the bait, and ran to the constitutional court in Karlsruhe to demand clarification. And this week the court gave its blessing, with the proviso that the German Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, must normally sanction every mission. The government agreed yesterday to summon a special session next week, to give retrospective approval to the Awacs and Adriatic exercises. But if Mr Ruhe deserves a share of the credit for the court decision, his reputation on all other questions in Germany's defence community is mud. 'Even a Green minister of defence (committed to abolishing the armed forces) would be better than Volker Ruhe,' one defence analyst said yesterday. 'He doesn't give a damn about the Bundeswehr. He has systematically destroyed the armed forces in a way which is without precedent.' All the evidence suggests that morale in the Bundeswehr is plumbing new depths. Parliament's ombudsman for the armed forces, Mr Alfred Biehle, said in his last annual report that constant changes or cancellations in budget commitments and structural decisions had 'shattered the credibility and leadership ability of the political and military commanders'. Mr Ruhe's first problem was that he never made any secret of where he wanted to be: in the Foreign Ministry. And he has used his present position to gain political popularity and profile with that end in mind. From the beginning, he decided that the most popular political move would be to reap the 'peace dividend' from the end of the cold war - by cutting his own budget. First he tried to axe the Eurofighter, only to discover that his partners - Britain, Italy and Spain - were not prepared to agree. So he had to settle for a superficial redesign of the aircraft, which will almost certainly end up costing more, not less. His next mistake was to try to be too active in volunteering big cuts in his own defence budget. 'Instead of asking the budget committee for more than he needed, and then negotiating down to a sensible compromise, he actually offered them bigger cuts than they were contemplating,' according to an impartial observer. 'The budget committee simply wasn't prepared to give up its job, so it cut him still more.' Real defence spending last year was reduced by some 28 per cent. This year's budget freeze amounts to a token reprieve. 'Nobody would dispute that the Bundeswehr needs to be smaller,' a military attache said. 'The budget is no longer enough to support 370,000 men.' Yet from Mr Ruhe's point of view, that is still a success: he has reaped the peace dividend. The cut in conscription also seems certain to be popular with young voters and their families. He is determined to prove the soothsayers wrong, and demonstrate that there is a political life in Bonn after the Ministry of Defence.</p>

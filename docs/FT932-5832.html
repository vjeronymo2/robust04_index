			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Brewers urge beer excise cut THE BREWING industry is urging the government to lower the new rate of excise duty on beer, which took effect yesterday, on the grounds that it breaches a pledge by ministers that it would not raise more revenue than the previous system. The Brewers' Society said yesterday that if the new system had been applied over the past 12 months it would have yielded Pounds 64m - or 3 per cent - more than the old one. The society said ministers had promised that the rate would be fiscally neutral and would be rectified if this that proved not to be the case. It urged a rate change before the November Budget. Customs and Excise expressed surprise that the brewers had not complained earlier and said they had not substantiated their claim.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Surprising view from land of the back extension Sir, Colin Amery warns us against architectural competitions ('The tyranny of the few,' September 23). Seen from afar (an aircraft over Switzerland, as it happened) I could only smile that his cautionary lines come from a country where a 'new' building is still a supermarket parading as an oast house, usually close to a (genuinely) new motorway. Two of the projects he warns against, the reorganisation of the South Bank and the redesign of a disused power station for a new Tate Gallery, are in the English tradition of conversion and adjustment. In a culture devoted to back extensions and knocking through I imagined Amery would have admired the inherent modesty of these two projects. Instead, he seems afraid of their possible modernity.

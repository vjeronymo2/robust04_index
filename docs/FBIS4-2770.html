			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- China's exports  increased by half a percentage point more than its imports  during the first three months of this year, the National Customs  Office revealed here today.    This is the first time for more than 25 months that exports  have grown faster than imports.    But the adverse trade balance in this first quarter still  stood at 480 million U.S. dollars, while the total trade volume  of 39.5 billion U.S. dollars showed an increase of 18.4 percent  over the same period last year.    The customs department figures showed that exports for the  quarter were worth 19.11 billion U.S. dollars (up 18.7 percent  over 1993's first quarter) and imports totalled 20.39 billion  U.S. dollars (up 18.2 percent).    Significant was that the growth rate of exports in the first  quarter of 1993 was 7.4 percent, so this quarter's exports  growth rate was 11.3 percentage points greater. In contrast,  imports in the first three months of 1993 went up by 25.4  percent, while this year that increase was 7.2 percentage points  less steep.    According to some experts here, this phenomenon indicated  that China's export capacity has recovered, while the excessive  demand for imports has been effectively controlled, and China's  foreign trade is becoming more stable and balanced.    It was learned that in the first three months of the year,  China's exports of such products as clothes, textile products,  shoes, toys, radio recorders and plastic products have increased  steadily.    Meanwhile, the growth in imports of goods such as steel,  refined oil, automobiles, aircraft, ships and textile machinery  has slowed down, in some cases even dropped. However, imports  of metal processing machinery and telephone switchboards have  abruptly increased.</p>

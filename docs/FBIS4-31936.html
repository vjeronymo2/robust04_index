			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Deteriorating Foreign Trade Balance"] </F>   [Text] The foreign trade balance continued to deteriorate  in the first three months of the year: While exports increased  by 25 percent, imports exceeded the level registered in the  first quarter of 1993 by 30 percent, the Central Statistical  Office [KSH] reported.    The decline of exports was the most visible characteristic  of  foreign trade in 1993 which resulted in a spectacular  deterioration of the trade balance. In 1993, exports were 13  percent lower than a year before. The reduction was typical  mainly in the sales to market economy countries. Within this,  Hungarian exports to the countries of the European Union (EU)  decreased by 18 percent.    In 1993, the amount of imported goods increased by almost 21  percent. Of this, 12 percent more goods arrived from the market  economies and 49 percent more from transforming [atalakulo]  countries. The latter was mainly in connection with on-off  deliveries like MiG airplanes or the repair of Lithuanian  airplanes. As a result, the import of machinery and transport  vehicles from these countries increased almost sevenfold.    The volume of imports exceeded the previous year in all main  product groups. In addition to significantly increased machinery  import, the import of consumer industrial goods from the  transforming countries and foodstuffs from the market economies  increased the most, by 66 and 18 percent respectively.    The KSH detected further deterioration in the first quarter  of 1994. While exports calculated at current prices increased  by 25 percent, imports exceeded the level of the same period  last year by 30.8 percent. A little over half of the balance  deterioration arose in trade with the market economies, mainly  with EU member states.</p>

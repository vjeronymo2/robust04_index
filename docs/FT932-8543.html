			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sony music unit gains 39.7% as home sales grow SONY Music Entertainment (Japan), a core unit of the Sony group's domestic software business, saw a 39.7 per cent increase in profits for the fiscal year to March. Pre-tax profits of the parent company rose to Y22.4bn (Dollars 202m) from a year earlier due to the success of new Japanese recordings and the expansion of its domestic repertoire. Net profits gained 41.2 per cent to Y11.9bn from a year earlier, while sales grew by 8.4 per cent to 100bn. However, the shares of the company, whose western recording artists include Michael Jackson, suffered from profit-taking on the second section of the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, ending Y30 lower at Y5,180. The company said CD and record sales of their Japanese artists climbed 21.7 per cent the last fiscal year and enabled the company to counter depreciation costs. In spite of the gains made last year, Sony Music predicted a decline of 10.0 per cent in pre-tax profits to Y20.2bn this current business year, with sales down 2.6 per cent at Y98.1bn.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Christian Salvesen The small worry about Christian Salvesen is that its chapter of accidents is beginning to look like bad judgment. It entered both the rock concert business and the Spanish market at the wrong time. Now it has also mistakenly counted a contract to supply power to the town of Split as a long-term one even though it requires the Croatians to put up precious foreign exchange. Such fumbling does not help when the big worry, revealed in yesterday's profits warning, is a vital strategic one; Aggreko, its contract hire division, seems unable to deliver the growth on which the company had depended. The problem is easy to diagnose, harder to solve. Aggreko faces severe competition from Caterpillar in its big ticket US business and from independent operators in small generator supply. Curiously the squeeze developed when the US economy was supposed to be recovering, but Salvesen appears to have been living off unsustainable margins. Its finance director properly waited until December's gloomy interim statement to unload his options. With hindsight, his timing may look fortunate too.</p>

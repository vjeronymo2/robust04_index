			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: IT industry 'to change radically' A RADICALLY different information technology industry will emerge over the next few years through consolidation in the semi-conductor business and the disintegration of the traditional computer industry. This was the view of industry leaders speaking yesterday at a major industry conference in Barcelona. The Etre conference brings together leading figures from the industry each year for two days of discussions and presentations. Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microfsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, said that within three years software houses would no longer market complete applications programs as at present. Instead, they would develop pieces of software which could be connected together into complex systems. He predicted that within a few years, 90 per cent of personal computers would have Microsoft's best-selling Windows program built in. The latest development in Microsoft's family of Windows operating systems, codenamed Cairo, would emerge from the laboratory in 18 months, he said. The new system would have advanced features such as voice and handwriting recognition built in. Mr Gates said that developments in the computer industry would lead to an information-rich society in which individuals might have to take explicit steps to avoid bombardment with data. He said aeroplanes, hotels and theme parks were the obvious candidates for sites where people could be supplied with virtually unlimited information. Mr Jerry Sanders, chief executive of AMD, a US semi-conductor company, warned there would be no place for small, independent semi-conductor companies in the volume IT markets of the late-1990s. He said the costs of research and development coupled with the expense of building plants capable of manufacturing chips with features smaller than half a millionth of a metre meant that only the largest companies like Intel and AMD would be left to fight it out.

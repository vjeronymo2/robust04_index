			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Hardship fears for travellers A children's charity fears proposed legislation in the criminal justice and public order bill to be debated in parliament today will 'cause considerable hardship' for travellers and gypsies.

Mr Michael Taylor, Save the Children's UK director, said it would mean the frequent eviction of travellers and gypsies who could be forced into moving constantly from one illegal stopping place to another.</p>

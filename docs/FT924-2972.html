			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Granada to shed up to 250 TV jobs THE Granada group confirmed yesterday that it was shedding 200 to 250 jobs out of 1,300 at Granada Television, the ITV company for north-west England. The announcement came a week after Granada announced a 129 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 130m. The company described the job losses as a 'major development plan' designed to ensure that the company remained the leading ITV producer/broadcaster in the new licence period which starts next month. It hopes the job losses can be achieved by voluntary redundancies.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Recovery at Paribas continues Paribas, the leading French banking group, last year continued its recovery with a 64 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.45bn (Dollars 253m) from FFr886m in 1992. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said the group, which fell into the red in 1991, benefited from a strong performance in market trading activities and also from its US and Asian banking interests. However, he added that it had continued to be affected by the European recession. The group mustered a 13 per cent increase in operating income to FFr32.68bn in 1993 from FFr28.96bn in 1992. Net banking income rose far faster, despite the sluggish state of the French market, with a 21 per cent rise to FFr31.31bn from FFr25.88bn. However, revenue from other sources fell by 56 per cent to FFr1.37bn from FFr3.08bn mainly due to a reduction in asset sales. Gross operating profits rose by 16 per cent to FFr13.08bn from FFr11.28bn. However, Paribas was again forced to make hefty provisions on its non-performing property and industrial investments. The level of operating provisions was 15 per cent higher in 1993 at FFr8.78bn against FFr7.65bn in 1992. Paribas said that it had made particularly heavy write-downs on its industrial investments in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy.</p>

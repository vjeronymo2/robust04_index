			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (8): Hotels must catch up - Computer Reservations INFORMATION technology for hotels is an immature, fragmented market with great scope for growth and the refinement of existing products and services. According to a Mori survey carried out this year for International Business Mach- ines, the largest hardware supplier to hotels using computers, 70 per cent of the hotel chains polled were not linked to a computerised reser- vation system. The survey, of 100 British IT and marketing managers, also found that only slightly more than half the respondents were taking advantage of property man- agement systems - those that allocate rooms to guests and keep track of housekeeping, maintenance and supplies. 'The industry has a bit of catching up to do,' comments Mr Richard Horsfield, IBM UK's hotel services group manager. To the extent that the technology is not taken up, travellers are deprived of the efficiency gains that computers can bring to itinerary planning. Hoteliers forgo added precision in their management accounts. Where computers are used, improvements are taking place at the point at which the customer usually makes his first contact with the electronic net - the airline- owned ticket reservation systems which also accept hotel and car hire bookings. Hotels are beginning to opt for direct on-line links with these systems. Such direct links allow hotels to sell rooms off their own bat and in tandem with the intermediaries, such as Utell, which market a substantial portion of some inventories. 'In three years, at the outside, all the leading hotel chains will have such direct links,' says Mr Carl Holton, head of marketing for the UK arm of Galileo, the reservation system owned by 11 US and European airlines. With a direct link, confirmation of room requests is instantaneous, and elim- inates the potential for lost fax and telex messages which some travel agents say still adds an element of uncertainty to room bookings. 'We're looking to the day when we can book a hotel room by computer and know that it is as secure as an airline ticket issued the same way,' says Mr Neil McNair, information and technologies manager at The Travel Company, a travel agency. Another place where more direct computer access is being applied is in the central reservations systems operated by the hotels themselves. When fully automated, these process bookings for a whole hotel chain or group at a single office and send them down the wire to individual properties. Forte Travelodge takes 12,000 to 14,000 reservations a week on such a system designed by Innsite, the largest of the hotel software suppliers with 1,500 installations worldwide. Suppliers appear to be striving hard to match products with hoteliers' perceived needs. Last year, 98 suppliers (only a fifth of them specialists in the sector) launched a record 31 new software products into a UK market worth Pounds 30m, according to a report by Hill Associates, the consulting firm, in conjunction with the trade journal Caterer &amp; Hotelkeeper. This effort was probably stimulated by feedback from systems buyers who gave availability of software to fit their particular business as the single most important influence on their buying decisions - before price, range of system features and speed. Even so, more than a quarter of the hotel and catering businesses analysed in the Hill report - 74 per cent of whom said computers were essential to their work - said there was a gap between needs and available systems. 'This suggests there is a considerable opportunity for further product development,' the report says. The future holds the promise of higher spending by hotel groups on computers. The IBM survey notes that 46 per cent of IT managers intend to spend more on computers this year than they did in the 12 months to February. Holiday Inn is already undertaking a 2 1/2 -year Dollars 60m upgrading of its hardware and software with the aim of refining its ability to balance a room rate with vacancies and guests' length of stay. The old system registered no vacancy if a room at the desired rate was not available on the first night. The new system will check whether the right type of room is free on subsequent nights, then pull up a different room (but at the same price) for the first night. Holiday Inn estimates the new system will staunch the loss of Dollars 125m in US revenues caused by the old's inability to factor in guests' length of stay. When one considers that 45 per cent of all hotel rooms in the world are in the US, and 53 per cent are in Europe, international sales to North America and the Continent will be of ongoing importance to IT suppliers in the sector. At least half a dozen systems designers and software specialists offer service support in at least one foreign language. Technology notwithstanding, the hotel business remains one of service and personal relations. As Mr Marty Silverman, an IT specialist with management consultants Booz Allen, told an industry conference in London in April: 'IT won't deliver sustained competitive advantage to the hotel sector unless a lot of things change around it - the features you advertise, the liaisons you forge, the way you train your staff.'</p>

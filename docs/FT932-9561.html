			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Local finance 'WE MUST build a new accountability fit for the 21st century - a new accountability that goes directly from those who run public services to those who use them.' Admirable sentiments, expressed with characteristic clarity by Mr John Major in February. However, accountability for the provision of local services has become less direct in recent years, according to a report published today by the Audit Commission. The commission says that the scope for councils to vary spending on services in line with local preferences has been shrinking. Standard Spending Assessments, used by the government to allocate grants to local authorities, prescribe what councils should spend to provide a standard level of service. But they are also used to control council spending. Local authorities which spend too much over their SSA are forced to cut their budgets. Using such assessments to allocate government grants inevitably leads to arguments over the needs of particular areas. It also creates anomalies, rating Cambridge as more deprived than Hartlepool, for example. Worse, using them to cap council expenditure undermines the accountability of local authorities to their electorates. Councils that provide poor quality services can blame the government for setting SSAs which are too low for their area's needs and for capping their spending. The view that these assessments are objective is strengthened by ministers who encourage councils to spend up to SSA. Birmingham City Council, for example, has been pilloried for spending less than SSA on education. Increasingly it looks as if central government decides what councils spend, through the SSAs, rather than the locally elected council. The result is a confusion of accountability; neither central nor local government accepts responsibility for decisions on particular services. At the heart of the problem is the fall in the proportion of local government income which is raised by local taxes. In 1989-90, more than half of local government income came from local taxes; this year they account for about 20 per cent. Councils which depend for 80 per cent of their income on government grants can only be weakly accountable to the local electorate. And as long as Whitehall provides the bulk of local authority income, ministers will want to interfere in how town halls spend it. Restoring local accountability requires an increase in the discretion which local government can exercise. That means providing local authorities with a stable tax base which can finance a much higher proportion of their spending. The simplest step towards this would be to return the business rate to local authority control, with safeguards to limit increases which might damage competitiveness. Efficiency and effectiveness will be easier to achieve if local taxpayers know that their councils exercise real power over local services.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KING OF HORROR;  </P> <P> AUTHOR OF 'INCREDIBLY CREEPY STUFF' THRILLS 'EM IN PASADENA  </P> <P> What do you do with a man who takes a perverse pleasure in scaring the living  daylights out of you? You celebrate him, of course. You give him standing  ovations, respond to his jokes with wall-shaking laughter and wave your fist in  the air, shouting "Yeah!" when he mentions the titles of his books.  </P> <P> "Pet Sematary." "Yeah!"  </P> <P> "The Shining." "All right!"  </P> <P> "This is sort of like Stephen King's greatest hits," said the horror story  writer during a jocular, confiding address to an audience of youthful King  aficionados at the Pasadena Public Library on Wednesday.  </P> <P> For many of the 250 people packed into the little auditorium, some of whom had  stood in line in front of the library all night Sunday to buy the last tickets  for the sold-out speech, this was the literary event of the era. They hauled in  crates of King novels to be autographed, jabbered excitedly about the latest  King film ("Pet Sematary," which opened last week) and exchanged notes on their  idol's diabolical literary powers.  </P> <P> "He can write some incredibly creepy stuff," said one man. "Yeah, he can keep  you up at night."  </P> <P> King mesmerized them.  </P> <P> When the author appeared at a side door, a tall, slouching figure in jeans and  a rumpled shirt, with glasses as thick as Coke bottles, audience members  erupted into applause, jumping to their feet when he reached the stage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rare Trip  </P> <P> King had made a rare trip to California from his home in Maine not just to give  a lecture to an adoring audience, he said. "The fact is that, in some odd way,  this is a research trip," said King, 41, whose novels are perennial entries on  the best-seller list. His two dozen books -- including "The Drawing of the  Three," currently on top of the New York Times' Paperback Best Sellers list --  have sold a combined total fast approaching 100 million.  </P> <P> "I'm working on a book called 'The Library Police,' whose central character is  a woman vampire and sexual psychopath," he said, launching into a riveting  discussion of the sources of his ideas and the secrets of his success.  </P> <P> "The ideas can come from any place and no place at all," King added.  </P> <P> Successful horror stories, King suggested, always have a kind of split  personality. "As a writer, you're talking with two voices," he said. "At one  level, you're screaming at your audience about ghosts and vampires. At another  level, you're whispering to them about real fears."  </P> <P> The "whispering" was obvious in the "thousand bad horror movies" of the 1950s,  which provided the young Stephen King with a shaping influence. Take the early  Japanese monster movies, with their references to nuclear holocaust, he said. "  'Godzilla,' with his radioactive halitosis, stomps Tokyo flat and makes real  the unspoken nightmare of the whole nation," said King.  </P> <P> American movie thrillers of that period sometimes seemed to echo the communist  scare of the 1950s, King added. " 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' " with  its pod people subtly replacing good Americans, really suggested that "there's  a Red under every bed," said King.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Turned Into Movies  </P> <P> Half a dozen of King's books have been turned into movies, with plans for more  in the works. King shamelessly plugged the movie version of "Pet Sematary," for  which he wrote the screenplay and in which he played a small role.  </P> <P> King's stories whisper of up-to-date fears: disease, mass murder, family  pathology.  </P> <P> Television sitcoms never prepared him for the grinding stresses of raising a  family, King said. "On 'The Donna Reed Show,' Dad was always cool," he said.  "He wore a tie at the dinner table and his hair was combed. The mother never  said, 'Get outa here. I've got PMS, and I'm gonna kill you.' "  </P> <P> The author came to realize, he said, that anyone can have the impulses of the  murderous father in "The Shining."  </P> <P> "When you get up in the middle of the night to give the baby his bottle," King  said, "out of some sewer back there (in one's mind), there's an alligator  saying, 'Kill it. Use the pillow.' The whispering says, 'Jack Torrance is you.'  "  </P> <P> King's latest theme came to him, the author said, from his 12-year-old son,  Owen, who provided unwitting fodder for the prolific King horror machine. The  boy had wanted his father to check a book out of the library for him, rather  than putting it on his own card. Why? "I'm afraid of the library police," Owen  confessed to his father, saying that a family member had once told him that a  corps of enforcers punished derelict library patrons.  </P> <P> It was one of those frivolous childhood fears that King has made so much of --  half superstition, half kids' scary game -- and which is treated as hideously  real by King's characters.  </P> <P> "Immediately, my antennae went up," said King, shooting his familiar grin.  "What was this kid afraid of? There might be millions of dollars in this.  (Appreciative applause from the audience) Suddenly, I'm a concerned parent. . .  ."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Colorful Wonderings  </P> <P> The exchange with his son sent King's imagination reeling. "I started to wonder  what library police look like," he said. "Look at all the unmarked doors in the  library. They're there, 10 feet tall, with silver eyes, trench coats and  horrible weapons."  </P> <P> All of his novels have sprung from such random intrusions into his life, King  said. "The Shining," a novel (turned into a movie by Stanley Kubrick), set in a  deserted resort hotel, came from an actual trip to such a hotel in Colorado.  "We got up there the day before the season ended," he said. "We checked in  while everybody else checked out. . . . In the restaurant, all the tables  except ours were covered with plastic and there was a forest of upturned chair  legs."  </P> <P> "Cujo," in which the villain is a mass murderer inhabiting the body of a rabid  dog, came from a face-off between King and a dog at a mechanic's garage. "There  was this noise, like a motorboat at a low idle," said King, exulting in the  story, "and here was the biggest St. Bernard I'd ever seen in my life. He was  dirty, he had his head down and his tail down, and he knew what he wanted. He  wanted me. 'Don't worry,' said Joe (the mechanic), 'he always does that.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ornamental Doodad'  </P> <P> King, describing Stephen King the author as "the ornamental doodad on the  automobile of civilization," also made these points:  </P> <P> What makes horror stories truly gripping is the human condition. "None of us  are going to walk out alive," he said. "We're going to croak, folks. As Steve  Martin once said, 'We're having a pretty good time tonight considering we're  all gonna die.' "  </P> <P> He saw a ghost five years ago, after a house party in Maine, while retrieving  his wife's coat from an upstairs bedroom. As King sorted through a pile of  coats on a bed, "I realized there was a man sitting by a window across the  room. He was about 70 years old, in a blue pinstripe suit, with a bald head and  brown glasses." The man's head was "tanned and tough looking, with freckles."  But the apparition disappeared suddenly.  </P> <P> He expects to die in the month of February. "Everything bad in my life happens  in February."  </P> <P> His characters assume their own destinies. "The boy in 'Cujo' -- I was real  sorry when he died. He literally died one day on the page. His mother gave him  mouth-to-mouth, and I thought he'd come around. But he never did."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Satisfied Audience  </P> <P> The audience floated out of the library in small groups, with freshly  autographed copies of "The Stand" and "Carrie" and the rest. "It was more than  satisfying," said Norma Vega, a student at Cal State L.A. who had paid $30 for  the library's six-author lecture series just so she could see King. "I would  have paid triple."  </P> <P> Jessica Ackerburke, 15, said she had been hooked on King novels for several  years. "It's kind of like getting away from yourself," said the John Muir High  School sophomore. "You don't have to worry about it. It's in the book."  </P> <P> Is there a word describing "Kingophiles"? Vega didn't hesitate. "Obsessed," she  said.  </P></p>

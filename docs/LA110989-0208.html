			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH MAY SEAT APPOINTEES WITHOUT SENATE OK  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, frustrated by Senate delays on its nominations, may  give some of its 200 languishing nominees "recess appointments" that don't  require Senate action, White House officials said today.  </P> <P> Such a parliamentary end run around the Senate's advice-and-consent powers  would surely anger Democratic leaders and worsen already strained relations  between President Bush and Congress.  </P> <P> "We're not anxious to do this. This is only a last resort. But it is something  we may be compelled to do," an anonymous White House official said.  </P> <P> Senior White House aides are preparing recommendations for Bush on the  procedures for making a possible batch of recess appointments during Congress'  year-end break, the sources said.  </P> <P> Someone granted such a "recess appointment" may serve, under the Constitution,  until the end of the next session of Congress.  </P> <P> Nearly all Presidents have made recess appointments from time to time. And it  is a favored tactic for giving political supporters short-term jobs like  ambassadorships near the end of a presidential term.  </P> <P> However, the device has never been used in a wholesale fashion before.  </P></p>

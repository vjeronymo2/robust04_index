			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: CASUALTY LOSS MUST BE 'SUDDEN OR UNEXPECTED' TO BE  TAX-DEDUCTIBLE  </P> <P> QUESTION: The soil underneath our home is gradually sinking. We have learned  that our house was built on top of an old garbage dump that was closed in the  mid-1950s, filled and converted into a subdivision for about 150 homes.  </P> <P> Some owners have jacked up their homes to make them level, but our house is  built on a slab foundation, so leveling it will cost at least $30,000. If we  decide to go ahead, can we deduct this major expense as a casualty loss on our  income tax returns?  </P> <P> ANSWER: You are asking a very difficult question to which there is no right or  wrong answer. To be able to deduct a casualty loss on your income tax return,  the loss must be "sudden, unexpected or unusual."  </P> <P> The IRS could argue your loss is caused by the gradual subsidence of the land  underneath your house, so it does not qualify. However, if the land suddenly  sank under one portion of your home, then it could qualify for the casualty  loss tax deduction.  </P> <P> I suggest that you consult your tax adviser. He or she will also explain that a  casualty loss deduction is allowed only to the extent it exceeds 10% of your  adjusted gross income. For example, if you and your spouse have a $50,000  adjusted gross income, the first $5,000 of a casualty loss would not be  deductible.  </P> <P> You should also be aware the IRS loves to audit casualty losses because  taxpayers often cannot prove these deductions. However, if you and your tax  adviser conclude your problem does not qualify as a casualty loss, your expense  is then a capital improvement, which can be added to your adjusted cost basis  for your home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should Commission Be Split With Lawyer?  </P> <P> Q: I am a real estate broker. Recently, I met the owner of a large apartment  complex who listed his building for sale with my firm. I called a few of my  business contacts and located a buyer within about a week. When I brought the  full-price offer to the seller, he insisted his attorney review it.  </P> <P> But the attorney says he wants half my sales commission if he is to recommend  his client accept the offer. I asked the attorney if he is a licensed realty  broker and he replied that attorneys do not have to be licensed as brokers. I  said I would think about the situation. As the sales commission is almost  $140,000, do you think I should split it with this crooked attorney?  </P> <P> A: No. Attorneys are exempt from real estate license laws but they are not  permitted to share in real estate sales commissions without a real estate  license. I suggest your correct reply should be: "The real estate license law  does not permit me to split my sales commission with an unlicensed person.  </P> <P> "I'm sure you don't want me to lose my license. If you insist on receiving part  of my sales commission, then I must report your illegal demand to your client  and to the state Bar Assn."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sell Your Home Before You Buy a New One  </P> <P> Q: I know we made a bad mistake but hope you can get us out of our mess. We  committed ourselves to buy a new house before selling our old one. Since our  purchase offer had a contingency for the sale of our old home, we thought we  were safe.  </P> <P> But then another buyer made an offer to purchase the house we want to buy, and  the seller insisted we either remove our contingency or give up the house. So  we waived the contingency. That was two months ago and we haven't had any  offers for the sale of our current home. What should we do?  </P> <P> A: Your situation is a classic example of why prospective home buyers should  sell their old home before buying a new residence.  </P> <P> One solution is to forfeit your earnest money deposit on the new home if there  would be no further liability. That might be your cheapest solution.  </P> <P> But another choice is to obtain a "bridge loan" on your old home so you will  have the cash to buy your new home. But this can be an expensive choice. The  interest rate on bridge loans isn't low.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sometimes It's Better to Rent Than Own  </P> <P> Q: Recently I attended a real estate investment seminar where the speaker, who  seemed very knowledgeable, said it is cheaper and smarter to rent your home  than to own it. My wife and I pay about $1,200 per month for the mortgage  payment and property taxes on our home. But we could rent a similar house down  the block for $950 per month. Do you think we should sell our home and rent  instead?  </P> <P> A: No, no, no. The seminar speaker you heard is absolutely correct in telling  you that it is cheaper and smarter to rent your home than to own it. However,  most folks don't like the idea because they want to own the home where they  live.  </P> <P> The solution is to rent the residence in which you live and own an equivalent  rental house. For example, you could rent that house down the street for $950  while you rent your present home for $950 to tenants.  </P> <P> Yes, you will have a negative cash flow of about $250, plus maintenance and  insurance. However, you will be able to depreciate your former residence, thus  resulting in a tax loss. If your adjusted gross income is less than $100,000,  you can deduct up to $25,000 of such a loss against your ordinary income, such  as job salary, interest and dividends.  </P> <P> I must admit although it makes sense to rent a residence instead of owning it,  I don't do that. There is something about the security of owning your home that  can't be compensated no matter how great the tax benefits. Before you move out  of your home and rent one down the street, please consult your tax adviser for  full details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Realtor Defends Need for 6-Month Listing  </P> <P> Q: As a realtor for the past 12 years, I find your column must reading. In  fact, we often start out our Monday morning sales meetings by discussing your  articles. We don't always agree, but you certainly provoke a lively discussion  among our sales associates. However, one thing we strongly disagree about is  the term of the listing.  </P> <P> I realize you hear from the unhappy home sellers who signed six-month listings  and their agent did a poor job. I have no apology for those agents. But most  realty agents need 90 days to sell a home in a typical market. By the time we  get the listing into the local multiple listing service, begin our advertising  program, and work with interested buyers, it takes at least 30 days. If the  local market is slow, as it is in many cities today, homes don't sell  instantly. Isn't it about time you rethink your ideas about the listing term?  </P> <P> A: Thank you for sharing what Paul Harvey would call "the rest of the story."  The big drawback of a 90-day listing is most realty agents work hardest,  smartest and fastest just before a listing expires. As a real estate salesman  for several years, I know how that works.  </P> <P> Over the years, I have received many letters from home sellers who signed  long-term listings, only to discover their agent is not doing everything  possible to professionally market the home.  </P> <P> For example, perhaps you recall the recent letter from the home sellers who  learned that their agent didn't promptly submit their listing to the multiple  listing service for 30 days. That wouldn't have happened with a 30-day listing.  </P> <P> For this reason, I recommend home sellers sign a 30- or 60-day listing with the  understanding that the listing will be renewed if the agent is doing a good job  when the listing expires with the home unsold. This strategy prevents the home  seller from getting stuck with a lazy agent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move Back Into Rental to Avoid Paying Tax  </P> <P> Q: About three years ago we moved to a new town about 75 miles from our former  home. Since we weren't sure about our new jobs, we rented our old residence to  tenants. Now we've decided to buy a home in our new location. To do so,  however, we must sell our old home to get the cash for our down payment. How  can we accomplish this and avoid tax on our sale profit which we estimate will  be about $75,000?  </P> <P> A: That's easy. Just move back into your former residence. Then sell it and buy  a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24 months  before or after the sale. This is the "roll-over residence replacement rule" of  Internal Revenue Code 1034.  </P> <P> The tax code does not require a minimum occupancy time but most CPAs recommend  six to 12 months. Please consult your tax adviser for further details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life Estate May Protect Property for a Son  </P> <P> Q: We have three wonderful adult sons. I am 74 and my husband is 82. As we both  have heart problems, we could die any day. One of our children is mildly  retarded and we want to be sure he receives our house when we die.  </P> <P> He lives with us now. But we are worried about one son who might challenge our  wills, since my husband has Alzheimer's disease. In your opinion, what is the  best way to make certain our retarded son receives our home? Incidentally, we  have provided for all three sons through a trust, so they will have handsome  incomes.  </P> <P> A: A life estate could solve your problem. You could deed your home to the  retarded son now but reserve a life estate in it for the lives of you and your  husband. It would then be very difficult for either of your other sons to take  the house away from the retarded son after you both pass away. But please  consult your attorney and tax adviser for further details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Need to Reinvest All in Replacement  </P> <P> Q: Two months ago, we sold our home. But after paying off our mortgage and  pressing personal bills we have only about $33,000 left with which to buy  another house. Our real estate man says we must reinvest all the cash from our  home sale into a replacement home if we are to avoid paying tax on our sale  profit, which was about $58,000. How can we get out of this mess?  </P> <P> A: What mess? To defer the tax on your home sale you do not have to reinvest  all your cash received into the purchase of a replacement home. Your real  estate agent is mistaken.  </P> <P> All that matters if you are to avoid paying tax on your sale profit is that you  buy and occupy a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost  within 24 months before or after the sale of your old home. Internal Revenue  Code 1034, known as the "roll-over residence replacement rule," says nothing  about reinvesting all the cash received from your home sale into the purchase  of a replacement home.  </P> <P> An extreme qualifying example would occur if you sold your old home for all  cash and bought a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost for  nothing down, such as with a no down payment VA mortgage. Then you could pocket  the tax-deferred cash to spend as you wish. Please consult your tax adviser for  more details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Sale Tax Losses Are Not Deductable  </P> <P> Q: We bought our home last year, expecting to stay here forever. But then my  wife received a tremendous job opportunity in New York City. Since I am a  free-lance writer and can live anywhere, we decided to sell our home and move.  But our problem is, if we sell our home we will have a loss of about $6,500 on  the sale of our home after we pay the realtor's commission. Is this loss tax  deductible?  </P> <P> A: No. Unfortunately, losses on the sale of your personal residence are not tax  deductible. But Uncle Sam is very quick to tax home sale profits, unless the  sale qualifies for the "over 55 rule" $125,000 tax exemption or the "roll-over  residence replacement rule" tax deferral. Please consult your tax adviser for  further details.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Control of Prices and Investment"] </F>   [Text] It is necessary to create jobs, but to this end it  is necessary to have capital, which we do not yet have in  sufficient quantity for accelerated growth. The only solution  for resolving this problem is to make use of foreign savings --  not in the form of loans attracted by interest rates that are  much higher than in other markets, but in the form of direct  investment, which brings not only the funds for creating jobs  but the technology with which it is possible to face  international competition. Now the first result of the law on  the so-called abuse of economic power will be to push foreign  capital away from our country.    So far the strongest obstacle to foreign capital has been a  very high inflation rate and protectionism, which impeded  production under the proper conditions. We liberalized our  economy, and in some sectors it was possible to reduce domestic  prices by importing modern components that made it possible for  us to compete abroad, streamlining production costs. The Real  Plan has brought hope for the return of a "civilized" inflation  rate. We can hope to once again receive foreign investment,  which in recent years has dropped remarkably. Yet Congress has  just approved an antitrust law that actually seeks to reinstate  a price control system that is even more harmful than direct  control, because it produces uncertainty. Under such conditions  the country will push foreign capital even farther away. In  order to attract foreign capital, Brazil has for several years  been said to have -- unlike other countries -- a large potential  domestic market. It so happens that this advantage is  disappearing with the creation of Mercosur [Common Market of the  South], as foreign investors can settle in one of the other  Mercosur signatory countries, which sooner or later will be  joined by Chile, in order to conquer the Brazilian market.  Foreign investors will undoubtedly choose the countries  offering the best conditions, especially those without price  control. Now having more than 30 percent of the market is a  mortal sin in Brazil, a sin that condemns an enterprise to  several suspicions that can result not only in heavy monetary  fines but also in the stealing of its technology...    We do not know whether our lawmakers thought about this when  they approved a law that condemned us to remain behind  technological progress in the modern world. It is good to know  that this has favored our Mercosur partners, which will be able  to create jobs, enlarge their domestic markets, and conquer the  Brazilian market without any difficulty, unless we resign our  participation in an organization that is only one step forward  toward the globalization of the economy.</p>

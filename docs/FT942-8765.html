			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Thatcher to answer questions on dam Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, is to accept an invitation to appear before a Commons committee investigating the link between arms sales to Malaysia and aid for the Pergau dam, James Blitz writes. Staff at Lady Thatcher's office said yesterday that she would announce her acceptance of the invitation from the foreign affairs committee later this week. She will be the first former prime minister to give evidence to a parliamentary select committee. As a member of the Lords, Lady Thatcher is not legally bound to appear. MPs believe, however, that she can throw light on attempts to link an offer of Pounds 234m of aid to Malaysia and defence equipment sales of Pounds 1bn. Such a link is contrary to government guidelines on aid and trade.</p>

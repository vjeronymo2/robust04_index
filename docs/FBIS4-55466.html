			<p>BFN     [Text] A two-day session of the first congress of the  Communist Party of Slovakia [KSS] ended in Levice today with the  adoption of final documents. The party's policy reaffirms that  the KSS is a Marxist party, the objective of which is to build  socialism, a democratic society with political and economic  plurality, a society that would be self-administered,  prosperous, and socially just. The party's policy says that if  this party fails to win a partner for a joint course of action,  it will go into the elections as an independent political  entity. The delegates reelected Vladimir Dado as KSS chairman,  and (Ladislav Jaco) was elected KSS central secretary.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> MISTRIAL DECLARED IN TEEN'S MURDER CASE  </P> <P> A Ventura County Superior Court judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors  failed to reach a verdict in the murder case of a 17-year-old immigrant accused  of stabbing a Thousand Oaks nurseryman last spring.  </P> <P> After deliberating for 12 hours over three days, the jury found Jose Luis  Navarro, 17, not guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of Jose Narvaez,  49, who died of deep stab wounds on April 19 in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> But the jurors deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal on a charge of  second-degree murder, and Judge Charles R. McGrath declared a mistrial, which  could mean that Navarro will be re-tried, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes  said.  </P> <P> A hearing is set for Monday to schedule further proceedings, Holmes said.  </P> <P> Navarro testified that he had sodomized Narvaez that night. But he told jurors  that he stabbed Narvaez in self-defense when Narvaez tried forcibly to sodomize  him.  </P> <P> Narvaez was stabbed once in the stomach and three times in the back with a 9  1/2-inch butcher knife.  </P> <P> Holmes declined to disclose details of what jurors told him about their failure  to reach a unanimous verdict. But he said the jury "had problems with the case"  in determining whether Navarro killed Narvaez in self-defense.  </P> <P> Navarro is being held at the Ventura County Juvenile Hall in lieu of $250,000  bail.

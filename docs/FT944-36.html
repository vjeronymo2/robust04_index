			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Farewell to a passionate man - John Osborne, who died last week, always aroused fierce emotions. International director William Gaskill recalls his own personal and professional encounters with the controversial playwright I first met John Osborne in 1956 when I was an unknown, out of work director and Look Back in Anger had not yet been produced. Tony Richardson, the play's first director, had given me the text to read and I was bowled over by the passion and virility of the writing. Soon after, Tony invited me to his flat to have dinner with Osborne. I suppose I had imagined a shaggy, haired, open'necked intellectual. John arrived in blazer and bow tie, very neat, a bit flash and accompanied by his flat mate - or rather his boat mate - Tony Creighton, who was diminutive and prissy and wore a kilt. Creighton had co-authored John's early play Epitaph for George Dillon. It emerged that Osborne and Creighton were vegetarians. Were they also gay (or queer, as we said then)? Richardson and I whispered speculatively to each other in the kitchen. We never found out - John's diatribes against homosexuals in later years were as virulent as his attacks on women, Australians, Americans and critics. John wrote as he spoke and could, if he wanted, speak as well as he wrote. Even then the passion would surface beneath the laid back theatrical drawl, with its mocking nasal twang and it was the immediacy of his feelings and his ability to communicate them so directly to his own generation that were to characterise his work at the Royal Court. It wasn't until the end of 1957 that I went to work at the Court as assistant to the director George Devine. Look Back in Anger had been followed by the huge success of The Entertainer and both had opened on Broadway. Osborne and Richardson were in New York, which is probably why Devine asked me to direct Epitaph for George Dillon, with Robert Stephens in his first leading part. It is a conventional three act play about an out of work actor-writer and his impact on the suburban household where he lodges. But there is a remarkable scene between Dillon - a first sketch for Jimmy Porter - and the Communist intellectual aunt in the house (the only time John wrote a give-and-take scene between a man and a woman). The play did well at the Court, transferred to the West End for a short run and then went to Broadway. During the rehearsals for the Broadway opening John was very much in evidence. He had become an eccentric figure who, like a Medici prince, went everywhere with his entourage - his mistress, Francine; Robert Webber, the actor, as a bodyguard; and his black tailor, Arthur Maguy. We would go in a group to the talent night at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem and to hear Sarah Vaughan. We laughed a lot at the excesses of the Broadway scene, while loving every minute of it. Osborne and I never quarrelled but I never worked with him again. He did ask me to direct his satirical musical The World of Paul Slickey, about the world of gossip columnists, but I managed to get out of it and he ended up directing it himself. (On the disastrous first night, he was obliged to flee the theatre and was pursued along Charing Cross Road by disapproving members of the audience). When I took over the Royal Court in 1965 we put on three of his plays - Time Present, The Hotel in Amsterdam and West of Suez - all directed by Antony Page. But they failed to strike the same response in audiences as his earlier works. George Devine had died and some of Osborne's talent seemed to die with him. He was a passionate man who let his life and his writing be governed by his feelings. When it worked it was thrilling; when it didn't it was very sad.</p>

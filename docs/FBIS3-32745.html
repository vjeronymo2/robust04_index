			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin in Washington </F> by unidentified station reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota; from  "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] We greet Colombian Foreign Minister  Nohemi Sanin Posada, who is in Washington. Good morning,  Foreign Minister.    [Sanin] Good morning. We are very sad over the loss of our  ambassador to Honduras [Lucelly Garcia Montoya]. Words cannot  describe the cowardly assassination of this great patriot who  was our ambassador.    [Reporter] What official information do you have about it?    [Sanin] It is being investigated. She was a woman who served  the country. She prepared the visit of the Honduran president  [words indistinct]. She traveled quickly from Honduras to  prepare it and asked us for leave to organize [words indistinct]  all her personal matters. I awoke very saddened with the news  that she had been killed. I am really very sad with the news.    [Reporter] Did she tell you that she had been threatened?    [Sanin] No, she never did, but she did tell me that she had  never been happier than with this appointment. She said that  for a long time [words indistinct] and she was happy. I have  never seen someone so pleased, devoted to her job, and with  great spirit. She knew well international affairs because she  had been a member of the Chamber of Representatives' Second  Commission. She was very knowledgeable in her field. She was  good with little details [words indistinct] people. She was  truly an important person for Colombia because of her knowledge  of the field. She was a great woman.    [Reporter] That is how all Colombians are feeling. By the  way, what are you doing in Washington?    [Sanin] Well, I am holding bilateral talks with the State  Department. I will be meeting with Mr. Watson and Ambassador to  the OAS Babbitt. I plan to talk with the 34 ambassadors to the  OAS. I am talking about the possibility of President Gaviria's  candidacy [to OAS secretary general] and about [words  indistinct] the course that the OAS should take. The president  has been receiving opinions not only about the vote but also  about the OAS philosophy to see if these opinions agree with the  president's view of what the OAS should be.    [Reporter] What do you think about the debate that has  arisen  over the differences of opinion between the State Council and  the president over the presence of U.S. soldiers in our country?  Do you think all this debate, which many think has weakened the  president in Colombia, can jeopardize Cesar Gaviria's candidacy  for OAS secretary general?    [Sanin] No, I really do not think so. The fact is that in  Colombia we are in the middle of an election campaign. For  example, there are people who say there are Marines in Colombia  as if it were not known that those are members of a Marine  infantry corps which many times has been used as assault troops.  As you said, military engineers or soldiers (?came). I totally  agree with the president's viewpoint. I also totally agree with  the defense minister in his explanation that perhaps the  ministry did not provide good information about these military  engineers. What is really going on? What must the country be  told? Military members always train. They always undertake  simulations of possible occurrences. When these actions are  carried out with other countries, some of them are covered by  international treaties. There is cooperation, technology is  provided, and projects are carried out to train and to simulate  situations that might occur, for example, an air attack. Then  they would carry out air cooperation operations. For example,  there is the Unitas exercise, which is staged in the territorial  sea of various countries and all the navies agree to simulate a  naval attack. On land, the engineers simulate circumstances and  instead of building barricades or useless structures, they train  by quickly building a school, a road, or a health center to show  how quickly this can be done jointly through cooperation. In  this way, they can show how our engineers and the engineers from  the United States, in this case, can work quickly and resolve  problems by simulating specific operations.    I think there was a shortage of information on the part of  the government but I do not think that sovereignty was harmed in  any case. The Colombian Armed Forces have always been in  control of sovereignty. We have always acted in keeping with  the principles of international agreements. [Words indistinct]  information and a political use of the electoral situation in  Colombia. I think the State Council has not condemned anyone  because it has declared itself [word indistinct] and has  remitted the circumstances to the Commission of Charges, but I  am sure that with the explanations that the government has given  based on international treaties and the military cooperation  agreements, and the explanations that the government has  obviously [words indistinct] internationally will be understood  because all the countries of America and the world have  international cooperation agreements. Through them, they  jointly simulate situations that might occur and they work on  training for them. It is like target practice, building a  retaining wall, like any training that must take place because  of military, security, or other circumstances. For example, in  the area of radar, we do not have the required technology so the  military engineers train the Colombian engineers. We cannot  confuse this with sovereignty.    [Reporter] Madam Minister, was the Foreign Ministry  consulted? Did you agree from the start with the presence of  those U.S. soldiers in our country?    [Sanin] The Foreign Ministry did not have to be consulted. I  was not consulted because this was based on existing treaties.  Then, I would have to be consulted every day because every day  [words indistinct] building (?naval) schools for example. Among  the existing agreements.... [pauses] My staff would have to  consult with the Senate and the State Council if it is meeting  [word indistinct] the joint operations that have been agreed on  with different countries. The Foreign Ministry was not  consulted, nor do I think from a legal standpoint that the  Foreign Ministry should have been consulted. These are normal  training operations that are conducted, I repeat, to rehearse  situations that may arise and allow our military engineers to  resolve them quickly. Building a [word indistinct] quickly and  effectively. That is what they are doing.    [Reporter] In reacting irately yesterday to the State  Council  position, President Gaviria defended the war on drugs, and  (?almost) called those who disagree with him enemies of that  war. My question is this: Why were the people not told from  the start: soldiers are coming because they are cooperating in  the war on drugs? Why didn't the government say what it was  instead of something else that led to this controversy?    [Sanin] I think a mistake was made how the information was  given. Part of this whole cooperation is the war on drugs. It  is not the only thing, because they practice operations to face  different kinds of circumstances, namely, the war on crime or  defense of national security. Why did the president respond  irately? Because [words indistinct] to be told that national  sovereignty was violated. He is responding in proportion to the  circumstances. The accusation is very grave, and we feel that,  based on solid legal arguments and the existing military  agreements, these exercises could be conducted without  requesting the permission of the Senate or the State Council.  Now, I share the defense minister's view that the country  should have been told in a normal manner that U.S. military  engineers were coming to participate in such and such training  and operations.    On the other hand, we cannot comment on all military  operations. Imagine, how could we fight crime if we were to  announce that in such and such place a cooperation operation was  going to be.... [pauses] that a telecommunications apparatus to  monitor voices was located in such and such place.  Technological cooperation to combat crime would not be  effective then. These operations have to be kept secret and  guarded by the military. The Foreign Ministry knew that for  over 30 years these joint operations have been conducted. The  Foreign Ministry has never been informed because they fall  within a legal framework and treaties. I do agree with the  president and the defense minister that the topic should be  handled differently, and that the initial information given....  [pauses] They were not prepared for the question, certainly,  and it was incomplete. They did not explain as they have now  that these are training exercises. Instead of [words indistinct]  building roadblocks that served no purpose, the military  engineers are building a school, or a road, or anything to be  able to efficiently build what may be necessary for a specific  event.    [Reporter] The Council of State president's reaction to  President Gaviria's position in the sense that the Council of  State statement endangers international cooperation against drug  trafficking was: Were they building a school or struggling  against drug trafficking? My question is: Have you just  confirmed that there is an operation against drug trafficking in  Juanchaco?    [Sanin] Look, the activities in Juanchaco are related to  cooperation in military engineering. There have been joint  exercises simulating possible situations that include quickly  and efficiently constructing facilities to handle specific  situations related to drug trafficking crimes. Instead of  wasting time building a barricade or a useless road, they are  building a school and a health center for the community.    Within the cooperation agreements I have mentioned,  obviously  many are part of international cooperation in the struggle  against drug trafficking. Why? Because fortunately today  Colombia is not struggling alone. All recent successful  actions, which fortunately have been recognized by the  international community, have been carried out with technology  from other countries, from several countries, that have made  available to us equipment to track down the voices and locate  the place where drug traffickers or kidnappers are hiding or to  deal with situations that really endanger our national  sovereignty, security, or citizens' lives.    There are no contradictions. They were in an operation  involving military engineering and joint training. Both our  military engineers and U.S. engineers were training together in  harmony, learning how to quickly build facilities that could be  necessary under a given circumstance, such as building a road, a  base, and many other aspects a country may need for its defense.  This joint training is based on existing agreements. Our  engineers are acquiring new skills to build facilities quickly.  They have experience and must practice, just as they jog, fly  planes, or practice target shooting every day. It is part of  their training to prepare them for the struggle against crime  and drug trafficking, and to defend our national security and  people's lives. There are so many circumstances we may have to  face. There have been no lies, and there is no contradiction.  The information was initially incomplete.    [Reporter] With regard to doing an efficient and quick job,  yesterday, a group of journalists invited by the Defense  Ministry visited the projects under construction by a group you  described as military engineers in Juanchaco, and found out that  the projects are incomplete and will not be completed before 28  February, the date when U.S. soldiers and military engineers  must leave the country. Does this mean their stay in our country  will be extended? Definitely, they will not be able to meet the  deadline. The supervisors have said that they will not have  enough time between now and 28 February to efficiently and  quickly complete their work.    [Sanin] Training means learning to do a job. I do not know  if they are doing a good, bad, or fair job. That must be  determined by the supervisors of the military engineers who are  being trained, and the defense minister. The Defense Ministry  must decide when they will leave. The decision must be made  within the legal framework. I do not know if they will be able  to complete the work they began. I hope they can. In any event,  they are participating in a training program. When journalists  are being trained, I do not know if their performance is good,  bad, or fair. I know they must be trained, because they are not  going to be asked to do a program without any training. This is  a military training program during which facilities are being  built for the benefit of the community. If they are not able to  complete the work before they leave, at least they started it,  and the community can do the rest. It was not a waste of time,  no useless walls or roads were built. The training was an  opportunity to build facilities for the benefit of the  community, which in my opinion was good. Since they were going  to learn how to build quickly, it would have been silly to build  a barricade that would serve no purpose instead of a project  that will benefit the community.    [Reporter] Madam Minister, the president of the Republic  during a news conference yesterday upheld or upholds that the  Council of State statement is a political statement. You have  also said that in all these circumstance there is a political or  politically biased climate. Is it not strange for those  accusations to be made against the top body of administrative  justice in Colombia given that the ruling was unanimous. The  authors of that measure were 26 justices: 14 Liberal Party and  12 Conservative Party members.    [Sanin] I have not seen the ruling, I have only seen the  press communique that does not contain the legal arguments most  certainly included in the ruling. I remove myself from the  Council of State position, with all due respect, as this is the  institution at the highest level on this issue. I totally  remove myself because all these military cooperation agreements  are contained within a legal framework established in agreements  and treaties that have been in force for more than 30 years.    I want to repeat, however, I have only seen the press  communique. I remove my myself from its concept because all of  these military exercises are undertaken in all the nations  within the same legal framework as ours; they do not attack  sovereignty. [Words indistinct] meaning of something very  important that should be known; transit and stationing of  troops. By international law, a nation can lose its state of  neutrality when it allows the transit or stationing of foreign  troops to mobilize against a third nation. Therefore, the nation  that allows that transit, that stationing loses its state of  neutrality. We are not faced with any war situation with any  neighboring nation or with the stationing of hostile troops.  They are simply, as I said, training. They are training during  military cooperation exercises in addition to cooperating in the  struggle against drug trafficking and other crimes. That is the  truth, that should have been said since the beginning.    [Reporter] In another turn or events, Madam Minister, the  Venezuelan foreign minister has just said that Colombia and  Venezuela could reach an agreement any moment now on the  limitation of maritime and submarine areas. Do you agree?    [Sanin] There are some negotiating committees appointed by  the nation made up of Colombians who are politically well-known  and very well informed on the matter. I have hopes that one day  we will find the solution to the limitation of the maritime  areas. It is impossible, however, to give a date. What is  important is to reach a balanced decision, accepted by both  nations, convenient for both nations, thereby solving this  conflict. It is very difficult to know when. However, my  intentions are geared toward finding a solution.</p>

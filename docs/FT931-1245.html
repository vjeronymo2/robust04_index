			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / People: Brooks extends her Sotheby's empire Diana Brooks, president and chief executive of Sotheby's North and South America, has had her empire extended after her region did somewhat better than the rest of the group in difficult conditions last year. She steps up to the specially created position of president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's, in charge of the auction house's business worldwide. Michael Ainslie, 49, remains president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of the auction, finance and real estate operations. He explained that Brooks' promotion would enable him to spend more time with major international clients and on strategic decisions, but one analyst, who commented that the real substance of Ainslie's role remained unclear, surmised that 43-year-old Brooks was now effectively chief executive. Whereas she used to report to Ainslie alongside Roger Faxon, managing director of Sotheby's Europe, and Julian Thompson, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, Faxon and Thompson now report to her. The other parts of the group have underperformed America, and market share has been lost to Christie's, the traditionally less aggressive rival. In 1992 Sotheby's pre-tax profits fell from Dollars 21.5m to Dollars 6.49m. A Yale graduate with a degree in American studies, Brooks joined Sotheby's in 1979. Six years later she was made chief operating officer, before becoming president of North and South America in 1987 and chief executive officer in 1990. She has built herself a formidable reputation on both sides of the Atlantic. 'Dede shoots from the hip and doesn't tend to miss,' says one observer who has watched her in operation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Some of Moscow's industrial enterprises dealing with  radioactive materials do not pass all of the radioactive waste  to the Radon processing amalgamation. As a result, there are  about 70 places contaminated with radioactive substances on the  premises of Moscow's enterprises and even in the vicinity of  apartment blocks, the Moscow Environmental Protection Committee  told Interfax. Almost all of them have been eliminated by now,  except 18 storages of low-radioactive waste in Krylatskoye,  Lyublino, Strogino and some other districts.    The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee believes that  as such these sites pose no threat to the population. But  before building housing on them decontamination measures must be  taken. The decontamination of one of such site, 26 kilometers  from Moscow, is being completed.    The same source reports that there are more than 1,500  enterprises and organizations in Moscow which use nuclear  reactors, radioactive materials and products.    The worst danger is coming from 769 enterprises which create  radioactive waste. In 1993, radiation control inspectors  revealed 288 instances of violation of safety rules.    The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee announced that  on the whole, Moscow's radiation level is light and measures 7  to 14 microroentgen per hour.</p>

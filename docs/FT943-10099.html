			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Moves afoot at the Accademia What is going on at the Accademia Italiana, which for five years brightened up London with some impressive exhibitions of Italian culture and even better parties? Last week seven of the 11 staff were made redundant and the Accademia will shortly leave its grand Rutland Gate premises for the decidedly utilitarian Smith Galleries in Covent Garden. According to its moving spirit, Rosa-Maria Letts, the Accademia is still up and running, with six shows of modern Italian art scheduled. One, devoted to the cultural ramifications of footwear, should cause as great a stir as the recent in-depth investigation of the bra. In addition Mrs Letts is energetically fund-raising for a new venture, the European Academy, which, sponsors willing, will add arts from other countries to the exhibition list. These expansionary plans are very galling to the 180 unpaid creditors of the Accademia, who range from advertising agencies, security firms and transportation companies to its previous landlord, Glaxo. They are owed a collective Pounds 480,000 and have been promised 54p in the pound if they are patient, perhaps for years. They would prefer that some of the new money being raised from Italian sponsors went to them rather than on ambitious ventures, like negotiating to take over the Italianate Royal College of Organists as the future home of the various Academies. Next week-end sees the start of the Edinburgh Festival. The omens look good. The box office has already taken around Pounds 1.3m towards its Pounds 2m target, more than it secured during the whole of the 1992 Festival. Even the inevitable last minute crisis has already happened - the NDR Orchestra from Hamburg has cancelled its performance of Bruckner 8, citing rehearsal problems, although it is still coming over for Beethoven. What with the 1993 Festival registering a Pounds 12,000 profit; the old row over the absence of a decent opera venue resolved by the opening of the Festival Theatre; and the local District and Regional Councils, now fully supportive and substantially raising their funding, this long running controversy is now a success.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Good for buyers, less so for sellers - Wine auctions For the first year since 1990, when the long, steady increase in London wine auction prices was halted, Christie's and Sotheby's increased their turnover in the 1993-1994 season. Christie's total sales rose in the UK from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 7.4m and Sotheby's from Pounds 2.38 to Pounds 2.62m. The year-end figures were helped by exceptional sales. Sotheby's, which has generally restricted wine auctions to the UK, achieved a substantial addition by the sale in Germany of the Thurn and Taxis wines that yielded Pounds 863,000. In June, Christie's held the largest ever private-cellar auction. It belonged to Dr Remington Norman, a former member of the wine trade and an author. With buyer's premium it yielded Pounds 1.5m, and some prices of leading wines well exceeded their normal market level - Pounds 5,800 for a case of Mouton Rothschild '61 (Pounds 4,200) Pounds 5,000 for Latour '61 (Pounds 4,000) and Pounds 720 for Taylor '63 (Pounds 600). These obviously had some affect on the accompanying average top 1994 first-growth and vintage port tables. Far East wine buyers were prominent in Sotheby's June auction. To commemorate the company's 250th anniversary, Philippe de Rothschild had given four uncommonly large bottles of Mouton-Rothschild: one Jeroboam (six bottles) of 1945 that fetched Pounds 14,250, and three Nebuchadnezzars (15 bottles) of 1975, 1982, and 1990 that made Pounds 9,900, Pounds 13,750 and Pounds 12,650 - much higher than the estimate. They were bought by a far eastern bidder. Sotheby's does not provide an analysis of its annual wine sales, but Christie's, in its King St auctions, increased the average lot value from Pounds 391 to Pounds 483. Overall in the UK it slightly upped the percentage of lots sold from 90 to 91 per cent. On the other hand its overseas sales were well down, as it gave up US auctions that last year had yielded Pounds 2.6m; (see Antony Thorncroft's story below). The accompanying table shows the average highest London auction house prices between 1990 and 1994 of first-growth clarets and vintage ports. Figures in the first-growth table, which omits Petrus as its saleroom prices are so much higher than the others as to distort the averages, have risen above their previous peak in 1990 - without taking account of inflation. Among the nine other most prominent classed-growth clarets, recovery in prices began more markedly in 1993, with less advance this year. Apart from the increasingly rare '61s, the most sought-after vintage is '82, while '83 and '85 are probably under-valued. Although the '89s and '90s will be increasingly popular vintages, their initial prices were so high, and the quantities made so ample, that their saleroom prices may depend to a great extent on inflation. The sad wine, traditionally bought for long-keeping or investment, is vintage port. The average top auction price this year is still below the 1990 level, although there is a clear difference between Fonseca, Graham and Taylor and the other five leading ports. The three have been showing some price life, but nothing to compare with the quality and the original price of great vintages such as '63 and '77. Assuming that the pace of economic recovery is mirrored in the wine saleroom, the current period may be looked on as good for buyers, but less so for sellers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST-GROWTH CLARETS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Vintage             1990       1994 (Jan-July)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1961                3567       3817 1970                 865        965 1982                 908       1073 1985                 402        445 1986                 443        632 1989                            617  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average highest pricd per dozen - Chx Cheval-Blanc, Haut-Brion Lafite, Latour, Margaux, Mouton-Rothschild.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VINTAGE PORT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Vintage             1990       1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1963                 493        464 1970                 256        250 1977                 244        234 1983                 143        119 1985                 157        153  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cockburn, Croft, Dow, Fonseca, Graham, Novel, Taylor, Warre.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In calculating average top prices, account has been taken of whether a wine had not been auctioned in that year, and whether a shipper had not declared that vintage.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Edmund Penning-Rowsell  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

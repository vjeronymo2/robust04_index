			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / The ships come in at last for P&amp;O: Ferries and cruise lines repay heavy investment A buoyant performance by Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company's cruise and cross-channel ferry operations helped yesterday to propel its share price 21p higher to 674p. P&amp;O's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 291.6m to Pounds 126.4m for the six months to June 30, but the 1993 figure included Pounds 200m profits from disposals, primarily of contract caterer Sutcliffe Services. The 1994 figure included a Pounds 4.4m exceptional profit. Profit before exceptional items, however, rose 52 per cent from Pounds 80.1m to Pounds 122m, pushed by P&amp;O's shipping businesses, which are finally justifying the substantial investment made over the past five years. Turnover rose 1.6 per cent from to Pounds 2.69bn to Pounds 2.73bn, but P&amp;O benefited from the operational gearing of its shipping businesses, which have a high level of fixed costs. The ferries division, for which about 70 per cent of profits come from the Dover-Calais route, more than doubled profits from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 26.6m in spite of continuing competition on fares. P&amp;O now has about 60 per cent share of the cross-channel passenger market, and it carried 37 per cent more passengers during the period. Freight units increased slightly more, helped by the oft-postponed start-up of the Channel Tunnel. Consensus forecasts for the full year increased by about Pounds 20m to Pounds 320m (before exceptional items), but analysts warned that the tunnel threat was merely deferred, and could knock Pounds 50m off operating profits next year. However, Lord Sterling, chairman, said heavy promotion by Eurotunnel would help to expand the overall market. P&amp;O's cruise liners also thrived on the economic recovery in its primary markets of the US and UK, with profits up 25 per cent from Pounds 34m to Pounds 42.4m. Lord Sterling said cruise bookings for 1995 were 'nicely up on this year', and the company should benefit from the launching of two new ships next year. The containers division increased profits from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 25.7m, as volumes increased and rates gradually recovered. P&amp;O Australia, which has been the focus for the group's rapid expansion into the Asia Pacific region, also performed strongly, contributing Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 10.8m). Lord Sterling said: 'At the start of the year, prospects were looking strong in most of our businesses. This is still generally true, although the recovery in the UK is still rather patchy, and land transport, housebuilding and construction remain flat.' Bovis Homes improved from a loss of Pounds 0.3m to a profit of Pounds 0.1m, while property development reduced losses from Pounds 7.9 to Pounds 0.7m Interest costs fell from Pounds 63.5m to Pounds 59.2m, despite a rise in net borrowings to Pounds 1.61bn, as P&amp;O has invested Pounds 297.6m in fixed assets, primarily ships, and a further Pounds 27.6m on acquisitions during the period. Lord Sterling said P&amp;O was comfortable with gearing of 61 per cent, but he indicated that further property disposals were likely in 1995. The interim dividend is maintained at 13.5p, but it is covered by recurrent earnings for the first time since 1990. Earnings per share were 13.8p (39.3p). Lex, Page 20</p>

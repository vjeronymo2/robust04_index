			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- "Fate has given us 24  hours to be dispirited; now this time has passed, we have no  right to delay," Prime Minister Peter Boross, Deputy Chairman of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), told his party's National  Board today. The senior party of Hungary's governing coalition  won 11.3 percent of the votes cast on party list in the first  round of the parliamentary elections on Sunday. (Four years ago  the MDF scored 24.73 percent of votes in the first round.) The  MDF now trails the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (33  percent) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (19.76 percent) for  third place.    Over the past four years, the MDF has accomplished a  historic  performance by laying down the constitutional foundations of  multi-party parliamentary democracy and creating a legal  background to transition to a social market economy, Boross  said. The PM claimed the MDF had subordinated its interests and  popularity to the needs of the country and the nation.    In a joint declaration, the MDF National Board warned  against  the danger of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) winning more than two thirds  of seats and thus gaining excessive power, something undesirable  in a parliamentary democracy. The Board calls upon all who want  to halt this excessive win to support in the second round the  100 MDF candidates still in contention.    The MDF hopes to create a political counterweight, to  guarantee a controlled, democratic order of parliamentary  decision-making. The Board proposed the MDF should start talks  with the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) on  second-round cooperation. The Board also proposed that the  local MDF groups should make electoral deals with the Christian  Democrats and the Smallholders, but should not negotiate similar  deals with the Free Democrats.</p>

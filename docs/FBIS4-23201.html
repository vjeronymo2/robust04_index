			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has reacted to the  interview given by [French Cooperation Minister] Michel Roussin.  In a statement, the RPF has denied that massacres took place as  a result of the withdrawal of French troops last November. The  RPF points out that there were a number of reports of massacres  of civilians at a time when and in regions where French soldiers  were present. The rebel movement also questioned how France  could explain that it had evacuated only members of the former  ruling party and refused to protect the family of the prime  minister designated by the Arusha peace accords -- end of  quotation.</p>

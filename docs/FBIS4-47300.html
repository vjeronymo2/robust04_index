Vavilov;  UDC 681.327.12.001]    [Abstract] A technical sighting system for prevention of  railroad train collisions is being designed, a major role being  assigned to semaphores. Its three basic tasks are to detect  objects (obstacles), to identify them, and to decode their  encoded position. A telephoto camera with an optoelectronic  receiver of semaphore lights feeds images to a detector (image  converter). The latter sends signals to: 1. an object identifier  followed by a semaphore lights color analyzer, 2. a  stereorangefinder, 3. a path analyzer. A generator of brake  activation signals, upon receiving signals from these three  sources, transmits an output signal to the brake servomechanism.  The stereorangefinder and the tracking device are interfaced,  the latter sending signals to a light source for the road. In  the stereorangefinder a right prism with mirror faces is placed  symmetrically between two terminal reflectors of incident light.  This prism combines the light coming from both reflectors into a  single beam and sends that beam through an intensity regulator  into an objective followed successively by a focus magnifier and  a beam splitter. Two hoods, one around each reflector, prevent  entry of sunlight or the headlight beam of a train into the  system. The spectral sensitivity band of the system is 0.45-0.90  m, which covers both visible and near infrared light so that  the system can respond to semaphore lights of all three colors:  green (0.51-0.55 m) - yellow (0.57-0.59 m) - red  (0.62-0.78 m) semaphore lights. Object-obstacle  identification is based on geometrical characteristics. The  color of a semaphore light is identified by spectral  discrimination. The path analyzer has an autointerrogator with  an exclusive-NOR gate, and a decoder followed successively by a  comparator, a memory, and an autoresponder. Figures 4;  references 3.</p>

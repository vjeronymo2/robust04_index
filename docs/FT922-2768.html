			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (2): Bulldog tenacity needed - Andrew Hill talks to Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister MR Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious new prime minister, is just three months into his government, but he has already got his teeth into the two basic problems which cast a shadow over Belgium's future: constitutional reform and the cleaning up of the country's public finances. But the 51-year-old Flemish Christian Democrat will need all his bulldog tenacity if his administration is to survive the summer and complete its four-year term. The government - like its prime minister - is small, but weighty. Mr Dehaene admits it is 'un peu non-classique' by Belgian standards, with just 16 ministers (half the usual number) and a concise legislative programme. It also moves fast: an emergency budget for 1992 was wrapped up in just three days. What the centre-left coalition lacks is the two-thirds parliamentary majority necessary to carry through the next stage of constitutional reform  -a flaw which has led doubters to conclude that it is simply a stop-gap administration which will disintegrate as soon as it is tested on this fundamental issue. Mr Dehaene himself warns against such short-termism. 'You have to be careful not to assume that because there are fewer pages (in our programme) and it's less detailed, that it doesn't have much of a long-term view. One of the challenges I'm faced with is to prove that a government doesn't have to have a legislative Bible to function properly,' he says. Mr Dehaene was a loyal supporter of his long-serving predecessor, Mr Wilfried Martens, over nearly 13 years. Now he has graduated from the vice-premiership to the top spot, he seems determined to do the job properly in spite of all the obstacles to efficient government which Belgian politics throws up. So, in the hope that a two-thirds majority will evolve, Mr Dehaene has set in motion a 'dialogue of the communities' - Flemish- and French-speaking politicians talking through the country's constitutional problems. Interviewed by the Financial Times last month, the prime minister was confident that the dialogue would not end inconclusively. 'It's wrong to say that nothing will come out of this,' he said. 'Most of the people taking part are doing so with the will to reach an agreement.' Almost everything else of significance that Mr Dehaene wants to do depends on the success of the dialogue. The 1992 emergency budget measures were mainly an attempt to patch up damage caused by economic neglect during the long political interregnum. The 1993 budget, which should be negotiated in the first weeks of August if all goes according to plan, is intended to tackle the deeper-rooted problem of the budget deficit - which has to halve from about 6 per cent to just 3 per cent of GDP by 1996 if Belgium is to fulfil the European Community's criteria for membership of a currency union. This, as Mr Dehaene has already made clear, will be painful, but he is convinced that it is essential - even if the people are not. 'I recognise it's difficult for the population to understand,' he says. 'The (economic) crisis at the beginning of the 1980s was something that everybody felt - everyone knew someone who was unemployed and everybody realised we had to make an effort. But because of everything that was done then, people now have the impression they're living in a healthy economy at a previously unknown level of well-being. According to public opinion, the state budget is the politicians' - not the people's - business.' Mr Dehaene says this is a burden which should be borne jointly by the people and the politicians. He draws a parallel with the public's road safety duties - a good analogy for Belgium, home to some of Europe's least tolerant drivers: 'Everyone complains about road safety. Politicians can contribute to solving the problem by making a certain number of rules. But in the end, if each citizen sitting behind his steering wheel, inside his steel shell, thinks that he has right on his side and that the rules were made for others and not for him, no amount of political repression is going to solve the problem.' Mr Dehaene criticises individuals who 'cocoon' themselves to escape their public duties. He says this 'deep malaise' is part of the explanation for the anti-political reaction of voters in the Belgian elections. At the Lisbon summit, on June 26-27, Mr Dehaene will get his first chance to discuss that malaise with other EC leaders who have suffered a similar electoral backlash over the past year. For a man fascinated by domestic politics, but who has hardly dabbled in foreign policy, this will be a new experience. Indeed, to get himself into the swing of summit politics, Mr Dehaene has been touring some Community capitals over the past few weeks. Last month, before his grand tour, it was clear that there was unlikely to be any great change in Belgium's staunch pro-European stance under Mr Dehaene's leadership. The new prime minister wants the European Community to be open to new candidates, but also to build on its existing strengths - widening and deepening, to use the Euro-terminology. 'Unity in diversity should be the leitmotif of what we do during the years to come,' he explained. And what of Belgium itself? With its constant bickering between linguistic communities, its institutional complexities and its fragmented politics is it really a good example to the Community of a federal system in action? Mr Dehaene pauses before answering. 'We're a good example of how to try to recognise the autonomy of entities which have specific characteristics, and aspirations to independence, lawfully and peacefully,' he replies. 'In several parts of Europe this (move to independence) is being accompanied by conflict and deaths. What we've achieved in Belgium, without being ideal, is a peaceful and lawful restructuring. That's created a model with a certain complexity - but we're dealing with a complex reality.'</p>

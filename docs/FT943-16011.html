			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Depositary receipts hit record Foreign companies selling their shares to US investors in the form of American depositary receipts (ADRs) and general depositary receipts (GDRs) in the first half of this year raised a record amount, in spite of the slump in US and international stock markets. According to statistics compiled by the Bank of New York, 68 non-US companies raised Dollars 8.6bn between January and June through offerings of ADRs and GDRs, the dollar-denominated baskets of foreign company shares which are held on deposit at US banks and sold to US investors. That compares with the 27 issuers which raised Dollars 4.9bn in the first six months of 1993. European companies were leading issuers of depositary receipts with 23 offerings raising Dollars 4bn. Latin American companies raised Dollars 2.2bn, and Indian companies accounted for most of the Dollars 1.9bn raised by Asian companies. The Bank of New York, the leading US sponsor of foreign companies' depositary receipt programmes, also said the volume of ADR and GDR trading reached a record level in the first half of the year at 3.6bn shares. The growth in the ADR market indicates that foreign companies do not believe that this year's slump in stock markets worldwide has diminished US investors appetite for foreign stocks. If anything, it is likely that the poor performance of US share prices - this year the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered consecutive quarterly declines for the first time since 1984 - persuaded more US investors unhappy with the returns on their domestic holdings to buy foreign stocks.</p>

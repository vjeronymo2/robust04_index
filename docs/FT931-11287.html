			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Rate falls prompt novel debt instrument DEMAND from investors looking to preserve their income following recent falls in UK base rates yesterday prompted the first public issue of sterling-denominated instruments which pay a higher return as interest rates fall. This follows last week's launch of a wave of novel debt instruments by UK building societies which were also aimed at satisfying demand for higher-yielding sterling paper. Yesterday, Abbey National, the Halifax Building Society and Eksportfinans, the Norwegian government's import-export agency, each issued Pounds 100m worth of so-called 'reverse' floating-rate notes. The yield on these notes, for which there is a minimum investment of Pounds 100,000, increases each time interest rates fall. The notes offer the holder a fixed return of 7 per cent for the first six months. For the rest of the notes' three-year life, the coupon will be fixed at 12 3/8 per cent minus six-month Libor (London Inter Bank Offered Rate), which stood at 5 7/8 per cent yesterday. An official at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which arranged the deal for the Halifax, said there was good demand for the issue from domestic and continental institutions, especially income and money-market funds which were having difficulty in finding high-yielding sterling investments. Last week, the Leeds Permanent Building Society launched the first sterling-denominated 'collared' floating-rate notes, followed closely by Bradford &amp; Bingley and Halifax. These issues, each of Pounds 100m, offered investors a minimum interest rate (floor) and a maximum interest rate (cap). Under this structure, the holder receives a higher return than current money market rates, but will not benefit if rates rise above the level of the cap. The warm reception to yesterday's reverse floating rate notes reflected a growing feeling among investors that UK rates are set to fall further, in spite of government denials of media reports that further cuts are already planned. The issuers are believed to have taken steps to protect themselves against paying out more to the note holders in the event of a base rate cut through a series of transactions in the swap market, which has left them with floating rate liability.

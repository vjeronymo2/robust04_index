			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): The coalition that calmed a crisis NATIONAL CRISIS AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENT 1926-1932 by Philip Williamson Cambridge Pounds 60, 569 pages THE DECISION to return sterling to the gold standard was one of the many disastrous mistakes of the inter-war years. The intention to return was announced in November 1918, in the exuberant month when the war ended. It was regarded as a long-term policy aspiration of no immediate relevance and nobody took much notice. But political promises which benefit particular groups are not forgotten. From the beginning, the debate was not about whether to return to fixed exchange rates, but when. The promise was eventually redeemed in 1925 by Churchill when he was chancellor. The date was chosen for no better reason than that the government wanted to avoid having to ask Parliament for a renewal of the Act by which gold payments had been suspended. Despite the huge and differing disruptions and inflations that had occurred in the world's economies since 1914, the pound was pegged at the pre-war rate of Dollars 4.86. Seldom has a decision of such national importance been taken with so little thought. To many eyes, the exchange rate was a technical matter to be left to bankers. Others saw it in terms of national prestige. The Bank of England, still entirely independent of government, was well aware that, at that time, most British investments abroad were in fixed interest bonds. If exporting industry was rendered hopelessly uncompetitive at par, then, it argued, manufacturers should cut their costs. The UK, already in deep depression, was to pay a heavy price for this folly as the downward spiral was reinforced with falling demand leading to yet more unemployment, business failures, and social misery. The losses from the decision were estimated by Keynes at over 10 per cent of national output every year. The interesting book by Philip Williamson, National Crisis and National Government, tells how the mistake was eventually reversed. He describes day by day the course of events which led to the financial crisis of July 1931 and the replacement of the minority Labour government by the coalition of Conservatives, 'National Liberals' and a rump of Labour ministers who followed Macdonald into the National Government. Williamson has assiduously explored the papers of most of the actors in the drama. He shows how they responded to the pressures, new and unexpected, and follows the shifting alliances and compromises, both party and personal, as the crisis unfolded. His book is political history in a narrow sense, largely confined to the tumble of events as seen and interpreted by politicians at Westminster. No attempt is made to analyse the different options that were open to the government or to trace the real effects of the decisions taken. But as a study of how politics actually works his book has a relentless fascination. When the exchange rate came under pressure, it became accepted that what the country needed was 'retrenchment', meaning principally a cut in unemployment relief. The unemployed, it was argued, had benefited from the fall in prices. But then so had the owners of the gilts by which the war had been financed. In an attempt to buy the good-will of foreign financiers, the National Government imposed a further huge dose of deflation on a suffering nation. Taxes were raised by 10 per cent. Public service pay was cut, that of teachers by 15 per cent. Even when mutinies broke out in the Navy, when India looked set to be dragged down in the wake, and overt class war in the streets seemed inevitable, the policy was persisted with in a display of stolid tenacity reminiscent of the generals of the Somme. Only Keynes, Bevin and Mosley (who was not yet a fascist) showed any understanding of the real issues and choices, along with the old-fashioned patriot, the Marquess of Lothian. In the end, the Bank itself stopped gold payments on its own authority, to the amazement of Labour politicians. 'They never told us we could do that,' they were to complain later, and not without justice. For, contrary to expectation, the heavens did not fall. Indeed, things immediately started to get better. The fall in sterling was modest, and within months there was a clear revival of economic activity and a reduction in unemployment which was to continue unabated over subsequent years. The National Government had its reward. In the general election of October 1931, the coalition whose only reason for coming together had been to resist devaluation at all costs, and which had been overwhelmed in the attempt, was re-elected with the biggest majority in history. They were secure to make further disastrous decisions involving repression in India and appeasement of the dictators in Europe. The story that Williamson's book tells is deeply depressing. At a time when many voices favour the fixed exchange rates of the ERM, and when there is talk of giving responsibility for monetary policy to an independent central bank, it is of more than historical interest.</p>

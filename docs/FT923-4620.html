			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson turns in Pounds 1.6m Taylor Nelson AGB has issued its first set of results since becoming the largest market research group within the UK. That followed the merger this year of Taylor Nelson with AGB, RSGB, ASL and IMR. In the six months ended June 30 1992, the expanded group produced turnover of Pounds 20.5m and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.61m, and has declared an interim dividend of 0.1p. Earnings came to 0.63p (0.05p). Taylor Nelson's turnover rose from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 10.4m while the AGB businesses generated Pounds 10.1m since acquisition. Last year's profit was Pounds 40,000. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 625,000 included settlement of the Autocar litigation of Pounds 175,000, and provisions of Pounds 450,000 for rent arrears under original tenant liabilities resulting from the insolvency of tenants in leased properties which were sold by Addison Consultancy some years ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulbitskiy and </F> TRUD correspondent Rudolf Kolchanov: "Aid to Russia Will Be  Continued"]    [Text] Bonn, 28 Feb -- The finance ministers and leaders  of central banks of the seven leading Western countries held a  routine meeting in the German city of Kronberg last Saturday [26  February]. The participants analyzed the situation in the world  economy, noting the positive changes in it, and discussed  problems of stabilizing the Japanese yen and proposals for  lowering the bank credit rate in the FRG.    But great attention was devoted to questions connected with  giving financial aid to Russia. A. Shokhin, Russian minister of  the economy; S. Dubinin, leader of the Ministry of Finance; and  V. Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank, were invited to  the meeting in Kronberg.    Assessing the results of the meeting, at which the Western  participants linked economic aid to the achievement of financial  stability in Russia and to progress in implementing reforms,  Shokhin declared, in particular: "The majority of the Western  ministers said that the reforms in Russia must be carried out  with due regard for the need to create a system of social  protection for the population. Of course, no one in the West is  prepared to allocate money to us for the unemployed and  pensioners. But the West is showing readiness to elaborate a  joint scheme of cooperation in the sphere of social protection."    "It seems to me," Shokhin went on to point out, "that we  succeeded in convincing the finance ministers and the banks'  leaders of `the seven' that it is necessary not only to promote  the Russian reforms but also to seek new mechanisms of more  intensive financial support also for the CIS countries, which on  this basis will be able to build equitable relations with Russia  more successfully. We recommended that the finance ministers  `hurry up,' if I may use these words, and grant the first credit  lines to the CIS countries (Russia has already received $1.5  billion). This would strengthen the CIS countries' financial  position and help them to pay off their debts to Russia."    Dubinin voiced confidence that "it will now be possible to  attract to Russia the financial resources of `the seven' in the  form of not just state but also private investments."</p>

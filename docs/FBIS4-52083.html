			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai Parliament Must Be Free of Narcotics"] </F>   [Text] A Thai member of parliament has gained notoriety  after being accused by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  of involvement in the international drug trafficking movement.  As a result, his assets in the United States have been seized  and his name blacklisted as persona non grata by the United  States. It has become major news in view of the current  political situation in Thailand.    It can be said that this sort of notoriety is nothing new.  In the past, several MP's have faced similar charges in  Australia and Hong Kong; some were even imprisoned abroad based  on those convictions.    An MP who was a former political party leader and a one-time  candidate for prime minister lost any chance of becoming a  national political leader because the United States accused him  of involvement in narcotics trafficking and declared him persona  non grata. No details were ever given about his alleged  activities. It became a big story after a report citing a  Foreign Ministry official or an official of the embassy  concerned was made public. The story gradually faded away, and  whoever was concerned with the issue -- whether Thai or  foreigner -- never provided any details to clear up the  resulting confusion.    In the latest case, a USIS release claims that the DEA  provided the Thai Government with a chronology of the Thai MP's  trafficking activities dating back to 1977 and sought assistance  in gathering information on the MP's background and assets.  This was to facilitate the DEA's appeal in a California  district court to seize the MP's assets. The release also noted  that a house in Los Angeles and a Mercedes 560 SL were assets  the MP acquired with profits made by smuggling narcotics into  the United States beginning in 1977, when the MP started  smuggling shipments of one or two tons. In mid- 1987, U.S.  Customs officials seized a shipment.    Although it is merely an accusation, we believe many people  feel this causes great damage to Thailand. In particular, the  honor and prestige of the House of Representatives -- which is a  major institution in Thai society -- have been damaged because  one of its members has been accused of conduct that  international society and the United States have been trying to  suppress.    Therefore, we appeal to the president of the House and the  leader of the party the MP in question belongs to: Take  responsibility in this notorious issue by undertaking an inquiry  with the DEA and bringing the MP in person to clarify the  matter. In this way the people's skepticism can be cleared up.</p>

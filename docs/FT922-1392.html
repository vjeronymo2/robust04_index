			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hays in Pounds 38m French acquisition HAYS, the business services group, yesterday announced a long sought move into Europe through the acquisition of a French food and drink distribution company financed by a Pounds 34.3m placement of shares. The company is paying Pounds 37.5m for Groupe FRIL, a private distributor of drinks and chilled foods for customers that include Carrefour, Yoplait and Moet Hennessy. Hays could pay an additional Pounds 15m over three years, depending on FRIL's profits. Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman and chief executive, said Hays had been wanting to expand in Europe for 18 months and that the FRIL acquisition would be followed by one in the commercial services area in France or Germany. After yesterday's placing, the group's balance sheet was in good shape to make further acquisitions without issuing any more new paper. Gearing had fallen from 30 per cent to 26 per cent on net debt of Pounds 38m. 'There are a lot of good acquisition targets out there in Europe and England,' Mr Frost said. 'I am in an acquisitive mood.' He said FRIL would enhance the company's earnings, previously forecast at 12.3p in 1992-93, to about 12.6p. The acquisition would deliver earnings equivalent to 18p for each of the 19m new Hays shares being issued. FRIL had sales of FF450 (Pounds 45m) in the year to September 1991 from its three trading groups - Logistique Barre, Transports Barre and TAC Developpement. It made operating profits of FF48m before interest, tax and start up losses on new contracts. Hays is buying net assets revalued last September at Pounds 7m and is also assuming FF250m of FRIL's debt. Since Mr Frost brought Hays to the market in 1989, two years after a management buy-out from the Kuwait Investment Office, the company's market capitalisation has almost doubled to Pounds 723m. But the company has remained almost totally dependent on the UK economy. Mr Frost said FRIL provided a platform to widen Hays' geographical spread. 'Hays' existing activities in distribution, together with those of FRIL, will be able to offer continental European customers the type of services that they are beginning to demand.' Schroders underwrote and Rowe &amp; Pitman placed the shares yesterday morning at 182p with a range of institutions. Hays share price closed down 3p at 187p. Mr Frost said there continued to be no evidence of economic recovery in the UK. The personnel division - the third business area which supplies specialised people - remained flat. When the recession came to an end, however, it would recover very quickly and about 70 per cent of its billings would go straight to the bottom line, he said.</p>

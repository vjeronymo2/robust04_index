			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Yeltsin moves to support German autonomous area RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree yesterday that supports the restoration of a German autonomous republic on the Volga river, Russian television said, Reuter reports from Moscow. 'The document draws attention to the necessity of urgent measures to rehabilitate and, step by step, to restore the statehood of Russian Germans inside the Russian Federation,' the television said. Soviet leader Josef Stalin accused the Volga Germans, descendants of workers brought to Russia by Tsar Peter the Great and Empress Catherine the Great in the 18th century, of collaborating with invading Nazi troops in 1941. All were deported to Siberia and Central Asia, and now more than 800,000 ethnic Germans are scattered across Russia. The decree suggests the first step is to set up a German national district in the Volgograd and Saratov regions. Mr Yeltsin promised to restore the German republic when he visited Germany last year. President Yeltsin will start a two-week working holiday in the Black Sea resort of Sochi,his press secretary said.</p>

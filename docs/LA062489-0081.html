			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN'S INITIATIVE TARGETS MOBIL OIL REFINERY;  </P> <P> BID TO CURB TOXIC ACID OKD FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> Los Angeles County election officials formally certified Wednesday that  Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker's initiative to curb the use of  hydrofluoric acid at the Mobil Oil refinery has qualified for the ballot.  </P> <P> Torrance City Clerk John Bramhall said he was notified by the county  registrar-recorder's office that a random sample of 500 signatures on Walker's  petitions found that 91.2% were registered voters.  </P> <P> Based on that sample, county officials estimated that 8,938 of the 9,801  signatures submitted by Walker this month are valid. He had needed 7,241.  </P> <P> "On that basis, it is sufficient to qualify," Bramhall said.  </P> <P> Walker's measure would severely restrict the amount of acutely toxic  hydrofluoric acid that can be stored at any industrial site in Torrance.  </P> <P> The initiative would limit storage to 250 gallons, a fraction of the more than  29,000 gallons of highly corrosive acid usually stored at the Mobil Oil  refinery.  </P> <P> A thunderous explosion and two-day fire at the refinery in November, 1987, was  caused by an excess of the acid in a unit that produces unleaded gasoline.  </P> <P> Walker, who has argued that Torrance residents are concerned that the chemical  poses a safety risk, said he was thrilled by the voters' response to his direct  mail appeal.  </P> <P> "I am positive the initiative will pass," he said. "When it is done, we will  have a far safer community."  </P> <P> But Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti took a decidedly different view. "The  signatures are not surprising in that most people are willing to put things on  the ballot," Carbonetti said. "That doesn't necessarily mean that it will pass  after the voters have more information and time to think about the issue. We  will just continue our efforts to communicate with the community."  </P> <P> Mobil last week launched a 24-week advertising campaign aimed at improving the  refinery's image in Torrance.  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council must now decide whether to adopt the measure as  written or to put it on a special election ballot in November or the regular  city ballot in March.  </P> <P> "I want the people of the city of Torrance to be able to resolve this matter in  the fastest way possible," Walker said.  </P> <P> He called on his colleagues to put the measure before voters in November, when  a Torrance school board election will be held, instead of waiting until March.  "There is no reason to delay this another four months."  </P> <P> Walker expressed the hope that his colleagues would consider adopting the  measure outright since thousands of Torrance voters signed his initiative. "I  sincerely hope that they will look at it with an open mind," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urged Not to Sign  </P> <P> But Mayor Katy Geissert said she has seen no sign that her colleagues are  inclined to adopt an initiative that they urged voters not to sign.  </P> <P> In an open letter to voters in April, Walker's colleagues accused him of using  "questionable political tactics" to advance his own political career. Council  members said Walker, who wants to run for the Legislature, plotted to  "capitalize politically on the community's fears" about the refinery. Walker  used an estimated $50,000 in campaign funds to finance the initiative drive.  </P> <P> Geissert said she would rather see the measure on the March ballot to spare the  expense of a special election and to allow the city's legal staff more time to  work on a lawsuit that the city filed in April seeking to have the Mobil  refinery declared a public nuisance.  </P> <P> The mayor, an outspoken critic of Walker, said Torrance taxpayers will have to  pay to defend the initiative if Mobil challenges it in court.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Geissert said Walker's initiative has "a very good likelihood of  passing" because Torrance residents "are very much concerned" about the  possibility of a catastrophic accident at the refinery. "They are worried about  the health and safety issue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Would Add Credence'  </P> <P> Walker said a public vote to support his measure would "add a great deal of  credence to the city's position" in court.  </P> <P> Concern about the potential danger posed by hydrofluoric acid grew late in 1987  after a series of incidents, beginning with an accident in October at a  Marathon refinery in Texas. The Torrance explosion and fire followed. And in  December, an environmental group released the results of oil industry-sponsored  tests that showed that releases of hydrofluoric acid were more dangerous than  previously thought.  </P> <P> However, a risk assessment conducted by consultants for Mobil concluded that  use of hydrofluoric acid poses almost no risk to Torrance residents.  </P> <P> The city has questioned the adequacy of that study. Walker, who has rejected  the study out of hand, warns that a 1,000-gallon spill of hydrofluoric acid  could threaten the lives of tens of thousands of residents near the refinery.  </P> <P> "This initiative was the first step in controlling what we all see as a major  hazard in the community," he said. "This is the one chemical that could impact  the lives of tens of thousands of people who live miles away from this  refinery."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expects to Be Outspent  </P> <P> Walker said he expects that Mobil will easily outspend him in the coming battle  for the votes of Torrance residents.  </P> <P> After conducting a public opinion poll and meeting with community leaders  recently, Mobil found that "we needed to do a better job of communicating with  the community," Carbonetti said.  </P> <P> The new advertising campaign featuring refinery employees discussing their  concern about health and safety and their contributions to the community is one  of the ways that Mobil plans to communicate with residents.  </P> <P> "There are many other things coming up," Carbonetti said, but did not offer  details.  </P></p>

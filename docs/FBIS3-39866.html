Like the interior minister, Ciller  also described the DEP people as traitors.    After meeting Catherine Lalumiere, the secretary general of  the Council of Europe, the prime minister participated in the  meeting of her party's parliamentary group. Saying that she  wants to draw attention to incidents that have troubled the  public in recent days, Ciller went on to discuss the DEP  deputies.    [Ciller] Neither our lofty parliament nor the True Path  Party  will allow the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] to take shelter  under the roof of that lofty parliament.    [Kilinc] Indicating that DEP deputies are hiding behind  their  immunity, the prime minister added:    [Ciller] The decision that has passed the commissions is now  before the lofty parliament, which will do what is necessary on  this issue. We, the True Path Party, will take the lead on this  issue.    [Kilinc] There was uproar in the hall when she addressed DEP  leader Hatip Dicle as mister.    [Ciller amid shouts from the floor of: He is a traitor] Yes,  he is a traitor.    [Kilinc] Ciller said that with his statement after the  incident at Tuzla, DEP leader Hatip Dicle openly violated his  parliamentary oath.    The coalition partner SHP [Social Democratic Populist Party]  did not support the prime minister in the debate on lifting the  immunity of the deputies from the southeast. Speaking to his  party group meeting, SHP leader Murat Karayalcin did not express  his views on the immunity of DEP deputies. He later replied to  questions from Kanal-6's correspondent. Karayalcin said that  during the voting on the report on DEP deputies, SHP deputies  will vote according to their personal preferences. The SHP  leader also indicated that, in principle, his party group does  not consider it appropriate to lift immunity on political  grounds.</p>

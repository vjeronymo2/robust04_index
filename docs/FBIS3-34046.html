As Vice Chancellor Busek stressed, during the meeting Rabin  pointed out the "international responsibility for peace in the  Middle East." The international community, which has called for  peace for years, must now also participate in the reconstruction  of the Palestinian territories.    In the afternoon Busek inaugurated the  "Franz-Cardinal-Koenig  Professorship for Austrian Studies" at the Hebrew University of  Jerusalem.    Previously Busek was the first Austrian politician to lay a  wreath at the grave of Theodor Herzl, the father of political  Zionism, and visited the Yad Vashem memorial for the 6 million  victims of the Holocaust.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / People: Cuoni quits Coutts Zurich National Westminster Bank is likely to increase its management grip on Coutts, the frock-coated bankers to Britain's royal family, following the resignation of Jean Pierre Cuoni, chief executive of Coutts International Private Banking in Zurich. Cuoni, 57, was appointed chairman of the executive committee of Coutts AG in Zurich in 1988 after 28 years with Citibank. David Went, who took over as chief executive of the Coutts Group in June, says Cuoni has done a 'fantastic job' in bringing together a group of very disparate businesses. However, Cuoni felt that the time had come for someone else to take Coutts' International business forward. Coutts has offices in 14 countries and Went is keen to expand the international side of its business. The group opens its Hong Kong office this week and is expected to open three offices in California over the next few months. Although Cuoni was never a member of one of the families which ran Coutts for many years, he was a member of a senior management team which has been gradually replaced as NatWest has taken a firmer hold on a part of its business which has never really fulfilled its potential. Ian Farnsworth, a NatWest general manager, took over from Julian Robarts as managing director of Coutts &amp; Co in early 1992 and just over a year ago, Sir David Money-Coutts stepped down as chairman of the group. Went denied yesterday that Cuoni's departure had anything to do with NatWest's increasing involvement with one of the world's great banking brand names. He said it was unlikely that Cuoni's successor would come from NatWest and that he was looking for an international banker of 'some stature'.</p>

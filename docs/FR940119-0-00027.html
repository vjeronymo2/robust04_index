			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, underground mines can be designated as remining operations only if they qualify for such status in accordance with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106. Therefore, not every underground mining operation currently in existence in Colorado is automatically extended the designation of ``remining operations'' on previously mined areas. Accordingly, unless an underground mining operation began prior to August 3, 1977, and continued operations into permanent program approval or qualified as a remining operation, the operator is required to completely eliminate the highwall. As a result, the public is not denied the protections promised by SMCRA, nor are underground mine operations allowed to escape reclamation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter asserted that Colorado's proposed amendment contains no clear, measurable standards for judging compliance and success. As an example, the commenter cited the fact that the Division has not clearly defined ``reasonably available spoil'' and that determining whether an operator has backfilled properly will be left to the judgment of the operator and the Division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director notes that this comment was submitted on May 28, 1993, prior to Colorado's addition on August 4, 1993, of the definition of ``reasonably available spoil.'' This definition is substantively identical to the corresponding Federal definition of ``reasonably available spoil'' (finding No. III.2.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM believes the definition of ``reasonably available spoil'' and the Director's clarifications in finding No. III.2. above include sufficient detail and safeguards to preclude improper implementation of highwall reclamation rules. If Colorado implements these rules in a manner that is not consistent with the Director's findings, OSM will address this issue in the oversight of the Colorado program and require Colorado to further modify its rule language in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17 or take other appropriate actions regarding the implementation and enforcement of its rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the commenter asserted and alleged that for a number of years, the Division has signed ``settlement agreements'' that allow operators to use lower standards in order to sidestep various performance standards and compliance deadlines. As an example, the commenter alleged that two recent ``settlement agreements'' were made to allow mines to avoid elimination of highwalls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter stated that this use of ``settlement agreements'' is unacceptable and represents Division-sanctioned licenses to violate the law, and that the Division and the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board do not have the legal authority to set aside the law or create lower standards.The commenter further stated that these agreements and other Division actions allow operators to continue violations, escape compliance deadlines, meet lower reclamation standards, and avoid full sanctions for serious violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the commenter requested that, within 60 days, OSM take the necessary steps to (1) revoke the settlement agreements, (2) achieve compliance at all mines with all rules and deadlines, and (3) prohibit the Division and Board from entering into similar settlement agreements in the future. The commenter also requested that OSM provide biweekly progress reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director acknowledges the commenter's assertions and requests. Regarding the request by the commenter that OSM revoke any settlement agreements entered into by the State of Colorado and an operator, OSM has been notified by Colorado that it has revoked the two settlement agreements that the commenter is referring to. Regarding the other requests by the commenter that OSM achieve compliance at all mines with all rules and deadlines, prohibit the Division and Board from entering into similar settlement agreements in the future, and provide biweekly progress reports, the Director must also decline to take action on these requests. Any violations of the approved Colorado State program are subject to enforcement by the State regulatory authority. Should the State fail to enforce its program, OSM, upon determining that such a failure did, in fact, occur, would use the Federal enforcement mechanisms available to it to ensure compliance with SMCRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the rationale set forth above in responding to the commenter's concerns and assertions, the Director does not find Colorado's proposed rules less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director does not comply with the commenter's request to reject Colorado's proposed amendment pertaining to backfilling and grading for the elimination of highwalls and limited variances from AOC requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of Agriculture, and various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Colorado program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The representatives submitted to the brother president the  results of the Shabwah Governorate expanded popular gathering  and the statement issued by the gathering which met under the  slogan "For the Sake of A United And Effective Stand of the  Governorate's Sons To Defend Unity, Democracy, Justice, and  Social Development."    The brother Presidential Council chairman spoke at the  meeting. He praised the national role played by the sons of  Shabwah Governorate in the march of the Yemeni revolution, the  national movement, and the confrontation of the colonialist  presence and the imamate regime. He praised the results of the  expanded gathering of the sons of the Shabwah governorate and  the positive decisions they adopted. He said these results  embody a high sense of national responsibility and demonstrate a  dynamic militant spirit that is committed to the homeland and  eager to safeguard its unity and democratic course.    The brother chairman said: The most important achievement of  this gathering is the unity of ranks of the sons of the  governorate, irrespective of their party affiliations. He  added: This is a great gain for this governorate which suffered  much, whether before or after the independence. Its sons have  offered convoys of martyrs for the sake of independence. They  also offered many of its elite men as defenseless victims of the  regrettable political disputes.    The brother president added: Our target has been and  continues to be that 22 May 1990 will be the decisive date for  ending all these disputes and tragedies from which our Yemeni  people have suffered much. He added that Yemeni unity is the  framework for settling differences. It is the fence within  whose boundaries the Yemeni family is reunited. It is the balm  that soothes all the wounds of the past. The brother chairman  added: However, it is regrettable that political quarrels and  private interests seek to sully this beautiful picture of unity  and to assassinate the joy our people feel as they proceed  toward a new era where ranks are closed, hatred disappears and  all work together to build the homeland, carry out development,  construct roads and schools, hospitals, educational  institutions, and spread services throughout Yemen.    The brother chairman said: However, it is regrettable that  some try to obstruct this so that the benefits of unity will not  reach all the people who will then realize the importance and  value of unity in their lives.    The brother chairman said it is important to unite the  efforts of the sons of the Shabwah governorate so that they work  for the interest of the governorate and the homeland, and  benefit from the lessons of the past. The past is replete with  unfortunate lessons which should be kept in mind so that they  are not repeated in our lives.    The brother chairman said: Unity is the means to achieve a  better future. Preserving it is a sacred national duty, and the  alternative to unity will be destructive for the entire  homeland. He added: All are dutybound to safeguard unity  because it will prevent the return to the past where  partitioning prevailed. The preservation of unity takes place  through sincere and fruitful action in the field and through the  decisive confrontation of all those who seek to harm unity.    Addressing the audience, the sons of Shabwah Governorate,  the  brother chairman said: I highly value the results you have  attained in your gathering. We support them because they embody  a national spirit that remains committed to the constants which  cannot be relinquished. We support all your legitimate demands  and needs, whether in the field of services or in other fields.  We will do our best to meet them within the available  capabilities of the state. We are also in tune with the  sentiments you have expressed that Shabwah should never again be  the scapegoat or the arena for political disputes. We are  confident that our homeland's future will be promising, God  willing. We believe that the course of dialogue and  understanding is the best approach for settling matters and  disagreements. He added: Party, provincial, or religious  biogtry will only cause tragedies.    The brother chairman said: We were united on 22 May, and we  will safeguard our homeland's unity with all the power we have.  Unity brings accord, peace of mind, establishes an atmopshere  of amity and fraternity, responds to the people's needs and  protects their rights. Unity means safety. Without it, we will  become fragmented into more than one entity.    The brother chairman referred to the incident of the  impounding of the large shipment of espionage, monitoring,and  military telecommunications equipment which was recently  confiscated by the competent authorities. He said that attempts  were made to bring this shipment into the country illegally, a  shipment which was impounded by the competent bodies. He said:  In whose interest was this, and who paid for it? He added:  Where are the regulations, the laws, and the conscience on  whose basis we should account for what we do? We want to employ  funds for the good of the Yemeni people, for developing the  homeland, entrenching their unity, and not to harm the people  and destroy the homeland. We must learn lessons from the past,  and resort to reason, and not be influenced by whims and  suspicions which only benefit Yemen's enemies. [passage omitted]</p>

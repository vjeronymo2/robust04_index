			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Tempting harvest Iraqi forces have advanced towards two Kurdish villages near Irbil in northern Iraq, apparently intending to seize ripening crops, a Kurdish spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Ankara. Mr Safeen Dizayee, Ankara spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic party, said: 'Local people and our peshmerga (guerrillas) sighted combine harvesters so it seems they want to take the local crops for themselves.' Iraq, hit by UN sanctions, said on Sunday it was giving harvest collectors powers to fine or jail farmers who fail to gather crops.</p>

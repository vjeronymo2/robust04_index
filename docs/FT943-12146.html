			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / HK backs away from bank reforms The Hong Kong government has drawn back from comprehensive reform of the colony's banking system and has passed to its successor government in 1997 the issue of interest rate deregulation. In February Hong Kong's Consumer Council called for the phased deregulation of interest rates governing small deposits, and for far greater disclosure of the true nature of bank profitability. The council said the banks reaped monopoly profits from an interest rate cartel, and that bank secrecy no longer served any purpose. In the government's reply yesterday, however, Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said the administration had to strike a balance between competition in banking services and the need to maintain stability in the colony's monetary and banking systems. He said he also doubted if small depositors would benefit from deregulated interest rates. The government's cautious response to liberalisation underlined its concern about the possibility of financial instability in the run up to Hong Kong's change in sovereignty in 1997. It was a large, if expected, victory for the banks which had argued vigorously against any change to the status quo. In a concession to the consumer lobby, however, Mr Cartland said that restrictions on the rates of interest governing time deposits could be lifted in 1995. These interest rates cover about 4 per cent of the Hong Kong dollar deposits.</p>

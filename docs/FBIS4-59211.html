			<p>BFN     [Text] Senior Army sources state that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] will not transfer any powers to the Palestinians  in the Gaza Strip today. Yesterday about 140 Palestinian  policemen entered an installation in Dayr al-Balah, where they  remain for the time being. Today several dozen more policemen  are slated to enter the Gaza Strip. Our correspondent Karmela  Menashe reports that over the next few days more Palestinian  policemen will prepare in the area for the transfer of power to  their hands.</p>

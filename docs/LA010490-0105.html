			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR LEADS BY 1 AT THE HALF BUT FALTERS TO LOSE TO LACC, 117-92  </P> <P> After watching the Los Angeles Harbor College basketball team's play in the  first half of their Southern California Conference opener against L.A. City  College, Seahawk Coach Ken Curry seemed pleased.  </P> <P> His team led by one point at halftime.  </P> <P> Curry wasn't as pleased with his team's performance after the game. The  Seahawks were defeated 117-92 Wednesday night at LACC.  </P> <P> "That was the worst half of basketball we have played all season," Curry said.  "We didn't do anything right."  </P> <P> With the loss, Harbor dropped to 14-9, 0-1 in SCC. LACC improved to 11-8, 1-0  in the SCC.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Seahawks, LACC Coach Reggie Morris said he noticed  something towards the end of the first half. "I saw that they (Harbor) looked  as if they were beginning to tire," Morris said. "I decided that it was time to  turn up the defensive pressure in the second half."  </P> <P> The Cubs went into a full-court press three minutes into the second half and  that move blew the game wide open. The pressure defense sparked the Cubs to a  19-9 run and a 78-66 lead. Harbor could draw no closer than 10 points.  </P> <P> Sophomore Marcus Nash of LACC led all scorers with 34. Eric Carpenter and Eddie  Shannon each had 21 points to lead Harbor.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by columnist Naoki Tanaka: "Deregulation Should Be </F> Made the Top Priority Task of the Hata Cabinet"]    [Text] As long as the Hata cabinet is starting out as "a  reform government"--although of a minority ruling coalition--it  should announce its basic policy on reform to people at home and  abroad. One of the important goals of reform should be the  abolition of unreasonable economic regulations. The former  Hosokawa government adopted an "administrative reform outline,"  and the key point of it was to abolish the regulations. The  Hata administration is responsible for taking this over and  implementing it.    As a way of implementing it, I hope, Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata will issue instructions to individual cabinet members on  the need for deregulation and will evaluate all of his cabinet  members based on how the deregulation program has been achieved.  In case regulatory government offices want to leave some  regulations as exceptions, they must once again explain reasons  for them to the people. Otherwise, the people will not support  the minority ruling coalition.    In the tax system reform, what must come first is the  reengineering (drastic renovation of business operations) of the  government sector through deregulation; nonessential expenses in  the government sector should be cut down through deregulation  and other actions. If reengineering is done successfully, it  will become possible to raise the consumption tax only by a  small rate.    The former administration set forth the concept of the  national welfare tax. Assumptions made on the scale of tax rate  increase at that time should change if the deregulation and  administrative reengineering are going to be implemented. The  taxpayers will not be able to understand a hike in the  consumption tax, which is based on "rough estimates" and does  not take this point into account.    In a policy of the coalition adopted before the Social  Democratic Party of Japan bolted, it was agreed to "work out a  decision on the tax reform--basically increasing the ratio of  the indirect tax--by the end of June." But if regulations are  to be drastically revised, it will be impossible to reach a  decision on the tax system reform, including the consumption tax  hike, by the end of June. What the government should do is keep  income tax cuts in effect even after 1995, continue deregulating  until the economy recovers, and pursue the tax system reform  plan, including the consumption tax hike.    What is noteworthy in the new cabinet lineup is that Komeito  produced posts and telecommunications minister, transport  minister, and construction minister and that it thus has become  an important component in the government. But these are posts  of ministries known for having so many regulations. Will these  three ministers be able to push on with deregulation? The  public will come to find out the party's true stand on it.</p>

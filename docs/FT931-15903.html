			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: Why we agreed to take part - Restaurant proprietor Neville Blech explains why he is participating in 'Lunch for a Fiver' WHEN Nicholas Lander first wrote to me proposing the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver', my first reaction was to file it in the bin. Not our scene, I felt. However, intimate French restaurants such as ours are decidedly not in fashion at the moment. In fact, intimate restaurants of any kind seem definitely out. I was enormously saddened by the closure in 1992 of such fine restaurants as Sutherlands and Rue St Jacques, victims of this most vicious recession and deaf banks. Restaurants that are working well now are those serving basic foods (albeit of many different countries) in posh, spacious surroundings at relatively modest prices. Students of marginal costing will know how critical a break-even point is. In the restaurant business, the profit/loss yield curve is very steep. Get well above break-even point and you are in clover, but go even a little below and you are heading down that slippery slope of rapidly escalating losses that ends, ultimately, in financial doom. So how do I think Mijanou can capitalise on the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver'? Although our volumes have been hit by the recession, our break-even point is a lot lower than those of the larger restaurants. If we had not been hit by a double whammy in 1991 (a six-month closure due to dry rot and a rent rise that meant we have to find an extra 500 covers a year), our break-even point would have been even lower. As it is, we need every customer to spend at least Pounds 33 to cover our overheads. Obviously, the more customers we have, the less they need to spend for us to break even. Giving our customers 'Lunch for a Fiver' may not seem the way to increase profits but with an increased spend on drinks, the damage will be limited. The object of the exercise will be to secure a permanent increase in our clientele back to the level of the mid-1980s. The FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' may achieve this, whatever the cost. Naturally, the whole exercise has led us to look carefully at our costings and pricing policies. We have produced a new menu running parallel to the 'Lunch for a Fiver' menu which will allow customers to spend considerably less at Mijanou than they have done in the recent past. We will have some lower-priced dishes with cheaper ingredients to cope with the psychological retrenchment on spending that accompanies all recessions but we shall also be retaining some of our signature dishes for those who still crave subtlety and finesse. One thing is certain. Whatever happens, we shall never lower our standards of cuisine or service. Mijanou, 143 Ebury Street, London SW1W 9QN. Tel: 071-730-4099.</p>

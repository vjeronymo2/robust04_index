			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry has issued a statement  in connection with remarks made yesterday by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The Estonian Foreign Ministry is  seriously concerned in connection with Foreign Minister  Kozyrev's remarks contained in his speech at the conference of  ambassadors accredited to Russia, the CIS and the Baltic states.  Kozyrev told the ambassadors that it is in Russia's strategic  interests to preserve a military presence in these countries.    The Estonian Foreign Ministry draws the attention of the  Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry to the fact that  international law does not allow for the protection of a  country's strategic interests by way of a military presence on  the territory of another country without that country's  permission. Russia has taken upon itself an internationally  recognized obligation according to Article 15 of the CSCE  Helsinki Final Document to fully and promptly withdraw its  troops from the Baltic states in an orderly manner.    Foreign Minister Kozyrev's statements make Estonia doubt as  to whether or not Russia wishes seriously to develop a  good-neighborly policy with the Baltic states. Estonia, in good  faith, is holding talks with Russia so as to complete the  process of Russian troop withdrawal as soon as possible, and is  convinced that only adherence to the obligations made in the  Helsinki final document will enable Russia to seriously protect  its strategic interests.    The Estonian ambassador to Vienna will soon present an  official enquiry to the CSCE security forum in connection with  Andrey Kozyrev's remarks, as instructed by the Estonian Foreign  Ministry, the Estonian Foreign Ministry statement notes.</p>

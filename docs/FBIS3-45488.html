			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to THE CHINA POST" by Christopher Bodeen] </F>   [Text] A delegation representing the mainland Chinese press  met with ROC [Republic of China] senior statesman Ku Chen-fu  yesterday and invited him to visit the mainland.    Ku reportedly said the ROC was "flexible" in allowing such a  visit, but did not formally accept.    The presence of the delegation, on a 10 day visit to the  island, was made possible by an understanding brokered by Ku and  his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan during their breakthrough  talks in Singapore last April.    A reciprocal visit to the mainland by members of the Taiwan  media is scheduled for March.    The delegation yesterday met with heads of the semi-official  Central News Agency yesterday in an exchange of impressions on  the differences between mainland news organizations and those in  Taiwan. They expressed surprise at the large number of  publications and news agencies operating here and were  particularly interested in the financial situation of the  independent press.    The delegation is led by Nan Zhenjong, vice-president of the  Xinhua news bureau in Beijing and, one of the first high ranking  members of the Chinese Communist Party to visit here.</p>

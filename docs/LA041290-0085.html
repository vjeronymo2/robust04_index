			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> YOUNTVILLE;  </P> <P> TRANSSEXUAL SAYS SHE'LL RUN AGAIN  </P> <P> Transsexual and ex-Las Vegas female impersonator Terri Pohrman lost her bid for  mayor by an overwhelming margin, but vowed to give Yountville voters another  chance. "I thought the people had more brains than they did," said Pohrman, 37,  wearing a tight, low-cut gown with red sequins at a restaurant gathering with  50 disappointed supporters after her loss.  </P> <P> The election may have drawn a turnout as heavy as 80%, one of the highest ever  in the tiny Napa wine country town. Pohrman received 280 votes, second to Mayor  Pro Tem Carlee Leftwich's 621. Former City Councilman Aaron Mosley was third  with 187. Leftwich, 60, said sexual orientation was not an issue. Pohrman, now  a clothing and costume jewelry saleswoman, said she would run for the City  Council in two years. "I'll be around. I'm not going to die," she said.  </P></p>

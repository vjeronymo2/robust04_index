This is part of the achievements the autonomous region made  last year in its infrastructure construction.    The region has in recent years concentrated its efforts on  the construction of transportation and telecommunications  facilities, which are essential to relieve bottlenecks in local  economic development.    Last year, the region spent more than 6.7 billion yuan on  some 20 national key projects and 17 local key projects. Some  of them were completed and put into operation last year. They  have yielded good economic and social returns.    The region installed some 193,000 lines of urban telephones  were installed last year, an increase of more than 100,000 lines  over the previous year.    The Datong-Jungar railway and the Jining-Tongliao railway,  which will soon be completed, are expected to bring common  prosperity to the eastern and western parts of the autonomous  region.    In addition, ten leading highway projects are still under  construction. Infrastructure facilities at the border posts  like Erenhot and Manzhouli, bordering on Mongolia and Russia,  were also improved last year.    The energy industry in the autonomous region grew rapidly  last year as generators with a capacity of 574,000 kilowatts  were installed, pushing the total installed capacity to nearly  4.68 million kilowatts.    Construction of a number of other national key projects,  including several coal mines and copper mines, is also well on  its way.</p>

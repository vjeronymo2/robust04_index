			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / EC set to curb subsidies for Italian steel group THE European Commission is set to take the first step towards outlawing a far-reaching programme of state subsidies for Ilva, Italy's state steel company, at its meeting in Strasbourg tomorrow, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Any attempt to change the mind of the Commission is likely to be unsuccessful. A formal procedure against the subsidy plan will probably be opened at tomorrow's full Commission meeting. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the Italian research commissioner, dropped his efforts to delay a decision yesterday. The Italian government will then have a set period - usually two or three months - to convince Brussels that its plans will not distort competition in the EC market. If the government fails, then Ilva, Europe's third largest steel producer, will have to repay the L350bn (Pounds 159.5m) it received in September when it absorbed Sofin, the state agency entrusted with economic development in southern Italy. Further tranches of aid would be blocked. Rome's attempt to justify support for the loss-making state steel company has already been undermined by the company's announcement of a L498bn loss a month ago. That ruled out the possibility of a stock market flotation in the near future and aroused deep concern in Brussels. The state aid code for steel companies is particularly strict because of over-capacity in the EC industry. The Commission believes no private investor - the classic test in state aid cases - would have pumped money into Ilva given its ailing finances. Ilva says it has been handicapped by Brussels' insistence that it should carry more debt than it wanted when Ilva took over the Italian state steel industry in 1988.</p>

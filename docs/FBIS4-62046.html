			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The Russian State Duma began  examining President Yeltsin's remarks on the Duma deputy status  law. The Duma part of the Russian parliament's Conciliation  Commission was formed today. It is headed by vice-Speaker of  the State Duma Valentin Kovalev. The commission also include  the authors of the law -- Chairman of the Duma Organisational  Committee Vladimir Bauer, his deputy Igor Shichanin, and also  members of the Duma Committee for Legisaltion professors of law  Viktor Vishnyakov and Oleg Mironov.    "The commission has already begun its work," Valentin  Kovalev  told ITAR-TASS. Asked when it will be completed, he replied  that "quite a few subtle constitutional and legislative problems  have cropped up". Kovalev noted that "all this process is most  extraordinary, because the president recommends the State Duma  to suspend the action of several norms". He recalled that "the  procedure for such a suspension was not envisaged by the  constitutional legislation. This is why the Duma is confronted  with several extremely difficult problems affecting its reaction  to the letter even though it is most favourably disposed towards  it".    Kovalev said that "it was first of all necessary to solve  several procedural matters, in other words to establish our  competence to suspend these norms and then to get down to the  crux of the matter". He stressed that a solution would be found  within the frameworks of the Conciliation Commission, which will  "satisfy the Council of the Federation, the State Duma, and the  president".    Kovalev said that the president's remarks were "quite  extensive" and included almost six typewritten pages.</p>

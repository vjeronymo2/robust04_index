			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Brazilian purchase for German group Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, the Munich-based white-goods producer, is acquiring its first manufacturing plants in Latin America through the takeover of the Sao Paulo-based Continental 2001 group, writes Andrew Baxter. Terms were not disclosed, but Continental is Brazil's third-largest manufacturer of domestic appliances, with a workforce of 3,500 and expected sales this year of DM360m (Dollars 229m). It is profitable, but Bosch-Siemens would not give details. The Sao Paulo group markets its products under the Continental and Metalfrio brands. Bosch-Siemens said the takeover continued its preparations for the increasing globalisation of the white-goods sector. Last month, the company signed a joint venture agreement with a Chinese partner for the manufacture and marketing of front-loading washing machines.</p>

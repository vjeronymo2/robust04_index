			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices down despite Saudi reassurance OIL PRICES weakened further yesterday in spite of comments by Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, who the market should soon bounce back from its current lows. The price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery slipped by 30 cents to Dollars 17.70 a barrel - its lowest point since March. The price of crude oil is increasingly being dragged downwards by continued weakness in the price of oil products such as gasoil and fuel oil. The latest weekly report from the American Petroleum Institute on the level of US stocks - released late on Tuesday - showed sizeable increases in distillate and fuel oil stocks. Stock levels of distillate, which is used to make heating oil, increased by 3.99m barrels last week and fuel oil stocks were up 2.28m barrels. Demand for these products is usually high during the winter but this year, mild weather and the economic recession has depressed usage. Some refineries in the US are considering cutting production rates and bringing forward maintenance programmes which in turn, will reduce demand for crude oil. Traders are looking to the weather to pull prices out of the doldrums, but so far there has been little cold weather to push up consumption. The reluctance of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output has also depressed prices. 'If it were an extremely cold winter and we were burning up a lot of products, Opec might just be able to get away with this level of production,' said Mr Paul Mlotok, oil economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Opec agreed to cut production to 24.58m barrels a day (b/d) from 25m b/d at its last meeting in November, but traders say they have yet to see evidence of these cuts in the marketplace. Under the agreement, Iran and Nigeria bore the burnt of production cuts. 'We see no sign of either two countries cutting back,' said one trader with an international oil company. 'On the contrary, they are still selling barrels from higher levels of production in place before the latest agreement,' he added. Mr Nazer yesterday was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: 'The oil price will pass through a correction period towards a significant improvement of oil prices.' He went on to say that the price volatility was being caused by speculators and that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.</p>

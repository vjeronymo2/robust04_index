The Armed Forces of the republic were formed in the  extremely  difficult conditions of the social and political situation, and  the civil war. The first units of the Armed Forces that were  formed during a short period of time, together with the military  units of the Internal Affairs and Security Ministries of the  Republic of Tajikistan, made a huge contribution to the  stabilization of the social and political situation and  strengthening the defense capability of the republic.    The people of the Republic of Tajikistan will remember  forever the names of those soldiers and commanders of the Armed  Forces who were killed in actions for the noble cause, the  freedom and independence of their motherland.    I congratulate you, dear comrades on the occasion of the  anniversary of creation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of  Tajikistan. I wish you sound health, happiness, and success. I  am confident that the Command and the Staff of the Armed Forces  of the Republic of Tajikistan will do their best to protect and  to promote the independence, sovereignty, and territorial  integrity of the Republic of Tajikistan.    [Signed] Imamali Rakhmanov, the head of state and Supreme  Council chairman of the Republic of Tajikistan.</p>

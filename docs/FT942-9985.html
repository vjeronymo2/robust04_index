			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Enso firm on Berghuizer bid Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish forest products group, said yesterday it had no plans to raise its bid for the outstanding shares in Berghuizer Papierfabriek, its loss-making Dutch paper subsidiary. The news came in spite of criticism from some shareholders that its offer of Fl 50 per share was too low. The Finnish company said the takeover was the best way to safeguard Berghuizer's future. Berghuizer was expected to post further losses in 1994 and 1995, and there was no likelihood of a resumption of dividend payments in the 'foreseeable' future, it said. 'Enso believes that it is offering a generous strategic premium over the net present value of the underlying cashflow potential of the shares, and is not prepared to improve its offer,' it said. Mr Magnus Diesen, Enso's vice-president of corporate planning, said in Amsterdam that the Fl 50 per share on offer was 'substantially' higher than Berghuizer's expected cash flow potential, but he declined to give details of Enso's calculations. The offer expires in mid-June. Criticism of the bid has centred on Berghuizer's book value, which is estimated at Fl 86 per share. Some shareholders, including US pension funds, have called for the bid to be raised above book value. Yesterday Mr Diesen said: 'Book value is not an adequate measure of the value of the company.' Berghuizer was trading at Fl 47 when Enso unveiled its bid plans on April 18, but expectations of a possible increase in the offer have lifted the shares to just below Fl 55. Yesterday, however, they fell by more than 5 per cent to close at Fl 52.00 from Fl 54.90 on Tuesday. Mr Diesen said Enso had not set any minimum acceptance level and would pay Fl 50 for any shares tendered. The illiquidity of Berghuizer's shares in Amsterdam meant that Fl 50 was the best possible exit price for large shareholders, he said.</p>

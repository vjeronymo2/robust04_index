			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- The visit of Gloria, the  Colombian flagship, will serve to reaffirm, even further, the  ties of friendship and brotherhood between Cuba and Colombia.  This was said today here by Captain Eduardo A. Otero, the  vessel's commander.    The Gloria was met today at the Cuban Revolutionary Navy  (MRG) pier by Captain Martin Jodar, representative of that  institution's chief and of its chief of staff, and by Ricardo  Santamaria, Colombian ambassador to Cuba.    Otero told a group of reporters who were visiting the  sailing  vessel that he was pleased by the warm reception he was given  upon his arrival in this capital and noted that this presence  here will serve for the crew and the cadets to learn about the  island's reality.    I am very enthusiastic because during my first visit to Cuba  in 1976 in this same vessel, I travelled as an officer aboard  and today as ship commander. This will allow me to contribute  to the strengthening of the relations between our two nations,  he stressed.    Otero and the officers who accompanied him were received by  Rear Admiral Pedro Perez Betancourt, MRG chief. Perez  Betancourt expressed Army General Raul Castro's, chief of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces, satisfaction with the arrival of  Colombian Navy training vessel.    The vessel, a 23-sail brigantine, will remain at the Havana  pier until 21 May when it will depart for Norfolk, Virginia, the  United States.    The Gloria, which has been the Colombian Navy's flagship for  25 years, embarks annually on tours while it serves as a school  for the Colombian naval cadets. Among its goals are the  development of the cadets' and officers' love for the sea, the  naval mystique, as well as dedication to those values, the  members of the crew pointed out to PRENSA LATINA.    Moreover, the Gloria's mission is to serve as a goodwill  ambassador that takes to all the world's ports of call  Colombia's friendly facet, through its floating expositions and  through the conduct of each crew member, the same sources added.    The 40 officers, 73 cadets, and 13 civilians embarked on the  tour will engage in a program of simultaneous visits to Havana's  historical center -- patrimony of humanity -- the museum of the  revolution, a naval academy, and the biotechnical institute.  They will also hold conversations with young Cuban cadets with  whom they will exchange experiences and academic knowledge as  well as on the life in their respective nations.    The Colombian Navy flagship is also scheduled to visit the  United States, France, Portugal, the UK, Germany, and Spain in  1994.</p>

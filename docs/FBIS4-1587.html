			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter He Chong (6320 3095): "It Is </F> Historically Inevitable That China and the United States Will  Permanently Grant Preferential Trading Status to Each Other"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Prior to  and following U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  visit, China unceasingly criticized the United States for  interfering in its internal affairs on the pretext of human  rights and stated that it would absolutely not accept the  question of the most favored nation [MFN] status being lumped in  with the human rights issue. For this reason, many pessimists  hold that China will most probably not have its MFN status  renewed this year. However, some optimists argue that China's  tough stance reflects the huge changes in the international  situation and that China is confident and will definitely have  its MFN status renewed. They maintain that it is even possible  that China will obtain permanent MFN status, ending once and for  all the big issue over which China has to quarrel, deal, and  bargain over with the United States every year.    Diplomatic struggles are based on strength. China today is  able to struggle with the United States. Let us look at how the  West evaluates China's strength. The ECONOMIST, a British  magazine, worked out for the first time in November 1992 that  China's GNP was more or less the same as that of Germany that  year and ranked third, coming next only to those of United  States and Japan. Estimating China's economic scale with the  purchasing power parity method for the first time in 1993, the  U.S. Land [lan de 5695 1795] Company worked out that China's GNP  ranked second or third in the world. Articles carried in FOREIGN  AFFAIRS, an American quarterly, even argued that China's overall  economic strength will surpass that of the United States and  rank first in the world by the year 2020.    It is from political motives that Western countries and  international organizations intentionally belittled China's  economic strength in the past and then are suddenly exaggerating  China's strength now. Therefore, Beijing expresses its distrust  and will not accept the title "super economic power." However,  the various calculations above also have scientific evidence and  reflect China's increasingly strong economy after years of great  efforts. According to Beijing, China's foreign trade volume  exceeded $190 billion last year and is expected to grow at an  average annual rate of 20 percent. In the next seven years,  China will import $1 trillion of commercial equipment and thus  become Asia's largest market. Nowadays, Japan, Germany, France,  Italy, Australia, and others are vying to develop trading  relations with China. Can the United States then cancel China's  MFN status and exclude itself from China's market?    In fact, since shortly after he became president, Clinton  has  paid special attention to China and has repeatedly revised the  China policy he put forward during the presidential election  campaign. Last July, his think tank compiled a research report  on foreign affairs, stating that the rate of Asia's economic  growth was quicker than that of the United States and Europe and  that U.S. exports to Asia ranked first. Therefore, the report  proposed that the United States shift its economic and foreign  affairs strategy from Europe to Asia and change the "containment  policy" for socialist countries to the "market expansion  strategy" to serve its economic revival. As for its strategy for  Asia, China, the locomotive of Asia's economic development in  recent years, will become the focal point for U.S. "market  expansion." Therefore, in the name of calling the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation Summit, Clinton invited China's State  President Jiang Zemin and held the first Sino-U.S. summit to  jointly confirm norms for China and the United States to develop  friendly and cooperative relations. If Clinton cancels China's  MFN trading status over the human rights question, it also means  that the United States will lose its MFN status granted by China  and that their bilateral trade will retrogress. More  importantly, the "market expansion strategy," which focuses on  Asia, planned by Clinton through extraordinarily painstaking  efforts, will "go bust before it is ever implemented." Being  the president of a superpower, how much face will he have if his  strategy ends up this way?    If China and the United States lose MFN trading status at  the  same time, U.S. losses will absolutely not be "an insect bite"  as some critics put it. According to statistics, last year,  U.S. exports to China came to $8.76 billion and 170,000 job  opportunities were thus created. If trade develops in a normal  way and if China is willing to reduce the trade surplus, it will  probably reach $40 billion this year, U.S. exports will be  nearly $20 billion, and 400,000 job opportunities will be  created for the United States. Moreover, it will offer a big  market for its depression-stricken airplane, automobile,  chemical, telecommunications, and service industries. If a  trade war begins, the United States will not only suffer from  its nearly $20-billion exports. Its real losses cannot be  estimated lightly. Will Clinton, who is currently troubled by  the Whitewater incident, be laoathe to to incur attacks from  industrialists and businessmen? Will he?    It seems that U.S. "human rights diplomacy" is a  double-edged  sword which will hurt others as well as itself. Some White  House advisers proposed to Clinton that by granting China  permanent MFN status, the president will be able to get rid of  the limitations from Congress, thus avoiding bargaining with  some Congressmen over the question of renewing China's MFN  status between March and June each year in exchange for  interests on other bills. If this is true, the permanent mutual  granting of the favor will become an inevitable historical trend.</p>

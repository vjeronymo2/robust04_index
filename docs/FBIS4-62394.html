			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vilor Niyazmatov] </F>   [Text] Tashkent 16 May -- Uzbekistan's President Islam  Karimov began his first official state visit to Japan on Monday  [16 May]. On the eve of the visit Karimov told journalists that  long ago the great silk road, which connected the east with the  west, established the first links between the ancient Uzbek  state and Japan. Now life itself prompts to the two nations to  strengthen their ties and give them a more substantive  development.    During the visit of the head of the Uzbek state to Japan, he  will hold talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and will be  received by Emperor Akihito. The two countries are expected to  sign a number of intergovernmental agreements in several fields  of bilateral cooperation.</p>

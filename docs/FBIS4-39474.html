			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Financial Department report: "Paratroopers Are Sponsored </F> by a Novosibirsk Bank"]    [Text] Large regional banks, persistently seeking to  penetrate the Moscow market, are resorting to very unorthodox  methods to assert themselves. Thus, Moscow branch directors of  a leading Novosibirsk bank -- the Siberian Trade Bank -- on 5  June signed an agreement with the Russian Paratroopers Command  effectively establishing the bank's "sponsorship" of the  paratroopers.    The agreement between the Siberian Trade Bank and the  paratroopers envisions, in particular, preferential bank  servicing and crediting of the paratroopers subdivisions and  individuals as well as the provision of financial assistance to  officers' families. The agreement establishes among the basic  targeted programs "financing by the bank of house and apartment  construction for officers transferred from neighboring states,  civilian training courses for retired military, and also  assistance to military servicemen, and their facilities, who  have found themselves in extreme conditions." For their part,  the paratroopers undertake to train personnel for the bank's  security service.    This agreement with the paratroopers is the first action by  the Siberian Trade Bank Moscow branch. Such an unusual  beginning of the branch's activity is quite explicable. With  tough competition on the Moscow financial market, regional banks  are hard put to make a name for themselves here by confining  themselves to providing "common" banking services to their  clients.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTES: 'PAINT-IN' TO PROTEST CANYON DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> A group of artists has scheduled a "paint-in" next Friday and Saturday on the  Laguna Canyon hillside in the vicinity of "The Tell," the 600-foot photomural  alongside Laguna Canyon Road.  </P> <P> According to organizer Karen Blume of Laguna Hills, the purpose will be to  "protest the extensive (planned) commercial and residential development of the  property around Laguna Canyon Road" and to document the last remaining elements  of the natural environment. From dawn to dusk, the artists will be working in  various media -- including painting, drawing, photography and sculpture -- to  portray the natural life of the canyon.  </P> <P> Blume estimates that between 25 and 50 artists will be involved, including  members of DAB, a group of artist graduates of Cal State Fullerton. Other  artists are welcome to join. Information: (714) 831-3015.  </P> <P> Laguna Art Museum will hold its annual art auction Nov. 4 at 7:30 p.m. Works  for "The Best of the Eighties," as it is being called, have been donated by 140  California artists including Joe Goode, Ed Ruscha, Kim Abeles, Frederick  Eversley, Jo Ann Callis, Craig Stecyk, Joyce Treiman, Daryl Curran, Michael  Davis, and Helen and Newton Harrison.

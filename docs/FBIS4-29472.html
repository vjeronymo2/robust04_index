			<p>BFN     [Text] House of Representatives members of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], who support chairman Tomiichi  Murayama, decided on 14 June to form a new intraparty group as a  counterforce against the party's largest group "Democrats,"  which supports general secretary Wataru Kubo who is eager for  SDPJ's return to the coalition administration. If the Tsutomu  Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse, the new group intends  to strongly demand an early dissolution of the House of  Representatives and a general election. Following the move, the  conflict within the party will certainly worsen.    The new group will develop from the "group for promotion of  true political reform," which backed Mr. Murayama in the  chairmanship election in September last year. Former SDPJ  General Secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi (chairman of the House of  Representatives' Budget Committee) proposed the formation of the  new group. They will hold a general meeting on 21 June to  formally form the group centering on Diet Administration  Committee Chairman Koken Nosaka and Deputy General Secretary  Hideyuki Maejima. They intend to expand and reorganize the  group in the future by inviting middle-of-the-roaders and former  cabinet members to join the group.    In a platform on "calling for regathering" which was worked  out on 14 June, they agreed to the recent party policy of  "demanding a dissolution [of the lower house] and a general  election" if the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse. At  the same time, the platform virtually stresses the need to start  election preparations in anticipation of a lower house  dissolution and a general election under the current multiseat  electoral system, saying: "We have to prepare for establishing  the structure for dealing with a general election." Moreover,  it denies the possibility of allying with both Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and Komeito, saying: "We severely criticize the  Liberal Democratic Party for its corrupted system resulting from  money-oriented politics and the "Ichi-Ichi line" [the alliance  between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito  Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa] for their way of managing  politics by use of pressure tactics. We need to put "social  democrats and liberals" together as the third force."</p>

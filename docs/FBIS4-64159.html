			<p>BFN     [Text] An expanded session of the Cabinet of Ministers  chaired by Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko was held on 30 May  with the participation of the heads of republican departments  and deputy heads of oblast administrations and the  administrations of Almaty and Leninsk.    After listening to a report by Finance Minister Yerkeshbay  Derbisov, the session examined the updated state budget for  1994. Since the beginning of this year, as is known, the  republic has lived according to the budget endorsed in January  by the decree of the president of Kazakhstan in the absence of  the legislature. This period in the life of society, linked  with a deepened economic crisis, has objectively led to a new  spiral of inflation, and additional measures are now needed to  curb the inflation.    The draft updated budget which will be submitted to the  Supreme Kenges of the new convocation is characterized by a  strict financial concept. The budget envisages a deficit not  higher than 4 percent. This corresponds to the norms of the  international financial banking organizations.    During the discussion on the budget, proposals were voiced  to  support the basic industries, the development of entrepreneurial  structures, acceleration of market reform, and also to increase  social protection for low-income groups.    Vice President Yerik Asanbayev and Supreme Kenges Deputy  Chairman Marat Ospanov took part in the session.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: A theatrical life - Henry Livings is riveted by Joan's story JOAN'S BOOK by Joan Littlewood Methuen Pounds 20, 796 pages I have read a great deal of this remarkable book on trains to and from rehearsals and I have been constantly leaping up, leaving hat, coat or script, having nearly missed my stop. But I have never let go of Joan's Book. It is certainly not well-written; there are few phrases where I would want to go back and look again for resonances and encapsulations. But this story of one of the most significant and exciting theatre companies ever, the Theatre Workshop, is also a profoundly personal memoir of astounding, tragic and comic times. Joan Littlewood seems, like an actress, to re-inhabit herself each time. The childhood chapters read like a best-girl-in-the-class essay on 'My Family'. Adolescence is hoydenish, self-important and self-glorifying. The account of her first schoolgirl production (she also played Macbeth), in which she went too far for the Mother Superior, is joyful. The headmistress hurtled backstage to tell the company to calm it down a bit. 'Which they did, to my chagrin.' The early professional life in Manchester is as rich as steak and cow-heel pie. She seems to meet everybody, from Laban (she does not convincingly explain how the great dance and movement annotater happens to be in Manchester at the time) to Nye Bevan, who tells her the company should be playing to the miners, which she then does. Her account of Ewan McColl's marriage proposal on the tram, which develops into so violent an altercation that the driver stops, as vigorous and moving as the tender, muddled love she comes to share with Gerry Raffles. Once or twice you glimpse her ruthlessness, as when she lets it be known that the company is disbanding, in order to get rid of an old actor for whom she has no further use. She may have a conscience, but l do not think so. Compassion, yes. Her description of friendships forged in Czechoslovakia and then broken as the company leaves the Stalinized Socialist Republic is almost unbearably moving. Think about the authors who went through her treadmill at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, East London, and altered our perception of modern drama: Brendan Behan and Shelagh Delaney among them. The account of the creation of Oh what a Lovely War tells you all you need to know about story telling, and also, by implication, why the film is so dull. And her demolition-jobs on the Great and Good are meat and drink to jobbing artists. In Tunisia, helping to organise a makeshift drama festival, she intercepts a newly-arrived Peter Brook: 'I warned him against introducing any of his old-hat ideas.' Later, Brook eats a sheep's eye at a dinner, and she is convinced it is to get back at her. You do not have to be even half way interested in theatre to relish this welter of a book. It is compulsive, elusive and maddening. Read it. It is an un-literary masterpiece. Playwright Henry Livings is a former member of the Theatre Workshop. His new translation of Blood Wedding opened this week at the Bolton Octagon.</p>

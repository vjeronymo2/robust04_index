			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coordination with rules relating to the allocation of income under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76(b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If &sect;1.1502&hyph;76 applies (relating to the taxable year of members of a consolidated group), an allocation of items under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is determined after applying &sect;1.1502&hyph;76. Thus, if a short taxable year under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76 is a change year for which an allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this section is to be made, the allocation under this section applies only to the items allocated to that short taxable year under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allocation of certain credits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The principles of this section apply for purposes of allocating, under section 383, excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), current year business credits under section 38, and the minimum tax credit under section 53. The loss corporation must use the same method of allocation (ratable allocation or closing-of-the-books) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of sections 382 and 383.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) Assume that the loss corporation, L, a calendar year taxpayer with a May 26, 1995, change date, determines a section 382 limitation under section 382(b)(1) of $100,000. Thus, for the change year, its section 382 limitation is $100,000 &times; (219/365)=$60,000. L makes the closing-of-the-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> books election under paragraph (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Assume that L has a $150,000 capital loss carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) and a $300,000 net operating loss carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) to the change year. L recognizes, in the pre-change period, $200,000 of ordinary loss, and, in the post-change period, $150,000 of capital gain and $100,000 of ordinary income. Assume that section 382(h) does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to the capital gain or the ordinary income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) L has a $100,000 net operating loss for the change year ($200,000 pre-change loss less $100,000 post-change income), as determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because L has no current year capital losses, L's $150,000 capital gain recognized in the post-change period is its modified capital gain net income for the change year (as defined at paragraph (g)(4) of this section). L allocates $100,000 of net operating loss to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-change period and $150,000 of modified capital gain net income to the post-change period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryover to offset its modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period, subject to its section 382 limitation. L's section 382 limitation is $60,000, so L uses $60,000 of its capital loss carryover to offset $60,000 of its $150,000 modified capital gain net income. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation for the change year and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L offsets its $100,000 net operating loss allocated to the pre-change period by the $90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period, without regard to the section 382 limitation, thereby reducing its pre-change net operating loss to $10,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $90,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996 taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $10,000 of net operating loss subject to the section 382 limitation to its 1996 taxable year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) Assume the facts of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  except that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L does not make the closing-of-the-books election under paragraph (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) L ratably allocates its $100,000 net operating loss and its $150,000 of modified capital gain net income for the change year. $40,000 of net operating loss ($100,000 &times; (146/365)) and $60,000 of modified capital gain net income ($150,000 &times; (146/365)) are allocated to the pre-change period. $60,000 of net operating loss ($100,000 &times; (219/365)) and $90,000 of modified capital gain net income ($150,000 &times; (219/365)) are allocated to the post-change period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

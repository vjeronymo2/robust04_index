			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC CLOSURES  </P> <P> When I saw the front page I was sickened by what I read: "The long-awaited  closing Friday of three Los Angeles County mental health centers has  permanently cut off hundreds of mentally ill people from treatment, triggering  suicide threats, confusion and frantic calls by frightened mental patients to  the overcrowded clinics that remain open, officials said."  </P> <P> The state, we are told, did not come through with the necessary funds to  maintain much-needed mental health services.  </P> <P> Where are the values of our politicians and our society? Must they, must we,  always go where the money is, where the votes are? Where is the compassion for  our fellow human beings? Is there no decent, caring majority in the halls and  seats of power?  </P> <P> We look around the world. Every day there are new killers and new killing  fields. We are shocked and we deplore what is going on -- elsewhere.  </P> <P> But we have our killers and our killing fields, too. Only our bullets come  disguised as budget cuts.  </P> <P> ROLF GOMPERTZ  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

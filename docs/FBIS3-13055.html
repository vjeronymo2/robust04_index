			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Chamber of Deputies held a plenary session  today. [passage omitted]    Deputy 'Ali 'Ammar assailed the U.S. ambassador's  interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. He said: Before  the two massacres were committed [Hebron killings and Lebanese  church explosion], it was expected that something would happen  in Lebanon, as shown by the U.S. ambassador's statements. The  ambassador's interference goes beyond all international norms  and constitutes intervention in Lebanese internal affairs like  between a victim and a murderer. He also provokes certain agents  and symbols to foment sedition. Deputy 'Ammar added: It is  time that the pertinent authorities stopped responding to the  U.S. intentions that seek to cause sedition among the Lebanese  people.    He asked the Chamber of Deputies to adopt a stand denouncing  the U.S. envoy's behavior. [passage omitted]    [Beirut Voice of Lebanon in Arabic at 1235 GMT on 8 March  adds:  "Deputy 'Ali 'Ammar called U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley the  ambassador of filth [safir al-danas]. He described his movements  as suspicious and as going beyond diplomatic limits. He said  that the ambassador equates victims and criminals."]</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Rise in GPs' support for fundholding SUPPORT for GP fund-holding has increased among family doctors since the government introduced the controversial scheme last April, a British Medical Association survey showed yesterday, Alan Pike writes. The survey, the most extensive ever among family doctors, shows that most general practitioners still oppose fund-holding. Fund-holding GPs have budgets from which they buy hospital and other treatment on behalf of their patients. GPs were asked in the survey to state both their initial and present views of fundholding. The proportion of doctors in favour has grown from 10 per cent to nearly 20 per cent. Those opposing the scheme have declined from 76 per cent when fundholding was introduced to 62 per cent now. The survey suggests, however, that there are mixed attitudes about fundholding even among doctors using it. Thirty per cent of GPs who are fundholders, or are considering joining the scheme, remain opposed to the idea. The survey also shows that 73 per cent of GPs would like to opt out of their 24-hour responsibility for patients. They would like this to be replaced with alternative arrangements such as the provision of out-of-hours care by local primary-care emergency centres. The survey will form the basis of future negotiations between the BMA and the Department of Health.</p>

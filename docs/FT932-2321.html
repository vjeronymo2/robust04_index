			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Airlines face 747 safety costs THE WORLD'S cash-strapped airlines face paying for much of the cost of rebuilding engine mountings on almost 1,000 Boeing 747s following Boeing's decision to strengthen and add several components, writes Daniel Green. The design changes follow Boeing's inspections of the 747 fleet after accidents involving the aircraft. Last October, a 747 cargo aircraft crashed into an Amsterdam apartment block, killing about 50 people. A similar aircraft crashed off Taiwan in December 1991. Boeing said yesterday it would supply the new parts free, but it was likely the airlines would pay the labour costs of fitting them. 'It is expected that each airplane will take two or three weeks to modify,' it said. It would take 4-5 years for all 948 747s in service to be altered. Northwest, a US carrier, said it was working on the assumption it would pay the labour costs, although British Airways and the UK's Virgin Atlantic said they hoped Boeing would split this cost, too.</p>

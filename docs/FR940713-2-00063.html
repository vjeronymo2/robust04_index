This funding is to support administrative start-up costs, to include staffing and awarding competitive subcontracts with community institutions and organizations conducting specific work related to the execution of the intervention plan. Operational funding for intervention and evaluation is expected to increase in years 02 through 05.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years. This funding estimate may vary and is subject to change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of Project DIRECT is to: (1) Improve the health-related quality of life of an African-American community by reducing the burden of diabetes and its complications through a multilevel, community-based intervention(s), and (2) develop, carry out, and evaluate strategies that will be incorporated into State-based diabetes control programs nationwide. The research design of the project is to conduct a baseline population survey of a predominantly urban and suburban African-American community, implement targeted interventions for at least 5 years, monitor a longitudinal cohort of persons with diabetes, and conduct a follow-up survey at the end of the intervention phase to detect and document community level changes. There will also be a comparison community that will be surveyed at baseline and at follow-up. This multilevel community intervention will be conducted by a consortium of public and private agencies and organizations with management and leadership provided by the official State health department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CDC will assist in the design of interventions and evaluation protocols used in conducting and evaluating the project, provide technical assistance in the design of demonstration protocols, provide programmatic consultation and guidance in support of the project, coordinate with DEHNR in sharing and distributing information, data, and successful strategies and interventions to States and other appropriate organizations, agencies, and institutions. CDC will also provide DIRECT Intervention Plan guidelines and assist in the development of a plan for Diabetes Care, Outreach, and Health Promotion interventions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Diabetes and Chronic Disabling Conditions, with particular attention to populations at disproportionate risk of developing diabetes, including minorities and the elderly.

This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> Eligible Applicant: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Assistance will be provided only to DEHNR for this project.

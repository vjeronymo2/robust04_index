			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State  Department acknowledged Thursday that the United States has been  in contact with North Korea since the last publicly reported  meeting on Dec. 29 and said that Washington knows where  Pyongyang stands on the nuclear issue.    The official statement by the office of the department  spokesman is drawing keen interest as it was issued in an  extremely tense atmosphere that has gripped the U.S. capital  with regard to the North Korean nuclear question.    The statement also came shortly after Billy Graham, visiting  Pyongyang, delivered a verbal message from U.S. President Bill  Clinton to North Korean leader Kim Il-song, and the American  evangelist was reported Thursday to have "urgently relayed"  Kim's reply to Clinton.    Asked whether there has been any contact with North Korea,  the office of the department spokesman said, "there was no  meeting since Dec. 29, but there has been communication with  them."    One official at the office stressed that "we know what their  opinions (on the nuclear issue) are."    But "at the present time," he said, "the U.S. Government has  no plans to contact them to deal with practical problems."    On the stalled negotiations between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on nuclear  inspections, the U.S. Government has stated that it will not get  involved.    Meanwhile, Cable Television News Network (CNN) reported  Thursday that Kim Il-song, during his meeting with Billy Graham,  expressed hope that the nuclear issue would be resolved.    Commenting on Kim Il-song's reply to Clinton, an official at  the White House said Thursday he has nothing new to report on  the North Korean nuclear problem.    U.S. congressional sources, well informed on affairs at the  White House, said that members of the National Security Council  must be analyzing Kim's message. The White House will then need  time to consult with congressional leaders, they said.    In a related development, the State Department confirmed  Thursday that North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations,  Pak Kil-yon, and his wife have arrived in Washington from New  York to attend a national breakfast prayer meeting.    U.S. officials who are scheduled to attend the prayer  meeting, however, have no plans to confer with Pak, department  officials said.    The officials, recalling that Pak attended a similar meeting  last year, said no significance should be attached to his  attendance this year.</p>

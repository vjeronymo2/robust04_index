			<p>BFN     [Text] Statement and warning issued by the Aden Axis  Command to the brother citizens in the city of Aden:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The  Aden Axis Command warns and draws the attention of the brother  citizens in Aden to avoid the following areas: Aden airport,  Badr Camp, the naval forces berth, the radio and television  buildings, the operations center in al-Sawwahi in the so-called  Defense Ministry, the [Yemeni Socialist Party] Central Committee  headquarters, al-Ma'ashiq area, and all the camps inside Aden,  out of concern for the safety of all citizens and their precious  lives. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy will  have to deal with these positions and camps because the gang of  rebellion against the constitutional legitimacy is not abiding  by the cease-fire and continues to attack the positions and  camps of the forces of unity and legitimacy.    The Aden Axis Command is confident that all honorable  brother  citizens in Aden will heed this appeal and warning and keep away  from these positions and camps.</p>

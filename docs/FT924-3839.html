			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Signs of fragile economic upturn in some sectors FURTHER signs that a fragile recovery in the UK might be imminent emerged yesterday, as the pound gained against the D-Mark, while there was news of a strong rise in car sales last month. But any expectations about a vigorous overall upturn were damped by a Financial Times survey which showed that sentiment about an end to the recession was extremely muted across a large swathe of manufacturing and services companies. Even though some businesses in the housing, leisure and electronics sectors are relatively optimistic about a recovery next year, gloom about the next few months is particularly deep among manufacturers and in the transport and advertising sectors. On currency markets yesterday, the general feeling about a weak recovery prompted some large investors to switch funds into sterling, which finished in London more than 1 pfennig stronger against a weak D-Mark at DM2.4875. This was its highest close since mid-October and represented a gain of more than 7 pfennigs on the week. In New York it fell slightly to close at DM2.4854. Against the dollar the pound closed nearly 1 cent down in London at Dollars 1.5575, but still up 4 1/2 cents on the week. In New York it rose slightly to Dollars 1.5605. Hopes of an upturn were buoyed by the announcement that sales of new cars in November were 6.3 per cent up on a year previously, while new commercial vehicles saw a 15.3 per cent rise over the same period. In three of the past four months, registrations of new cars and commercial vehicles have been higher than in the corresponding months last year. Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'These figures reflect a continuing, modest but welcome increase in UK sales.' He said the full benefit of the abolition of special car tax, which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced as part of his package of growth measures in last month's Autumn Statement, had still to work through. On the stock market, investors yesterday took a generally downbeat view about a recovery, with share prices dropping slightly amid profit-taking after the sharp rises earlier in the week. The FT-SE 100 share index was down 11.6 to close last night at 2,759.4, virtually unchanged on the week. Mr Robin Aspinall, an economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said: 'Hardly anyone expects growth next year to be any more than modest. The stock market is getting moderately enthusiastic because even with a small amount of growth in the economy companies may be able to boost profits by up to 15 per cent by stepping up sales without increasing their labour forces.' Among industry managers, the mood about the economy is one of extreme caution. Mr Jon Shep-heard, senior economist at British Gas, said: 'There are some tentative signs of recovery but the outlook is very confused.' Mr John Duff, UK strategy and business director at IBM, the international computer company, said: 'I do not see very much in the way of an upturn. There are still a lot of very frightened businesses out there.' However, the FT survey shows that among some specific sectors there are some relatively hopeful straws in the wind. In particular, indications from agencies specialising in finding employment for temporary staff are that demand in some sectors of the economy may be picking up. At the Treasury, few ministers or officials want to predict a strong recovery after several occasions in the past two years when the department said an upturn was imminent, only to find a false dawn. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary at the Treasury, said yesterday that most independent forecasters expected 'a gentle recovery to take root next year'.

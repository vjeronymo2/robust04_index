			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / GMTV's quotas are watered down: Minimum airtime for current affairs is cut GMTV, the loss-making breakfast television station, has persuaded the Independent Television Commission to lighten its licence obligations. The commission has agreed to set aside detailed weekly quotas on everything from news and current affairs to children's programmes. Instead, the commission has set lower minimum timings for particular programme categories. The new weekly minimum for current affairs will be 2 hours 30 minutes a week compared with 3 hours 47 minutes in the original licence and the new minimum amount of sports coverage will be 40 minutes a week instead of an hour. In addition to increased flexibility, one and three quarter hours a week will not be allocated to any category and can be assigned by GMTV, according to editorial priorities. Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director of GMTV, said yesterday: 'It takes us 10 per cent of the way towards our rivals who have no quotas at all.' The commission decision reflects the fact that GMTV operates a rolling news service and has faced much more intense competition, particularly from Channel 4's Big Breakfast, than expected when the company bid for its licence. GMTV, which is owned by Carlton Communications, Granada, The Guardian Media Group, Scottish Television and Walt Disney, implemented the changes a month ago in anticipation of the decision. 'We took a calculated risk. I think it is the logical way to make the programme,' Mr Stoddart said. GMTV faces considerable commission criticism over its first year on air because it is clear that in order to survive the company deliberately breached quotas in the first half of 1993. 'We didn't get it all right,' said Mr Stoddart yesterday. 'Maybe we veered too much towards the Big Breakfast.' According to the latest figures, GMTV reached a total of 11.2m viewers from Monday to Friday compared with 8.6m for the Big Breakfast and 8.1m for the BBC's Breakfast News. The zany Channel 4 programme had the largest peak quarter hour audience at 1.9m - 300,000 ahead of GMTV. 'We have stopped counting quotas. We just pursue the stories now and it's already increased confidence,' Mr Stoddart added. GMTV bid Pounds 34.61m a year for its licence.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fresh as a raspberry The convenience of using frozen soft fruit, such as raspberries, is offset by problems such as the length of defrosting time, the loss of the fruit's shape and handling difficulties. Distillerie du Perigord, a French company, says it has introduced a new fruit processing method which firms up the fruit, increases its shelf life to a year and heightens its flavour. The process begins with an analysis of the fruit's sugar content, acid content and permeability. The fruit is then dipped in sugar at low temperature, put into an alcohol solution and flavoured with spices. Distillerie du Perigord: France, 53 59 31 10.</p>

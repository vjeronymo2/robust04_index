Clinton made the pledge at a conference held here on Sunday  [9 January] after his arrival for a NATO summit starting today.    "I have come here today to declare and to demonstrate that  Europe remains central to the interests of the United States,  and that we will help to work with our partners in seizing the  opportunities before us all," he said.    The President also talked about a new security for Europe  and  promised that the U.S. will be a "strong partner" in building  that security.    "The new security must be found in Europe's integration --  an  integration of security forces, of market economies, of national  democracies," he said.    He pointed out that the new security for Europe needs three  elements -- military strength and cooperation, greater economic  vitality, and democratic process in the Central and East  European countries. The first element is the most important, he  added.    "The Cold War is over, but war itself is not over. It rages  today not only in distant lands but right here in Europe and the  former Yugoslavia," said the president.    Clinton also stressed the importance of NATO's role in  providing security for Europe and called for NATO's closer  cooperation with the former Warsaw Pact countries.    He said the partnership for peace, a proposal due to be  adopted at the NATO summit, will create a framework in which  former Warsaw Pact member countries and other non-NATO members  can participate in joint military planning, training, exercises  and other efforts.    But he did not give promise to let them become members of  NATO.</p>

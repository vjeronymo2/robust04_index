			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Menem plan angers army Argentina's military commanders have reacted angrily to the surprise announcement last week by President Carlos Menem that he will abolish compulsory military service next year. No general has openly attacked Mr Menem's plans but officers are irritated by his political motivations in ending conscription and the air of improvisation in the decision. A defence ministry official said yesterday: 'The army has always wished to become a professional force, but it will require a four- or five-year transition.' But Mr Rosendo Fraga, a defence analyst, commented: 'Military organisations everywhere are reluctant to change. The generals and defence ministry are dragging their feet.' Resentment in the armed forces has increased as the government raises wages of its civilian employees while holding down military wages. General Martn Balza, the army commander, earns the equivalent of Dollars 2,344 a month; a senior civil servant earns twice as much. But Mr Fraga said moving swiftly to a professional force should be neither difficult nor costly. The Argentine armed forces have only 18,700 conscripts and to put volunteers in their place would require only a 5 per cent increase in the Dollars 4.7bn defence budget. Opposition to the deeply unpopular 12-month military service for 18-year-old men, picked at random, has deepened after the unsolved murder in March of Mr Omar Carrasco, a conscript at an artillery unit. An opinion poll published yesterday showed that 61 per cent of Argentines oppose military service. Mr Menem's decision is very popular. He is reforming Argentina's 1853 constitution so that he may run next year for a second successive term as president, but his administration has been adrift in recent months. He has now skilfully regained the initiative, turning a potential crisis to his political advantage.</p>

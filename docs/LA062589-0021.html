			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORDS TO THE WISE ON TEACHER INVOLVEMENT  </P> <P> In its recent contract settlement with the Los Angeles Unified School District,  the United Teachers of Los Angeles has taken a major step toward its  long-cherished goal of increasing the teachers' role in local school-site  decision-making. The contract provision that establishes school councils  composed of 50% teachers, with authority to make decisions that cannot be  vetoed by the school principal, could usher in a new era in management for this  huge, bureaucratically centralized system.  </P> <P> Business leaders realized some time ago that involving employees in  organizational decision-making is a powerful way to regenerate employee  performance and satisfaction, thereby improving productivity. Smaller school  districts have begun to experiment with shared decision-making to reduce  tensions between teachers and administrators and in forging new solutions to  seemingly intractable problems.  </P> <P> Four years ago, in anticipation of the movement toward school-based  decision-making, the administrators and teachers of the Corinne A. Seeds  University Elementary School, the laboratory school of UCLA's Graduate School  of Education, began exploring how to involve teachers in decision-making as a  means of reorganizing our school and, thereby, improving the educational  program. What we have learned should be instructive to those developing the Los  Angeles school district's participative management program.  </P> <P> We have learned that involving teachers in decision-making produces powerful  positive outcomes in the classroom and for the school as a whole. The most  important gain has been better decisions that incorporate the creativity and  thoughtfulness of many people. It makes sense that the experiences of many  educators at a school will generate more workable options than the judgments of  a single administrator or a central administrative unit.  </P> <P> There are other advantages. When teachers participate in making school-wide  decisions they become more knowledgeable about the choices possible and come to  understand the interwoven complexities of running a school. Teachers assume a  greater sense of responsibility and accountability for carrying out decisions  they have helped shape. By locating decision-making at the school site,  administrators and teachers can focus their attention on solving problems that  are unique to their specific situation. There is no question that our effective  reorganizing efforts at Seeds have benefitted greatly from the teacher  involvement.  </P> <P> However, such teacher involvement did not occur easily or without effort. And  our experience is consistent with what others have learned when they have tried  this approach.  </P> <P> The following four issues must be carefully addressed if the schools and school  district are to reap the benefits of teacher involvement.  </P> <P> Participative decision-making requires lots of time from many people. When more  people participate in decisions about critical instructional programs, the  curriculum or how to spend limited funds, time must be made available for  information sharing, for arguing, for developing and agreeing on solutions.  Such problems cannot be dealt with in weekly 45-minute meetings. The divergent  interests of parents, teachers and administrators cannot be accommodated on the  run.  </P> <P> Collaborative problem-solving skills and attitudes must be nurtured. Many  teachers,who are accustomed to their own self-contained classrooms, have  limited experience in working with others to solve school-wide problems. Few  have professional training that prepares them for participating in continuing  decision-making and in the long-range planning process.  </P> <P> Conflict resolution techniques must be developed. When administrators, teachers  and parents interact to resolve problems that have important consequences,  there is an inevitable increase in the level of interpersonal conflict. All  participants need to learn how to share ideas and disagree without resorting to  personal attacks and interest-group politics. They need to learn how to express  and receive criticism in ways that further constructive decision-making without  creating destructive polarization. Formats for negotiations and appeals must be  worked out.  </P> <P> Finally, the role of the administrator must be redefined. Administrators who  are accustomed to managing primarily through the authority of their position  must become able to work cooperatively through the efforts of others. They must  know how to listen, to genuinely respect divergent opinions and to encourage  others to exert leadership. They must be highly skilled at forging true  consensus rather than settling for temporary compromise.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District has a participative management scheme  that could have significant local and national impact. Realizing this  potential, however, will depend on whether the district provides the support to  ensure its effective implementation.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Medical claims processing offices. The medical claims JAs at Army medical centers, other than Fitzsimons Army Medical Center and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, may be designated by the SJA/head of area claims office for the installation on which the center is located as claims processing offices with approval authority for medical malpractice claims only. Claims beyond their approval authority will be investigated and forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. The SJA, Health Services Command, Quality Assurance Division, OTSG (DASG&hyph;PSQ) and the Consultation Case Review Branch, Clinical Policy and Consultants Division, Office of the Surgeon General (CCRB), will be advised by USARCS of all referrals, provided a copy of all claims, and informed of their disposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Special claims processing offices. (i) The Commander, USARCS, the chief of a command claims service or the head of an area claims office may designate special claims processing offices within his or her command for specific, short-term purposes (for example, maneuvers, civil disturbances, and emergencies). These special claims processing offices may be delegated approval authority necessary to effect the purpose of their creation, but in no case will this delegation exceed the approval authority maximums set forth in other chapters of this regulation for regular claims processing offices. All claims will be processed under the claims expenditure allowance and claims command and office code of the authority who established the office or a code assigned by USARCS. The existence of any special claims processing office must be reported to the Commander, USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A special claims processing office is the proper organization to process and approve, as appropriate, maneuver damage claims, except where a foreign government is responsible for adjudication under an international agreement (see subpart G). Personnel from the maneuvering command should be used in the investigation of claims and, at the discretion of the area claims office, may be assigned to the special claims processing office. Claims filed after the termination of the maneuver will be processed by the area claims office. Claims arising within the jurisdiction of other area claims offices, while units are traveling to or from the maneuver, will be investigated by the special claims processing office and forwarded for action to the area claims office in whose area the claims arose. Claims for damage to real or personal property arising on private land being used under a permit may be paid from funds specifically budgeted by the maneuver for such purposes in accordance with AR 405&hyph;15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A special claims processing office provided for a disaster or civil disturbance should include a claims approving authority with adequate investigatory, administrative, and logistical support, to include damage assessment and finance and accounting support. It should not be dispatched prior to notification of Commander, USARCS. The concurrence of Commander, USARCS must be obtained prior to the payment of the first claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Claims processing offices discussed in paragraphs (c) (2) through (4) of this section must be supervised by an assigned JA or claims attorney in order to exercise delegated approval authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.9  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Claims investigation and adjudication should be accomplished at the lowest level possible, that is, by the claims processing office or area claims office with monetary authority over the estimated total value of all claims arising from the incident in question. The expeditious investigation and settlement of claims is essential to the successful fulfillment of the Army's responsibilities under the claims statutes implemented by this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where technical errors exist in the filing of a claim or in its format, claimants should be advised of such errors and the need for corrective action. If the errors concern a jurisdictional matter, advice should be given expeditiously and a record should be maintained. The advice should include a warning that the error must be corrected prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Investigative environment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the investigation of claims, every effort should be made to create a cooperative environment engendering the free exchange of information and evidence. The goal of obtaining sufficient information to make an objective and fair analysis should be paramount. Personal contact with claimants or their representatives is frequently essential to clarify the issues both during investigation and prior to adjudication. Where settlement is not feasible, issues of disagreement or dispute should be clearly identified and spelled out to facilitate the resolution of any reconsideration, appeal, or in appropriate cases, litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims directives and plans.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Two copies of command claims directives will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS. Area claims office directives will be distributed to all DA and DOD commands, installations, and activities within the area of responsibility with an information copy to Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) One copy of all area claims offices' disaster/civil disturbance plan or annex will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interpretations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commander, USARCS will publish written interpretations of the provisions of this regulation and establish and publish policy as to those matters that are within agency discretion. Interpretations and policies that reference this provision will have the same force and effect as this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If it is considered to be in the best interest of the Government, the Commander, USARCS may grant authority to deviate from the specific requirements contained in this regulation in a particular instance except as to matters that are based on statutes, treaties and international agreements, executive orders, controlling directives of the Attorney General or Comptroller General, or otherwise have the force and effect of law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Guidance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commander, USARCS may publish bulletins, manuals, handbooks, notes, and a DA Pamphlet to provide claims authorities with guidance on administrative and procedural matters related to the implementation of this regulation. These will be binding on all Army claims personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Communication.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All claims personnel are authorized to communicate directly with personnel of the USARCS for guidance on matters of policy or relating to the implementation of this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Private relief bills.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no established procedure under which DA sponsors private relief legislation; this is a matter between an individual and his or her Congressman. Claims personnel will remain neutral in private relief matters. No statement should be made that purports to reflect a DA position on a private relief bill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.10  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Guidance concerning disclosure of information and assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WASTE INCINERATOR BUILDER SUES AIR QUALITY  DISTRICT  </P> <P> A company seeking to build a hazardous waste incinerator in Vernon sued the  South Coast Air Quality Management District Tuesday, claiming the agency  unfairly required new environmental studies before renewing its building  permits.  </P> <P> Security Environmental Systems Inc. charged in its federal suit that the AQMD  denied it its due process rights by forcing it to meet the newly imposed  environmental reporting requirements after it had already met previous  requirements.  </P> <P> The company said the conditions imposed this year on its second request since  1987 to win AQMD extensions on 21 building permits were tantamount to a  revocation of all the permits it had sought from governments and regulators  since it began the project in 1985.  </P></p>

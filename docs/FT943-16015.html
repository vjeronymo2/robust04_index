			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mercer expands German interests Mercer International, a diversified Vancouver-based group, has bought Germany's Zellstoff und Papierfabrik Rosenthal (ZPR), whose main asset is a large pulp mill in Thuringia, eastern Germany. The mill, upgraded in 1992 to produce chlorine-free sulphite pulp, has a capacity of 160,000 tons a year. ZPR's sales were USDollars 54m last year. Mercer will pay the Treuhand, the agency in charge of privatising businesses in eastern Germany, a nominal price. It will provide a Dollars 12m loan to ZPR, which has agreed to employ at least 350 people and spend Dollars 45m on capital improvements over the next five years. The outlays will be financed mainly by German government incentive programmes. As part of the privatisation agreement, the Treuhand and other German agencies will also forgive ZPR's Dollars 76m debt, provide cash grants of Dollars 43.7m, and pay Dollars 12m to indemnify the company from environmental liabilities. Mercer late last year bought six paper recycling plants in the Dresden area from the Treuhand. The plants augment its used paper supplies with pulp from the ZPR mill.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GROUP GETS GO-AHEAD FOR ELY RECALL PETITION;  </P> <P> COLLEGE DISTRICT: THE 12 SIMI AND MOORPARK RESIDENTS HAVE 160 DAYS TO GATHER  9,900 SIGNATURES.  </P> <P> A citizens group that has demanded the resignation of Tom Ely, a trustee of the  Ventura County Community College District, was given the green light Friday to  start collecting signatures for a petition to recall him, county officials  said.  </P> <P> The group's petition, along with Ely's response, was approved and certified by  the Elections Division of the county clerk's office Friday afternoon, said  Jenny Harrison, elections services coordinator for the county.  </P> <P> The citizens group last week demanded that Ely resign immediately or face the  possibility of being recalled. The group cited "fiscal irresponsibility and  unprofessional conduct" in regard to his "excessive travel expenses" as the  main reason for the demand. Faculty leaders at each of Ventura County's three  colleges have also called for Ely's resignation.  </P> <P> Ely, who could not be reached for comment Friday, has said he will not resign.  </P> <P> The group, made up of 12 Simi Valley and Moorpark residents, has 160 days to  gather 15% of the signatures of the 66,000 registered voters in the 4th  District, according to election officials. If the signatures are collected in  time, the college Board of Trustees would be required to call a special  election.  </P> <P> Caroline Paras, an organizer of the group, said members planned to start  collecting signatures this morning.  </P> <P> For the recall to be on the November ballot, 9,900 signatures would have to be  collected by June 15, said Ruth Schepler, director of the Elections Division.  Otherwise, the board would not be able to call a special election until next  year.  </P> <P> Ely filed a one-page response to the recall notice with the Elections Division  on Thursday, Schepler said.  </P> <P> "You've elected me three times. I've always been prudent with your money," Ely  wrote in his response. "For 11 years, I've been the only board member to donate  time unselfishly, to represent you in Sacramento, Washington, D.C., or wherever  necessary.  </P> <P> "My efforts have benefited my constituents. Naturally, my expenses have been  higher than other board members," he said.  </P> <P> Ely has been the subject of controversy since it was disclosed in March that he  had run up large gambling debts and had used his district telephone to call  casinos in Nevada.  </P> <P> A district audit of his financial records has led to a criminal investigation  by the district attorney's office involving the possible misuse of several  thousand dollars in district funds.  </P> <P> Ely has said that the audit is flawed and that he has not violated the  district's travel policy.  </P></p>

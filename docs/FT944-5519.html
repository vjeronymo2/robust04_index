			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Store blackmail pair sent to jail Two businessmen who tried to blackmail three supermarket chains into paying a total of Pounds 12m by threatening to contaminate products with the HIV virus were jailed at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Michael Norman of Wreningham, Norfolk, was sentenced to eight years after pleading guilty to three charges of blackmail. Mr Alexander Taylor of Yeovil, Somerset, was jailed for five years after being convicted of conspiracy to blackmail. Mr Norman sent letters to Safeway, J. Sainsbury and Tesco threatening to contaminate products on the shelves with chemicals and the HIV virus unless the store groups paid up, the court heard. The letters warned that if they did not do so, financial investors and the press would be told there were contaminated products on store shelves. At Mr Norman's request, Mr Taylor had previously looked into ways of laundering large sums of money and placing them in overseas bank accounts without trace. The two were caught by police officers posing as supermarket representatives. Mr Taylor had acted as a go-between, meeting the officers as an agent of the blackmailer. He was followed and seen meeting Mr Norman in motorway service stations. The men were arrested just after the officers handed over a suitcase containing Pounds 275,000 in cash as part of the blackmail payment. Mr Norman told police he got the idea for the crime from the Dick Francis thriller The Banker. Sentencing the two men, the judge Mr Recorder Paul Focke said such blackmail 'strikes at the roots of the retail industry'.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Storm shares decline by 31% Shares in the Storm Group, which is involved with intellectual property rights relating to toys and cartoon characters, lost 5 1/2 p to close at 12 1/2 p, a fall of 31 per cent, after Sunday press reports described by the company as containing 'a range of ill-founded statements and material inaccuracies'. Mr Jim Driscoll, chairman, said he could not comment in greater detail as the group was considering further action. 'We are obviously very worried by the fall in the share price.' The USM-quoted group recently raised Pounds 2.3m with a placing and open offer. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December were Pounds 122,000, compared with losses of Pounds 2.1m restated in accordance with FRS 3. Turnover fell from Pounds 6.04m to Pounds 5.23m but there were operating profits of Pounds 311,000 (Pounds 2.03m losses), after much lower exceptional debits of Pounds 107,000, against Pounds 2.05m.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: US and Japan shy from investing in UK - Falling profits put pressure on institutions INSTITUTIONAL investors in Japan and the US have been expressing caution about UK investments amid the currency turmoil. Although some in the US see advantages from the floating of sterling, Japanese fund managers in particular said they had become more wary of investment in UK financial markets. Mr Eiji Arima, manager of foreign exchange at Nippon Life Insurance, said the company is 'negative about investment in the UK' until it returns to the European exchange rate mechanism. 'We think it will take a long time for the UK economy to recover. We will be watching the currency situation closely and hope that it will be settled quickly,' he said. The souring of Japanese investor sentiment comes after a surge of interest in UK securities last year, when net purchases totalled Dollars 14.5bn, up from Dollars 1.95bn in 1990. Net purchases of UK securities, mostly bonds, accounted for 19.9 per cent of all Japanese purchases, behind only the US, which accounted for 21.3 per cent. Mr Arima said sudden currency fluctuations intimidate Japanese institutional investors, some of whom have suffered large currency losses in recent years. Meanwhile, the slowing of the Japanese economy and sharply falling profits have put extra pressure on institutions to take no risks this year. Mr Shinpei Kawate, investment strategist at Yasuda Trust and Banking, said investors are interested in longer-term bonds, but there is 'a real fear that the monetary order will change dramatically' in coming weeks. 'We have to exercise great discretion in case sterling or the German mark fall suddenly. It's not only the UK, but all of Europe. We are waiting to see how far interest rates can be cut,' Mr Kawate said. 'Germany will probably cut rates some time in the near future, and other European countries will follow. We will watch for the timing, as it will make long-term bonds attractive.' Many US fund managers are pessimistic about the impact of ERM withdrawal and lower interest rates on UK prospects. Mr William Holzer, who runs the Scudder Global Fund in New York, has not changed his opinion in light of sterling's withdrawal from the ERM or the cut in interest rates. 'My view is that the domestic part of the economy, those companies that sell their products within the UK . . . their prospects remain bleak over the long term because of insufficient reinvestment in the physical UK economy.' As for the future, 'with everything in a state of flux', Mr Holzer remains extremely cautious about investing in the domestic UK economy. He does not believe the devaluation of sterling will be a great help: 'If devaluing was the route to economic prosperity, Brazil would be very successful and Argentina not far behind.' A sharply different view of the UK came from Mr John Hickling, international portfolio manager at Boston-based Fidelity, the largest fund group in the US. He was bearish about the UK until very recently, primarily because he never believed the ERM would work. 'Since early 1990 my opinion has been that it would be extremely difficult to maintain a system with economies at such divergent points in the economic cycle.' Consequently, he was 'extremely pessimistic about the UK from an earnings standpoint because of the arbitrary, deflationary system' that was the ERM. Now that sterling has been taken out of the ERM, however, and UK interest rates lowered, Mr Hickling's opinion on prospects for investing in the UK has changed. He says: 'The UK now, fundamentally speaking, has done what needed to be done. Lower interest rates, freedom from the yoke of German monetary policy and a weaker currency are all positive for corporate profits and earnings in the UK.' Since last week Mr Hickling has been considering rearranging his portfolio, moving from the purely defensive positions he has been holding in utility stocks into interest rate sensitive and early cyclical sectors, such as financials (especially insurance companies and brokers), health and house-hold companies and housebuilders. Sterling's weakness, however, poses a problem for dollar investors like Mr Hickling, but because Fidelity's management policy has always been not to hedge against currency movements, there is nothing he can do about it.

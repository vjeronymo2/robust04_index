			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, May 4, RIA -- Russia will continue aiding  Kyrgyzstan in its effort to make up for the harm done by natural  disasters -- earth tremors and avalanches -- which are so  frequent in that mountainous republic, said Vladimir Shumeyko,  who chairs the Federation Council of Russia's Federal Assembly,  now on an official visit in Bishkek. Kyrgyzstan is the site for  a field staff of the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations,  which runs programmes of measures to prevent natural disasters,  forecast them and provide early warning of tremors and  avalanches.    The town of Uzgen is where a number of prefab houses,  purchased in Russia with Russian easy-term credits, have been  built to give shelter to victims of natural disasters. Kyrgyz  President Askar Akayev estimates that last year Russia's aid  helped save over 14,000 of the republic's citizens.</p>

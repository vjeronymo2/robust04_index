			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GRAF HOPES TO PLAY IN EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> West Germany's Steffi Graf says the political upheaval in East Germany has  raised her hopes she will one day be able to play there.  </P> <P> "I get one-third to half (of my fan mail) from East Germany," Graf said Monday.  "I get so many letters from there. I think the people who write just want to be  able to see me play."  </P> <P> Among the most memorable letters Graf said she has received came from a  6-year-old East German girl. "She wanted to know if I could come and help her  with her tennis," Graf said. "Of course, I couldn't."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BODY FOUND IN BONDAGE CASKET  </P> <P> Authorities are trying to determine what killed a person whose body was found  in a casket in a room equipped with an iron cage and sexual bondage  paraphernalia, police said today.  </P> <P> Authorities could not determine immediately whether the decomposed body is that  of a male or a female, said Harris County Medical Examiner J. L. Ebdon.  </P> <P> The body was found Wednesday wrapped in heavy plastic and bound at the feet  with duct tape.  </P> <P> "It is very badly decomposed but because of the wrapping, we cannot tell how  long it has been there," Ebdon said.  </P> <P> Police were called by a friend of the owner to the townhouse where the body was  found. The man found the casket while looking for tools in an upstairs room and  opened the casket slightly after smelling a foul odor, Mayer said.  </P> <P> Neighbors told police the home owner is hospitalized recovering from brain  surgery.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN SHOT AFTER FIRING RIFLE AT OFFICERS  </P> <P> Police shot and wounded a distraught Northridge man during a gun battle Friday  night after the man fired a rifle at officers from a window of his apartment,  authorities said Saturday.  </P> <P> Police said Gary Fassett, 25, was in critical condition at Los Angeles  County-USC Medical Center after being shot several times. He was arrested on  suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer.  </P> <P> No officers were wounded, said Lt. William Hall of the Los Angeles Police  Department's officer-involved shooting unit.  </P> <P> The standoff apparently grew out of an argument between Fassett and his wife at  a Reseda pizza parlor earlier in the evening, police said.  </P> <P> Hall said the man's wife left the restaurant with their children in the family  car, and Fassett offered several youths $20 to drive him to his apartment in  the 8700 block of Etiwanda Avenue. But when the youths dropped him off, he  returned from his apartment brandishing a .22-caliber rifle, Hall said. He also  brandished the weapon at the apartment's manager, who called police, Hall said.  </P> <P> When officers Leo Slagel, 55, and Hector Jaramillo, 23, arrived in the  building's rear parking lot about 10:30 p.m., Fassett appeared at his  second-floor window and told them to leave, Hall said.  </P> <P> When they did not, Fassett grabbed the rifle and pointed it in the officers'  direction, prompting Slagel to fire one round from his .12-gauge shotgun, Hall  said. Jaramillo fired two rounds from his 9mm pistol, Hall said.  </P> <P> Fassett disappeared from the officers' view for several minutes and then fired  two rounds at them, Hall said. The officers returned fire, he said.  </P> <P> Two backup officers, John Futrell, 40, and Michael Binford, 41, fired a total  of nine rounds at Fassett in the building's hallway after he pointed the rifle  at them as he left his apartment, Hall said. Fassett was shot several times.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] La Paz, 3 Dec (Jatha)--The Armed Forces asserted  today that the organization "Vivid Red" [Rojo Vivo] does not  belong to the military, indicating that the pamphlets that are  circulating about the group's existence come from people who are  trying to cause unrest in the ranks.    Military authorities agreed that the group has not achieved  its goal because the armed services are made up of brave men who  can bring up any issue.    Both Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes and the military  chiefs indicated that it has not yet been determined whether  "Vivid Red" is a group or a single individual who has been  issuing a series of pamphlets in an attempt to create unrest in  the Armed Forces.    Cespedes indicated that the Armed Forces cannot waste time  trying to determine whether it is a group or an individual  because they have more important things to do.    The commander in chief of the Armed Forces, General Fernando  Sanjines, said that this is not the first time that walls have  been painted and pamphlets have been distributed in a bid to  tarnish the military's image.    "These sorts of actions by people who are trying to create  unrest in the Armed Forces will not have the desired effect  because military personnel do not accept the publication of  anonymous messages," he added.    He cautioned that if the people who are putting out the  pamphlets are identified, they would be punished in accordance  with the provisions of the Organic Law of the Armed Forces and  the Code of Military Penal Procedure.</p>

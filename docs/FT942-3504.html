			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Poll results help drive prices lower across Europe European government bonds took another tumble, pressured by a variety of political and economic factors. The sell-off was exacerbated by thin cash market conditions, with most of the action concentrated in the futures markets. UK bonds suffered particularly heavy losses. 'Investors are still sitting on the sidelines, while the speculative community is dominating,' said Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. Uncertainty ahead of today's US May consumer price and retail sales data also kept participants nervous. Following Friday's short squeeze, many markets started the day on a slightly firmer tone. However, that quickly gave way to renewed selling when the results of the weekend's European parliament elections hit many markets. One of the worst affected was Spain, where the governing Socialist party's weak showing in the European and Andalusian elections prompted fears of an early general election. Prime minister Felipe Gonzales' Catalan coalition partner said it would continue supporting the minority Socialist government, and rejected the need for a parliamentary vote of confidence. However, one dealer warned that Mr Gonzales 'will be at the mercy of the Catalans, which doesn't make for a stable political outlook'. The September contract of the Spanish government bond future fell 1.62 points to 92.50. In France, where the anti-European candidates made a strong showing in the Euro-elections, prices also fell sharply on fears that confidence in the government's policies aimed at European integration would be undermined. The September contract of the notional bond future on Matif fell by 1.62 points to 115.54. The spread between the higher-yielding French 10-year benchmark bond against its German counterpart widened to 44 basis points, from 39 basis points on Friday. German bonds were steadier, helped by the fact that Chancellor Helmut Kohl was one of the few European leaders whose government was bolstered by the elections. Ten-year cash bonds fell less than a point, led largely by the bund future. The September contract on Liffe broke several key support levels before closing around 92.25, down 1.18 points. UK gilts fell about 1 1/2 point, dogged by the ruling Conservative party's poor showing in the elections. Despite supportive producer price data, dealers reported continued inflation worries, and are nervously eyeing Wednesday's raft of data, which includes May retail prices, April average earnings and May employment. Moreover, the Bank of England on Friday is expected to announce its next gilt auction. In the absence of significant investor demand, 'the spectre of fresh supply is unnerving the market', said a dealer. The September long gilt futures contract fell by 1 1/2 points to 100 3/32 . Although prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's party put on a strong performance in the European elections, Italian 10-year bonds dropped more than two points on fears that Friday's constitutional court ruling ordering the government to pay trillions of lire in back pensions would worsen the deficit position. The September bond future on Liffe fell by 2.08 points to 106.15. US Treasury bonds retreated amid concern that today's economic data could reveal an upturn in consumer price inflation. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 lower at 86 13/16 , with the yield rising to 7.347 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 5.873 per cent. The trading week opened quietly, with many investors reluctant to commit fresh funds to the market until after the Commerce Department released its May consumer price index early this morning. Until late last week, analysts had not viewed the report as a potential obstacle. However, a surprising gain in core producer prices, revealed by the government on Friday, has raised some trepidation among traders. Some were concerned that inflation on a consumer level may prove to have been stronger than expected. Analysts, however, are generally sticking to their forecasts of a 0.2 per cent gain in the CPI, and a 0.3 per cent gain in core prices.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Explorers fail to match Shell's oil successes - Tony Walker finds executives disenchanted by the unfulfilled promise of eastern Syria SHELL OIL company executives in Damascus are looking very pleased with themselves these days, as well they might, given Shell's continuing exploration success in eastern Syria towards the Iraqi border. Good spirits at Shell headquarters in the Syrian capital, however, are balanced by the gloom among other foreign explorers, who have little to show for the USDollars 200m-plus they are estimated to have invested in Syria since 1988. 'This is the year when reality sinks in,' said the representative of an American company which has been unsuccessful, thus far, in its efforts to find oil and gas. British Petroleum has already announced that it is pulling out, and others, including Enron, the small American independent, are expected to follow suit. For the more than half dozen oil explorers who were attracted by Shell's successes in the mid-1980s, Syria has proved disappointing. For Shell itself, success has followed upon success, and with its partner, Deminex of West Germany, it is continuing to make finds in its Ash Sham concession whose lease expires in May this year. Shell officials are coy about production figures, and about reserves in their exploration zone, but the company, through its Al Furat operating company (in which the Syrian Petroleum Company has a 50 per cent share), is reliably reported to be pumping about 345,000 barrels a day of light, easily marketable crude from its Deir ez Zawr and Ash Sham fields. With the additional finds made recently, it may well lift production to a considerably higher plateau. Assuming that the Syrian Petroleum Company is producing 160,000-80,000 b/d of heavy, sulphurous crude from its well-established Sweidiyeh field in Syria's north-east corner, Syrian total production is now comfortably above 500,000 b/d. About two-thirds of production is available for export. Latest balance of payment figures, included in the IMF's Article IV report on the Syrian economy, show that oil sales, as well as new aid flows from the Gulf as reward for Damascus's support of the anti-Iraq alliance in the Gulf war, dramatically improved Syria's financial position in 1990-91. Earnings from oil in 1990 attained nearly USDollars 2bn. The figure was lower, about USDollars 1.7bn last year, because of the softer oil market. Grants and soft loans from the Gulf totalled USDollars 1.5bn in 1990-91, sharply improving Syria's overall balance of payments in those years. According to an IMF forecast, however, Syria's payment's position will again start to become precarious this year. That is certain to add to pressures for more rapid exploitation of Syrian reserves, which now stand officially at about 1.7bn barrels. Mr Mtanios Habib, Syria's oil minister, said last June that within two years Syria aimed to treble production. That is almost certainly over-ambitious, although Syria is edging its way to being a relatively significant Mediterranean producer. A further increase in production by the mid-1990s cannot be ruled out. Further finds by Shell will determine this. As the May deadline approaches for Shell to relinquish its Ash Sham concession, the company has about ten drilling rigs working overtime to ensure there is no repeat of its recent painful experience when Elf Aquitaine of France made a commercial discovery in Shell's surrendered Deir ez Zawr acreage. Oil industry representatives say that there is some talk of an arrangement that might allow Shell to continue exploring in the Ash Sham concession beyond the May deadline, but at this stage Shell executives assume that they will be obliged to relinquish the acreage on the due date. Among other foreign players in the field, Occidental of the US is pushing ahead. Occidental has two years of a three-year exploration agreement to run on its 8,000 sq km block in central Syria. However, other companies, such as Repsol of Spain, which has also been exploring in central Syria, and Unocal (formerly Union Oil of California), which has been searching near the Turkish border, are reported to be drilling their last wells and are likely to join the exodus if they are not successful. Marathon has been sitting on a fairly sizeable gas find but at this stage there is no sign of it beginning commercial exploitation. Indeed, company representatives are reported to be 'not very enthusiastic'. Syria's domestic market is limited, although power stations are being converted to 'dual use' technology. Export prospects are not especially encouraging.</p>

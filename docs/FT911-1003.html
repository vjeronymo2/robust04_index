			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Technology: Hard times to bear - In the third of a series on innovation in the recession, Andrew Baxter describes how the UK machine tools sector is coping Anthony Balding could hardly believe his eyes when he stopped by one stand at a recent machine tool exhibition in Taiwan. 'I saw one local manufacturer there which had launched nine machines in one hit. That's a rate which can't be dreamed of in the UK.' Especially, it appears, in a recession. The UK machine tool industry, says Balding, managing director of Norfolk-based Beaver Engineering Group, is probably in its worst position for sales and orders for 20 or 30 years. Some manufacturers say domestic sales are down 40 per cent over the past year, although few admit to suffering as badly as that. Beaver has been as innovative as any in the UK industry over the past five or six years, developing a niche market in machining centres - large multi-purpose machine tools - and turning machines. 'In our industry you should be looking at a major new product, or a substantial change to an existing product, every 18 months,' says Balding. Last summer it shipped the first of a new machine that cost around Pounds 700,000 to develop, a big investment for a company with annual sales of Pounds 11m-Pounds 12m. Now, however, Beaver has cut back on new product development and, says Balding, 'we are moving as slowly as we have done for 10 or 12 years. It hurts me greatly because our competitors in Japan, Germany and Taiwan are not slowing down. The recession is going to put us two years behind where we would have been.' Across the country at Leicester, Malcolm Taylor, managing director of US-owned Bridgeport Machines, is taking a different tack. Bridgeport, which claims to be the largest UK machine tool producer, has shed some 'bottom end' research and development staff, and set up a multi-disciplined hit-team from R&amp;D, production and quality. The aim, says Taylor, is to quicken the pace of new product development. 'We are trying to run at 100mph to introduce new products, freshen up a depressed market and prepare for the upturn.' A new range of machines will begin to come on the market next month offering innovation and more specification for little difference in price. Taylor is determined not to lose two years to his powerful German and Japanese competitors. 'In this business, either you get on the roundabout and make it go faster, or you get off,' he says. These two strategies for getting through the recession may vary in emphasis, and would probably differ from those at the other 120-odd machine tool manufacturers in Britain's highly-fragmented machine tool sector - the world's seventh biggest with estimated sales last year of Dollars 1.72bn. But the encouraging link is the importance that companies attach to innovation - new machines, new production techniques, new attitudes to selling. That is not just because it is a time when machine tool makers' thoughts turn to innovation, as the 9th EMO, the big biennial European machine tool exhibition, opens next month in Paris. More fundamentally, the commitment to innovation is based on the fear of history repeating itself. The post-war British machine tool industry has witnessed the demise of dozens of famous names - led by Alfred Herbert, once the world's biggest producer - due in to a static product range and refusal to modernise manufacturing techniques. The key development in machine tools over the past 25 years has been the introduction of numerically controlled, and later computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines, which have transformed the accuracy and flexibility of machine tools. This trend was spearheaded by the Japanese producers, and led to the introduction of machining centres which can hold 100 or more tools and memorise a series of jobs on a variety of workpieces. That in turn led on to flexible manufacturing systems, where a host computer controls a group of interlinked machine tools and machining centres. British manufacturers have struggled to cope with this of the industry. Although the mechanical aspects of machine tools have developed to take advantage of the greater precision offered by computers, the extent to which a machine tool industry can offer CNC machines has become perhaps the most important indicator of its technological state of health. In the UK, the Machine Tool Technologies Association estimates that NC/CNC machine tools have risen from about 11 per cent of British manufacturers' sales in 1978 to 35 per cent in 1989. That is still a long way behind the Japanese at more than 80 per cent, but compares quite well with 45 per cent for the old West Germany. The commitment to expand the application of CNC is continuing despite the recession. As recently as the mid-1980s, most British manufacturers would have relied almost totally on CNC unit suppliers such as Allen-Bradley of the US. Now the bigger companies have their own in-house software development teams who, according to one observer, 'are unlikely to be sitting around doing nothing in a recession'. The use of CNC varies considerably, and is not limited to the larger producers. Privately-owned Pneuform Bending Machines, based in Aldershot, derives 85 per cent of its turnover from CNC machines. Pneuform has just 18 full-time employees and is cushioned from the recession by exporting 75 per cent of its Pounds 1.3m annual sales. In Paris it is unveiling what it claims is a wire bending machine with a patented technique for forming wire components such as exhaust brackets and supermarket trollies. Sensibly, the survivors of the shakeout in the UK machine tool industry over the past 20 years are concentrating on specialisation rather than taking on the big-volume Japanese producers such as Okuma and Toyoda. This has led to the fostering of a small-company, owner-manager philosophy, with many producers focusing all their development, production and marketing skills on one product area in an attempt to stay competitive. That has its advantages and drawbacks. Innovative production techniques can be brought in quickly and have a speedy effect. Len Weaver, chairman of Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based grinding machine producer, recalls that five years ago the company had a 'build programme' of its production run for the next 12 months. Once written, it was cast in iron. Now it is produced every eight weeks. The introduction of computer-aided design can quickly boost the productivity of a small team of draughtsmen, and significantly improve the flow of new products. But a recession exposes the weaknesses of a fragmented industry that is constantly seeking improvements to its products and methods. At Beaver, Balding has just spent Pounds 4.5m on a new factory, but is now putting off spending a further Pounds 100,000-Pounds 140,000 on a CNC turret punch that would have automated a semi-manual section of production. And small companies shouldering the entire burden of a new product programme can find themselves going into loss, as happened at Beaver. But Balding refuses to import technology via licence agreements. 'I believe that if you buy in designs other than to let that design be a small part of your total programme, it is the beginning of the end,' he told the recent House of Lords inquiry into innovation in British industry. He points out that the UK machine tool industry is now so small that companies have to look inward for solutions, with the exception of areas such as computer technology. There is some justification for this fiercely-independent approach. The industry will probably never see another sea-change like CNC, and for the past decade has been concentrating on incremental product development. Consequently R&amp;D in the UK is 'not much R and a lot of D,' according to one manufacturer. This is true even in the grinding sector, which for technical reasons has lagged behind others in the application of CNC. With an abrasive grinding wheel constantly changing its size and shape, CNC has been able to cope with this complex set of variables only since the mid-1980s. Although much smaller than it was 15 or 20 years ago, the UK industry has maintained an expertise in grinding technology that remains on a par with rivals worldwide. This was strengthened last month when J&amp;S agreed to acquire rights to creep-feed technology (grinding slowly in a single, deep cut) from Brown &amp; Sharpe of the US. Tom Pearce, director of Bristol University's Institute of Grinding Technology, says some manufacturers are wary about joining in collaborative research programmes, for fear of giving away too much to competitors. Pearce says the recession has forced a few companies to pull out of research projects, but this year he has had more inquiries than ever before. J&amp;S made a splash at the 7th EMO in 1987 with its Format 5 CNC surface grinder, but is contenting itself this year with some more modest refinements to its range. Behind the scenes, it continues to innovate its production methods, such as rationalising the major castings used in its surface grinders. 'That does not stop because of a recession. It's important to keep those efforts going,' says John Liverton, technical director. Next week's article looks at the computer industry.</p>

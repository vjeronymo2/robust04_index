			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1327 (7 U.S.C. 138f) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (PL 101&hyph;624), as amended, known as the 1990 Farm Bill, requires USDA to charge a nonrefundable accreditation fee for laboratories seeking accreditation by the Secretary under the authority of the FMIA or PPIA. The fee is required to be in an amount that will offset the cost of the ALP. All fees collected by the Secretary of Agriculture are credited to an account from which the expenses of the Accredited Laboratory Program are paid, and are available immediately and remain available until expended for the ALP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fees are billed annually on a per-accreditation basis. The ALP regulations define an accreditation to be a determination by FSIS that a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of meat and poultry products for the presence and amount of all four food chemistry analytes (protein, moisture, fat, and salt) or a determination by the Agency that a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of product for the presence and amount of one of several classes of chemical residues. Accreditations are granted separately for the food chemistry analysis of official samples and for the analysis of such samples for any one of the several classes of chemical residue. A laboratory may hold more than one accreditation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The user-fee-funded ALP has been in operation since December 13, 1993, the effective date of the final rule that, among other things, established the accreditation fee (58 FR 65254). FSIS has reviewed its costs incurred to grant and/or renew a laboratory's accreditation status. A cost analysis was performed on the 1994 rate and it was determined that the 1995 rate should be reduced. The revised fee was determined by an analysis of the fixed and variable costs of the service. The cost was calculated to be $2,500 per year, a reduction of $1000 from the 1994 fee. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  This reduction was due to administrative and managerial efficiencies, and the use of interlaboratory accreditation maintenance check samples only, rather than both check and split samples, to demonstrate acceptable laboratory performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of the cost analysis is available from the FSIS Docket Clerk, USDA, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Room 3171, South Agriculture Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20250. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each year, FSIS will perform a cost analysis to determine whether the current accreditation fee is adequate to recover the costs of providing the service for the next year. If the fee is not adequate or is in excess of that required to recover the costs, a new fee will be established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has determined that the fee for original accreditations and renewals, beginning December 13, 1994 (the anniversary date for the accreditations of most laboratories in the program), will be $2,500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the amount of the accreditation fee is mandated by regulation, the regulations must be amended before laboratories can be billed at the new, reduced rate. As the regulations are now written, the Agency must begin billing December 13 at the existing, higher fee rate of $3,500. However, the Agency has determined that a lower fee should be charged. The Agency has determined that the lower fee needs to be made effective immediately in order to assure that it collects the fee it has determined is appropriate and in order to assure that industry will not be burdened unnecessarily by the charging of a fee that is higher than what is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS is also making an editorial correction to &sect;318.21(c)(3)(ix), paragraphs (A), (B), and (C), and &sect;381.153(c)(3)(ix), paragraphs (A), (B), and (C), of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations. In the final rule, the option for using interlaboratory accreditation check samples was inadvertently omitted from these paragraphs but included in the introductory sections for these paragraphs. This interim rule merely corrects that editorial error and makes no substantive change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), for the reasons listed above, the Agency finds good cause for making this interim rule effective upon publication. At the same time, however, FSIS is providing for a 30-day comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Letter: Assurances and the British Gas prospectus Sir, Your leader 'Time to review the regulators' (June 10) asks whether the latter are 'tearing up the prospectuses published when the utilities were privatised'. In the case of British Gas my answer would be yes. This observation does not relate to the much publicised raising of the X factor in the price formula but rather to the proposal by the Office of Fair Trading, subsequently adopted by the government, to reduce the tariff threshold from 25,000 therms to 2,500 therms (with a view to phasing it out entirely). The company's prospectus clearly stated that the authorisation to act as a public gas supplier conferred upon the company a monopoly of its present customers consuming up to 25,000 therms per annum for a minimum period of 25 years unless BG failed to comply with enforcement orders made by Ofgas or the secretary of state for trade and industry. The OFT report stated that BG had complied with all undertakings given to all regulatory bodies but that it considered further remedies were required if competition is to develop. While not necessarily disagreeing with the OFT conclusion, this action has raised further important questions. For shareholders there must be an issue of whether assurances given in privatisation prospectuses are of any value after the dust has settled from the flotation and the government has taken its revenue. For gas consumers the reduction (and potential elimination) of the tariff threshold should give pause for thought. At the time of privatisation, a monopoly was conferred on BG in return for certain obligations towards this class of consumers. Removal of that monopoly places a question mark over the status of the company's obligations. This is not necessarily alarming, but their consequences demand more public attention than they have received thus far. Jonathan P Stern, 98 Erlanger Road, London SE14 5TH</p>

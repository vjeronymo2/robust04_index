			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS FIND HOSPITAL OWNERSHIP IS POSSIBLE CURE TO HEALTH-CARE ILLS  </P> <P> Dr. Joe Valoria felt confident that he was onto a good investment when he  joined about 60 other doctors to buy out the financially floundering Lark Ellen  Hospital in West Covina in 1978.  </P> <P> "All the doctors were excited about the opportunity to own a hospital," said  Valoria, vice chairman of the all-physician hospital board.  </P> <P> "They were admitting about four patients a day in that hospital when we took  over," said Dr. Jesse Umali, a key player in organizing the group. In the first  quarter of this year, the facility, now called Covina Valley Community  Hospital, has almost doubled that figure. The number of investors has grown as  well, from about 60 to more than 100.  </P> <P> At a time when large health-care chains are divesting themselves of less  profitable facilities, doctors have bought or entered into joint-venture  arrangements at four other hospitals in the San Gabriel Valley within the last  two years. West Covina Hospital and AMI-Glendora Community Hospital were bought  by local physician groups this fall.  </P> <P> Doctors are attracted by potential profit, as well as the opportunity to have  more influence on decision-making, and hospitals value physicians as the source  of a steady stream of patients.  </P> <P> "Joint ventures are the current vogue," said Bob Joiner, general counsel for  Paracelsus Healthcare Corp. of West Germany, which owns 76 hospitals worldwide.  The firm sold West Covina Hospital to 20 doctors in November. In 1987, it gave  up a 49% share of Monrovia Community Hospital to SGV Healthcare Services Inc.,  a physician group formed by Valoria.  </P> <P> "Doctors are one of the primary customers in the business," Joiner said,  referring to the patients they bring in. "They can make a significant financial  impact" as partners.  </P> <P> For instance, he said, "physicians in the old days would order every battery of  tests possible. Under today's environment, physicians have to say how many they  really need."  </P> <P> Also, doctors who used to order expensive drugs start looking harder at generic  equivalents that work just as well, Joiner said.  </P> <P> "Every physician would like their hospital to have the latest in technology,"  said Ken Rappoport, vice chairman of Nu-Med Hospitals Inc., a 14-hospital chain  that signed a joint-venture agreement in 1988 with about 30 doctors at Terrace  Plaza.  </P> <P> But in a joint venture, when physicians select equipment, they are more  interested in making sure that it will be used enough to justify the cost, he  said.  </P> <P> "They are more receptive to suggestions that can be cost effective and are more  concerned about quality of care because (their own hospital) becomes the only  facility they use," Rappoport said.  </P> <P> Since the Terrace Plaza agreement was signed, patient admissions are up 10% and  "fairly lucrative" outpatient surgeries are up 20% at the 95-bed facility, said  hospital spokesman David Watkins. "The patient mix has improved considerably,  with more commercial and private insurance-holders than (those on) Medicare or  Medi-Cal," he added.  </P> <P> Rappoport said: "There are physicians practicing there who were not before.  Clearly, doctors are influential in bringing in other physicians" and their  patients.  </P> <P> But the changes don't happen overnight. And for Valoria and his colleagues at  Covina Valley, it wasn't smooth sailing for quite a while.  </P> <P> Valoria, who became the chief of medical staff at the 76-bed facility,  remembers the nightmare of regulatory problems that the new owners had to  straighten out. The hospital had lost its accreditation from the Joint  Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in 1977, the year  before the doctors took over, because of serious violations. It was not  reaccredited until 1982.  </P> <P> "We almost closed right away," Valoria said. "We lost and lost and lost (money)  until 1984," when the doctors reaped their first dividends.  </P> <P> But from 1985 through 1988, he said, the eight general partners who had each  invested $6,000 to $8,000 in the $3-million purchase received an average of  $155,000 a year.  </P> <P> "It's very profitable," Valoria said.  </P> <P> According to the Washington-based Federation of American Health Systems, only  8% to 12% of physicians nationwide have ownership interests in health-care  facilities.  </P> <P> But in California, "20% of hospitals are physician-owned," said David Langness  of the Hospital Council of Southern California, adding that the number has  increased in the last five years.  </P> <P> The boom in buying and selling of hospitals in California has been fueled by  higher real estate and health care costs, as well as competition among the  large number of hospitals here, said DeAnne La Rue, also of the 230-member  Hospital Council.  </P> <P> A record number of California hospitals closed in 1988, Langness said, and 52%  of the hospitals in the state lost money.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills-based American Medical International Inc., which had announced  that it would close AMI-Glendora Community Hospital in November, signed an  agreement that month to sell the 165-bed facility to a group of more than 50  local doctors. Escrow is expected to close Jan. 7, said hospital board Chairman  Bill Raymond.  </P> <P> The sale illustrates the reversal of a trend in which doctors had been doing  the selling, said AMI spokeswoman Suzanne Hovdey.  </P> <P> "Before, we were buying hospitals from doctors," she said. When profits started  declining, however, the firm, which owns more than 70 hospitals, started  selling them off in 1985. "Today we look for smaller health-care chains or  doctors" to sell to, she said.  </P> <P> Oscar Fauni, management consultant for Covina Valley, said: "The key of the  future is a marriage between doctors and hospitals. Hospitals need physician  involvement to give them the economic incentive."  </P> <P> Paracelsus and Encino-based Nu-Med have entered into such marriages of  convenience with physicians at Monrovia Community Hospital and Terrace Plaza,  respectively. The chains report that doctors who are co-owners develop a  greater respect for the economics of medicine.  </P> <P> But critics of doctor investment in hospitals say it could create a conflict  between what's best for the patient and what's best for the doctors'  pocketbook.  </P> <P> Doug Cave, senior health policy analyst at Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc. in Los  Angeles, an employee benefits consulting firm, warns that doctors could find it  difficult to practice objectively if they have an ownership interest.  </P> <P> "Any time a physician is involved in financing as well as care, tremendous  conflict of interest could occur," Cave said. Physicians have always realized  that there's a lot of money to be made in health care, he added.  </P> <P> Cave also said a doctor-owner would have an incentive to refer patients to his  hospital even though it "may not have best quality for a given procedure."  </P> <P> But Dan Maier, a spokesman for the American Medical Assn., argues that  physician-owned hospitals are more acutely aware of -- and more responsive to  -- community needs than a large corporation.  </P> <P> "There are obviously cases of abuse, but the majority are legitimate and  improve health care," Maier said. "It's natural for physicians to invest back  into medicine; they just need ethical guidelines."  </P> <P> Federal anti-kickback laws prohibit direct reimbursement to physicians for  patients they refer to hospitals in which they have a financial stake. In 11  states, including California, doctors are required to disclose their investment  interests to patients.  </P> <P> The doctors see their investment as a way to gain some control over the  facilities they practice in.  </P> <P> Dr. Jarnail Gugga was among the 20 physicians who bought West Covina Hospital,  renamed Doctors Hospital of West Covina. "We bought it because we were  disappointed with the quality of care," he said. "Besides, we had no authority  over there."  </P> <P> Although previously Gugga rarely sent patients to West Covina Hospital, he said  he expects that his entire hospitalization load of about 20 patients a month  will be admitted there once he moves his offices to Doctors Hospital.  </P> <P> "We can exercise quality control better," Gugga said, adding that the response  time of nurses is better because the doctors are there watching them.  </P> <P> Umali, who also spearheaded the Terrace Plaza partnership, said the reduction  of corporate red tape in a doctor-owned hospital is refreshing.  </P> <P> "If doctors run (a facility) and want equipment and renovations, you just go to  the board, make appropriations and you have it. That's the beauty of a small  organization," he said. "Doctors feel at home at a hospital they own."  </P></p>

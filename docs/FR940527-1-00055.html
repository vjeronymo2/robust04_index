			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions Process <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Most of the commenters agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that some type of exceptions process would be needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of which system for defining hospital labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas is developed. Several commenters stressed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for an exceptions process to address geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anomalies; cases in which air miles are not equivalent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> road miles; and cases in which a hospital is grouped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlike hospitals, such as a rural referral center (RRC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouped with much smaller primary care hospitals or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tertiary care hospital in a single hospital MSA that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouped with much smaller rural hospitals. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter supported giving a hospital the right to appeal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> add or delete hospitals from its labor market area if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target hospital can demonstrate substantial labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition (or a lack of it) with a specific hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters supported special exception criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RRCs. One group believes that the nearest neighbors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal should be modified to accommodate RRCs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise would have been reclassified, that have only other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rural hospitals in their nearest neighbors group, or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be significantly harmed by the proposal. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group believes that RRCs should be excluded from a nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors wage index and that they should be allowed to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either their own hospital-specific wage index or be allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reclassify into the nearest MSA using the existing MGCRB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Multi-campus hospitals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _We received a wide range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments concerning multi-campus hospitals. Some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the hospital's location should be its main  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address listed on the cost report. Other commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the facility with the largest concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of employees be defined as the hospital's location, or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital should be allowed to pick which campus would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered its location for labor market area purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hospital Location Verification <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that we publish each hospital's longitude and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latitude and require them to submit documentation to verify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any requests for corrections to this data. Others suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we use the Global Positioning System to verify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location. Some commenters suggested that the hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency room entrance should be used as the hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location, others suggested the main employee entrance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still others suggested that a hospital be allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designate any point on its campus as its location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Boundaries <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Some commenters stated that labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas should not be constructed across State lines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because cost of living and labor costs can vary greatly from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State to State due to differences in State tax structures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of health insurance and other employee benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs dependent on State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Blend/Floor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Some commenters suggested that a nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors wage index should not be adopted unless a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's own wage data were weighted more heavily than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those of its neighbors. Other commenters suggested that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institute a floor below which a hospital's wage index could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not fall or that we blend the current wage index with any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index based on revised labor market definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Analysis of Alternative Labor Market Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with commenters, and with ProPAC, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements to the current labor market system should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explored. Below, we discuss the feasibility of several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative methodologies for establishing labor markets,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including revised versions of the current MSA-based system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various hospital-specific methodologies, as well as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative that combines the hospital-specific and MSA-based methodologies. In evaluating each of the alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented, we considered the major issues raised by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, ProPAC's recommendations, as well as our own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal research and analysis. ProPAC's data on air-mile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distances between hospitals were used to develop wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indexes based on hospital-specific systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that in our May 26, 1993 proposed rule (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30244), we indicated that we would hold a meeting with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working group consisting of hospital industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives to review potential revisions to labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas, and other issues related to the wage index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 19, 1993, HCFA staff met with 17 representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of State and national hospital associations to discuss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options for redefining hospital labor market areas and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues related to the current wage index. A ProPAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative also attended and presented information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the status of the Commission's current research. HCFA staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented information on each of the options under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The group expressed no preference for any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital-specific or MSA-based options with the possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception of a hospital-specific wage index based in large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part on the hospital's own wages. The group was extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned about the redistribution of dollars that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur if nearest neighbors labor market areas were adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the current budgetary climate. It was also concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about how an exceptions process would function under any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised labor market scheme, fearing that it would be too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subjective and that it would be impossible to predict how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many hospitals would be reclassified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. MSA-based and Hospital-Specific Alternatives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our labor market research, we reviewed a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of options: nine hospital-specific wage indexes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the nearest neighbor and fixed radius approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and seven MSA-based indexes involving ways of subdividing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSAs or statewide rural areas. Following is a description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the options we reviewed. We have assigned each option a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name to facilitate discussion and for use in tables that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow later in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

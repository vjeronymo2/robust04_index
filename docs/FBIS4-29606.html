			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A senior Social Democratic  Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] official said on Friday [17 June]  the party will present an alliance-seeking initiative to both  the ruling coalition and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for  negotiations to create a new governing coalition.    Koken Nosaka, who heads the Diet Administration Committee of  the second-largest opposition party, told a press conference  that the party will compile an alliance proposal by next  Wednesday to present to the ruling coalition and the largest  opposition party.    "We want to play a leading role in creating a stable  government," Nosaka said.    Nosaka was skeptical about the possibility of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata heading the new coalition government after he  resigns, as required by SDP's prerequisite for alliance talks.    "It is unthinkable" that the premier who resigns will  immediately assume the same post again, he said.    Meanwhile, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made a renewed  call  for Hata, who heads the first minority government in four  decades, to step down to set the stage for coalition talks with  the SDP.    At a meeting with SDP-supporting labor unions, Murayama also  said the SDP will submit a motion of no-confidence against the  Hata cabinet if he takes a stance that it cannot agree with.    The SDP withdrew from the coalition in late April after the  abrupt formation of a parliamentary group excluding the party.    LDP President Yohei Kono made clear the party still plans to  seek a no-confidence vote against Hata.    Kono said at a meeting of party executives that the Hata  administration has not obtained a sufficient mandate from the  people and that it has also lost international credibility over  the failure in the Japan-U.S. trade talks.    Kono also pointed to Hata's lukewarm posture toward the  lingering corruption charges against former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa as a reason to seek a no-confidence vote.    Management and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro  Ishada, who heads Komeito, a major coalition component, said the  SDP's move Thursday to join forces with the LDP at the House of  Representatives Budget Committee to decide to summon Hosokawa to  testify before the Diet over the financial dealings is bound to  have some impact on the political situation.    But Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, former head of  the Democratic Socialist Party, another coalition member, said  so far the SDP's alliance with the LDP is limited to the  Hosokawa issue, and said it is not yet clear whether or not the  SDP will fully cooperate with the LDP in seeking a no-confidence  vote.</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Latin America rewards believers - But a few clouds have appeared on the horizon LATIN AMERICA'S stock markets put on a strik-ing performance in the 499th year after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. And most followers of emerging markets believe that they have a good chance of faring well in the 500th. The most important markets - Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico - together gave investors total returns in dollar terms of 106.4 per cent in the first 11 1/2 months of 1991, according to the International Finance Corporation. The Argentine market more than quadrupled investors' money, with a total return of 323 per cent; Brazil, in spite of its economic travails and galloping inflation, more than doubled it; returns on Mexico were 92.7 per cent, Colombia 141 per cent, Chile 87 per cent and Venezuela more than 30 per cent. Against this, the rest of the world looked pedestrian. The optimism fuelling these gains was built on a number of premises. Economic reform continues apace in many countries, and there is a fair chance of debt restructuring agreements for two of the region's bigger economies, Argentina and Brazil. Both factors offer the prospect of a renewal of economic growth. Evidence continues that residents are bringing their so-called flight capital home, some of it into equities. 'Latin American markets still have quite a lot of room to grow,' says Mr Marc Wenhammer, fund manager at the London-based Latin American Securities, which manages about Dollars 500m in equity investments. The horizon is not cloudless, however. The strength of the markets, particularly Mexico, since early 1990 has encouraged significant new issues of equity, especially into the international markets. Together with the privatisation issues, many see a danger of markets being overwhelmed. Market watchers are aware of the risk that the big build-up of foreign capital in some markets could be sharply reversed. Ms Caroline Tillott of John Govett in London points out that foreign investment in the Mexican market quadrupled this year to almost Dollars 17bn, a fifth of market capitalisation. According to Mr Lincoln Rathnam of Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark's emerging markets group in New York, foreigners hold half of Telmex, the state telephone group privatised last year which accounts for a third of the Mexican market. Troubles in the negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, being discussed between the US, Canada and Mexico, could hit sentiment in Mexico. As it stands, the market drops on every hint from Washington that agreement might not be possible in a US election year. Mexico and others also suffer directly from US economic weakness. A loss of confidence in Mexico could quickly rebound on to the other markets. But investors have had to become accustomed to volatility. As in other emerging markets, they have also grown used to practices frowned on in more developed markets. Asked about insider trading, for example, Mr Rathnam says: 'There are few violations because in most places it is not illegal.' Many companies are still family held and the float of readily traded stock tends to be small: management dealings in the stock thus often have an undue influence on prices. Reading balance sheets also has its perils. Inflation of the levels prevailing in Brazil of more than 20 per cent a month distorts company results, as it biases their trading in favour of financial, over productive, activities. In spite of this, fund managers say that, in terms of access, Latin America is better than many other emerging markets. There are rules that limit the speed with which an investor can sell shares bought in Chile, but exchange restrictions are no longer widespread. Most of the important exchanges have been modernised: fund managers claim that clearing and settlement is generally good. One notorious exception is Venezuela, but even here modernisation is expected in 1992. Most of the markets, however, remain illiquid, meaning that it can be difficult to sell stock when sentiment turns. On the other hand, the ratios of market capitalisation to gross national product are such that further market growth seems inevitable. According to Mr Wenhammer, the ratios of share price to earnings (on a historical basis) are 12 in Mexico, 14 in Chile, 24 in Venezuela and less than 6 in Brazil. With the exception of Mexico, these figures are based on small samples of stocks and should be treated with caution. However, they suggest that Venezuela is generously valued and that Brazil would have enormous potential if its economy were to be put back on track. Mr Alexander Zagoreos of Lazard Freres Asset Management in New York is an investor in mutual funds. As such, he avoids some of the liquidity problems associated with direct investment. He has for some time been overweight in Latin America: not difficult, as the world stock market indices used by many fund managers do not include a Latin American market. He points out that a weighting of 0.5 per cent in Korea at the beginning of the 1980s would have been enough to ensure that a fund manager was rated in the top 25 per cent through much of the decade, even if he just matched the indices in the rest of the portfolio. That shapes his view about Latin America: if the markets perform as expected, returns will be high; if they collapse, then the effect on his portfolio will be limited, because such a small sum is invested.</p>

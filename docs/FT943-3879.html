			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Agrochemicals The dust has at last settled on the European agrochemicals industry, following 1992's Common Agricultural Policy reforms. These scythed up to 20 per cent off the European market. Results from agrochemicals companies during the first six months indicate the market should stabilise this year, but the outlook for European agrochemicals groups remains bleak. This year, everything that could go right for the industry has done so, yet the world agrochemicals market is forecast to expand by only 3 per cent. Over the next five years, annual growth is expected to be limited to no more than 2 per cent. Such poor prospects would not be so serious if European agrochemicals groups were capable of generating reasonable returns. Even before the reforms, they were poor. In 1991 Bayer achieved margins of 8.9 per cent. In spite of the recovery this year, profitability remains lamentable. Zeneca's margins during the first half crept up from 10.1 per cent to 13.7 per cent. It is not that the business is intrinsically unprofitable. US groups such as Uniroyal and Monsanto have achieved margins as high as 33 per cent. The European industry must follow the example of the American industry, by cutting costs, rationalising or taking the difficult decision to leave the business altogether. Unlike the US, where just four large manufacturers remain, in Europe only Schering and Hoechst have merged, leaving Ciba, Sandoz, Rhone-Poulenc, Zeneca, Bayer and BASF battling for market share. The present situation is unsustainable, and benefits neither companies nor their shareholders.</p>

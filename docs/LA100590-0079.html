			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSES FEAR STREET PROJECT  </P> <P> Lomita officials this week tried to reassure businessmen who complained at the  City Council meeting that the yearlong rebuilding of Narbonne Avenue would hurt  their businesses.  </P> <P> Mark Esser, who runs a computer store, warned of a "financial catastrophe in  this city," adding that the duration of the project would have a devastating  impact on small businesses.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County engineers, contracted by the city to administer the project,  said vehicle access to businesses would be maintained during the work, except  for three times during the project for three days each. They also guaranteed  that two lanes of traffic would remain open at all times, except during storm  drain construction, when one lane would be used.  </P> <P> Construction on the 3/4-mile stretch of Narbonne Avenue will begin later this  month, said city staff.  </P> <P> The $1.7-million project will extend from Pacific Coast Highway north to 248th  Street, along 10 blocks of small retail stores, professional offices, a  mortuary and a preschool.  </P> <P> The street will be widened by four feet, sidewalks replaced and the roadway  rebuilt. Over the years it has developed a crown from buildup of asphalt used  for resurfacing. Trees will be planted and traffic signal synchronization will  be improved.  </P> <P> "We'll do the best we can to minimize the problems," said City Manager Walker  Ritter, "but you're talking about a big project, so there's going to be some  inconvenience. We will work with everybody as best we can."  </P> <P> A public hearing on the project will be held Oct. 15 at City Hall.  </P></p>

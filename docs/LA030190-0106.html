			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CRAWFORD PROVIDES SPARK IN MOORPARK VICTORIES  </P> <P> His shots weren't falling as frequently in a first-round Southern California  regional game as they had in his previous outing, but Sam Crawford couldn't  have been more pleased.  </P> <P> His team was winning.  </P> <P> Moorpark went on to defeat Orange Coast, 75-64, Saturday night and advance to  the second round of the state playoffs.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-8 freshman point guard is a flashy, explosive player who is toiling  in junior college only because he couldn't qualify academically for a Division  I scholarship. He scored the last seven points in the game and finished with a  game-high 20 points and 12 assists.  </P> <P> Crawford broke the single-season assist record for Moorpark (22-10), led the  Western State Conference by averaging 12 assists and was second in the  conference with a 20.4 point average.  </P> <P> In the final regular-season game Feb. 17 against Ventura, Crawford scored a  school-record 49 points.  </P> <P> Moorpark, a suburban junior college, and Crawford, a city kid from Westchester  High, have made a successful, if unlikely, alliance.  </P> <P> "I like it here," he said. "I'd rather be at a four-year school but, having to  do this, this is probably the best place for me." STEVE HENSON  </P></p>

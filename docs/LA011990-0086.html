			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CRITIC TAKES OFF TO BECOME A 'REAL' WRITER  </P> <P> Journalists are sometimes asked: "Do you ever do any real writing?" The  question makes us bristle -- what we do feels real enough to us -- but we  understand its subtext, and perhaps even agree with it. Journalists write  columns. Real writers write books.  </P> <P> So I am taking a year off from The Times to tackle one. It will be a biography  of American playwright William Inge. Inge had four hit plays in a row in the  1950s, including "Picnic" and "Bus Stop," and was in such despair by 1973 that  he killed himself. There ought to be a story in that.  </P> <P> To write it, I am going back to Inge's Midwest. That means no Los Angeles  theater for a year. Separation anxiety is immediately felt: What's a journalist  without his beat. Especially when the beat is to be covered by a critic as  disturbingly qualified as Sylvie Drake.  </P> <P> But the die is cast: the boxes have been shipped, the office is bare. All  that's left are a few yellow Post-It notes on the bulletin board -- stuff to  put in the column one day. This would seem to be the day:  </P> <P> * "Piano." This refers to August Wilson's "The Piano Lesson," which I am not  going to get to see at the Doolittle Theatre. This is a big frustration, for it  struck, a year ago at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, as Wilson's richest and  funniest play yet. I guess I'll just have to read about it. (See review on F1.)  </P> <P> * "Branagh." Another frustration is having to miss Kenneth Branagh's  Renaissance Theatre Company stagings of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "King  Lear" at the Mark Taper Forum. Again -- certain readers seem to refuse to take  the point -- the argument isn't that American actors can't perform Shakespeare.  It's that Los Angeles needs to see an acting company with an agreed-upon  approach to Shakespeare and the ability to bring his language alive in the  theater. Branagh's British actors are there to remind us that we can have our  own classical repertory company at the Music Center if we really want it.  </P> <P> * "Ahmanson." Hooray; there is serious talk about reconfiguring the Ahmanson  Theatre for spoken drama. Some say that this can be done without losing its  capacity for handling big-budget musicals when they come along. Maybe so, but  there aren't many examples of theaters that can successfully serve two masters.  The simplest and bravest solution (not necessarily the cheapest one) would be  to scale down the house to seat 1,200 people, all within the immediate range of  the actor's unassisted voice. Chamber music needs a certain ambience. So does  drama.  </P> <P> * "AIDS." I was remiss in not mentioning the Taper's recent "Because We Care"  benefit, featuring members of "The Phantom of the Opera" cast, excluding  Michael Crawford. Besides raising $20,000 and dozens of baskets of food for two  local AIDS projects (Hollywood Helps and Necessities of Life), the evening  offered the quintessential rendition of Leonard Bernstein's "Glitter and Be  Gay," transformed into a battle between two air-head sopranos, neither of whom  knew that the other had been invited. Bravo, Dale Kristien, Leigh Munro and  director David Galligan.  </P> <P> * "Tru." A recent disparaging remark about "clone theater" in this space wasn't  meant to apply to Robert Morse's uncanny evocation of Truman Capote at  Broadway's Booth Theatre. This wasn't a rip-off of Capote, but a reminder that  there was a vulnerable person beneath his fuss and feathers -- that it took a  considerable amount of courage to be Truman Capote. Morse now owns Capote, the  way Hal Holbrook owns Mark Twain. It's the kind of annuity every good actor  deserves, and it won't keep Morse from playing other roles. Bravo again.  </P> <P> * "Year-End." For all the think-pieces written on the 1980s, nobody wrote one  on the words, phrases and even sounds that first surfaced during that decade.  It was about '83, for example, that I noticed that theater audiences,  especially younger ones, weren't merely applauding: they were now squealing,  like the proverbial stuck pig.  </P> <P> The '80s also introduced Wo! as a term of surprised admiration. News analysts  started using the word perception to mean impression. People started wearing  power ties and going to power lunches and even power breakfasts. And on leaving  work at the end of the day, colleagues would say, "Have a good one."  </P> <P> It was the decade when "get off my back" became "get off my case" -- or even  "get out of my face." Zero in football scores became zip. Nerds became  wanna-bes. What did it all mean?  </P> <P> I don't know. I'm outta here. Have a good one.  </P></p>

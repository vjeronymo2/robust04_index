Discussing privatization, the president said it suffers from  disorder and abuse of authority by officials. The first stage of  the process, hopefully to be completed this year, was very  successful, Brazauskas said. He urged the government to  carefully prepare a legal basis and a program for the next stage  of state property privatization.    The president said the previous year was quite successful  because economic stabilization was achieved and foreign trade  became much livelier. Brazauskas said the principal task this  year will be to sign a free trade agreement with the European  Union.    He noted, however, that "very serious conclusions need to be  drawn" in stimulating foreign investments and attracting foreign  banks to Lithuania. A new law on banks should be adopted as soon  as possible, he said.    "I think commercial banks should not be treated so  skeptically." In his opinion, the central bank should actively  cooperate with commercial banks and other private structures, in  order to boost the circulation of capital and to increase credit  resources.    The president said a number of serious problems remain in  industry and agriculture. Brazauskas expressed hope that  production will finally begin to grow this year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed definition of bad faith is largely consistent with that promulgated at 58 FR 3841 on January 12, 1993 (38 CFR 1.965). There are, however, some differences. Reasons for the differences include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The 38 CFR 1.965 definition is strictly for use by the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). The COWC has jurisdiction over waiver and compromise of all benefit overpayments, including Loan Guaranty debts, but within its jurisdiction the COWC only applies the definition of ``bad faith'' to define a condition which will bar waiver of an indebtedness which has been found to be valid. The COWC is not involved in determining whether a debt is valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The examples included with the proposed definition in 38 CFR 36.4202 and 4301 definition are strictly for use by Loan Guaranty and apply only to home loans. In Loan Guaranty ``bad faith'' is used in a number of contexts which are quite different from the way in which it is used by the COWC. For example: A Loan Guaranty finding of bad faith is a basis for establishing a valid debt against a veteran on a GI loan originated after December 31, 1989; it is also the standard for deciding a veteran's appeal of such a finding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Appeal of the validity of a Loan Guaranty debt is processed by Loan Guaranty_the veteran has the right to file a subsequent Notice of Disagreement with the Board of Veterans Appeals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For another example: A finding of bad faith on a real estate loan originated before January 1, 1990, prevents Loan Guaranty from granting a pre-foreclosure waiver of VA's right to establish and collect a veteran's liability account under 38 CFR 36.4323(e)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Loan Guaranty debts differ from other overpayments in that the veteran often bears no direct role in their creation (i.e., foreclosure often occurs as a result of circumstances outside the veteran's control), in that the veteran has not profited personally by receiving a benefit (i.e., an overpayment) to which he or she was not entitled, and in that the amount of the debt which would ultimately be established can often be greatly reduced by the veteran cooperating with VA. Accordingly, for Loan Guaranty purposes ``bad faith'' must take into account the element of cooperation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the examples illustrate, the definition will permit a finding of lack of ``bad faith'' when the veteran is willing to cooperate with VA but prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond his or her control (e.g., the veteran is willing to offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure, but his or her spouse refuses to sign).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many Loan Guaranty debts are established after foreclosure in cases where less costly alternatives could not be considered because the veteran did not respond to VA outreach efforts. This proposed regulation permits such a failure to respond to be deemed a ``failure to cooperate with VA representatives in resolving an insoluble default in a manner which will minimize the amount of claim payable.'' ``Compelling reasons'' which would justify such failure would be heard by VA Loan Guaranty if offered after foreclosure inconnection with a veteran's dispute of the validity of an indebtedness. For example:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

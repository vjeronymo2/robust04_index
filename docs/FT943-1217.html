			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (9): For collaborators  -Joia Shillingford takes a look at groupware 'The personal computer caused people to go off and work on their own. What companies now want are products which will enable groups of workers to collaborate more effectively.' So says Michael Skok, chairman and chief executive of European Software Publishing (ESP). A growing number of these products  - often referred to as groupware  - are becoming available. The research consultancy Ovum divides groupware into four categories: Workflow products, which control the flow of work between users. These include Staffware, from the UK-based company of the same name and the Action Workflow Management System from US company Action Technologies. Intelligent messaging products, such as BeyondMail, distributed by UK-based ESP. BeyondMail can filter messages and distribute information according to certain rules  - for example, all mail from the boss goes to the top of the queue. It also provides some workflow-like features. Niche groupware applications, such as group scheduling and meeting support. Videoconferencing is sometimes regarded as a form of groupware  - especially if video images can be displayed in a window on the user's PC. Groupware suites (for example, Lotus Notes) which integrate a variety of groupware functions, such as information-sharing and conferencing. Ovum believes that groupware suites will become the dominant area of the groupware market, replacing office automation systems. Notes dominates the groupware market, with Lotus claiming sales of about 1m copies. Microsoft is planning to introduce a rival product next year called Exchange Server, which will run under its Windows NT operating system. This will give users on PC networks access to scheduling, document management, electronic mail, electronic forms, directories, voice mail and faxes. Lotus and Novell, which has acquired WordPerfect, also plans to introduce new messaging-based groupware products next year. Other players in this market include office automation suppliers, such as AT&amp;T GIS, ICL, Digital Equipment and Uniplex, who are adding collaborative features to their products. Ovum says the total market for all types of local-area network-based groupware is already about Dollars 700m in the US and Europe and it expects this to grow to Dollars 2.2bn by 1998. It predicts that growth rates will be high until 1995, after which more moderate rates of 15 per cent a year can be expected. The benefits of groupware can include reduced meeting times, improved information sharing, and the speeding up of routine processes. But it is all too easy to waste money on it. One problem is that users are not always willing to share information. Senior managers, in particular, like to hoard information, according to a Reuters survey on Information Misers. This means that it is very important to monitor the level of usage new systems are getting after they have been introduced. If usage is low, then something can be done about it. Roger Whitehead, consultant and editor of the Groupware News newsletter, warns that: 'Groupware is no more able to influence group behaviour than a keyboard unless it is implemented as part of a willingness to change.'</p>

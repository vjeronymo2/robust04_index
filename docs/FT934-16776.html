			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Radio watchdog gets howls of complaint: The finances behind the controversial award of the capital's speech franchises to London Radio News THE Radio Authority's decision last month to end LBC's 20 years of broadcasting news and comment in London caused a furore. The regulatory body received so many letters of complaint - stirred up at least partly by the commercial radio station's presenters appealing for support on air - that a temporary secretary had to be taken on to answer the thousands of letters. Some in the industry believe the decision to award both London speech frequencies to London News Radio is as controversial as the decision to reject LBC's new management team and Dame Shirely Porter, the station's head. It is now clear that the LNR application was firmly supported by only Pounds 9,000 in equity and an underwriting of the Pounds 4m financing by Guinness Mahon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank of Yokohama. The LNR application, based on a round-the-clock news service and a second more conversational service, was put together by Mr Bruce Fireman, managing director of the communications division of Guinness Mahon. A potential investor was Europe-1, the French radio company which has a stake in Allied Radio in the UK, and which planned to take a 20-25 per cent stake in the venture. This, however, was subject to shareholder approval. LNR also said the financing would include convertible preference shares. The LNR's application document said no loan stock would be involved in the financing. After it awarded the frequencies, the Radio Authority is believed to have been unhappy with the share structure and wanted to see changes made. There are statutory requirements under the 1990 Broadcasting Act that majority control in commercial radio licences in the UK has to be held within the European Community. Under the latest LNR structure Mr Fireman, who is to become managing director of LNR, has left the employment of Guinness Mahon. He now holds 52 per cent of the Pounds 150,000 equity in LNR - due to go on air in October 1994 - with Guinness Mahon holding the rest. The Radio Authority is happy with this new arrangement and last week gave LNR a formal letter of financial satisfaction. Apart from the Pounds 150,000 equity, the radio statio's money is now going to be raised through Pounds 3.85m in redeemable loan stock all fully underwritten by Guinness Mahon. The Radio Authority takes the view that the move from preference shares to loan stock makes no regulatory difference. Mr Fireman said last night the change from preference share financing to loan stock had taken place entirely because the company would probably run a deficit in its first year and it would not be possible to repay preference shareholders. LNR says it is in negotiations with a number of institutions to take slices of loan stock. But the Radio Authority takes the view that even if nothing changes between now and next October, LNR would probably still get its licence because control rests within the EC. 'This is a completely routine financing,' Mr Fireman said last night. Europe-1 is now unlikely to invest in the venture because of reservations about the business plan. LNR, chaired by Mr John Tusa, former managing director of the BBC World Service, is planning to hire 88 journalists and expects to have revenues in 1995 of Pounds 9.78m. Running costs that year are estimated at Pounds 10m. In the year to September 1993 LBC is understood to have achieved revenues of just under Pounds 8m. Last month the Radio Authority announced it was bringing forward by a year plans to launch a national commercial speech station. Dame Shirley Porter is determinated to submit an aggressive bid for its licence.</p>

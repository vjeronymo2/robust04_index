			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA;  </P> <P> RALLY AT JESUIT SCHOOL SUPPORTS ABORTIONS  </P> <P> Two hundred students at Santa Clara University have made history at the  138-year-old Jesuit school with a rally supporting legal abortion. The  demonstration was the first of its kind at the university, where students  cannot receive birth control at the student health center. Other Catholic  universities have banned similar rallies. The university's president, the Rev.  Paul Locatelli, wrote in a letter to the university newspaper that school  should support the expression of different viewpoints.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BETTER THAN AVERAGE: SANDERS RALLIES POWAY  </P> <P> Poway's Matt Sanders entered Friday's Palomar League showdown with Mt. Carmel  batting .056, but it was his three-run home run that sparked a 10-9 upset over  the No. 2 Sundevils.  </P> <P> Sanders was the team's designated hitter only because senior Frank Wolinski  came down with the flu Friday morning. Coincidentally, Sanders had hit a  three-run homer in Thursday's practice to give the juniors a 6-5 victory over  the seniors.  </P> <P> But his drive over the left field fence in the third inning was for real and  breathed new life into Poway, which needed some quick resuscitation after Mt.  Carmel's six-run third inning.  </P> <P> The Sundevils had taken a 7-1 lead into the bottom of the inning but entered  the fourth still in a game, 7-5.  </P> <P> A big third-inning defensive play by right fielder Greg Sorrell also helped the  Titans win. Sorrell threw out Andy Owen at home to end Mt. Carmel's six-run  rally. Owen was trying to score from second on John Moon's single, the eighth  hit of the inning for the Sundevils.  </P> <P> That one run made the difference.  </P> <P> The victory went to reliever Danny Miller (9-1), who pitched the sixth and  seventh innings. He struck out three and got an exceptional defensive effort  from first baseman Robbie Plarski with runners on first and second to end it.  Moon and Andy Panganiban were aboard on infield hits when Plarski reached over  the six-foot fence up to his elbow and snared Armando Sanchez's foul ball for  the final out.  </P> <P> Plarski also doubled off the fence in the fourth inning to drive home a run  that cut Mt. Carmel's lead to 9-7, then drove home the game-winner in the sixth  with a double to right center field.  </P> <P> The winning rally began with Sorrell's walk and a wild pitch by loser Todd  Voigt (0-1). Matt Schwenke followed with his third single, which scored Sorrell  to tie it at 9-9, then went to second on the throw home. Plarski broke the tie.  </P> <P> The victory pulled No. 10 Poway (15-6-1, 6-3) and Rancho Buena Vista within two  games of Mt. Carmel (19-4, 9-1) and virtually assured the Titans a playoff  spot.  </P> <P> In other Palomar games:  </P> <P> Vista 5, Fallbrook 4 -- Chris Adams and Jason Harrington combined on a  four-hitter to lead Vista 10-12-1, 4-5-1. Fallbrook is 9-11, 4-6.  </P> <P> Orange Glen 3, Torrey Pines 0 -- Jim Roby hit a two-run homer, and Scott  Campbell pitched a four-hitter for Orange Glen (15-9, 6-4).

The Pirates benefited from nine walks, a  hit batsman and three Carlsbad errors. Bill Precht (4-2) came on with two out  in the fourth and gave up just two hits for the victory. Jose Avila hit a  bases-empty home run in the second for Oceanside.  </P> <P> San Pasqual 12, El Camino 6 -- Marin Soto (three for three) and Eric Marsh  (three for four) led a 14-hit attack for San Pasqual (9-10-1, 6-2).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lichong Akui and M. Thillinandan] </F>   [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Monday [20 June] -- It is believed  that Melewar Corporation Chairman Tunku Abdullah Tuanku Abdul  Rahman used his diplomatic passport to enter Israel. According  to sources, Tunku Abdullah could only have entered Israel by  using a diplomatic passport because Malaysia has no diplomatic  relations with that country. A Malaysian international passport  cannot be used to enter that country because it is stated on the  passport that Israel is the only country that cannot be visited.    The sources say the Immigration Department is authorized to  issue diplomatic passports only to diplomats, ministers, and  royal relatives.    Tunku Abdullah, the younger brother of Paramount Ruler  Tuanku  Jaafar, reportedly paid a visit to Israel recently during which  he met Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon  Peres.    Meanwhile, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman contacted  today did not rule out the possibility that Tunku Abdullah used  a diplomatic passport for the visit because it is the only way  to enter that country. "We are not sure, however, where he  obtained a visa to enter Israel. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs does not know positively when he left that country," he  said.    Israeli television is believed to have covered Tunku  Abdullah's visit and his meetings with Israeli leaders on 17  June. AFP ran a similar report.    Yesterday, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed  said  he knew nothing about Tunku Abdullah's visit and that it was  made without the government's knowledge.    The spokesman said Tunku Abdullah made the visit without the  knowledge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. An early  investigation showed that the visit was personal; he did not  represent any party. "We do not know the purpose of his visit,"  he said.    According to the spokesman, a report obtained by the  Ministry  of Foreign Affairs showed that Tunku Abdullah entered that  country on 16 June but was not positive whether or not he had  returned home. He said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not  have the authority to question Tunku Abdullah because the matter  falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs and  the Immigration Department.

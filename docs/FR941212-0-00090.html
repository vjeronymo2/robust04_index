The field claims office will provide USARCS duplicates of all correspondence, records and documents relevant to the investigation and processing of the claim as they are added to the file. Direct liaison and correspondence between USARCS and the field claims authority is authorized and encouraged on these and all claims. In addition, heads of area claims offices in CONUS will advise the action officer at Tort Claims Division, USARCS who is responsible for their geographic area of all potential claims likely to meet the criteria in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section, and will forward a copy of the investigation file to USARCS on request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) By higher settlement authority. A higher claims settlement authority may take action with respect to a claim in the same manner as the initial claims office. However, if it is determined that any further attempt to settle the claim would be unwarranted, the claim will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS, with recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Claims not cognizable under subparts C through L. If a claim is determined not to be cognizable under this regulation, reference to DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 8 may reveal a basis for compensation or consideration by another agency. If so, the claimant will be so advised. If, after investigation, it appears that the claim may not be settled under any law or regulation, the claim, the related file, and a memorandum of opinion will be forwarded through claim channels to the Commander, USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Blast damage claims. All claims cognizable under subparts C, D and F which are based on damage to or loss of property due to explosions (for example, artillery firing, aerial bombing, or demolition of explosives) will be sent through USARCS to U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratories (USABRL), Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD 21005&hyph;5055, for a technical opinion prior to settlement. See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 5, section IX. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.22  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims memorandum of opinion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Tort Claims memorandum.

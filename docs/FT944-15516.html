			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Retail sales The Confederation of British Industry's September retail sales figures, showing a sharp rise in the balance of shops reporting higher volumes, do little to unscramble the confused signals coming from the British high street. Although the fall in the official figures for August was widely seen as an aberration, the City was expecting a pretty flat September picture from the CBI. In recent months the CBI survey has tended to give a gloomier view than the official numbers, which are being treated with increasing caution. But those observers who justified their pessimism by arguing that the CBI is more accurate will find today's figures tricky to explain. The CBI believes that the weak surveys in July and August were partly due to retailers misreading the price/volume mix of their sales growth. When inflation was high, retailers tended to overestimate volume growth and the CBI figures were generally better than the official numbers. During the period of heavy discounting in the summer, the illusion worked the other way. With the summer sales largely over, the September figure for volume growth looks all the more impressive. Yet even those who place most faith in the CBI figures will not get carried away. The series has been very volatile and the average for the three months to September was unchanged from August. Nor, given their recent poor forecasting record, will retailers' optimism about October be given much weight. But, if tomorrow's official figures are also better than expected, the City might start believing the leading chains' predictions of a bright Christmas.</p>

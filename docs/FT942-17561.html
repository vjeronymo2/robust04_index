			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Credit Lyonnais plans to speed up asset sales: Bank hopes to raise FFr35bn from disposals Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank which is the subject of a FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.14bn) government-backed rescue package, plans to accelerate its asset sales by selling up to FFr35bn of its industrial holdings, according to Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman. Mr Peyrelevade, who was drafted into Credit Lyonnais by the Balladur government in November to orchestrate the rescue and prepare the bank for privatisation, had already announced plans to sell FFr20bn of assets by the end of next year. But he now intends to make additional disposals worth up to FFr15bn, he said in an interview with the Financial Times. 'We plan to sell FFr20bn of assets over the next two years, but we won't stop there,' he said. 'Our portfolio is now worth between FFr50bn and FFr55bn. We'll continue to sell assets until it has been reduced to around FFr20bn.' Credit Lyonnais amassed a large number of industrial investments as part of the aggressive expansion pursued by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, its chairman for five years until Mr Peyrelevade's arrival. The Haberer regime is now the subject of an official inquiry in France after the announcement last month of the rescue deal and of the group's FFr6.9bn net loss for 1993. Most of Credit Lyonnais's investments are minority stakes in corporate clients. The focus for the disposal programme is expected to be on its holdings in private sector companies - such as Bouygues and Navigation Mixte in construction, and Christian Dior in luxury goods. The group has recently sold minority holdings in the Union des Assureurs Federales insurance group and TF1 television station. However, it is expected to hold on to its investments in other state-controlled companies - including Usinor-Sacilor, the steel maker, and Aerospatiale, the aerospace group - as these holdings would be more difficult to sell. Mr Peyrelevade said he did not object in principle to a commercial bank adopting the role of a German-style industrial bank. He stressed, however, that Credit Lyonnais was not in a financial position to afford such a strategy. 'It's not that I don't believe in the concept of an industrial bank taking minority stakes in his clients,' he said. 'But they must be good investments with growth potential and the bank must be able to afford it.' One of Credit Lyonnais's most complex disposals will be that of MGM, the stricken Hollywood movie studio that it must, under US banking regulations, sell by mid-1997. Mr Peyrelevade said he had been approached by a number of potential purchasers for the studio, which is the subject of legal suits. Paribas recovery, Page 13 Renault profits fall, Page 13</p>

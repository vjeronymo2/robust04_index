			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Andi Bejtja: "Berisha and Rugova Under the Same </F> Denominator -- Dialogue With Serbia Unavoidable"]    [Text] "...At this moment, it is imperative to establish  dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade in the presence of a  third party, to determine measures to normalize life and to  achieve a political solution to the problem of Kosova." This  was the essence of the most recent meeting between President  Berisha and Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of  Kosova.    Rugova reaches this verdict three years after the  proclamation of the republic of Kosova and about two years after  the start of his political carreer under the title of president  of a country that no European country recognizes. At every  meeting with foreign diplomats, he has continually insisted on  the independence and neutrality of the republic of Kosova and  the need to place it under a civil protectorate of the United  Nations, perhaps doing all that is possible to internationalize  this issue, which in all probability will soon be put forward  for a settlement.    Meanwhile, Berisha, the Albanian nation's other president,  comes to this point after his harsh statements about NATO forces  bombing Belgrade and his flexible remarks in this context that  "Albania is not in favor of changing borders by force, but of  respect for the rights of Albanians wherever they are."    Contradictions are noticeable in these two excursions of the  two Albanian presidents toward a solution for the question of  Kosova, which have perhaps resulted from the stagnation of  European diplomacy over this issue. The entire international  diplomatic commitment has remained stuck at the limits of the  autonomy afforded by former Yugoslav President Tito in 1974,  while Albanian diplomacy has committed itself much further to  the idea of the republic. It is nevertheless indisputable that  the two presidents have now reached a common denominator in the  shape of dialogue with Milosevic.    Did Rugova move toward Berisha or did Berisha move toward  Rugova?    It must be said that there has been a basic contradiction  between the statements of the two Albanian presidents in recent  years, which, although resolved, cannot fail to leave a scar.  Berisha has continually declared that he supports Rugova's  policy, which means he supports the idea of the republic of  Kosova, at a time when at his meetings with leaders of foreign  diplomacy he has said that "Albania is not in favor of changing  borders by force but of respect for the rights of Albanians  wherever they are," which can imply all sorts of things but not  an independent and neutral Kosova.    This is understandable. Rugova has sat longer in the chair  given to him by his people than in the seats of European  diplomacy, whereas Berisha, as the president of a country  seeking to involve itself in European organizations, has  necessarily taken up the seat given him by international  diplomacy.    One can therefore firmly say that it was Rugova who moved  toward Berisha, which means that it was Rugova who could not  overcome the barriers imposed by those who lead the world and  decide what will happen to Bosnia. However, can it at the same  time be Rugova, who mediates in the Albanian-Serbian talks, at a  time when his theory has been shown to be obsolete and worthless  in a dialogue with Belgrade, which does not recognize him in the  capacity of president of Kosova?    At a time when no fresh figure who could mediate the  Albanian-Serbian talks is emerging in Prishtina, it seems that  in Tirana it is the Albanian Socialists, who long ago came out  in favor of dialogue with Belgrade, who are attempting to play  this high-value card. Well-informed sources report that Luan  Hajdaraga and Bashkim Zeneli, two of the Socialist leaders, held  a meeting lasting more than two hours in the Yugoslav Embassy in  Tirana, at which the central topic was precisely the problem of  Kosova and Rugova's policies. With the help of the  contradiction between the statements of the two Albanian  presidents, the Albanian Socialists perhaps wish to acquire a  proprietary interest in the cause of Kosova in Albania, hoping  that, if the title-deeds can pass to them, early elections may  become a reality.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> MAYOR, NEW COUNCIL MEMBERS SWORN IN  </P> <P> Promising to work to maintain the economic stability of Simi Valley in light of  recent state and federal budget cuts, Mayor Gregory Stratton took the oath of  office for the third time during ceremonies at City Hall.  </P> <P> Stratton, who defeated retired Los Angeles bus driver Alfred J. Wilson in the  Nov. 6 election, also welcomed new council members Sandi Webb and Judy Mikels  on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The two were also sworn into office by Municipal Judge John E. Dobroth during a  brief ceremony attended by about 75 people.  </P> <P> Webb, a local businesswoman, and Mikels, former chairwoman of the Planning  Commission, beat eight candidates, including incumbent Ann Rock, for two seats  on the council. Former Councilwoman Vicky Howard, whose term expired this  month, was elected to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> "I would like to thank all the people who worked on my campaign and, of course,  the people of Simi Valley who believed in me," Webb said after being sworn in.  "I intend to work very hard for them and to be very accessible."  </P> <P> In welcoming Webb and Mikels, Stratton warned the two that they were in for  long hours and hard work on the council.  </P> <P> "Say goodby to your husbands and loved ones and tell them that you will see  them again in four years," he said.  </P> <P> The council also paid tribute to Rock, who did not attend the ceremony, and  Howard for her eight years on the council and her recent election to the Board  of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Councilman Bill Davis, Howard's neighbor and opponent in the supervisorial  race, congratulated Howard and said he hoped that they could put their bitter  campaign rivalry to rest and work together.

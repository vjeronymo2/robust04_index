			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 6 Feb (AFP) -- General Raul Castro, minister  of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) warned Cubans  against any illegal immigration from the country via the U.S.  Guantanamo Base (1,000 km east of Havana), and stressed that any  such attempt could disturb the calm that currently prevails  around the base.    "The crime of illegally leaving the country is extremely  serious when the attempt is made at this border military zone,"  Raul Castro said.    It is a "provocation, a treacherous act against Cuban  national security," and a real "crazy exploit" because of the  danger of the mined zones and the presence of numerous forces,  from both sides, in the "no man's land" that surrounds the  base," Raul Castro said in a statement published today in  JUVENTUD REBELDE, a newspaper issued by the Union of Young  Communists (UJC).    "An incident occurring by chance or deliberately provoked by  the enemy in the no-man's land could lead to a conflict of  unpredictable proportions," he added in protest of the U.S.  attitude, which according to him, encourages the illegal  immigration of Cubans.    While the United States welcomes illegal Cuban immigrants  with open arms, "Haitians fleeing from extreme poverty and  bloody repression are stopped on the high seas and are  forcefully returned to their martyred country," Raul Castro said.    "In order to contain the economic immigration of millions of  Mexicans and Central Americans, the Yankees are building a tall,  long fence, comparable not only to the Berlin Wall, but also to  the ancient Chinese Wall," he went on.    JUVENTUD REBELDE did not specify the exact date which the  defense minister, who recently toured the eastern part of the  country, made that statement. The weekly did say, however, that  Raul Castro issued the warning during a visit to the military  hospital in Santiago de Cuba (900 km east of Havana), while  visiting a young soldier who was seriously injured by a mine in  early December in an effort to stop four fugitives from reaching  the Guantanamo Base.    With the worsening of the economic crisis in Cuba, attempts  to illegally leave the country -- particularly by sea -- to go  to Florida (United States) have increased from the northern  coasts of the archipelago and also from the Caimaneras Region,  bordering the Guantanamo Base.    [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 1743 GMT on 6 February  reports that according to Army Gen. Raul Castro, the illegal  departure from the country through the Guantanamo area, where  two Armies have been deployed, is very serious and constitutes a  provocation, "an act of treason against the national security of  our country. [quotation marks as received]    Raul Castro, first vice president of the Council of State,  accused Washington of encouraging for the past three decades the  illegal immigration of Cubans, who according to him, receive  exclusive and special treatment in U.S. immigration laws.    He recognized, however, that in the past year, during  William  Clinton's administration, there has been an atmosphere of  tranquility on both sides of the U.S. military base, which  occupies 117 square kilometers.    This Sunday, JUVENTUD REBELDE stated millions could be  killed  if the "cowboys of the unipolar world" were to fabricate an  incident that served as a "pretext" to invading Cuba.    "We have the right to be tough in applying sanctions. Those  who play around with sacred values cannot go unpunished," the  Cuban newspaper stated.]</p>

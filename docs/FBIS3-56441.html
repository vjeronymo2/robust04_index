			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Sunday [16 January] Russia's First Deputy  Premier Yegor Gaydar, who leads the Russian Choice bloc,  announced his decision to reject the post of first deputy  premier in the reorganized government.    According to him, he notified President Yeltsin and Premier  Chernomyrdin accordingly. Their attitude to his decision was  "sympathetic". "I discussed it with the president, and he  understands the situation perfectly."    When Chernomyrdin asked him about his attitude to the  possibility of giving this job to the prominent economist  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Gaydar said that he "would warmly welcome  his candidacy".    The Finance Minister, Boris Fedorov, "will take his own  decision in the next few days", Gaydar said (Interfax's note:  evidently he meant Fedorov's joining Russia's reorganized  government).    "We discussed this situation in detail with Chubays and  decided that it would be expedient to continue his work in the  government, at least till the time, when the privatisation  program to be concluded before July 1st, 1994, is implemented,"  said Gaydar.    "We hope that the government's policy will not be  drastically  altered after all," Gaydar noted.    According to Gaydar, the Social Security Minister, Ella  Pamfilova, has said that "under the circumstances she cannot  assume responsibility for the social policy, since she cannot be  responsible for the economic policy".    As Gaydar said, the Russian Choice faction in the State Duma  supported Gaydar's decision and "expressed its readiness for a  constructive dialogue and cooperation with the government".    Gaydar believes that "the presence of our colleagues in the  government is sensible and prudent in a number of directions,  particularly in all that is connected with international  politics and privatization".    "At the same time we must grant government members the  opportunity to consider everything once again and decide to what  extent they are capable of following the policy they and  ourselves view as responsible, and take a decision concerning  our participation in the new government proceeding from this,"  Gaydar said.    According to Gaydar, he has no claims on the post of  chairman  of the State Duma's planning and budget commission, and the  Russian Choice faction will support the Yavlinskiy bloc's  candidacy for it.</p>

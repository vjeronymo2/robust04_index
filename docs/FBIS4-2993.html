			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By C.C. Chen and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] London, April 13 (CNA) -- A group of influential  British parliamentarians Wednesday [13 April] called for world  support of Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT).    Speaking at a news conference after they unveiled a report  on  Britain-Mainland China relations, the lawmakers also suggested  that the world find a way to give Taiwan a voice in the United  Nations.    The report, prepared by the House of Commons' Foreign  Affairs  Committee, also reviews Taiwan's role in political and economic  development in the Asia-Pacific.    Noting that Taiwan is seeking increased presence on the  world  stage, the report says other countries can effectively help  Taiwan gain a say in world affairs by supporting Taiwan's GATT  bid.    As one of the world's major trading powers, the report says,  Taiwan should be admitted to the Geneva-based world trade forum  as soon as possible, regardless of the result of Beijing's GATT  membership application.    The report notes that Taiwan has applied to join GATT as a  separate customs territory, not a country. "This probably can be  used as a model for Taiwan to join other international  organizations," the report says.    It adds that Taiwan should be allowed a voice in the United  Nations. Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since  Beijing assumed the UN China seat in 1971.    The report continues that the world is obligated to persuade  Communist China to continue its gradually expanding exchanges  with Taiwan. It further advises the world, particularly  Communist China, to take into account Taiwan's desire for a  formal place in the international community.    The report urges the British Government to further improve  relations with Taiwan and better its treatment of Taiwan  representatives in London.    The 110-page report is the result of a year-long study by  the  11-member Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee held a  series of public hearings on prospects for London-Beijing ties  and its members also visited Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland  China to collect information about developments in the three  Chinese societies. The report is expected to become an  important reference for the British Government to formulate its  future policy toward Beijing and Taipei.    The committee's chairman, David Howell, said he was  impressed  by Taiwan's democratic reforms during his trip to Taipei last  September.    Howell pointed out that improvements in Taipei-London  relations are not related to conflicts between Britain and  Mainland China over Hong Kong, which reverts to communist rule  July 1, 1997.    "Britain should attach greater importance to its ties with  Taiwan since Taiwan has a dynamic booming economy and a  gradually maturing democratic system," Howell added.</p>

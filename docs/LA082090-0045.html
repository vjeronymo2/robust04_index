			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND REVIEWS;  </P> <P> KID FROST: POLITICAL RAP FOR CHICANO SOLIDARITY;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: HIS HIT 'LA RAZA' IS THE FIRST POPULAR EAST L.A. ANTHEM IN YEARS.  </P> <P> It was supposed to be incendiary; hot East L.A. rapper Kid Frost spitting out  angry, Chicano political rap in his first headlining show, but it seemed more  like date night in Reseda at the Country Club on Saturday.  </P> <P> Frost is being touted as the Mexican-American answer to gangster rap, reporting  the real scoop from the vicious Eastside streets. His image is kind of hard  core too, and on stage he surrounded himself with a bunch of ominous guys in  black caps, slim mustaches and dark shades, who glowered at the audience the  whole show. Still, his hit "La Raza" is the first popular East L.A. anthem in  years, and he seems more a spokesman for Chicano solidarity than a merry thug.  </P> <P> Kid Frost is a chunky guy with slicked-back hair, a reindeer-print poncho over  his T-shirt and chinos. A fat, gold rope around his neck supported a red, white  and green pendant in the shape of Mexico, in place of the Afrika medallions  worn by black unity rappers. He asked "How many people in the house speak  Spanish?" and the crowd exploded in cheers. He said "This is for La Raza," the  race, and they exploded again. He's got the Mexican-American equivalent of  "Black and Proud" down cold.  </P> <P> Frost has a truly idiomatic Chicano rap sound, underpinned with slightly  Latinate beats -- maybe the cha-cha settings on the drum machine that  generations of black rappers had ignored -- and overlaid with the kind of  tough, bouncy sax lines associated with the East L.A./Tex-Mex rock of the '60s.  His rapping style is light but fluent -- something like a Young M.C. with an  edge -- and his articulation is clear.  </P> <P> After half a dozen songs, Frost said good night, left the stage and waited for  the tumultuous applause that would call for an encore. Finally, Frost came out  -- a manhole-cover-size Aztec calendar slung around his neck -- and rapped  another number anyway.  </P></p>

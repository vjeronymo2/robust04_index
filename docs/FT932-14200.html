			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Second half sales boost for Asda Property ASDA Property Holdings has more than lived up to expectations with pre-tax profits showing a gain of 36 per cent for 1992 at Pounds 6.02m, compared with halved profits at the interim stage. During the year the sale of the greater part of its tenanted residential portfolio for Pounds 36m was completed, with a high proportion of it low income or non-income producing. This represented only slightly more than half of the total sales achieved during the year of some Pounds 70m; the net result at the year end was a reduction from Pounds 117m to Pounds 67m in net debt. Rental income showed marginally ahead at Pounds 11.2m. With other sales and additions the rent roll is now almost Pounds 13m which covers current interest and overheads more than 1.4 times. The impact on profit of the extraordinary level of sales was largely offset by property write-downs amounting to Pounds 1.3m and costs of Pounds 1.1m incurred in unwinding interest rate hedging against borrowings repaid. Financing charges showed a drop from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 10.7m. Mr Manny Davidson, chairman, told shareholders of progress on several fronts including commercial property, the investment portfolio and development projects. He also said that the group had been able to generate trading profits of more than Pounds 1m from new commercial ventures. The division was continuing the contribution to profits in the current year. He reported that investment acquisitions since the year end had been made totalling Pounds 12m with a combined yield of 13 per cent. All were modern properties let on long leases to a mix of good tenants and had potential for capital appreciation through active management. Earnings worked through at 8.1p (5.4p). The dividend total is increased to 2.1p (2p) with a recommended final payment of 1.45p.</p>

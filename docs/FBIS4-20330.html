			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shao Jianbiao (6730 0494 1753); Jia Mingsheng </F> (6328 2494 3932): "This Year the Feed Industry Will Rise to a  New Plateau"]    [Text] In 1993 with China's feed industry facing such  difficulties as tight resources, rising prices, and a shortage  of funds, it continued to maintain growth. Total production of  mixed and blended feeds reached 40 million tons, a 5 percent  increase over 1992.    According to a person in charge of the National Feed  Industry  Office, in 1993 China's feed industry production and sales had  the following characteristics: First, although overall  production rose, overall returns declined. Second, the greatest  decline was in production and returns of commercial grain system  feed enterprises. Their production share declined from 80  percent to 50 percent, but both the production and the returns  of livestock-raising, aquatic-product, and small town, and  individual enterprises, and "three kinds of foreign-invested  enterprises," increased rather greatly. Third, the demand for  feed for high-quality, high-grade fowl, fish, and special  animals was vigorous and full price mixed feed's share of total  production reached 80 percent. Fourth, the mix of feed products  was further adjusted and the tendency toward serialized and  standardized, and concentrated, and pre-mixed feeds increased by  about 50 percent, respectively, over the year before last.  Fifth, farmers' understanding of mixed feeds further improved.    Since reform and opening up, China's feed industry has  developed very rapidly, the feed industry system has gradually  improved, and it has become an important support to sustained  rapid growth of the livestock industry. Because of the  large-scale use of mixed and blended feeds, the remuneration  from feed greatly increased. To produce only the same amount of  livestock products, can save 8 million tons of feed grain  annually throughout the nation. Despite this, there still are  numerous problems currently in China's feed industry. The main  ones are: 1) The supply of feed resources, especially protein  resources, is tight and the prices have risen a great deal,  greatly increasing feed costs, but the prices of feed products  cannot keep pace, causing feed enterprise operations that  formerly made only slight profits to experience losses, and  economic results have generally declined. 2) Some large- and  medium-sized state feed enterprises, faced with market  competition, have been unable to convert their operating  mechanisms in a timely fashion. The enterprises lack vitality  and production and economic returns simultaneously slide. 3)  Macroeconomic controls are not strong and industry  administration is weak. Because industry administrative  departments lack the necessary administrative methods and rules  and regulations, duplicate development, blind growth, and the  existence of counterfeit and inferior goods are serious,  seriously affecting the healthy development of the feed industry.    So, the National Feed Industry Office has explicitly  proposed  the guiding thought for 1994: Further intensify reform and rely  on scientific and technical progress and improvement in product  quality, adjustments in the industry and product mix to strive  to attain a production volume of 42 million to 43 million tons  for mixed and blended feed and an 85 percent share for  full-price mixed feed. In the light of the current state of the  industry, while enhancing industry administration and further  improving standards, rules and regulations, and the service  system regarding the feed industry, it is important to adopt the  following measures:    1. Strictly control low-quality duplicate development. In  areas where feed processing capacity essentially satisfies  demand, generally do not set up new feed processing factories.    2. Progressively upgrade the technology of some processing  enterprises. Plan to use four years and invest 2 billion yuan to  upgrade technology for a 20 million ton feed processing capacity.    3. Speed up development of protein resources and feed  additives, mainly: Using 300,000 tons of cotton and rapeseed  cakes, 100,000 tons of feed yeast, 600 tons of vitamin A, 800  tons of vitamin E, 200 tons of vitamin B[.sub]2[/], and  25,000 tons of calcium hydrogen phosphate, and 10,000 tons of  lysine, and setting up a 3 million mu soybean base  for comprehensive use.    4. Speed up the conversion of scientific and technical  achievements to productivity. In more than ten years of tackling  scientific and technical problems, we have a large batch of  scientific research results in such areas as feed resource  exploitation and make up, and feed additives and we urgently  need to organize the total area and expand its utilization. This  year we will select a group from them and expand it to improve  the overall technical level of the feed industry.    5. Continue to intensify surveys and research and more  intensively research major problems that affect the development  of the feed industry such as adjusting the import and export  policy and the purchase and sales policy for feed resources and  striving for various preferential policies and proposing  adjustments in the mix of crops planted and expanding feed crop  production.</p>

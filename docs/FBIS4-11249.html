			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The </F> Fallacy of Social Dumping"]    [Text] The speech with which U.S. Vice President Al Gore  closed the GATT meeting gave the wrong tone to the transition  period that the multilateral trade organ has now begun toward  its transformation into the World Trade Organization (WTO). The  U.S. vice president brought to the fore the same subject that  the U.S. and French delegations unsuccessfully tried to include  in the ministerial declaration of Marrakech: the social dumping  issue. Like almost all the initiatives of the Clinton  administration, this is a clumsy, incomplete proposal that has  provoked ambivalent perceptions and dubious feelings. It gives  the impression of an ingredient that has been deliberately  undercooked to be used later for whatever purpose. The  representatives of developing countries have consequently, and  rightly, rejected the idea. No matter how good the intentions  of the U.S. Government -- which has declared its desire to  preserve human rights -- the effects of a social agenda will be  those of the most glaring protectionism, the victims of which  will be those economies that use manpower in large volume.    This issue has emerged with a touch of irony. Developing  nations have for decades tried to go from theoretical discussion  and factual descriptions to the adoption of concrete  compensatory mechanisms for resolving the problem of the  deteriorated terms of exchange. While the price per volume of  raw materials and semi-processed products exported by poor  countries was steadily dropping, the manufactured products  exported by industrialized countries consumed -- at a growing  speed -- the currency reserves of poor countries. Entire  forests were cut down for producing paper on which to print the  speeches and studies on the deterioration of the terms of  exchange made at multilateral forums like ECLA [Economic  Commission for Latin America], Ecosoc [Economic and Social  Council] [Consejo Economico y Social], GATT, and in universities.    This has produced no change in world trade. Over the past 30  years the price of coffee -- which supported the economy of  entire nations -- has dropped to the current levels, at which it  is impossible to run a farm. Copper, which guaranteed  prosperity of an extractive agricultural country like Chile, is  today anachronistic, and fiber optics and other energy  transmission techniques are expected to soon declare its final  death as a generator of wealth.    All this has produced compulsory changes, always involving  economic loss and social friction which, whenever well-managed,  are recalled by people as a difficult transition to better  times. In several cases, though, it has placed countries with  an extractive, primary economy on the list of the poor.    Vice President Al Gore now also wants the terms of exchange  to be regulated by the salaries and social rights of workers in  exporting countries. The argument is terrifyingly simple. An  underlying condition is that because human rights are the same  everywhere and in all nations, social rights should also be the  same. This will finally lead to the equalization of salaries,  just as the trend toward globalization of production has  equalized prices. A surtax should be applied to the production  of countries in which manpower is cheaper and social rights  narrower or less generous. This surtax will eliminate the  comparative advantage of lower personnel costs.    It is not necessary to say that this funny theory will clash  with the vast majority of developing countries, which over the  past few years have oriented their industry toward the export  sector. Industrialized countries will look for the solution to  the problems that have been caused by their own high social  costs inside developing countries, or in countries that have  recently developed their industry. They will be transforming  conditions that fall within the jurisdiction of national organs  into conditions for international trade. The fact that  countries either pay high salaries or give few social benefits  to their workers to promote their exports would at no time be  taken into account. Low salaries are caused by low  productivity, and this cannot be resolved through tariff  surcharges.    The proposal by Al Gore actually aims at transferring to  developing countries the social and unemployment problems that  industrialized countries are now confronting. At the Marrakech  meeting Foreign Minister Celso Amorim went right to the point in  his speech, in which he repudiated the social dumping thesis.  It is an anti-liberal thesis driven by the siren song of  freedom and equality. It is protectionism in its most  detestable form, because it distorts values that must be  preserved.</p>

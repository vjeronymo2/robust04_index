			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Vance and Owen tackle Serbs on ethnic cleansing THE international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, confronted Serbian and Yugoslav officials in Belgrade yesterday with fresh allegations of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and tried to bolster the Geneva peace process. Mr Vance, the United Nations envoy, and Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, were expected to discuss reports of ethnic cleansing of Croats and Moslems by Serb forces, as well as stepped-up air attacks which are seen as part of the campaign to force non-Serbs to flee from Serb-controlled regions of Bosnia. Sarajevo radio yesterday warned the inhabitants of the besieged Bosnian capital of imminent air attacks. The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference held closed-door talks with Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic and General Zivota Panic, the commander of the Yugoslav army. Diplomats in Belgrade said the two envoys would seek an accord on the demilitarisation of Prevlaka, a strategic peninsula on Croatia's southern Adriatic coastline which is controlled by the Yugoslav army. An accord on Prevlaka would unblock access to Dubrovnik, the Croatian port. The two envoys were also expected to take up the creation of safe passages for civilians in Bosnia and the return of Croatian refugees to UN peacekeeping zones in Croatia, said UN officials. They were due to discuss the reopening of the Belgrade-Zagreb motorway, closed since last August. Thousands of Croats have threatened to stage a march on their former homes in Baranja, north-eastern Croatia, many of which are housing Serb refugees from Croatia. The envoys met Mr Radoje Kontic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, instead of the prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, who was still in the US. Later yesterday they were due to meet Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia. UN peacekeepers put intense pressure on the Croatian government yesterday to prevent thousands of refugees from going ahead with a 'march to their deaths' into Serb-held territory, Reuter reports from Zagreb. One UN official said yesterday that the threatened march into the Baranja region of eastern Slavonia by up to 10,000 unarmed refugees impatient to reclaim homes before the start of winter would be a 'Balkan Sharpeville'.</p>

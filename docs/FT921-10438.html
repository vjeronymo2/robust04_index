			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Alphameric launches package in order to continue trading DIRECTORS of Alphameric yesterday put forward a three-pronged financial package aimed at helping the loss-making electronic data processing equipment group continue to trade. They warned that if the proposals were not approved and implemented it was, in their opinion, 'unlikely that the group will be able to continue to trade.' They added that as a result, it was 'doubtful that there would be any assets for distribution to shareholders.' The group is calling for: Pounds 4.3m net via a placing and open offer of 20.62m new shares at 23p each. The shares have been conditionally placed with institutions with a clawback for qualifying shareholders on an 11-for-2 basis. A reorganisation of the ordinary capital entailing the consolidation of 30 existing 5p shares into one new ordinary share with a nominal value of 150p and then sub-dividing each consolidated share into one new 2.5p ordinary and one deferred share of 147.5p. Each new ordinary will have the same rights as those attaching to the existing shares. A capital reduction via the cancellation of the deferred and special redeemable shares together with cancellation of the amount remaining in the share premium account following payment in full of the new offer shares. The cancellations would result in the creation of a separate reserve amounting to Pounds 20.5m against which the company would be able to write off the Pounds 15.4m deficit on its profit and loss account and set off goodwill arising on consolidation. The convertible preference share capital, currently owned by 3i Group, is also subject to changes. The proposals are subject to approval by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting convened for February 28 and the High Court. The group also reported a loss of Pounds 377,000 (Pounds 1.75m) pre-tax for the six months to end-September after taking account of an exceptional credit of Pounds 1.12m which arose from the sale of the financial systems division. Turnover from continuing activities totalled Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 3.89m). Losses per share emerged at 0.3p (1.7p). The shares closed 1 1/4 p lower at 1p.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (7): The battle intensifies - Race to supply new operating systems software - The emerging mid-range systems market has now become the main battleground for the new strand of operating system development Operating systems software occupies a pivotal position in modern computer systems. Not only does the choice of operating system define the computer hardware - it also defines the application. The choice of operating systems platform has, in effect, replaced the choice of hardware for users. While in the past, there was always a danger that computer users could become dependent upon their hardware supplier, over the last decade the emphasis has shifted to the operating system platform supplier. This has become increasingly confusing for users and software developers who are looking for a stable platform on which to build applications. The result has been a bitter public conflict among operating system suppliers, each hoping to gain dominance in the market. This conflict dates back to the mid-1980s when the virtues of common operating environments were first recognised. The success of IBM's Personal Computer (PC) along with Microsoft's MS/Dos created a large, homogeneous software product market for the first time. Previously, every computer came with its own operating environment - making it impossible to move application software from one machine to another without significant changes. The MS/Dos PC changed this and allowed a new breed of mass market software developers such as Lotus, Novell and Microsoft to dominate personal computer software. Towards the end of the 1980s, these and other software producers saw that the same approach could be taken to build software for larger systems - either in the form of PC networks or client-server systems. The need emerged, therefore, for an operating environment which could deliver the same advantages as a PC operating system, while coping with the greater complexity of multi-user systems. It is this emerging mid-range systems market which has become the main battleground for the new strand of operating system development. There is no shortage of contenders. Microsoft is in pole position with the extended version of its successful Windows-MS/Dos operating system for the PC. Known as Windows NT, it is claimed to be the natural migration path for single PC users who want to move into multi-user networked systems. Microsoft aimed to sell a million copies by the end of its first year and, while this target has proved to be ambitious, Microsoft has managed to get close to it. More significantly, sales of the original Windows are now about 50m worldwide and growing quickly. Microsoft's main rival comes from a combination of Novell and other Microsoft competitors who back various flavours of the Unix operating system originated by AT&amp;T's Bell laboratories in the 1970s. Unix has the advantage of a long history of supporting multiple users and wide backing across the industry. Most hardware manufacturers offer a Unix platform - although they are not as consistent as they should be in conforming to the standards. Unix has managed to gain some success in the mid-range systems market and a good portfolio of applications software now exists for it. The other main rival to Windows NT is OS/2 - an operating system developed originally by both Microsoft and IBM. When it was announced in 1987, it was designed to replace MS/Dos. But after slow initial success, IBM and Microsoft went their separate ways - leaving IBM to continue OS/2 development on its own. OS/2 has attracted a solid core of established large IBM customers because it fits in well with their existing systems. The OS/2 operating systems has an estimated four million users worldwide - but has had little success outside the IBM market. These three - Windows NT, Unix and OS/2 - are the main contenders in the operating systems conflict and each faction has embarked on a campaign to attract firstly, application software developers and, secondly, end-user companies. The conflict is further confused, however, by the emergence of a new strain of object-oriented operating systems. Apple's Macintosh, for example, has attracted attention - although it is limited by its ties to Apple's hardware. Apple founder Steve Jobs left to form Next Computer in the late 1980s, creating yet another potential rival operating environment. Next has built a version of its Nextstep object-oriented system for the PC and, again, has scored some success in niche markets. Another object-oriented environment has grown out of a joint venture between Apple and IBM under the Taligent name. Taligent promises to improve development productivity with its operating system - although it will be some time before it its ready for the market. The primary task of all of the contenders in the operating system battle is to woo software package developers. MS/Dos was successful because Microsoft was able to persuade a large number of application builders to base their packages on it. Software developers are sanguine about operating systems, however, and many have accepted that, unlike the MS/Dos market, they will have to back several different options. 'We have taken the view that the operating system is irrelevant to the end-user and are working to hide it,' explains Mr Ketan Karia, director of marketing at application software tool specialist Cognos UK. 'We aim to make our tools work across a range of operating systems but we are concentrating on Unix and Windows NT at the moment.' Mr Derek Masters, managing director of Sterling Software UK, comes at the problem from a different angle. As a veteran software supplier to the IBM mainframe market, Mr Masters says his company has been driven by customers moving from mainframe-based systems to networked systems. 'Three years ago our customers were entirely mainframe based. Now they have lots of Unix, Windows and OS/2 systems which they want attached to their mainframes. We have had to change our products to cover the whole range.' Sterling's products involve managing communications and data storage across an enterprise and must, therefore, be capable of coping with any operating environment which might be connected to the network. 'Microsoft is in a strong position with Windows NT - although we find our traditional customers favour OS/2 because of its IBM background. Then again we see Unix creeping in - especially in applications which use electronic data interchange (EDI),' Mr Masters adds. In theory, users should not have to worry about operating systems and, in the long term, it seems likely that much of burden caused different environments will be shouldered by tool builders. Meanwhile, software developers and users will have to accept that they must keep an eye on all of the main contenders - and maybe some of the 'also-rans.'</p>

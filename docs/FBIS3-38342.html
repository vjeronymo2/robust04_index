Last Attempt To Improve Offers Before Marrakesh"; as  released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Geneva, 31 January (ATS) -- The world commercial  powers of the Group of Four (United States, European Union,  Canada, and Japan) held a meeting in Geneva on Monday [31  January] in order to prepare for the signing of the Uruguay  Round trade agreements in Marrakesh (Morocco) in April. These  agreements were concluded among 117 states in Geneva last  December. The Americans still hope to persuade Japan to improve  its offer of market access.    The United States thinks that the negotiations with Japan on  market access are not over. The Japanese, on the other hand,  retort that the discussions on this subject are closed.  Washington expects from Tokyo a larger reduction in customs  duties on certain products (timber, copper, and alcohol),  according to a diplomatic source.  <H5>  "Balanced Context" </H5>   "If we can improve market access with Japan, we will do so,  but this must be done in a balanced context," Hugo Paemen,  European Union deputy director general of foreign economic  relations, said.    "An improvement is still possible," Mr. Paemen said.  However, the issues so far discussed are essentially marginal.  "We will not reopen the negotiations," the European official  stressed, adding that it was impossible to go back on what had  been achieved. The Europeans think they have completed their  negotiations with everybody.    A meeting of experts from the four commercial powers will be  held on Tuesday with the aim of putting clearly down on paper  the lists of tariff offers. The Group of Four is due to meet in  around 10 days for a final verification of the offers. This  meeting will take place shortly before 15 February, the deadline  set by the GATT secretariat for the submission of the final  lists.</p>

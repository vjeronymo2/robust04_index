The so-called Civilian Society Board has its headquarters in  Zocalo, Mexico City's urban and political center, and is  expected to continue operating until 10 April, the anniversary  of the murder of revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata, the name  the guerrillas decided to adopt during their 1 January  insurrection.    The discussion is somewhat similar to what the EZLN is  already doing in the Laconda jungle and Altos de Chiapas  communities. It is aimed at obtaining approval or disapproval of  the agreements signed on 3 March in San Cristobal de las Casas,  located 780 km southeast of Mexico City.    In the capital city, the Judicial Commission of the Civic  Action National Coordinator for National Liberation (CONAC-LN),  founded by Benito Miron, former official of the Federal Labor  Board, and Ricardo Barco, leader of the Proletariat Independent  Movement (MPI), organized the consultation. Both said they have  documents signed by EZLN military leader Subcommander Marcos  where the military leader acknowledges them as his legal  representatives in Mexico City. They both said that during the  consultation they expect to learn society's opinion on whether  or not the government's answers satisfy the demands that  prompted the EZLN to take up arms. The consultation also seeks  to establish society's opinion on whether or not the agreement  between the government and the guerrillas will allow peace with  dignity, which is one of the Zapatists' main demands.    In addition, the discussion tables will receive general  proposals to be included in a "list of proposals by the civilian  society which will be sent to the EZLN and the Mexican  Government to be taken into account in possible future  dialogues."    The CONAC-LN foresees the establishment of similar  discussion  tables in other cities, according to Miron and Barco, who  disclosed the results of a legal study on the previous  agreements between the Zapatist guerrillas and the government.  According to analysts, the official responses to the Zapatists  were made "in a confusing, evasive language void of concrete  proposals."    In February, the EZLN offered to present all the agreements  reached by the 19 delegates of the Indian Revolutionary  Clandestine Committee with Camacho Solis in a referendum. The  encounter that lasted 10 days took place at the more than  100-year-old San Cristobal de las Casa cathedral, and Bishop  Samuel Ruiz Garcia, dioceses official, was the mediator.    The Zapatist delegates presented 34 demands, 32 on the  social  and economic situation of 1 million Indians in Chiapas to which  Camacho Soils offered, in the government's behalf, 34 solutions.  After that meeting, the Zapatists discussed each of the  agreements with the communities under their influence in Altos  de Chiapas and the Laconada Jungle, where allegedly  approximately 300,000 persons live.    The government refused to discuss national policies with the  EZLN. The EZLN had demanded Carlos Salinas de Gortari's  resignation or a change in the electoral legislation to  guarantee impartiality of the 21 August presidential elections.</p>

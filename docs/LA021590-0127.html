			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER POOR SEASON, UCLA RECRUITING HITS HOMER IN TEXAS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: RETURN OF SMITH HELPS BRUINS SIGN SEVEN PLAYERS FROM LONE  STAR STATE.  </P> <P> With many high school football seniors honoring earlier oral commitments, there  were not many surprises Wednesday, the first day for signing letters of intent.  </P> <P> Despite its worst season in 18 years, UCLA brought in a blue-chip recruiting  class headed by seven prep players from Texas and a pair of outstanding local  linebackers.  </P> <P> The Bruins, who benefited from the return of Homer Smith as offensive  coordinator, saw their efforts in the Lone Star State pay off. They signed  three prep All-Americans, defensive back Othello Henderson and tailback Daron  Washington of Killeen Ellison, and defensive lineman Paul Kennedy of Austin.  </P> <P> Other UCLA recruits from Texas are defensive back Carl Greenwood of Corpus  Christi, tight end Bobby Gray of Arlington, fullback Shane Jasper of Troup and  linebacker Brian Tighe of Pflugerville.  </P> <P> The Bruins also landed linebackers Bruce Walker of Compton Dominguez and Nkosi  Littleton of Carson.  </P> <P> "We feel that this group has the potential to be a fine class two or three  years down the road," said UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, whose team finished 3-7-1  last season in only his second losing season.  </P> <P> Other Bruin signees included linebackers Randy Cole of Santa Monica College,  Rod Smalley of Santa Ynez, London Woodfin of Sylmar, and Andrew McClave of  Portland, Ore.; linemen Ryan Motherway of Santa Ana Mater Dei, Sale Isia of  Oceanside, and Eric Banducci of Santa Monica; receivers Mike Nguyen of  Portland, Ore., Kevin Jordan of Beltsville, Md., Bryan Adams of Bakersfield,  and J. J. Stokes of San Diego Pt. Loma; tight end Jason Green of La Puente  Bishop Amat; defensive back Marvin Goodwin of Camden, N.J., and Chris Alexander  of Hawthorne.  </P> <P> USC TROJANS  </P> <P> USC, the three-time defending Pacific 10 Conference champion, signed 18 prep  players and one junior college player, offensive lineman Derrick Deese of El  Camino College, who has already enrolled.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased with our class of recruits," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "It's an  outstanding class with a lot of great athletes. We've filled a lot of our  needs. There are players who help us at every position and some who have a  chance to play as freshmen."  </P> <P> Among them is Curtis Conway of Hawthorne, who signed with USC last year but  failed to qualify academically. Conway, a prep All-American quarterback and the  state 100-meter champion in track in 1989, will enroll this fall. He attended  El Camino College as a part-time student this year.  </P> <P> The Trojans, who will graduate four offensive and two defensive linemen from  last season's Rose Bowl championship team, signed eight other line recruits.The  prep signers are Andre Abrams of Perris, Chris Andresen of Downey Warren, Tony  Boselli of Boulder, Colo.; Joe Cajic of Phoenix; Norberto Garrido of La Puente  Workman, Jason Keiderling of Reseda and Kris Pollack of Fresno.  </P> <P> USC also signed running backs Michael Jones of Van Nuys Montclair Prep and  Jerome Casey of Sylmar; wide receivers John Herpin of La Porte, Tex., and Ryan  Lenderman of Grand Junction, Colo.; defensive backs Jason Oliver of  Bakersfield, Errol Small of Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and Deon Strother of  Oakland Skyline; and tight end Elic Mahone of Pasadena Muir.  </P> <P> In Herpin and Lenderman, USC signed two of the most sought-after receivers in  the country. Although he broke his arm in his fourth game and was sidelined for  the rest of 1989 season, Herpin was rated as the top receiver in Texas by many.  Lenderman, who is the cousin of former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury, caught  251 passes in his prep career, one shy of the national record.  </P> <P> USC signed a pair of outstanding linebackers in Willie McGinest of Long Beach  Poly and Jeff Kopp of Danville San Ramon.  </P> <P> McGinest, a 6-6 outside linebacker, was a consensus All-American last season in  making 107 tackles with 18 sacks. Kopp, 6-3 and 230, is another consensus  All-American who made 172 tackles with seven sacks and four fumble recoveries.  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Colorado signed four Southland players -- wingback Erik Mitchell of Los  Alamitos, wide receiver Charles Johnson of San Bernardino Cajon, defensive back  Blake Anderson of Palos Verdes and tight end Christian Fauria Encino Crespi.  </P> <P> Highly touted Glendora 6-4 quarterback J. J. O'Laughlin signed with Illinois,  becoming the eighth California quarterback to play for the Illini in the past  10 years.  </P> <P> Fresno State signed quarterback Armin Youngblood and wide receivers Tydus  Winans and Michael Ross of Carson; running backs Ron Rivers of San Bernardino  San Gorgonio, James Fuller of Los Angeles Locke and Greg Greene of Pomona  Garey.  </P> <P> New Mexico signed six local players -- defensive backs Vincent Bonner of  Westchester, Fred Easter of Riverside City College and Herbert McKinley of  Moreno Valley Canyon Springs; wide receivers Manley Woods of Gardena and Dion  Thompson of San Bernardino San Gorgonio and running back Tony Foster of Moreno  Valley.  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas signed two local players -- defensive back Bobby Perkins of  Carson and quarterback John Ma'ae of Wilmington Banning.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton signed two Banning wide receivers, Terrance Campbell and  Sheldon Butler, and running back Chris Peery of Canyon Country Canyon. Banning  defensive backs Curtis Daniel and Nizam Walter signed with Michigan State and  Vanderbilt.  </P> <P> (Orange County Edition) * Lettermen: The list is long as at least 35 county  players sign letters of intent.

Stoyan Andov told AFP he had passed the invitation addressed  to all 24 of Athens's Euro-MPs to the Greek deputy chairman of  the European Parliament, Yeoryios Anastasopoulos, on the  sidelines of a pan-European transport conference being held in  this Cretan town.    The offer comes a month after Athens imposed a controversial  trade blockade on FYROM in an effort to force the former  Yugoslav republic to change its flag, its name and its  constitution, and cease what Greece views as hostile propaganda  and territorial claims towards the hellenic state.    "It is a shame that we cannot speak to each other in such a  situation, at least among parliamentarians," Andov said, adding  that direct contacts between the neighbour countries had reached  a dead end.    Anastasopoulos, however, told AFP he had indicated to Andov  that a visit by Greek Eurodeputies to Skopje "could take place,  but (only) in the event of a normalisation of relations between  the two countries."    Anastasopoulos said the offer would be considered, but that  he was sceptical as to the usefulness of such a meeting.    Andov said he had been unable to discuss the crisis with  Greek governmental representatives, but that he had a "friendly"  talk with Konstandinos Tsimas, a Greek Eurodeputy of the ruling  Socialist (PASOK) [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party.    Tsimas said the two men had "chewed the fat," but that,  although he would pass on Andov's invitation to his party, he  "could not see a lot of interest" in the offer.    In a separate development in Bonn, FYROM President Kiro  Gligorov said Wednesday he favoured global discussions with  Greece, but stressed he would not bow to the pressure of the  embargo.    The embargo "could have tragic consequences" for the  stability of the region, he told journalists on a visit to  Germany a day ahead of a meeting with Bonn's Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel.    He added that the bilateral standoff could only be resolved  through "dialogue, compromise and good faith," and called on the  European Union [EU] and the United Nations to participate in  efforts to find a solution.    Since Greece began its political offensive against Macedonia  two years ago, only two Athens-based Eurodeputies and no  national parliamentarians at all have made the trip to FYROM.    One Greek Eurodeputy, leftist Mikhael Papayianakis, and  around 600 Greek intellectuals and celebrities have criticised  the blockade.    The embargo was sparked last month after the United States  formally recognised FYROM.    Many Western countries have also recognised the former  Yugoslav republic, while Greece's EU partners have fiercely  condemned the Athens blockade.</p>

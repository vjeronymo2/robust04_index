			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BARRICADED WOMAN, 19, FOUND DEAD IN IRVINE  </P> <P> Irvine police Wednesday sealed off a three-block area and evacuated 10  residences while dispatching a special negotiating team in an attempt to get a  young woman who had barricaded herself in her home to surrender.  </P> <P> But when police finally entered the Rossano Street home of Crista Barrow, 19,  they found the woman fatally wounded, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot  wound to the head.  </P> <P> The incident began at about 3 p.m. when police entered into a 2-hour  negotiating session with the distraught young woman. Officers set up an  evacuation center at a nearby park for residents whose homes were near the  barricaded house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shot Once in Temple  </P> <P> Irvine Police Lt. Mike White said Barrow shot herself once in the temple with a  .32-caliber pistol about 5 p.m.  </P> <P> She died about 4 hours later at UCI Medical Center in Orange, according to a  hospital official.  </P> <P> White said police earlier had received an urgent call from a woman representing  Barrow's psychologist. She warned officers that Barrow had a gun and was very  upset.  </P> <P> Shortly after the incident began, White said, Barrow fired one shot into a wall  of the house on the quiet residential street. Then, 2 hours into the standoff,  police heard a second shot and rushed through the front door. She was found  unconscious on the floor.  </P> <P> Paramedics treating Barrow took her by helicopter to the medical center.  </P> <P> "Apparently, she was upset over some kind of drug problem and was extremely  agitated when our officers arrived. She told one of the officers that she had a  gun and was going to commit suicide," White said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slammed Door  </P> <P> Barrow then showed one of the officers the gun and slammed the door in the  officer's face, White added.  </P> <P> "After that, we backed off and called in our negotiation team," White said.  </P> <P> Police negotiators talked with Barrow through a window, attempting to get her  to surrender, but she refused all attempts, according to White.  </P> <P> Police set up the evacuation center at Norwood Community Park, about 4 blocks  away. But park recreation leaders said none of the residents opted to use the  facility.  </P></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: WH Smith The problems of the Do It All home improvement chain are turning into a war of attrition for joint venturers WH Smith and Boots. While the ferocity of last summer's price fight has abated, there are signs that Texas and B&amp;Q are keeping up the pressure on poorly placed Do It All. What is even more worrying is that the parents now seem less convinced that they have found an answer. No further new money will come from the top to move to better sites or convert shops to the much-vaunted new format, so it is difficult to see Do It All improving much unless the housing market turns up decisively. Do It All fits more naturally with Boots' operations and a single parent might be prepared to take tough decisions. The cost of leaving the sorry episode behind might be worth bearing - always supposing that WH Smith can persuade Boots to take the body away. None of this would matter if the previously rock-solid high street chains were still going strong. Video and recorded music sales are very important to the group, yet the declining teenage audience seems to be turning to other pursuits. The demise of the singles market and the high price of compact discs may have caused a structural shift away from recorded music which minor price cuts will not reverse. There is also the vague threat of VAT on books and newspapers, which must tempt a cash-hungry chancellor. WH Smith has suffered from its safe-but-dull image as the market has sought out recovery stories. It would be doubly unfortunate if the group merely proves to be dull.</p>

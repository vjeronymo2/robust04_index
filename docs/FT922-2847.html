			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Alvis tops Pounds 1.5m after 50% growth INTEREST flowing from its positive cash balance enabled Alvis, the engineering group, to advance pre-tax profit by 50 per cent in the six months to March 31. There was a Pounds 1.5m swing round to interest received of Pounds 450,000, leading to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 1.04m). Turnover fell to Pounds 42m (Pounds 45.3m) and operating surplus to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 2.09m). Mr John Robertshaw, chairman, said all companies traded profitably but results of the Alvis Industries division were disappointing. Margins at aerospace and transmissions were affected by the disruption caused by the move of Self Changing gears to Walsgrave, logistics suffered a sharp drop in the intake of spares orders from the MoD and vehicles saw some delay in deliveries of Stormer carrier vehicles for the Starstreak missile project. Losses per share were again 0.8p and the interim dividend is held at 0.5p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The nation on Tuesday  marks the 34th anniversary of "the April 19 revolution," which  toppled the corrupt regime of Syngman Lee and carries deep  significance for President Kim Yong-sam as he claims to be the  legitimate heir to the spirit of reform and political integrity.    As soon as Kim was inaugurated as the first civilian  president in more than three decades last year, he officially  placed the April 19 uprising in its proper historical context,  calling it "a revolution."    Kim has not only issued orders to "sanctify" the tombs of  those felled by the bullets of policemen during the student-led  uprising, but also became the first president to visit the  Suyuri cemetery and pay his respects to the dead.    President Kim's particular feeling for the revolution is not  unrelated to the government's plans to host commemorative  activities with bereaved family members and other groups  associated with the event, sources said.    Government preparations come as the ruling Democratic  Liberal  Party and the main opposition Democratic Party are locked in  debate over which side boasts more members who played an active  role in the uprising.    "What the students aimed for on April 19, 1960, was  precisely  the democratization of the country," President Kim said.    It was a popular uprising against corruption and injustice  and intended to realize a just and clean society, Kim said.    Kim placed his civilian government "on the extension" of the  April 19 revolution and vowed to develop its spirit, according  to the presidential office at Chongwadae.    President Kim has visited the cemetery on April 19 every  year  except in 1981 and 1982, when he was under house arrest.    Time and again, Kim has emphasized that historical  evaluations of the April 19 uprising must be revised since the  administrations of former Army generals that followed have tried  only "to beautify" the military coup on May 16, 1961.    The April 19 uprising toppled the Lee government but, taking  advantage of the ensuing political chaos, Gen. Pak Chong-hui and  his associates in the military grabbed power a year later.    Since the student uprising have been belittled under the Pak  government and its successors with dubious legitimacy, President  Kim believes his administration must help correct inaccuracies  about the uprising and preserve its historical significance.    Under a presidential order, Seoul City started last October  to double the size of the Suyuri cemetery and build a  commemorative building there costing 15 billion won. The  renovation work is expected to be completed on April 19, 1995.    On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang will attend a  ceremony sponsored by the government. Smaller ceremonies on the  provincial and municipal levels and other commemorative events  are scheduled.    President Kim, the heads of the two other branches of  government and some 500 dignitaries are expected to pay their  respects at the cemetery.</p>

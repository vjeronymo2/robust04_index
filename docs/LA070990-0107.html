			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CZECH EX-PARTY BOSS SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS  </P> <P> Prague's former Communist Party boss was found guilty today of abuse of power  and sentenced to four years in jail in the first conviction of a member of the  country's former hard-line leadership.  </P> <P> The official, Miroslav Stepan, had ordered use of water cannon and tear gas  against demonstrators in Prague in the fall of 1988. A year later, a popular  uprising toppled the authoritarian Communist government.  </P> <P> Dozens of Czechoslovak citizens crowded in front of the small room where the  district court verdict was handed down, and some expressed satisfaction.  </P> <P> "That serves him right -- that's exactly what he deserved," an elderly woman  said.  </P> <P> Under Czechoslovak law, sentencing comes at the time of conviction.  </P> <P> Stepan appealed the verdict but was to remain in custody. No date was set for  the appeal, which was to be heard by a municipal court.  </P> <P> The court ruled that he had "unjustifiably" overstepped the bounds of his  office when, as chairman of the Prague Defense Council, he ordered the action  against the demonstrators Oct. 28, 1988.  </P> <P> He was also accused of having demonstrators transported outside Prague in  January, 1989, after they failed to disperse as ordered by police.  </P> <P> Stepan, 44, was arrested Dec. 23, 1989, less than a month after stepping down  as Prague party boss. He was the first member of the country's Communist  leadership to be brought to trial.  </P> <P> The trial, which began June 25, was initially held behind closed doors but was  opened to the public four days later after strong complaints in the  Czechoslovak media.  </P> <P> Stepan had pleaded innocent and said it was a political trial. He appealed to  President Vaclav Havel to hold no more such trials.  </P> <P> Five other former high-ranking officials, including Communist Party leader  Milos Jakes and chief ideologue Vasil Bilak, were detained last month and  accused of "serious criminal activity." But all were released within 48 hours.  </P> <P> Stepan, who joined the party's ruling Politburo in December, 1987, had a  reputation as a ruthless hard-liner.  </P></p>

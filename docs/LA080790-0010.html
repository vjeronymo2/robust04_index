			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS SAN DIEGO TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> GAVALDON WINS, SEEKS CHANCE TO PLAY NAVRATILOVA  </P> <P> Angelica Gavaldon came dressed for success. The color-conscious 16-year old  from Coronado left the neons at home and opted instead for all-white.  </P> <P> But the player who has quickly developed a reputation as being one of the more  flamboyant dressers on the tour didn't break with tradition entirely -- a red  band held her long hair in place.  </P> <P> In her opening match of the Great American Bank Tennis Tournament Monday night,  Gavaldon played like a seasoned veteran, defeating West Germany's Claudia  Porwik, 7-5, 6-4 before 3,514 at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. The  victory earned Gavaldon, who turned professional in February, the chance to  play the second-ranked player in the world, should Martina Navratilova win her  opening match against Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer tonight at 6:30.  </P> <P> "Even though I was down in both sets," Gavaldon said, "I was very happy to be  able to come back."  </P> <P> Since Friday's draw, Gavaldon has known Navratilova would be her opponent in  the second round, should she beat Porwik as expected.  </P> <P> Gavaldon made it to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in January, then  was stopped by Porwik.  </P> <P> "It's not my best victory," she said of winning Monday night, "but I was happy  to get another chance to play her. I could have gotten to the semis at the  Australian Open if I had beat her there."  </P> <P> With her powerful groundstrokes, Gavaldon had Porwik moving from side to side  in the backcourt. But with her first match point, Gavaldon double-faulted for  the first time.  </P> <P> Was it nerves or a bad toss? Neither. It was Navratilova.  </P> <P> "On match point that's what I was thinking about," she said. "But I'm not  nervous about playing her. I have nothing to lose. I'm just glad I have an  opportunity to play her."  </P> <P> Gavaldon may still be a new kid on the block, but she is still more well known  than rookie Alysia May, the other wild-card player. They can make the veterans  nervous. Ask Manuela Maleeva.  </P> <P> May, a former UCLA All-American, turned pro two months ago in Singapore, and  gave fourth-seeded Maleeva a scare before losing Monday night, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3).  </P> <P> "I think she played very well," said Maleeva, "not knowing who she is and where  she's from. I don't know if she can play every day like this."  </P> <P> If, indeed, she can, May's emergence on the pro tour verifies Maleeva's view  that in today's tournaments, there is no such thing as an easy match.  </P> <P> "Everyone's so good now," she said. "I really think, against the player you  haven't heard of, you can't afford one mistake, you can't relax for one point."  </P> <P> May was down, 4-1, in the second set before winning her serve to take a 5-4  lead. But both players held serve -- Maleeva held twice -- to force the  tiebreaker.  </P> <P> "I was becoming impatient," May said. "But then I settled down and started to  play better."  </P> <P> In the opening match on center court, Terry Phelps of Larchmont, N.Y. dropped  the first set, but came back to upset seventh-seeded Gretchen Magers of San  Diego, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> Renata Baranski, the 150th-ranked player in the world, eliminated Catarina  Lindqvist, a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1989, 0-6, 6-4, 6-2. Martina Navratilova  will play Rancho Bernardo's Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer tonight at 6:30.  Top-seeded Steffi Graf, the No. 1 player in the world, will play wild-card  entrant Stephanie Rehe of Oceanside today at 11 a.m.  </P></p>

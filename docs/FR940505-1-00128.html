Federal Requirements for SI Marine Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The EPA is currently in the process of developing a Federal rulemaking to control emissions from SI marine engines. The proposed standards will be expected to result in a 70&hyph;80 percent reduction in HC emissions from two-stroke outboard engines which comprise over half of the engines in this category. On average there will be a 50&hyph;60 percent reduction in emissions from the fleet of SI marine engines. However, as a result of controlling HC emissions, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions are expected to increase by a factor of 2&hyph;4 (baseline NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for these engines, on average, is about 2  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> g/kWh). This Federal program will apply to FIP areas. EPA is under court ordered deadline for this regulation; the schedule is for the NPRM to be signed by the Administrator by September 30, 1994 and final rule signed by November 24, 1995. The general provisions that the Agency anticipates will be included in the proposal for regulation of SI marine engines are briefly described in the following section. Today, EPA is also proposing a system of emission based fees for use of SI marine pleasure craft in the FIP areas. If the Agency finds that the Federal program for controlling emissions from SI marine engines does not achieve the anticipated reduction, adjustments will be made to the stringency of the fees or the standards to compensate for any loss in benefit from the Federal program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Overview of Requirements for SI Marine Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will propose to regulate the emission of hydrocarbons from SI marine engines. Included under this regulation will be emission standards for SI marine propulsion engines which include the following engine types: outboard, sterndrive (inboard/outboard), inboard, and personal watercraft (e.g., Jet Ski).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A compliance program involving pre-sale certification and in-use enforcement is also expected to be proposed for marine engines. The proposed program will be similar to the current on-highway engine program. EPA expects to include the following provisions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Designation of product line into groups of engines with similar emission characteristics (such groups are called engine families);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Manufacturer emission testing of selected engines with the specified test procedure to demonstrate compliance with emission standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Labeling of engines from each engine family;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Submission of application for certification for each engine family by model year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 21 (CNS) -- The State Statistical  Bureau warned today that the current economy was still suffering  from climbing prices, difficulties facing state-owned  enterprises and overheated investment and it called for great  concern to be shown and remedies found for such problems.    The three main problems covering a wide scope needed urgent  solutions. First, soaring prices which were already high  continued to climb. Commodities seeing greater price rises are  mainly food items, especially poultry and their products,  aquatic products and vegetables and medical and health care  service.    The problem is attributed to a change in the operation  mechanism, and during this stage it has no effective control  over runaway market prices and a price hike resulting from  speculation and artificial manipulation. National retail prices  increased by 20 percent last January and February over the same  period in the previous year.    Second, some state-owned enterprises suffered from many  difficulties in their production and management with economic  results tending to go downwards. Such enterprises' output grew  by 1.1 percent in the first two months of this year while  profits actually dropped and the scale and amount of losses  expanded.    Third, investment again showed overheating with new  expansion  of state-owned fixed assets investment made in the first two  months of this year rising to 77.5 percent from the original  74.1 percent registered in the same period in the year before.  New items undertaken in localities grew in great number with  the proposed investment value increasing by 65 percent over the  same period in the previous year while some other areas saw such  growth double.</p>

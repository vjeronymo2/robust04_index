			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Grid plan faces further delay The biggest upgrading of Britain's electricity grid network since the 1950s faces further delay with the decision to hold two more public inquiries into sections of the proposed route. The Department of Trade and Industry has announced that inquiries will start in March into two route diversions proposed by the National Grid Company after previous options were rejected by the DTI in May. The company says its proposed Pounds 200m upgrading of transmission lines through 50 miles of Cleveland and North Yorkshire is necessary to permit transmission of more, cheaply generated, electricity from gas, hydro and nuclear stations. Objectors to the proposals, first submitted in 1991 and already the subject of a six-month 1992 public inquiry, say that the upgrading is unnecessary and will despoil the countryside. This week at North Yorkshire wayleave hearings at which the Grid is fighting landowners who have refused consent for installation of new pylons and lines, the company said that in 1993-94 the electricity market had to pay Pounds 67m in compensation to northern generators because of transmission constraints. Yesterday it confirmed that Nuclear Electric's Hartlepool station and the new gas-fired Pounds 850m Teesside Power station were among the recipients. The company said that the compensation charge arose because competitively priced electricity offered by the generators could not be fully handled by the present transmission system. Similar compensation costs seem likely in the current year. In May the government gave approval in principle for 80 per cent of the route but the company still faces opposition from landowners refusing wayleave.</p>

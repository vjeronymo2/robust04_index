			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS GETS ON ALL FOURS IN DEFENSE OF SLAIN DOG  </P> <P> An animal behavior specialist draped in a white sheet and wearing a straw hat  crouched on all fours in San Fernando Superior Court last week to demonstrate  that a dog named Cuddles was neither mean nor aggressive.  </P> <P> Cuddles, a brown-and-white springer spaniel, is the sister of Freckles, a dog  that was shot and killed while the two animals were scampering on Earnest Lynn  Reubens' ranch.  </P> <P> Reubens, 59, a 15-year resident of Canyon Country, is on trial in San Fernando  Superior Court, charged with one count of cruelty to animals and one count of  using a firearm with gross negligence.  </P> <P> Reubens pleaded not guilty, but according to prosecutors he admitted to Los  Angeles police that he killed the dog because it was running on his land.  </P> <P> Freckles belonged to 4-year-old Erica Owen, who received the puppy as a  Christmas gift two years ago. Her 8-year-old sister's Christmas present that  year was Cuddles, Freckles' littermate.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosalie Morton summoned Cuddles to rebut suggestions by  defense attorney Richard P. Guluzza that Freckles was a big, aggressive animal  that might have attacked Reubens' sheep. Owen family members said Freckles and  Cuddles were almost indistinguishable in appearance and temperament.  </P> <P> "I brought her to court so the jury could see the sweet, darling dogs that they  were. They were not killers, or pit bulls; they were pets," Morton said.  </P> <P> Although Guluzza maintained that the canine victim's sister is irrelevant to  the case, Judge Ronald S. Coen allowed Cuddles to appear, noting that the  defense attorney had asked earlier about Freckles' size.  </P> <P> Cuddles was brought to the front of the courtroom on a leash, and Morton asked  Deena Case, a court-appointed animal behavior specialist, to demonstrate a  segment of the "27-part Danish temperament test."  </P> <P> As bewildered jurors looked on, Case draped a sheet over her body, put a straw  hat on her head, crouched and began moving toward Cuddles, darting to the right  and left.  </P> <P> The dog cowered behind its owner.  </P> <P> Case said the test demonstrated that Cuddles was "mildly fearful" when  confronted with something she had never seen before and was not aggressive.  </P> <P> Earlier in the trial, the Owens' housekeeper, Delia Villeda, admitted that she  generally let the two dogs run on Reubens' land for nearly half an hour a day  when she took walks with Erica's baby brother.  </P></p>

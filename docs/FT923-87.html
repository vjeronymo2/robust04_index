			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Winding up petitions add new twist to Blystad bid A DISAGREEMENT between directors of the Blystad Group over the conditions of a Pounds 7.5m paper bid has taken a new twist with the issue of winding up petitions against two companies connected with three of the directors, all members of the Norwegian Blystad family. The petitions are part of a campaign by directors outside the family to recover a Dollars 3.9m (Pounds 2.3m) loan to Sokana Industries, which is controlled by the family. Sokana and the South Pacific Banking Corporation are the subject of the petitions. Three Blystad brothers holding 65 per cent of the loss-making Blystad, which owns KCA Drilling, the UK independent offshore oil service company, have accepted the 5.4p-a-share bid from Abbot Holdings, a private company set up by Mr Alasdair Locke. The non-family board members, including the managing director and finance director, and Henry Ansbacher, financial advisers, oppose the offer because of a potential conflict of interest over the loan from Blystad to Sokana Industries. Abbot's approach to the loan, set out in the press release announcing the bid, is not to take any 'precipitate' enforcement action, although it does not rule out the loan being recovered at a later date.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Britannia in loss after exceptionals EXCEPTIONAL costs have again hit Britannia Group, the Cheltenham-based construction concern. But this time they led to a loss and the omission of the final dividend. For 1991 the profit slumped from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 410,000. The provision for the diminution in land stocks was cut to Pounds 775,000 (Pounds 1.2m) and there were reorganisation costs of Pounds 325,000 (nil); that led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 690,000 (profit Pounds 631,000). Losses per share came to 5p (earnings 3.5p). When announcing a cut in the interim dividend to 1p (1.9p) directors said they intended to pay a final (1.1p) - but they now considered that inappropriate. Total turnover fell to Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 36.9m). Rental income arising on development and investment properties was affected by the insolvency of two tenants. The development company was disposing of its land stocks with the exception of the site at Quedgeley, Gloucester, and its holdings at Rugby.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina today hoped that Mexico will find an adequate solution  to the violent developments in recent months, and he indicted  that Mexico's relations with his country "are above any program."    Talking to the local and foreign press covering "The Nation  and the Emigrants Conference" that concluded here yesterday, the  foreign minister insisted "there are things that fall solely  within the purview of Mexicans to assess, and I respect the way  they have been handled."    He added that many things have happened after Chiapas that  have shaken Mexican society, as well as Cuban society, referring  to the murder last March of the ruling party's presidential  candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and the political uncertainty in  some sectors of that nation.    In Robaina's opinion, what pains Cuba the most is that there  is no solution yet. However, he hopes the best possible path  will be found. Robaina added that he respects what is happening  in that neighboring country too much to give an opinion from the  outside.    When asked if the results of the August election will give  continuity to bilateral trade, he replied that existing  relations are "sufficiently stable, not to be altered or  diminished by any electoral process."    "I am highly confident, because relations with Mexico are  above any program and are based on a cultural, historical, and  geographical identity," and therefore -- he stressed -- they  prevail even above the interests of the United States and NAFTA.    In another respect, the foreign minister noted that the  recent landing in Mexico's southeastern coast of Cuban rafters  has not prompted any contact or proposal outside normal channels  for these cases between the governments of the two countries.    "We have maintained normal and fluid communications, and  there is no pressure from any side," he stressed.    Robaina also commented on the reception President Fidel  Castro hosted yesterday afternoon in honor of the delegates to  "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference," which he described as  a discussion with a great deal of respect, understanding, and  emotion, something more important than a question and answer  discussion.    He also warned that the policy the Foreign Ministry has  followed regarding the community of Cubans living abroad will be  continued without necessarily hosting new meetings as the one  recently concluded.    "I am certain we started on a path from which we cannot turn  back, but it does not only depend on successive conferences," he  stated, going on to explain that none of the measures adopted  intend to promote a change in U.S. policy toward Cuba.    "Whether or not it has an influence, that is not the  purpose.  The purpose was much deeper and is related to restoring a  relation, restoring those ties, and not allowing this community  to continue to be manipulated against the country," he noted.    He also indicated the government has been extremely cautious  in deciding to work in favor of normalizing relations with  emigrants, although this -- he added -- was not a process  brought about by the work of those who wanted to organize it,  but rather the product of a process of informing the people to  enable them to understand it.    He explained that if the result of the meeting contributes  in  some measure to stop the manipulation of the Cuban community  abroad -- not just in the United States -- then it was in fact a  success, although Washington's reaction depends fundamentally on  the repercussion it has and on what is happening today in Miami  and elsewhere, he stated.    The foreign minister affirmed that the measures agreed on  during the meeting will be implemented in the future, and he  reiterated his country's willingness to negotiate "anything"  with the U.S. Government, on the basis of equality, absolute  understanding, and respect.</p>

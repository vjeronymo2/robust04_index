			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / US group to join UDM in British Coal bid JIM WALTER Resources, a US coalmining company, is to join a consortium of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and East Midlands Electricity to bid for British Coal in next year's privatisation. JWR, based in Alabama, is a subsidiary of Walter Industries, a building materials company which has taken refuge in Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, after the launch of a Dollars 3bn asbestos lawsuit against it. The company argues that the suit is without merit, and expects to win the case when it reaches the Florida State courts in December. Walter Industries was the subject of a Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.55bn) Wall Street buy-out in 1988. However, the asbestos lawsuit in 1989 prevented the company from making the asset sales necessary to service the large debt from the deal. The company then went into Chapter 11, which protects it from its creditors while it reorganises its affairs. Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the UDM, said yesterday: 'We've been aware of this case from day one, and we don't think it's been any embarrassment to us whatsoever.' The three-party consortium, which is being advised by Kleinwort Benson, investment bankers, aims to put together an employee-led buy-out of British Coal. It will study the details of the offer for sale before deciding how many of the five parcels into which British Coal is to be divided it wants to bid for. But Mr Greatrex, whose union is based in Nottinghamshire, said the parcel containing the Midlands pits would obviously be of greatest interest. Finance for the bid would be provided by British Coal employees, who would put up a maximum Pounds 2,000 each; JWR; and East Midlands Electricity. Mr Greatrex said he had chosen JWR because they were the only potential partner of the 40 companies contacted who talked about the long-term future of British Coal. 'We are not looking for people wanting to make a massive profit and get out.' JWR's president, Mr Bill Carr, was born in Durham and spent his early life working for British Coal. He said UK mines were similar in geology, depth and gas to those worked by his company in Alabama - yet JWR's productivity was twice that of British Coal. He believed that JWR could bring greatly improved methods to its pits. He praised 'the good work ethic' of the UDM.

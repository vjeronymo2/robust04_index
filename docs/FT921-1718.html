			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Monday Interview: Enemy of restrictive practices - Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, talks to Geoffrey Owen Given the choice, I prefer to take a complaint to Brussels, where the response is swift and vigorous, than to the Office of Fair Trading.' This comment from a London-based competition lawyer highlights an anomaly. The present Conservative government in Britain, which believes in competition, has been curiously passive in dealing with what is probably the most widespread anti-competitive practice - price-fixing. No action has been taken on the 1989 white paper which proposed stronger powers for the director-general of fair trading. Last week's Tory manifesto promises new legislation on the subject; it cannot come soon enough for the competition authorities. 'We have been much frustrated by the inadequacy of our investigatory powers,' says Sir Gordon Borrie, who hands over as director-general to Sir Bryan Carsberg in June. 'I also believe the deterrent powers are inadequate because the sanctions are both remote and modest when they apply.' A Court of Appeal judgment last year made matters even worse. It ruled that a company was not responsible for the price-fixing activities of a senior employee when it had issued a prohibition to its staff and had adequate monitoring arrangements in place. Sir Gordon is urging victims of cartels, when they are uncovered, to sue for the losses they have suffered. 'Some well-publicised successes would be a useful deterrent,' he says. But his influence is limited. Restrictive practices are not the only area where he would like to see competition policy tightened. On mergers, he points out, the present system is benign. 'The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has to have very strong evidence that a merger will operate in an anti-competitive way before coming to an adverse finding.' Sir Gordon suggests a small but important shift in the burden of proof, so that the commission would block potentially anti-competitive mergers unless the parties could demonstrate that there were offsetting gains, such as greater efficiency or lower costs. Those who think the commission is too soft on mergers will applaud Sir Gordon's plan. At present clearance is normally given to border-line cases - and even some which seem not so border-line, like the merger in the roadside catering business between Happy Eater and Little Chef, cleared in 1987 as part of a deal between Trusthouse Forte and Hanson. (Sir Gordon found this verdict 'a little surprising'.) The opposite criticism is that merger policy creates costly uncertainty for businessmen while doing very little to promote competition. Sir Gordon strongly disagrees. If merger control did not exist, 'you could only deal with monopolistic situations after they had been created'. He points to gas and telecommunications. Because they were privatised as monopolies, they have to be controlled by price regulation, which is a 'poor substitute' for competition. The Kingfisher/Dixons merger proposal, referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and turned down in 1990, illustrates his point. If there had been no merger control and the deal had gone through, 'you would have got a substantial monopoly situation in DIY retailing, especially in out-of-town centres; where would be the protection for customers from monopolistic pricing?' As for complaints about unpredictability, Sir Gordon thinks the commission has made good progress towards greater consistency; it seeks to explain its decisions by reference to principles established in earlier reports. He agrees that there could be room for more specific use of precedents and this has begun to happen. But 'certainty can be bought at too high a price'. Rigid rules about, for example, maximum permissible market shares could lead to perverse judgments. At the reference stage, too, he thinks the secretary of state needs to have some discretion to respond to developments - like the Kuwait Investment Office's shareholding in British Petroleum - for which there are no precedents. Why not limit the discretion to cases where public interest considerations other than competition are at stake? Sir Gordon agrees it would be logical, in mergers where competition is the only issue, to leave the reference decision to the director-general. (He already has jurisdiction over monopoly references, where whole industries are referred to the MMC.) In making his recommendation on merger references, the director-general takes advice from officials in the relevant government departments. For the DTI then to second-guess him seems pointless. 'Several secretaries of state have suggested that they don't really want that role.' Sir Gordon's most serious worries about political interference in merger control centre not on the British system, but on the European Community - which is why he has suggested the creation of an independent European body like the MMC. His concern is that, 'under the present sysdifficult to keep political considerations out of cases that ought to be determined on competition grounds'. He was relieved that the commission came to what he regarded as the right decision in the recent commuter aircraft case. He places much reliance on the fact that the commissioner in charge of the policy, 'whose word normally goes', is Sir Leon Brittan, a strong advocate of competition. The UK's competition rules, of course, are far from perfect. The ideal sequence of reform, in his view, would be a radical improvement in the laws relating to restrictive practices along the lines of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome, with a further addition to alter last year's Court of Appeal ruling. Then, he suggests, 'although this has not been clearly worked out by myself or anyone else, we would need to look at the law relating to monopolies and competition, and perhaps see whether Article 86 would be a suitable model'. He would like to retain the power to initiate inquiries by the MMC into whole industries, which is not available under EC legislation. Meanwhile the uncertainties of the present law will continue, including the possibility that a new government might use the wide-ranging Section 84 of the Fair Trading Act to refer mergers that have nothing to do with competition - 'mergers that might be inimical to regional growth in Scotland or something of that sort'. That, says Sir Gordon, is for the politicians to decide. As for the machinery of competition policy, he is not impressed with the argument, endorsed recently by the Commons Trade and Industry Committee, for combining the MMC and the competition side of the OFT in one organisation. He accepts that the case for such a combination is somewhat stronger on mergers alone; the Cartel Office in Germany handles both the preliminary inquiries into mergers and the full investigations, and there would be advantages in the pooling of knowledge. But transferring the whole of the OFT's competition work is quite another matter. For one thing, the organisation of the MMC, with its reliance on part-time members, is quite inappropriate for the large administrative and negotiating load which falls to the OFT. Apart from the gains from combining competition and consumer protection under one roof, he thinks it is useful to have someone at the head of the OFT who can play a more partisan role in promoting competition than would be suitable for the head of the Restrictive Practices Court or the Monopolies Commission. As for relations with the new regulatory agencies, 'in retrospect one could have drawn the lines in somewhat different places'. In one privatised industry, buses, he has sometimes wished that there had been an 'Ofbus', to relieve the OFT of the burden of post-privatisation regulatory activity. He thinks, but perhaps not before the end of the century, price competition in gas and telecommunications may have reached the point where the need for specialised regulation could disappear. At the same time there could be a case for bringing together whatever regulatory agencies were still needed on a long-term basis. But all this is a long way off. 'I am not keen on institutional changes, especially if politicians see them as a substitute for something more important,' he says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1931 Born in Croydon.

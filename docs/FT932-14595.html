			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No right to allowance I AM A basic-rate taxpayer aged over 65. My total income for tax purposes is about Pounds 20,000 and I do not receive an age-related personal or married couple's allowance. My wife is a 20 per cent band taxpayer aged over 65 with a total income of about Pounds 4,500. She does get a personal age allowance. 1. Am I right in thinking that I still cannot have an age-related personal or married couple's allowance? 2. If I am right, and if I were to transfer my Pounds 1,720 married couple's allowance to my wife, would this then become a Pounds 2,465 married couple's age allowance for her in 1994/95? (being too late to apply for 93/94). 3. On a different subject, am I right in thinking that the new advance corporation tax rates in 1993/94 and in 1994/95 onwards apply to income from equity-based unit trusts as well as to share dividends (but not to interest from banks or building societies)? 1. Yes. 2. No. 3. Yes. Ask your tax office for a copy of the free pamphlet IR121 (1992) (Income tax and pensioners). Pamphlets IR80(1192) (Income tax and married couples) and IR90(1989) (Independent taxation - a guide to tax allowances and reliefs) may also interest you.

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Airlines aim at accounting benchmark WORLD AIRLINES will agree this week to set up a task force to develop international accounting guidelines to improve and harmonise financial reporting in the airline industry. The move follows a joint survey by the International Air Transport Association, the Geneva-based organisation grouping more than 200 airlines, and KPMG, the world's biggest accountancy firm. It revealed wide disparities in the accounting policies and financial disclosures of airlines. The Iata task force will be announced in Paris tomorrow. It will examine the possibility of establishing a benchmark of international accounting standards to make it easier to compare and measure the financial performance of different airlines. KPMG says this approach will avoid cutting across national accounting policies that are enforced in various countries. Mr Frank Harding, head of KPMG's transport industry group, said the survey, which considered the accounting practices of 25 of the world's leading airlines, highlighted the need for a harmonised approach. 'As the airline industry becomes increasingly global with more strategic alliances and more moves towards privatisation, it is imperative to improve financial reporting,' he said. One obstacle to an airline contemplating cross-border capital or investment transactions is the wide divergence in accounting policies and disclosure requirements in various countries, the report argues. Airlines are currently scrambling to forge partnerships and acquire equity stakes in other carriers to strengthen their competitive position in a global market. Among the growing number of airline partnership deals, British Airways acquired last week a 49.9 per cent stake in the French regional airline TAT for Pounds 17.25m. It has also agreed to invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 438.5m) for a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. The substance of airline financial statements often varies significantly from country to country and even between airlines operating within the same country, the report notes. There is, however, a general trend towards international harmonisation of accounting standards and several professional and regulatory bodies have included the issue on their current agendas. The financial community is also placing greater emphasis on airline financial statements in lending policies as a result of the financial problems sweeping airlines caused by the sharp recession in the industry. 'Improvements in financial reporting will assist airlines in persuading financiers and investors to provide debt and equity finance at a time when this is becoming increasingly difficult,' says Mr Harding of KPMG. The survey found widely differing approaches in such important areas as the way airline fleets are financed and accounted for; how aircraft are depreciated and to what residual value; accounting for foreign exchange gains and losses; and levels of disclosure in income statements for depreciation and finance costs.

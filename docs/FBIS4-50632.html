			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shi Jia (2514 0163): "Weekly Comments on </F> Current Events"]    [Text] New Proposal To Resolve B-H Crisis    After several hours of discussion on 13 May, foreign  ministers of seven countries comprising the United States,  Russia, and members of the European Union including France,  Britain, Germany, Belgium, and Greece, eventually reached a  unanimous agreement on putting forward a new proposal for  resolving the crisis in B-H [Bosnia-Herzegovina].    Judging from the contents, except for calling on the three  conflicting factions to resume talks within two weeks and work  hard to reach a cease-fire agreement for a period of four  months, which are new, the present proposal basically reiterated  the position on the issues of delimiting the boundaries in B-H,  lifting sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  and so on, as contained in the original peace plan proposed by  the European Union. However, the fact that the U.S. position  has obviously moved closer to the European Union's plan is the  largest progress that has been made.    As everybody knows, involvement of the big powers was a  factor of the outbreak of conflict in B-H and the fact that  peace efforts for the area have been repeatedly frustrated lies  primarily in the diverse policies adopted by the big powers  because of their different interest considerations. Now, the  big powers have put forward a common plan after all. Even  though it is still very difficult to put it into practice,  people hope that it will be a good beginning for the political  solution of the conflicts in B-H.  <H5>  Sensible Voices </H5>   In his speech in the U.S. Senate on 16 May, Senate Minority  Leader, Republican Senator Dole said: "The President should  immediately announce that he will unconditionally extend the  most favored nation [MFN] status to China." He also stressed  that the President "should frankly say what we, the great  majority of people, have known for a long time: The practice of  linking trade with human rights will not work. This policy has  gone bust." Meanwhile, 106 congressmen signed a joint letter to  Clinton on 17 May, urging him to extend the MFN status to China.    As 3 June draws near, the day on which U.S. President  Clinton  will make his decision on this issue, the intelligent voices  from men of insight in the government and the public have become  louder and louder. Strictly speaking, a nation's conditions and  policies on human rights are its own internal affairs, while MFN  treatment is a kind of specific term to facilitate trade  exchanges between two sovereign states. In fact, there is no  connection between these two things.    As disclosed by a U.S. newspaper, the findings of a survey  conducted by the U.S. administration show that if the MFN status  to China is revoked, it could cause losses of between $10 and  $13 billion to China and the United States. It is no wonder  that U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen repeatedly said that the  MFN issue is of paramount importance to both China and the  United States and that it must be handled prudently.  <H5>  Where Does the Difficulty in the Syria-Israel Talks Lie? </H5>   U.S. State Secretary Christopher was again on his shuttle  tour of the Middle East from 15 to 18 May, the second time this  month. After the talks on autonomy between the PLO and Israel  had succeeded and a final agreement on implementing the autonomy  was signed, the U.S. side wished very much to strike while the  iron was hot and push the Middle East peace process further  forward. But, the answer as to whether or not a new  breakthrough can be made in the Arab-Israeli talks rests with  Syria. Therefore, Christopher went to Syria a second time.  Judging from the situation revealed by the various sides,  however, though the talks have touched on substantive issues, it  is not an easy job to actually resolve the problem.    In fact, compared with the Palestinian issue, the  contradiction between Syria and Israel is much less complex and  difficult. The crucial point lies in the fact that the hostile  mentality caused by the confrontation between the two sides for  many years is so intense that they cannot trust each other.  Without mutual trust, it will be very difficult to achieve any  results in the talks and to realize the goal of peaceful  coexistence between the two sides.</p>

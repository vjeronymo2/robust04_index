			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Difficult to lock in low inflation The last time UK inflation was low - in the mid-1980s - there was discussion of how to 'lock in' that low rate, which obviously owed something to temporary factors. The obvious suggestion then was to tie sterling to the low-inflation D-Mark via the European exchange rate mechanism. The indications, which I discussed in this column last week, of a possible change in the long-range world economic climate from inflation to deflation increase the need for the UK to try to lock itself in on this occasion. It was none other than Harold MacMillan who warned of the follies of being 'an island of inflation in a sea of deflation'. What are the prospects? Both headline and underlying rates of UK inflation fell last autumn and winter much further than generally realised. The annual increase in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage payments, was 3.4 per cent in February - up 0.2 of a percentage point compared with the January figure, but still lower than in any year since the 1960s. Non-food producer prices rose only 2.7 per cent in the year to February. The best anti-inflationary news is on the labour front. The annual rise in earnings per head is now down to 4 3/4 per cent, compared with a minimum of 7 1/2 per cent in the 1980s. Meanwhile manufacturing productivity has been increasing at 5 1/2 to 6 per cent a year - remarkably rapidly for the late stages of a recession or the early stages of a recovery. Right-wing Tories, who are the government's real opposition, only show their own innumeracy when they say the gains of the Thatcher years have been either thrown away or proved a snare and a delusion. In any case the combination of wage moderation and productivity rise has led to a slight fall in manufacturing unit wage costs. It is this measure which has some claim to be the best one of the domestically generated core rate of inflation. The present phase, however, owes a lot to exceptional circumstances: namely the pressure on British costs imposed by two years in the ERM at a 'challenging' exchange rate, combined with a severe domestic recession. Since last autumn's 15 per cent effective devaluation of sterling, prices connected with imports have been rising. Materials and fuels purchased by manufacturing industry have risen by 7 per cent in a mere six months on a seasonally adjusted basis. The devaluation occurred at the best possible time in the cycle, when market forces were restraining the extent of pass-through. But there is no way a depreciation of this size can fail to affect recorded inflation. Thus inflation indices have climbed back a little above their recent low point; and the Treasury expects RPI inflation, excluding mortgage interest rates, to bounce back to 3 3/4 per cent by the end of the year, while the chancellor's independent experts expect 4 per cent. The government naturally hopes the bounce-back will be temporary and the devaluation effects 'once for all', passing away like clouds over a summer landscape. This would allow inflation to settle down towards the bottom end of the chancellor's 1 to 4 per cent target range. What do the financial markets expect? Fortunately the existence of index-linked gilt-edged securities gives some insight into the inflationary expectations. Take a 10-year gilt-edged security with a gross redemption yield of about 7.8 per cent a year. Then subtract from it the yield on an indexed gilt of comparable maturity of 3.4 per cent. The difference is an approximation to the expected average annual inflation rate over the next year which comes out at about 4.4 per cent. This dodges the influence of tax. But, as Maurice Scott argues in the February National Institute Review, it is likely that tax-exempt pension funds and charities dominate the index-linked market. The details of how we reached the current position are interesting. During previous periods of comparatively low inflationary expectations, normal gilt-edged yields have come down. This pattern has been paralleled on the present occasion by an only slightly smaller fall in the yield on indexed gilts themselves. Indexed-linked securities are a rarity outside the UK. But the fall in yields on ordinary nominal British government securities has been echoed in so many other countries in such different circumstances, that it is difficult to believe that the driving force is only inflationary expectations. There has probably been a drop in real interest rates in the main industrial countries of about a percentage point to, say, 3 1/2 per cent. You can ascribe this to the prolongation of the world recession. Or you can say that the expected 'world shortage of capital' has failed to materialise, as the needs for investment of the former communist countries and others have not been accompanied by an effective demand for funds on terms attractive to western investors. The UK departure from the ERM did worsen expectations of future UK short-term nominal interest rates. The chart of expected one-year interest rates, derived by the Bank of England from the structure of gilt-edged yields, rose in one week last September by more than one percentage point. Since then, expected rates for a couple of years ahead have fallen drastically in line with actual experience. But several years out they have not recovered from Black Wednesday. The other small chart shows that for a couple of years ahead there is little difference between expected one-year interest rates in the UK and Germany. But as one looks further ahead, expected UK interest rates climb back to nearly 10 per cent, some 2 percentage points higher than anything expected in Germany. Financial markets are not predicting inflationary catastrophes. But they know that governments are tempted to expand the economy too far as an election approaches and thus sacrifice hard won inflationary gains. The textbook remedy is that a government should tie its own hands, 'pre-commit itself', or something of that kind. There are only a limited number of ways in which this can be done. One example would have been a fixed-rate regime such as the ERM, which the government could not abandon without losing a lot of political face. Another would be to distance itself by means of an independent Bank of England. Unfortunately credibility has been so badly damaged by the manner of Britain's exit from the ERM that simply to rejoin it at some future time would not be sufficient to rebuild credibility. The Bank of England has made too much of Chancellor Norman Lamont's published statement to the new governor, Eddie George, on his appointment that 'his central responsibility should be to support the government in our determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation, the only sound basis on which sustainable growth and secure jobs can be built'. This statement still leaves the government with the last word. Indeed to rebuild credibility now requires belt, braces and suspenders. This means a genuinely independent Bank of England and the return to a European monetary arrangement as soon as conditions permit. Both would be achieved together if the British government would co-operate with the new French government in an attempt to make a real go of European monetary union. I know the political obstacles and John Major and the Conservative whips could name them all one by one.  ------------------------------------------- INFLATION IN THE G7  ------------------------------------------- Average consumer price inflation 1957-92 % pa  ------------------------------------------- Germany                        3.4 US                             4.7 Japan                          4.9 Canada                         5.0 France                         6.8 UK                             7.2 Italy                          8.5  ------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of England  -------------------------------------------</p>

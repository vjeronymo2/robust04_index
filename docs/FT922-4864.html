			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK backs wider Nato peace role BRITAIN yesterday came out firmly in support of a Nato peace-keeping role outside the area traditionally covered by the Atlantic alliance. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, speaking in London before a Nato ministerial meeting in Oslo later this week, said that Nato must make its resources available 'when the international community has decided that action needs to be taken'. Though he stressed that Nato should not itself become a 'pan-European policeman', it should be prepared to act under the authority of the United Nations or the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The advantage of this was that it would include the US, without expecting it to act alone. 'It would be frivolous and dangerous to start separating the US and Canada from the security of Europe.' Mr Hurd stressed that Britain was not opposed to the recently-created Franco-German corps, as long as it was used under a Nato or Western European Union defence organisation hat.</p>

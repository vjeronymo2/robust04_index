Chinese buyers are mainly interested in Vietnam's foodstuff  for preparing specialities such as trionychil turtles, frogs,  tortoises, eels, snakes, dogs, cats, chicken, illicium, green  bananas and cashew nuts, and raw materials such as rubber,  natural silk yarn. Meanwhile there is a wide range of consumer  goods flowing from China to Vietnam. They include mechanical  goods, processed foodstuffs, fresh fruits, motors, electric  fans, hot water vacuum bottles, beer, mineral water,  confectionery, medicinal herbs, garments, cosmetics, bicycles  and so on.    Goods were exchanged through official border gates as well  as  footpaths.    Taking the lead in the cross-border goods exchange among the  six northern border provinces is Lang Son.    A market managing official in Lang Son revealed that  Vietnamese and Chinese traders and transporters are seen  everywhere along the 253 km of the provincial border line. The  two-way flow of goods across the border is uncontrollable. In  1993 the province could collect import-exported taxes on only  one-third of the volume of goods exchanged, namely VND  [Vietnamese dong] 170 billion (roughly USD 17 million).    At the small border gate of Tan Thanh, the quantity of  exchanged goods every day is worth half a VND billion nearly USD  50,000, and there are about a hundred of such border gates in  Lang Son Province.    Opposite to Vietnam's border gates, it has been reported  that  there are big markets and export-import centres springing up on  Chinese border areas specially in service of the cross-border  trade.</p>

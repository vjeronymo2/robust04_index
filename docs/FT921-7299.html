			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: John Michael Clegg Mr John Michael Clegg, pictured bottom left, was on the fast track in London during the 1980s. Qualifying as a solicitor at Nabarro Nathanson, a prestigious City firm, he moved briefly to Minster Trust before buying into Wace in 1983 at the age of 24. The money came, he said repeatedly, from an inheritance of Ms Jayne Wright, his cousin, who had emigrated to South Africa. Recent investigations revealed, however, that she is in fact his half-sister, born out of wedlock to his father Mr John Henry Clegg. She is pictured bottom right outside her Durban home this week. Mr John Henry Clegg, pictured top left during his heyday in Sheffield in the early 1960s, was a notorious local figure. Like his twin brother Albert he was convicted on numerous charges. Bankruptcy proceedings were brought against both brothers by the Inland Revenue in the early 1980s. Several Sheffield relatives say they have seen little of either man since. Albert remains an undischarged bankrupt. For some years both men have had investments in South Africa. In recent days, Ms Wright has refused to answer questions put to her by reporters visiting her Durban home. Speaking briefly on her behalf have been her husband Mr Keith Riley and a man who gave his name as Frederick Turner. One day this week, Mr Turner arrived at the Riley home in a pick-up truck belonging to Ace Panel Beaters. Mr Antonio Bernardi, at the company, said he did not know of a Mr Turner but he did know Mr John Henry Clegg. He was his wife's uncle and lived at 42 Connemara, in Durban. The name Clegg is on the letter box but Mr Turner, who speaks with a northern England accent, answered the door (picture top right). He said he was not John Henry Clegg.</p>

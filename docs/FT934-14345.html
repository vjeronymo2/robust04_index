			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Berliners unimpressed by Kohl plan for 2001, the office space odyssey: Developers do not yet believe chancellor's pledge to move the government east CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's announcement last week that the federal government will complete the move from Bonn to Berlin this century should have been a cause for celebration among the capital's property developers. But enthusiasm is hard to detect among the city's property developers. They do not take the chancellor's words seriously. 'I am very sceptical, to say the least,' says Mr Mark Palmer, who, in partnership with Mr Roland Lauder, the US cosmetics heir, is investing DM1bn (Pounds 406m) in building the American Business Centre, an office complex on the site of the former Checkpoint Charlie border crossing which once divided the city. Construction is due to start in January. 'The government announced in 1991 that it would move the government. Who's to say it will not change its mind again? I am looking for some tangible evidence that this time the government will stick to its words,' says Mr Palmer, a former US ambassador to Hungary and now a property developer. There is some evidence of movement. A dozen senior staff from the federal Defence Ministry are already ensconced near the Landwekhkanal, near the centre of Berlin and conveniently close to the Berlin Philharmonic. More significantly, President Richard von Weizsacker, will move permanently to Berlin on January 1. And the President's New Year's Ball will be held in Berlin, much to the chagrin of the civil servants on the Rhine. But before any move can take place, the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, has to pass the 'Berlin-Bonn Gesetz' - the legal approval. This might take place over the next few weeks. Mr Frank Moller, who runs the marketing arm of the American Business Centre, believes early passage of the law is crucial. 'We got some clarity last week. But now we need the law legitimating the timetable,' he says from his office overlooking the site which awaits the bulldozers and the cranes. If the government does stick to the timetable, property developers believe it will speed up the city's building programme. Jones Lang Wootton, the UK property consultants which opened offices in Berlin and Leipzig three years ago, reckons a whole range of financial services, from banking to insurance companies will accompany the move and they will need offices. The new capital will inherit many of the old ministry buildings from the former communist regime, but offices and accommodation will be for ancillary and support staff moving to the new capital. But Mr Sascha Hettrich, Jones Lang Wootton's Berlin manager, argues that investors must not wait for the government. 'It makes no sense to wait for something that is supposed to happen in the future,' he says, betraying his own sense of scepticism about the government's commitment. Jones Lang Wootton, and many other property consultants, rushed to Berlin in the wake of German unification and snapped up prime locations in anticipation of an early move. The expectations fuelled property prices, which Mr Hettrich says increased from 'zero to 100' between 1990 and 1992, its peak. Renting a square metre of office space, without any services, cost about DM90 by last year. The market has since fallen to about DM60. 'The prices are now stable and they might well remain so for some time yet,' adds Mr Hettrich. Despite the hesitation in Bonn - or what Mr Palmer calls 'inertia by the bureaucrats' - private investment of over DM11bn has been poured into Friedrichstrasse. The street is a short walk from the future finance and economics ministries. Mr Hettrich estimates that over the next dozen years, demand will match supply, regardless of the move, if the recession ends soon. 'Between 7m and 8m square metres of office space will be available over this period.' In the meantime, property developers fear that Mr Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, will try to postpone the move on the grounds of cost, which swings between DM20bn and DM30bn. 'I don't understand the costs. Most of the ministries are ready to move into,' says Mr Palmer. Berliners cannot understand what all the fuss is about. 'I suppose the Rhinelanders want to stay in a provincial town,' said Mr Heiner Konitz, a computer programmer. 'But if the government does not come here, Berlin could remain a provincial city in the heart of Europe. Who wins?'</p>

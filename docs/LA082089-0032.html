			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO ENJOY FALL FOLIAGE AND MISS THE CROWDS  </P> <P> There are almost as many ways to see New England's fall foliage as there are  leaves on its trees.  </P> <P> For starters, leaf peeping is much more enjoyable if you avoid the crowds. And  the best way to do that is not to travel on weekends and other peak times, and  to stay off the most popular foliage routes. Or, at least, not to travel  exclusively on them.  </P> <P> But, you ask, won't that mean a foliage experience that, while perhaps less  stressful, is also less scenic? Not at all.  </P> <P> Foliage is usually at or near its best over a wide and scenic area of western  Massachusetts, and southern New Hampshire and Vermont during the Columbus Day  weekend (Oct. 7-9). This is the time when roads in foliage country are jammed,  and country inns usually booked.  </P> <P> But the foliage also happens to be good in this area well before that weekend,  and continues for some time afterward.  </P> <P> In southern New England -- Rhode Island and Connecticut -- leaves may just be  starting to turn on Columbus Day, while in the northernmost part of the region,  colors will already have faded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tiny Towns  </P> <P> New England's largest foliage festival takes place in North Adams, Mass. This  year it's set for Sept. 30 to Oct. 1. The first foliage festival will be in the  tiny neighboring Vermont towns of Victory and Granby, Sept. 23-24.  </P> <P> The two towns have only 150 people between them, but their gorgeous scenery and  down-home doings usually attract about 10,000 visitors.  </P> <P> During the following weekend, some of the prettiest villages in Vermont's rural  and unspoiled northeastern corner -- Peacham, Barnet and Cabot -- participate  in the Northeast Kingdom Foliage Festival.  </P> <P> New England's most popular foliage routes are the Mohawk Trail, the western  stretch of Massachusetts 2 from Greenfield to the New York line, and Vermont  100 and 9 in the southern part of the state. These are scenic highways that are  very crowded in season, while roads paralleling or crossing them are just as  pretty but far less busy.  </P> <P> Massachusetts 2A, for example, is a winding alternate to 2 that, in its middle  stretches, passes through some beautiful, quintessentially Yankee central  Massachusetts towns.  </P> <P> One of my favorite high-season foliage drives is through the gorge of the  Deerfield River, along a local road that runs from the little town of Zoar,  Mass., to Readsboro, Vt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Road Less Crowded  </P> <P> Steep hills, festooned with colors like medieval banners, hang over this road,  which follows the west bank of the river and connects the Mohawk Trail with  Vermont 100. It is at least as scenic as the two major roads, but rarely  crowded.  </P> <P> The Connecticut River forms the boundary between Vermont and New Hampshire, and  its valley is dotted with handsome villages and New England's greatest  concentration of superb Federal Era architecture.  </P> <P> U.S. 5 on the Vermont side and New Hampshire 10 traverse scenic stretches of  what is called the Upper Valley of the Connecticut, a region so distinct that  it once attempted to form a separate state.  </P> <P> New Hampshire 10 passes through Hanover, home of Dartmouth College, and Orford,  a jewel of a river village with a lineup of gleaming white federal mansions.  </P> <P> The more adventurous foliage viewer, one who wants to really escape the crowds,  should consider driving a stretch of third-class or unpaved road. It helps to  get local advice before trying one, however. And they shouldn't be traversed in  bad weather or with a low-slung car.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tough to Book  </P> <P> One of my favorite dirt roads in early foliage season is the Stannard Road,  which runs from Lyndonville to Greensboro Bend in northeastern Vermont. Well  maintained although unpaved for much of its length, the road passes over  Wheelock Mountain, with its splendid views, and through the lonely, lovely  hamlets of South Wheelock and Stannard.  </P> <P> Accommodations can be a problem in particularly popular foliage regions --  southern Vermont, the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, the Monadnock Region  of New Hampshire -- and advance reservations are recommended throughout the  season. They are essential around Columbus Day.  </P> <P> However, Vermont is particularly helpful about finding beds for leafers without  reservations, and many Green Mountain towns have a policy of putting visitors  into hospitable private homes when nothing else is available. Among the  chambers of commerce providing this service are: Addison County Chamber Travel  Bureau, Middlebury, (802) 388-7951; St. Johnsbury Chamber of Commerce, (802)  748-3678, and the Woodstock Area Chamber of Commerce, (802) 453-3555.  </P> <P> Driving may be the preferred method of transportation for looking at autumn  leaves, but there are other options.  </P> <P> The Providence and Worcester Railroad, exclusively a freight carrier most of  the year, runs special foliage passenger trains over a scenic central  Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island route on weekends until mid-October.  For information, call (508) 755-4000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sky View  </P> <P> Those who have experienced it maintain that foliage looks most beautiful --  something like a psychedelic stained-glass window laid end to end -- when seen  from above while slowly, silently floating in a hot-air balloon.  </P> <P> The Balloon School of Massachusetts in Palmer offers flights over the  Berkshires throughout the foliage season. Flights usually take place at dawn,  when there is little wind, and last one to two hours. For more information,  call (413) 245-7013.  </P> <P> Hiking is a healthy and rewarding way to get good foliage views. Mt. Monadnock  in New Hampshire may be the most-climbed peak in the country, if not the world,  rivaling Japan's Mt. Fuji.  </P> <P> On a good fall foliage weekend, the main trail up Monadnock is about as jammed  as the Mohawk Trail. There are well-marked alternative routes, however, and the  smashing view makes the effort worthwhile.  </P> <P> Many ski areas operate their chairlifts and gondolas during the fall, providing  colorful panoramas on the way up or down. Mt. Tom in Holyoke, Mass., has a  splendid view of the Connecticut Valley. Call (413) 536-0516.  </P> <P> A tramway runs up Jay Peak in Jay, Vt., (802) 988-2611, and the panorama from  the summit takes in the Northeast Kingdom and Eastern Townships areas of  Quebec, Canada.  </P> <P> The historic tramway at Cannon Mountain in Franconia, N.H., (603) 823-7751,  first of its type in the country, offers wonderful vistas of the White  Mountains, New England's tallest range.  </P></p>

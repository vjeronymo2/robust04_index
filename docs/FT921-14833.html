			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc plant to close for refit NUOVA SAMIM, the metals group controlled by Italy's state-owned ENI energy and chemicals holding company, yesterday confirmed that its zinc smelter at Crotone in southern Italy was likely to be taken out of operation for a refit sometime in the first half of this year. 'We are just putting the final touches to the plan,' said a Nuova Samim official. 'There may be some delays, but it will probably be done before the middle of the year.' Observers expect the refitting to take up to two years. Reports of the closure of the plant, which was built in 1927 and has an output of about 100,000 tonnes a year, helped the London Metal Exchange zinc price for three months delivery to rally from yesterday's low of Dollars 1,095 a tone. The market is suffering from considerable overcapacity at present. The plant came under state control last year, when Nuova Samim bought a controlling stake in Pertusola Sud, the company running the smelter, from its previous French owners. Another Italian state entity, GEPI, was already present as a minority shareholder. The Crotone plant employs about 800 staff and is one of the larger zinc smelters in Europe. According to the Nuova Samim official, the refitting may be linked to a plan to increase its eventual capacity.</p>

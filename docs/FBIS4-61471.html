			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    It was hoped that the combat operations would be suspended  on  the eve of the meeting the speakers of the parliaments of the  disputing countries will have. That would give an opportunity  to the sides to exchange views on what has to be done.  Regrettably, however, those who cherished that hope have been  disappointed. The relatively peaceful situation along the front  lines lasted only 24 hours. Azerbaijan's military forces have  resumed their intensive military operations in the confrontation  areas in the NKR. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press  Service has disclosed that Azerbaijan's military units have  maintained their attacks against various parts of Mardakertskiy  Rayon. The NKR military units not only obstructed their attacks  in the clashes in the vicinity of Chayly and Karmiravan but also  placed several heights under their control. Azerbaijan's  military units were forced to withdraw to their positions after  suffering many casualties.    Attacks were launched from the military bases in [words  indistinct] today. The NKR defense forces have successfully  rebuffed the onslaughts.    Using military vehicles, Azerbaijan's military forces tried  to penetrate the NKR lines close to Agdam yesterday morning.  However, they failed in their attempt. Their onslaughts were  obstructed. The advancing units were forced to retreat.    It is common knowledge that the neighboring republic's  leaders are convinced that sending their young men to die is the  only way to remove the economic crisis in Azerbaijan. However,  that republic's leaders and reactionary forces are well aware  that resolving the dispute through the use of armed force is  impossible.    Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's military forces have maintained  their  provocative activities on Armenia's border. They intensely  fired on Armenia's northeastern border with artillery units last  night and today. The defense positions and residential areas  close to the border in Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy,  Tavushskiy, and Krasnoselskiy Rayons were fired on with heavy  artillery units and Grad rocket launchers. The attacks have  caused damage. Our military units were forced to launch  retaliatory operations.    Two of Azerbaijan's military aircraft flew over the border  for reconnaissance purposes and disappeared in the direction of  the Khanlar locality in Azerbaijan at about 1800 yesterday.  However, the enemy was not satisfied with that provocative  action. Two enemy infantry groups launched an attack on  Berkaber in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon at 2200. A wave of intensive  artillery fire preceded their attack. Armenia's border troops  forced the Azerbaijani units to retreat after suffering many  casualties. No one was hurt on the Armenian side. Meanwhile,  the Armenian fighters clashed with another enemy group close to  Aygehovit in Idzhevanskiy Rayon. Azerbaijan's troops were  attacked and forced to retreat. There were dead and wounded on  both sides.</p>

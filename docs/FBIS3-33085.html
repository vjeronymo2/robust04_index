[passage omitted]    He said: [Begin recording] I want my right to privacy as  president and citizen to be respected. There was nothing wrong  with what happened in Rio de Janeiro. It was just an outward  show of merriment, a sign of esteem for Rio de Janeiro Carnival.  I was invited by the chairman of the samba schools association  and I attended the parade in my capacity as president of the  Republic. And yet, I also attended it as a human being, as a  citizen. Therefore, I do not see that I have done anything  wrong. [end recording] [passage omitted]    He added: [Begin recording] For a year and a half we have  been grappling with inflation, abject poverty, squalor. I would  like to underscore that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso has fulfilled his mission as a true patriot. Now, if he  decides to run for the presidency, he will undoubtedly have my  support. [end recording].</p>

Some sources said he belongs to the Islamic Action  Front [IAF], but IAF sources denied that.    According to informed sources, the new arrest raises the  number of detainees to over 50. The competent authorities,  however, are expected to release about 13 other detainees who  were arrested for interrogation but were found not guilty.    The prime minister had earlier told the House deputies that  the investigation will take its course and that all who had  nothing to do with the recent explosions will be released.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Wave of Indian violence recedes THE wave of violence which has swept India since the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque was yesterday showing signs of receding as tough action by the police and army restored order in many districts. Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, said the situation was dangerous for the country but 'the worst part is behind us as of today.' He told foreign journalists India had survived bouts of inter-religious violence in the past and would survive this one. 'We have been able to live together. We have been able to obliterate whatever tears of bitterness there have been. This we can do again.' Mr Rao admitted the crisis would prove a 'setback' for the economy, but a temporary one, while businessmen waited for the unrest to die down. However, once people saw that normalcy had returned they would have no doubts left about the country or about the government's continuing commitment to economic reform, he said. Over 1,000 people have died since Hindu militants stormed the Ayodhya mosque during a rally organised last Sunday by the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition party. Most of the dead have been Moslems shot by police during violent street protests and revenge attacks on temples. Hindus have hit back with raids on Moslems. The death toll yesterday rose from 960 to about 1,020, including those who died in hospital from earlier injuries. The BJP yesterday remained in defiant mood, though it cancelled planned demonstrations outside the Pakistani and Bangladeshi high commissions. It condemned the government's ban on militant organisations, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the core of the Hindu militant movement from which the BJP was born. Bombay, which bore the brunt of the earlier violence, was mostly quiet yesterday, though the atmosphere remained tense, with curfews in force in many districts. In Calcutta, which has a long history of Hindu-Moslem violence, firm action by the security forces seems to have prevented serious incidents. Only about 20 people have died in West Bengal, which includes Calcutta, compared with 200 in Bombay. A huge police presence has suppressed violence in Delhi, though tempers are running high, as was shown yesterday in street fights between Moslems and police in the north east of the city in which three died. The worst-affected states now seem to be Gujarat in the west and Uttar Pradesh in the north, which both have large Moslem populations. Tensions are particularly high in Uttar Pradesh because it includes Ayodhya and two other mosques which Hindu militants claim stand on temple sites. Troops were given shoot-on-sight orders to stop rioters in Kanpur, an industrial city of 6m people on the banks of the Ganges river in Uttar Pradesh. Six thousand soldiers were reported to be in the city.</p>

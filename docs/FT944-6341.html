			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / People: Conron puts wings on his heels John Conron, newly appointed director of planning and financial controls at Mercury Communications, clearly believes in his company's products. Yesterday he was closeted for several hours in a video-conference with colleagues across the Atlantic as he put the finishing touches to measures to cut costs and improve performance at British Telecommunication's largest competitor. Conron's appointment is part of a shake-up at Mercury designed to cut up to 2,000 jobs in a bid to boost competitiveness. Conron, 44, essentially replaces Jeff Phillips, director of finance, who in Mercury's words: 'is now being considered for other opportunities within the Cable and Wireless group'. C&amp;W owns 80 per cent of Mercury. The telecoms operator has been suffering declining profitability with the entry of new competitors in the UK market and no longer enjoys privileged duopoly status with BT. Conron, currently vice-president of finance at Cable &amp; Wireless Inc, worked for C&amp;W in the US for 10 years and for Arthur Andersen, the management consultants, before that. There has been no honeymoon period at Mercury. He arrived from the US last Sunday, went straight to his desk and has been there virtually ever since, working on the details of the cost-cutting scheme which is expected to be announced next week. He reports directly to Duncan Lewis whose appointment earlier this month as chief executive was also part of the shake-up. Rod Attwooll, group managing director, has also left his post at Mercury and is looking for a new position within the group. Attwooll was a major force behind a programme of change and revitalisation at Mercury whose first phase 'Ignition' finished in July.</p>

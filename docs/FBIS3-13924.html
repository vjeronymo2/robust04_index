			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at  1130 GMT and 1600 GMT on 21 March report on the morning and  afternoon sessions of the commission of inquiry into the Hebron  massacre.    In the morning, the commission heard testimony from  Brigadier  General Moshe Ya'alon, the former commander of the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] in Judaea and Samaria, who told the commission  that "it had not been foreseen and that he did not prepare  contingency plans for events he considered remote from reality."  The committee heard testimony behind closed doors from Colonel  Moshe Zarqa, the IDF intelligence officer in Judaea and Samaria.    Harley Braidman reports: "Brig. Ya'alon told the committee  that from the evidence so far it emerges that among officers and  men there was a misunderstanding about the order not to fire at  Jews and this needed correction. He said there were many  confrontations between Arabs and Jews at the Patriarchs' Cave,  mainly over prayer arrangements. Ya'alon made it clear that it  was decided to allow Jewish worshipers to enter the cave armed  because of the attacks against Jews in the Hebron area. Even  after the massacre no hasty conclusions should be drawn about  the license to carry weapons there in view of the concern that a  large number of Arab worshipers might attack Jews.    "As for the orders on opening fire, the brigadier said there  was clear discrimination because sometimes during Arab rioting  the soldiers' lives were endangered and they had permission to  start shooting in certain circumstances. One the other hand,  there was no permission to fire on Jewish worshipers because the  possibility of a Jew attacking a soldier was not envisaged. He  also noted that the use of tear gas against Jewish rioters  required special approval by the commander of Israeli forces in  Judaea and Samaria. Ya'alon added: It was obvious that the  soldiers seeing somebody commit a grave crime endangering the  lives of others should intervene to prevent that crime and even  shoot the perpetrator."    In the afternoon, the commission heard testimony from Brig.  Gen. Gadi Zohar, head of the Civil Administration in Judaea and  Samaria, who said that the Cave of the Patriarchs "had been a  source of tension for years between Arabs and Jews."    Harley Braidman reports: "Zohar said it is not mission  impossible to make satisfactory prayer arrangements for Jews and  Arabs at the Patriarchs' Cave, but it is problematic. The  Muslims believe the presence of Jews in the place which they  think belongs to them is a slight. They acquiesce in silence  with the status quo, but are prepared to make prayer  arrangements. The Jews, Zohar added, are trying to base a  permanent presence in Isaac's Hall to the chagrin of the  Muslims. Both sides attempt to change specifics. The constant  changes in Muslim and Jewish holidays are a source of tension,  he said. The issues have been raised in discussions with the  Central Region commander and in the Forum for the Territories  with the participation of Defense Minister Rabin. Prayer  arrangements are now being discussed with the Civil  Administration and when the cave is reopened there may be new  arrangements. Zohar also was not happy about the way the police  functioned at the cave because it had failed to deal effectively  with a string of illegal incidents there, such as throwing acid  on carpets and tearing off mezuzot."</p>

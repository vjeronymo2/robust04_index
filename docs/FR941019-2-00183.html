The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enable OCC to issue, clear, and settle new flexibly structured index options denominated in a foreign currency to be traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE''). <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed description of the CBOE product, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34203 (June 13, 1994), 59 FR 31658 [File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;33] (order approving a proposed rule change relating to flexibly structured index options designated in foreign currencies). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 23, 1993, the Commission approved a proposed rule change filed by OCC which proposed to accommodate the clearance and settlement of flexibly structured index options. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Flexibly structured index options exhibit virtually the same characteristics as regular index options; therefore, OCC establishes long and short flexibly structured index option positions in clearing member accounts in precisely the same way it currently does for regular index options. OCC incorporates flexibly structured index options in its premium settlement, margin collection, exercise notice, exercise assignment, and exercise/expiration statement processes without significant changes to those processes. Premiums and exercise prices for the flexibly structured index options that are currently being traded are denominated in United States dollars. Parties to a transaction in such an option may customize certain terms of the option including: the expiration date, the exercise style, the exercise price, the cap interval in the case of capped-style options, and the method to be used for establishing the current index value for purposes of settling expiration date exercises. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31912 (February 23, 1993), 58 FR 11879 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;33] (order approving proposed rule change relating to flexibly structured index options). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new flexibly structured index option product to be traded at the CBOE is similar to the existing flexibly structured index option product in that the underlying interest is an index and the parties to a transaction may customize certain terms of the option. However, the new product will have premiums and exercise prices denominated in foreign currencies rather than in United States dollars. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, this new product is being called Flexibly Structured Index Options Denominated in a Foreign Currency (``FX Index Options''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Premium and exercise prices for these non-United States dollars flexibly structured index options may be denominated in any of the foreign currencies currently underlying foreign currency options. Those currencies include: (1) Australian dollars, (2) British pounds, (3) Canadian dollars, (4) European Economic Community currency units, (5) French francs, (6) German Deutsche marks, (7) Japanese yen and (8) Swiss francs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To accommodate the clearance and settlement of FX Index Options, a new Article, Article XXIII, will be added to the OCC By-Laws. Because FX Index Options are a type of index option, the OCC By-Laws governing index options, Article XVII, will be incorporated into new Article XXIII and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. In addition, because FX Index Options will settle in a foreign currency, certain of the OCC By-Laws governing Cross-Rate Foreign Currency Options in Article XX also are being incorporated into new Article XXIII where appropriate. For example, those By-Laws governing extraordinary events, adjustments, and the payment of premiums will be incorporated into the new article. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> AGENCY URGES STUDY OF CITY PLAN FOR SOS  </P> <P> The Community Development Council on Wednesday refused to approve a city plan  under which the CDC would share its building with a charity forced by  complaining neighbors to move.  </P> <P> Agency directors instead voted 11 to 0, with one abstention, to let a committee  study the city-initiated plan for Share Our Selves to occupy 4,200 square feet  in the council's building at 1695 W. MacArthur Blvd.  </P> <P> Under the plan, SOS would move into the 35,000-square-foot facility -- with  part of its rent being paid by the city -- until the charity can find and  purchase its own quarters.  </P> <P> However, it is uncertain if any such plan would be implemented because SOS  directors this week rejected a similar proposal.  </P> <P> CDC officials said Wednesday that they want SOS to be included in any lease  talks.  </P> <P> The plan provides two options for the charity's relocation. Under a three-year  option, SOS would sublease space at a monthly rent of $3,780. SOS would  initially pay $610 of the rent, with the city picking up the $3,170 balance.  The charity would pay 25% of the rent during the next 12 months and 50% during  the last year of the arrangement.  </P> <P> Under a short-term option, SOS could enter a six-month lease but would be  required to pay more rent for the same space. The city would pay only 25% of  the monthly bill.  </P> <P> The City Council narrowly approved the plan Tuesday night and agreed to  guarantee the financial terms.  </P> <P> The CDC's lease on the building expires in August, 1992, and SOS directors had  complained that if they accepted the long-term option they would be forced to  relocate again if the CDC decided not to remain in the building.  </P> <P> SOS directors also called the six-month option impractical should they find a  permanent home before the lease term expired.  </P> <P> The charity has made offers on two industrial buildings in Costa Mesa. One is  known as the Fabric Store, at 18th Street and Placentia Avenue, and the other  is at 1550 Superior Avenue. Both are on the west side of the city and are  likely to draw opposition from some of the same residents who opposed the  charity's presence at the city-managed Rea Community Center, its home for the  past nine years.  </P> <P> One of the county's largest private charities, SOS is being evicted from the  Rea center by the City Council. The city had earlier denied a request that the  charity be allowed to remain at the center while looking for a new home. CARLA  RIVERA  </P></p>

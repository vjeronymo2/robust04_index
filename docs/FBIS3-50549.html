			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero at Los Pinos presidential </F> residence in Mexico City -- live]    [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today issued an  appeal to find points of consensus and a solution to all demands  through dialogue and respect for the law in reference to the  conflict in central and eastern Chiapas State, where Indian  groups took up arms early on New Year's Day.    The president recognized that there are shortages and  inequalities in Chiapas and that benefits and opportunities are  not a reality for many, but he insisted that in recent years  there have been earnest efforts to reverse the inequality that  has prevailed for centuries in this zone of our country.    The following is part of the president's message regarding  the violent conflicts in Chiapas.    [Begin Salinas recording] Let us never forget that we will  be able to find points of consensus and solutions to all demands  only through a dialogue within a legal framework. Let there be  no doubt; no region in Mexico has differences that surpass our  ability to settle them in a dialogue, nor is there a gap capable  of dividing our essential unity.    Violent actions obstruct true solutions to social needs and  cast a shadow on the settlement of disputes. Politics and frank  communication allow us to get to the bottom of differences, just  as joint efforts meet social demands. Solutions are found and  provided. Mexico has no place or time for disputes that are not  settled within a legal framework.    I reassert: We will always strive to defend the law and  peaceful dialogue -- particularly for the defense of human  rights and all the community's actions -- in Mexico. [end  recording]    President Carlos Salinas spoke to congressional legislators  who visited him on Monday. The legislators met with Salinas  for two reasons: to notify him about the conclusion of their  period of sessions and to confirm their support for the nation's  institutions given the violence that has arisen in the southern  part of the country.    The president, accompanied by Government Secretary  Patrocinio  Gonzalez Garrido -- who, by the way, has remained silent in  recent days -- emphasized that an essential unity among Mexicans  prevails over pluralism and ideological differences. He said  everyone is obligated to sponsor this unity as an expression of  his love for the fatherland. The ceremony was held at the  Venustiano Carranza Room in Los Pinos. Maria de los Angeles  Moreno Uriega, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' commission,  outlined the National Congress' position concerning the events  in Chiapas.    [Begin Moreno recording] The deputies who make up all the  legislative factions and fellow senators who participated in the  55th legislative period have asked me to express their concern  about the events in Chiapas and to state their strong rejection  of the attitude assumed by armed groups that have resorted to  violence in an attempt to justify it as a method to solve  problems that involve and affect various groups of Mexicans.    Likewise, the legislators express their conviction that we  will continue to find peaceful solutions -- within the framework  of the law and national constitution -- that will allow us to  continue toward the achievement of specific social welfare  goals, which is our shared goal and in which so much has been  achieved in this phase for the sake of the republic. [end  recording]    President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will receive various  groups throughout the day. This morning he was visited by his  closest aides. Representatives of various groups have also  arrived and will continue to arrive for the New Year  celebrations.</p>

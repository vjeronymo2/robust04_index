			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister Shim'on Shetrit will propose that the  government suspend the negotiations with the PLO until Yasir  'Arafat condemns the terrorist attack in 'Afula. Shetrit  expressed the belief that all the cabinet ministers will support  his proposal. The minister said that not only has 'Arafat failed  to condemn the terrorist attack of his own volition but also  avoided replying to a question on the matter yesterday in Cairo.    Shetrit explained that by his actions, 'Arafat is giving  cause to doubt the sincerity of his intention to fulfill his  commitments to Israel. Shetrit said that Prime Minister Rabin  and Foreign Minister Peres will find the appropriate time and  place to comment on 'Arafat's behavior.</p>

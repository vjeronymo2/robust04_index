			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WORKER SUSPECTED IN PAN AM CRASH  </P> <P> British investigators now believe the bomb that tore apart a Pan Am airliner  over Scotland last month, killing 270 people, was probably smuggled aboard by a  worker at London's Heathrow Airport, West German intelligence sources said  today.  </P> <P> The sources said British investigators were working from the theory that the  explosive was placed in a passage directly under the cockpit, connecting it  with the baggage hold. The sources said British media speculation that the bomb  might have been planted in a passenger's luggage in a connecting flight from  Frankfurt and then transferred to the jumbo jet at Heathrow is being  increasingly discounted by British investigators.  </P></p>

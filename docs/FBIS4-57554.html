			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Caracas, 16 May -- Defense Minister General Rafael  Montero Revette stated today that there are sectors interested  in creating apprehension in the democratic system through a  campaign of rumors such as those disseminated last weekend about  President Rafael Caldera's health.    The defense minister made these remarks at the National  Congress Administrative Headquarters where he had been summoned  by the Chamber of Deputies Environment Committee to discuss  issues related to the environmental problems faced in the  southern part of the country. The hearing was called off due to  absence of the parliamentarians, only Committee President Cesar  Perez Vivas was present.    In this respect, the defense minister urged the media not to  fall prey to the rumors "since they only overwhelm the country  and what we want to do is pull away from this crisis through  employment, before the violence which has appeared recently  spreads throughout the country and threatens all Venezuelans.  With or without weapons, we must maintain peace."    On the presence of masked groups [encapuchados], Gen.  Revette  said they are manipulative because they go around promoting  violence and only block progress. These groups are contrary to  peace and quiet in Venezuela."    Likewise, the defense minister ruled out the likelihood of a  social explosion and added that violence in Venezuela can never  be rationalized. He added that "we are aware that there are  problems, and we are urging all Venezuelans to remain calm and  collectedn order to try to solve these problems."    He indicated that he has ordered the National Police into  the  streets every morning with the mission of preventing violence.  We believe the students are confident that these problems will  not continue and that there will be an end to violence, as well  as that we will all work in peace."    In reference to the accusations made by retired Lieutenant  Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias with respect to a coup attempt, the  defense minister said that Chavez must present evidence of his  allegations since intelligence operations have failed to turn up  anything. There have been new reports and we are confronting a  situation of constant accusations without any evidence, which  are aimed at specific institutions or trade unions."    Nevertheless, he added, the National Armed Forces [FAN]  intelligence members and other state security organizations are  working 24 hours a day. With respect to military promotions, he  indicated that the promotion process has been clear throughout  the current year, and that the list of candidates will be  forwarded to the National Congress for evaluation sometime at  the end of this month.    With respect to the summons, the general indicated that  during the next few days he will present a report to the  Committee on Environmental Problems, which will be from the  military's perspective.</p>

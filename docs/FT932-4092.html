			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla back in the black METSA-SERLA, the Finnish forestry group, bounced back into the black in the first four months, showing a profit after financial items of FM102m (Dollars 18.8m), against a loss of FM2m the previous year. The recovery was due to the depreciation of the Finnish markka, lower domestic costs and savings from restructuring. The company moved yesterday to take advantage of its improved position by launching an international issue of 3m B shares which should raise about Dollars 100m. Combined with a further FM460m expected from the take-up in September of warrants from a 1987 bonds issue, Metsa-Serla is aiming to improve its equity ratio from a low last year of 29.9 per cent to 37 or 38 per cent. Company officials said Metsa was seeking acquisitions in Europe, playing on the weakness of many operators to expand market share. It is also spending FM200m this year, out of total capital expenditure of FM500m, on scrapping an uncoated magazine paper machine at the Kirkniemi plant and replacing it with plant to produce a new type of offset coated paper. Metsa said falling costs and double-digit depreciation of the Finnish markka were the chief factors behind its improvement. It saw little pick-up in its main European markets, still hit by overcapacity and low prices. In the first four months, group sales were up almost 4 per cent at FM2.74bn, compared with FM2.64bn. Operating profit was FM351m, or almost 13 per cent of sales, compared with FM229m, or 8.7 per cent of sales, last time. For the full year, Metsa-Serla is predicting a return to profits after a full-year loss in 1992 of FM290m. Sales are set to rise above FM8bn from FM7.75bn last year.</p>

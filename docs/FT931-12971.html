			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: CBI survey finds confidence in business outlook has increased MANUFACTURING orders are continuing to fall, although at the lowest rate for 2 1/2 years, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey, published yesterday, found that confidence about the outlook for business has increased significantly over the past four months, even though factory investment is still declining. The proportion of companies operating below capacity is 73 per cent, the lowest figure recorded since January 1983. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economics committee as well as chairman and chief executive of engineering group GKN, said the mood was 'more positive'. Even so, there was no guarantee that the recession was ending. He said that several times during the recession a rise in business optimism had proved to be a false dawn. Mr John Major, heading a delegation of UK businessmen in India, said the rise in confidence was 'dramatic' and that export growth would lead Britain out of recession. The prime minister said 'one missing ingredient' needed to end the recession had been stronger confidence in business. More than 1,100 companies answered questions in the survey, which was conducted between December 21 and January 11. New orders were lower in the past four months than in the previous four months for 35 per cent of manufacturers, allowing for seasonal variations. The 22 per cent to report an increase in orders gave a negative balance of 13 percentage points. That compared with a negative balance of 28 points in the previous survey in October. Manufacturers are more hopeful about orders over the next four months, with a difference of 13 points between companies expecting orders to climb and those anticipating a fall. Even though optimism about export prospects has changed little since October, the balance of companies expecting increased export orders over the next four months comes out at a relatively healthy 18 points. That compares with a balance of 6 points in October. The increased confidence about exports sparked by the devaluation of sterling last September has been only feebly translated into actual orders. A balance of 11 percentage points said export orders over the past four months had declined, compared with the previous four months. That was only slightly more encouraging than the balance of 19 points recorded last October. More companies expect to reduce their spending on buildings and machinery over the next 12 months compared with those which think they will increase it. The balance expecting to make cuts is lower than it was last October, however. The CBI expects total manufacturing investment in mid 1993 to be nearly 40 per cent below its peak in mid 1989. Unit costs have increased only slightly since the last survey while the CBI says the squeeze on profit margins has remained tight, as indicated by the balance of just 11 points of companies expecting to increase prices over the next four months.</p>

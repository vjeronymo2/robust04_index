			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CYNICISM AT WORK  </P> <P> The article "Breaking Camp: Concerns for Health Force Migrants Out" (Dec. 18)  raises the obvious question of whose health we are interested in?  </P> <P> It is ironic that the mechanisms to promote health in San Diego are being used  to destroy the only homes people have. We consider it a very cynical use of a  public agency for the Health Department to enforce the wishes of those who want  the camps out of their backyard.  </P> <P> It is obvious to us as members of a public health-oriented discipline that if  as a society we say we are concerned about health, we must meet the challenge  of providing adequate housing and sanitary conditions for those who earn a  substandard wage. As pointed out in the article, the people living in the camps  work hard and many are legal U. S. residents. Razing the camps will displace  the symptoms of the problem, it is not a solution.  </P> <P> TERRI CLARK-COLLER  </P> <P> American College of Nurse-Midwives  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WINFIELD ALIMONY: $163,000  </P> <P> New York Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield has agreed to pay $163,000 in alimony  and attorney fees to a woman a jury ruled was his common law wife.  </P> <P> Winfield agreed to the payment Wednesday, and he postponed his appeal of the  jury's June ruling that he and Sandra Renfro had a common-law marriage from  1982 to 1985.  </P> <P> State District Judge Allen J. Daggett had ordered Winfield to pay $13,500 in  temporary alimony and child support to Renfro pending their divorce trial, plus  $210,000 for attorney fees. Winfield had initially refused to pay more than the  court-ordered child support for their daughter, Lauren Shanel, 6.  </P> <P> Renfro's attorney, Earle Lilly, said Wednesday he received a check from  Winfield for $163,000, an amount agreed upon by Lilly and Winfield's attorney,  Tom Alexander. Lilly said Renfro will receive $33,000 in back alimony, and his  firm will get $130,000.  </P></p>

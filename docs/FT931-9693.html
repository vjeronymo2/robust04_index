			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Investment pours back into Latin America: It may be a mixed blessing LATIN AMERICAN countries crippled by the burden of debt repayment throughout the 1980s have seen a reversal in the past two years as private investors have poured funds into the region. From net outflows of more than Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.6bn) in 1990, they recorded net inflows of almost Dollars 26bn last year. While Mexico's modest net inflow of Dollars 3.8bn in 1990 has soared to Dollars 15.3bn, Argentina has seen a net outflow of Dollars 4.9bn transformed into an inflow of more than Dollars 5bn. Venezuela, which haemorrhaged Dollars 4.2bn in 1990, saw net inflows of Dollars 344m last year. Even the region's biggest debtor, Brazil, has seen an outflow of Dollars 7.4bn in 1990 turn into an inflow of Dollars 1.4bn last year. This striking turnaround, described by World Bank and United Nations economists at this week's conference of the London-based Overseas Development Institute on economic prospects for developing countries, provided an important signpost for the 1990s: it is set to be 'the decade of equity investment' in developing countries. Those which hope to improve their plight must capture equity flows - whether in the form of foreign direct investment, bond issues, or portfolio equity investment - or flounder. While the change of the past two years has helped the liberalising states finance a surge in imports, World Bank officials argue it is a mixed blessing: private investment, particularly portfolio investment, is notoriously volatile. Also, as the countries of the industrial north rise from recession, the present tidal flow of funds could swiftly reverse as US, European or Japanese companies seek finance. But its potential benefits are great: it brings new technologies, management knowhow, and training for workers, boosts export capacity and provides access to export markets. Portfolio investment can lower the cost local companies face in raising capital. Whether the improvement of the past two years can be sustained remains uncertain, particularly in Latin America, where economists say the inflows may be a 'windfall' consequence of recent economic liberalisation. According to Mr Zigo Vodusek, economist at the Inter-American Development Bank, they have been critical in enabling countries in the region to pay interest on debts totalling Dollars 450bn. As debt service accounts for 20 per cent of export earnings, countries face a balance of payments problem that is likely to grow until exports rally, or imports fall. Mexico, for example, ran a deficit on visible trade in 1992 of Dollars 19bn. Since net investment inflows totalled Dollars 23bn last year, breaching such a trade gap was manageable. But even a small decline would create immense balance of payments pressure. Because traditional sources of finance from aid agencies or commercial banks are expected to stagnate as banks struggle with new capital adequacy rules and aid fatigue deepens among national governments, efforts to stimulate private investment flows are likely to be critical. According to Mr Kwang Jun, a senior World Bank financial economist, private funds can provide a rich seam for developing countries. Institutional funds available for portfolio investment in the US alone amount to Dollars 5,000bn-Dollars 6,000bn. At the same time, developing countries have far to go in exploiting stock market funding. Mr Jun notes that developing countries account for 13 per cent of world GNP, but just 6 per cent of world stock market capitalisation. Foreign direct investment currently accounts for just 2-4 per cent of gross domestic investment in the developing world. But in Malaysia, where foreign investment has been strongly encouraged, the figure is 20 per cent. Mr Jun notes that raising the average to just 10 per cent could mobilise around Dollars 50bn a year. Bonds may provide another rich source of funds. Well below Dollars 6bn a year between 1986 and 1990, they soared to Dollars 15bn in 1992, according to Mr Cristian Ossa at the UN Department of Economic and Social Development. He predicts bond issues will grow by 10 per cent a year in the near future. Economists are more confident over Asia's prospects. Most investment flows are now generated within the region, with one-time consumers of investment like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore now joining Japan to become important net investors across the region. Gloom is strongest in sub-Saharan Africa, where aid flows account for 11 per cent of the region's GNP and almost 100 per cent of foreign cash flows. The region's capacity to attract private funds is seen as limited, reinforcing other pessimistic forecasts for prospects in the 1990s.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Industry disappointed but markets give thumbs-up Industry was yesterday united in expressing disappointment at the rise in interest rates but views were mixed on whether it would have any material impact on the recovery. However, the markets gave a thumbs-up to the rise, with gilts and sterling making sharp gains. The FT-SE 100 index finished 10.5 points down on the day at 3128.8, but sentiment was generally positive. Among the more strident critics of yesterday's decision was the British Chambers of Commerce, which said the move could 'sabotage the recovery'. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director, said it was premature and would have a harmful effect on business and consumer confidence. 'Consumer demand is fragile and capacity utilisation is low. This rise means companies' profitability will be further eroded and there is a danger that some companies could fold.' Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said his members would be 'surprised and disappointed' as inflationary influences Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, described the move as 'unusual, since there is no strong market pressure for an upward rise in rates'. He continued: 'We had expected a small rise before the end of the year, though in our judgment it would have been safe to wait a little longer since inflationary pressures remain weak, as does the housing market.' He added: 'This move, in itself, is unlikely to damage the healthy recovery we are now seeing. But we would not like at this stage to see rates rise much further.' Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'We are disappointed, especially in light of better-than-expected trends in inflation. Low inflation is important, but not at the risk of stifling the recovery.' In the markets, analysts expressed mixed views about the implications for sterling. Some thought it would benefit from the fact that the Bank of England was clearly playing a greater role in monetary policy. The willingness of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to take a difficult decision was also seen as positive. Others were more wary. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, commented: 'I still think it's going nowhere fast. The rate rise might give it some support, but it is still caught in the crossfire of the big currencies.' The gilt market was less ambiguous, helped by Mr Clarke's pledge to avoid early tax cuts. 'The gilt market loved it, especially given the firm comments on tax,' said Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg. He added: 'There had been some uncertainty about policy here and the market finds this very reassuring. I would be surprised if the market didn't move ahead in the next few days.'</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pickens Responds to Criticism: T. Boone Pickens Jr. dismissed a letter from  Koito Manufacturing Co. as a "joke." In the letter, Koito accused the Texas  oilman of attempting to greenmail the Japanese company and demanded that he  "clarify" his relationship with Kitaro Watanable, who sold Pickens his 26%  stake in Koito. The letter came a week after Pickens asked Koito to raise the  company's dividend. After Sept. 30, the end of a six-month waiting period  required by Japanese law, Pickens can request a special shareholders meeting to  renew his previous request for representation on Koito's board.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tomas Juknevicius: "Government Officials are </F> Disseminating Erroneous Information about Unemployment in  Lithuania. Who Can Interpret the Puzzling Unemployment Curve?"]    [Text] For more than a year now, according to the official  statistics, the unemployment rate in Lithuania has been stable  at 1.5 percent, and sometimes has even dipped below that figure.  Is that at all possible? And if so, what does it mean?    V. Slekaitis, general director of the Labor Exchange, told  LIETUVOS RYTAS that on December 1 of 1993, 30,848 people in  Lithuania were registered as unemployed. Of these, 13,551, or  43.9 percent were in urban areas, and 17,297, or 56.1 percent,  were in the districts. Of all those registered as unemployed,  there were 19,078 (or 61.8 percent) blue collar workers, and  11,770 (38.2 percent) white collar workers. Of the total, 17,615  (or 57.1 percent) were women, and 13,233 (42.9 percent) were men.    Official documents from the Lithuanian Labor Exchange also  indicate that the proportion of unemployed blue collar men and  unemployed women in the cities has increased.    The documents show that the unemployment rate for Lithuania  as a whole is 1.5 percent. It is lowest in the Anyksciai,  Moletai, Plunge, Kedainiai and Varena districts, and is only 0.4  percent in the city of Marijampole. In the cities of Kaunas and  Klaipeda, as well as in the Pasvalys, Prienai, and Vilkaviskis  districts, it is under one percent. The unemployment rate is  highest in the Taurage (6.2 percent), Silute (4 percent), Akmene  (3.4) percent, and Raseiniai (3.1 percent) districts, as well as  in the cities of Panevezys and Druskininkai (2.5 and 2.2  percent, respectively).    No further information was provided to the LIETUVOS RYTAS  reporter by either V. Slekaitis or his advisor V. Zaksauskaite  (other employees are not allowed to talk to the press).    When asked how many Lithuanians work only part of the day,  or  part of the week, the heads of the Labor Exchange said that that  information was for internal use only, and was not made public;  under the Public Employment [Gyventoju Uzimtumo] Law, the Labor  Exchange was not required to collect this information.    Upon being asked whether the General Director of the Labor  Exchange was aware of the real situation in the employment  market, Mr. V. Slekaitis responded that "we are doing a better  job than anyone else!"  <H5>  The real situation in the job market </H5>   According to LIETUVOS RYTAS data, on December 1, 4258 job  openings were listed with local labor exchanges (there were 700  more in November). Urban labor exchange listings contained 78.7  percent of all job openings.    Each available job had 7.5 unemployed applicants; 6.2 for  each blue collar position, and ten for each white collar one. In  Kaunas, Anyksciai, Lazdijai, and Moletai, each available job had  about three applicants; each one in Vilnius, Klaipeda, Alytus,  Mariampole, Mazeikiai, Pakruojis, Pasvalys, Plunge, and  Vilkaviskis had about five; each one in Siauliai, Panevezys,  Druskininkai, Svencionys, and Telsiai had over 50; finally, each  one in Sakiai, Skuodas, Jurbarkas, Taurage, and Rokiskis had 200  unemployed applicants.    There were no openings for white-collar applicants on  December 1 in Jurbarkas, Rokiskis, Skoudas, and Sakiai. During  November, 2685 people found jobs, or 746 fewer than did so in  October.  <H3>  The unemployment rate is three times higher than the  official figures indicate </H3>   We were able to find out that on December 1, in 146  Lithuanian enterprises, a total of 17,300 people were on  enforced vacation, in 107 firms 32,300 worked less than a full  week, and in 253 firms a total of 50,000 people worked away from  their regular jobs, or in jobs that did not match their  qualifications. In November, about a hundred thousand people in  Lithuania worked without a clear timetable. The Lithuanian  Labor Exchange has this kind of information, but does not make  it public.    Experts assert that the unemployment rate is actually three  times higher than officially reported. The discrepancies between  the fictional official statistics and the real ones can be  explained by the unacknowledged existence of reduced work weeks,  unpaid vacations, and other such tactics.    Compared to November 1, the number of people on enforced  vacations has increased by 1.1 times, because they work less  than a full week, or less than a full day, because the employer  lacks raw materials or fuel, it is impossible to sell the  products or there are no orders for them, many firms are not  profitable, or their accounts are in a state of disorder.    Most commonly, the under employment of employees can be seen  in industry (91.4 percent). Things are considerably better in  transportation (4.4 percent), construction (2 percent), and  agriculture (1.7 Percent).  <H5>  The rural labor exchanges </H5>   In the opinion of J. Adomaitis, senior scientific associate  of the Agrarian Economics Institute, by the year 2000 the rural  population will decline by 1.5 percent, and the working  population by 6.5 percent. Hidden unemployment will continue to  flourish in the countryside, for people will find it impossible  to make a living on a 2-3 hectare piece of land. The situation  will be aggravated by a shift in commuting flows--about 23,000  women used to work in the cities.    Since transportation has become more expensive, people want  to work closer to home. Ex-agricultural experts would like to  continue to work in their specialties, which will cause the  supply of labor in the countryside to exceed demand by that much  more. There will be a real threat of the migration of the rural  population to the cities.    In the opinion of J. Adomaitis, rural employment offices  should seek out the unemployed, and arrange employment for them  as close to their homes as possible. Only a privately  capitalized, government-supported rural labor exchange could  accomplish this.  <H3>  What are the tens of thousands who are not employed, not in  school, and not registered anywhere, doing? </H3>   J. Jagminas, Director of the Vilnius Labor Exchange,  believes  that in the capital there are 366,400 gainfully employed  individuals. Only 285,000 are insured by "Sodra." Of these,  190,800 work in the public sector, and 94,100 in the private  sector--69,800 in corporations or closed stock companies, 11,400  in agricultural companies, and 4,800 in privately held  companies. Public organizations employ 4,300 people.    About 79,500 inhabitants of Vilnius officially pay no taxes  of any kind, said J. Jagminas. He also asserted that in Vilnius  alone, there are about 32,400 people who do not have jobs, do  not go to school, and are not registered with the Labor  Exchange. In other words, are there as many unemployed in  Vilnius alone as the official figures say there are in the whole  country?    The director of the Vilnius Labor Exchange thinks that most  of the large firms in the capital are headed for bankruptcy.  Officials of the aforementioned offices do not want to give to  the Labor Exchanges any data on their plans to lay off  employees, for future partners might not want to have anything  to do with a company that has many laid off employees.     <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-013C-88A>             Dynamics of Unemployment in Lithuania (1991 - 1 Dec </FIG></p>

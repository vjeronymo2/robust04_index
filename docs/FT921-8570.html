			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE BRITISH Aerospace will report on Wednesday its preliminary results for the year to December 1991, which the City expects will show a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 85m against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 376m a year earlier. The loss will include heavy exceptional costs to cover the defence, commercial aircraft, motor vehicles and property group's restructuring programme. The company said at the time of its flopped Pounds 432m rights issue last autumn that it expected pre-tax profits before exceptional items of at least Pounds 150m. The exceptional items which will lead to an overall loss include a charge of about Pounds 250m to cover rationalisation costs, a Pounds 45m extraordinary charge to cover the withdrawal of its Rover car subsidiary from the US last year, and a gain of Pounds 15m on the sale of the company's shareholding in SD-Scicon. The company is expected to maintain its final dividend. Dalgety kicks off the reporting season in food manufacturing today. The sector's results will be scrutinised particularly closely this time for signs of how far weaker demand and price-cutting at retail level are being passed on to suppliers. Extensive rationalisation and cost-cutting in the past two years have done much to improve Dalgety's competitive position. However, this week's interim figures are expected to show only a modest increase. Analysts are looking to between Pounds 52m and Pounds 55m at the pre-tax level, compared with Pounds 51.7m last time. Glaxo's interim results on Thursday will also be watched closely. They are the first to include sales of several new drugs that will determine whether the company's phenomenal growth during the 1980s is to continue. The potential blockbusters are Zofran, to control sickness during cancer chemotherapy, and Imigran, a migraine drug. If first half sales of Imigran are close to the Pounds 50m predicted by BZW, it will be on the way to becoming one of the world's handful of Pounds 1bn-a-year megadrugs. BZW is forecasting a top-of-the-range Pounds 730m pre-tax profit for the first half, against Pounds 617m last year. Smith New Court is among the lowest forecasts, at Pounds 680m. Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest package holiday company, is expected to report on Wednesday full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m, compared with Pounds 15.3m in 1990. Of particular interest will be any statement on the current year's trading and whether February bookings for the summer are maintaining January's high volumes.

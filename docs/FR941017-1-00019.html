Special attention should be directed to the site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this chapter. The assessment must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain an analysis and evaluation of the major structures, systems and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components of the facility which bear significantly on the acceptability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the site under the site evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter, assuming that the facility will be operated at the ultimate power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level which is contemplated by the applicant. With respect to operation at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the projected initial power level, the applicant is required to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as the information required by this paragraph, in support of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for a construction permit, or a design approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A description and safety assessment of the site and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety assessment of the facility.

The following power reactor design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics and proposed operation will be taken into consideration by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to the design of the reactor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of accidental release of radioactive materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release of radioactive material to the environment can occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special attention must be directed to plant design features intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents.

The applicant shall perform an evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and analysis of the postulated fission product release, using the expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission product cleanup systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents, together with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable site characteristics, including site meteorology, to evaluate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offsite radiological consequences. Site characteristics must comply with part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 of this chapter. The evaluation must determine that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental events.

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / US plans to unite bank watchdogs The US Treasury yesterday outlined plans to consolidate the four federal bank supervisory agencies into a single Federal Banking Commission. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said the proposal would carry out the administration's mandate to make the economy function more smoothly by 'eliminating a confusing and duplicative regulatory structure to improve efficiency and decision-making'. Writing in the Washington Post, Mr Bentsen said the overlapping supervisory responsibilities of the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision were decades out of date. 'It is a drag on the economy, a headache for our financial services industry and a source of friction within our government. It must be replaced,' he said. While the Comptroller regulates banks with a national charter, banks with a state charter are monitored by their local supervisory agencies. But state chartered banks are also supervised by the Fed if they belong to the Federal Reserve System, and by the FDIC if they do not. Bank holding companies and foreign banks also come under the Fed, while savings and loan institutions are mostly covered by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Mr Bentsen pointed out that a bank holding company today might well include among its affiliates a state-chartered bank, a nationally chartered bank and a thrift, and come under all four federal agencies. He said the Fed should retain its responsibilities for monetary policy and the payments system, while the FDIC should stay a deposit insurer. The Treasury has separately thrown its weight behind proposals to allow banks to open branches outside their home states, but this measure was blocked in the Senate last week when Republicans boycotted a meeting called to draft the legislation. Congress has finally passed a measure to provide funds for the Resolution Trust Corporation to enable it to complete the mopping up of bankrupt savings and loan institutions. A vote in the House of Representatives early yesterday morning provided Dollars 18.3bn (Pounds 12.2bn) for the S&amp;L bailout. For more than a year the RTC has been unable to shut down failed S&amp;Ls because of Congress's reluctance to approve necessary funding.</p>

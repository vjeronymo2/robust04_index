			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Jia Yong (6328 3057) and Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 </F> 2429)]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- Since the beginning of  the new year, a group of leading cadres of the large units under  the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have been staying with  selected grass-roots units to show the concern of their officers  and men and to help solve practical problems.    Going down to grass-roots units to conduct investigations  and  studies is a regular task to which the Central Military  Commission has asked all high-ranking military cadres to attach  importance. High-ranking cadres of the Army have visited  islands, companies, and border areas to discover problems,  analyze problems, solve problems, attain a thorough  understanding of construction at basic-level units, and guide  reform and construction there under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and his thought on Army building in the new  period. To meet the objective needs of establishing a socialist  market economic structure and the objective needs of Army  building in China, in the past year the leadership of the three  general departments of the Army and the various services under  the major military regions have begun to carry out systematic  comprehensive investigations and studies aimed at increasing the  Army's combat capability: The General Staff Department has  focused on investigations in connection with the training reform  and administration of the Army in the new period, the General  Political Department has organized cadres to stay at selected  units to conduct studies on how to improve ideological work and  political work in organizational construction and military  training under the conditions of a market economy, and the  General Logistics Department has sent out seven investigation  and study groups. They have traveled 75,000 km to carry out a  thorough investigation of the basic living conditions and the  planning and administration of budgets and materials in military  units; the Air Force, the Navy, the Secondary Artillery Corps;  the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry  Commission, and the major military regions have carried out  investigations into the conditions of special projects involving  100 company leaders, 100 commanders, and soldiers who are only  sons or daughters. Their investigation and study achievements  have served as the basis for high-level, accurate, and  scientific decision-making by Army authorities. Being approved  by the Central Military Commission and revised by the three  general departments, the "Outline for Army Building in  Grass-Roots Units" was promulgated last year for trial  implementation by the whole Army. This programmatic document  for guiding grass-roots Army building for now and in the days to  come was produced on the basis of extensive investigations and  studies and of pooling the wisdom of the whole Army.    Taking the mass line, high-ranking cadres of the Army have  listened to the suggestions of officers and men and have helped  grass-roots units solve practical problems as if these were  their own problems. The General Logistics Department has  adopted measures such as giving preferential treatment to  basic-level units, especially those in remote, frontier, and  difficult areas; ensuring that their expenses are met and that  they are provided with work guidance; and making overall plans  and comprehensive efforts to focus on solving the problems of  drinking water, housing, heating, electricity, and medical care  for these areas. By the end of last year, more than 1 million  officers and men of the Army had moved into new, modern  barracks. Housing conditions for over 60 percent of the  officers and men of basic-level military units have improved.  From May to July last year, under the leadership of the General  Logistics Department, a medical team was sent to Xinjiang to  provide physical examinations to officers and men of companies  guarding the first line of defense in the border areas. The  Lanzhou and Jinan Military Regions have also sent office cadres  to companies to ensure that basic-level cadres can take liberty  on schedule. The Guangzhou Military Region has set up "military  baby stations" and "military baby schools" in Haikou and Nanning  to provide jobs for the children of cadres of units stationed on  islands and in border areas.    By going down to basic-level units to carry out  investigations and studies, high-ranking Army cadres have laid  down the foundation for overcoming subjectivism in work,  improving leadership style and office work style, and  consolidating and strengthening the Army. To cope with the  problems of too many emulation campaigns, registers, and forms  for statistical reports in the Army, the General Staff, General  Political, and General Logistics Departments recently issued a  joint circular on further streamlining the number of activities,  registers, and report forms in the Army. The circular clearly  states that in the future, leading organs at all levels should  not, in principle, convene on-the-spot meetings at military  units and that leading organs must reduce to the minimum the  number of forms for statistical reports used for the purpose of  keeping track of the situation. When such report forms are  needed, in general the basic- level units should not be required  to fill in the form themselves.</p>

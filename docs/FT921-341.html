			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Observer: Champagne stakes Is France's Veuve Clicquot champagne company better at picking Britain's business winners than the Guardian newspaper? Undoubtedly, to judge by the track records of the winners of Veuve Clicquot's business woman of the year, and the Guardian young business man awards. Admittedly, one or two of Veuve Clicquot's selections, such as Sock Shop's Sophie Mirman, have hit a rough patch. But the record does not match the Guardian's uncanny ability to tip future losers such as John Gunn, John Ashcroft, James Gulliver, George Davies et al. Sensibly, the newspaper has ditched the award. Although Body Shop's Anita Roddick could still spoil the Veuve Clicquot score-sheet, and Ann Burdus has not had a happy time as marketing director of Olympia and York's Canary Wharf, most of the winners over the last couple of decades have held onto their reputations. Mair Barnes, for example, has been doing an excellent job at Woolworths and Nestles' Gill Lewis has just been given a seat on the Pearson board. On Thursday the Veuve Clicquot judges try once again. While the Random Century publishers' boss Gail Rebuck would seem the front-runner, there is more to business than making loads of money. So Observer's preference is for Phyllis Cunningham, chief executive of leading cancer hospital, the Royal Marsden.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- China is drawing up  a seven-year plan for the expansion of its coal industry in a  bid to raise its coal output to 1.4 billion tons by the year  2000.    The plan, manifesting China's medium- and long-term strategy  in this sector, will be announced shortly, an official of the  Ministry of Coal Industry said today.    As the most important primary source of energy in China,  coal  accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's energy  consumption. In 1993 alone, China produced 1.14 billion tons of  coal, an increase of 25 million tons over 1992.    The output is expected to top 1.16 billion tons this year,  the ministry official said.    He said 1993 will be the crucial year for the coal industry  to complete the shift from a planned economy to a market  economy. The government is scheduled to lift all its control  over coal prices by the end of this year.    In order to be answerable to the market, he said, the major  state-owned coal mines will continue to maintain production in  line with demand as well as transportation capacity.    One of the principal goals of the industry this year will be  reducing production costs and improving labor efficiency, he  said. This necessitates the optimization of the coal mines.    Loss-making mines with no hope of making profits will be  shut  down, suspended or shifted to other lines of production, while  those with quality coal, good market access and high efficiency  will step up technological upgrading to increase their  production.    The product mix and the industrial structure will also be  streamlined, the official said, adding that efforts will be made  to pursue diversified operations.    The locally-run mines will be screened, with emphasis placed  on the construction of 100 top-priority coal-producing counties  and 15 coal-mining areas, the official said.    In an effort to speed up the construction of coal mines, the  ministry wooed other sectors to invest in the area, in light of  the principle of "He benefits who invests." It has already  extended a welcome to the industries of electrical power,  metallurgy, chemicals and transportation.    The ministry is also encouraging coastal regions to invest  in  coal-rich areas and foreign investors to form joint ventures and  cooperative coal mines.    China will be active in attracting more foreign funds and  introducing advanced equipment, technology and experts as well  as management experience from abroad to raise productivity.    He said that this year some of the major coal mines will be  licensed to handle exports, which stood at 18 million tons in  1993.</p>

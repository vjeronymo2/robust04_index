			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NO 'LIFETIME,' ROYALS OWNER SAYS  </P> <P> Royals co-owner Ewing Kauffman doesn't want to get saddled with the lifetime  contracts of some Kansas City players if he sells the team.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to guarantee them.  </P> <P> Period," Kauffman said in an interview published in today's Kansas City Star.  </P> <P> The club's other 50% owner, real estate developer Avron B. Fogelman, is  struggling financially and has proposed a deal for Kauffman to help bail him  out in exchange for Fogelman's share of the team.  </P> <P> First baseman George Brett, center fielder Willie Wilson and former Royals'  pitcher Dan Quisenberry have signed guaranteed lifetime contracts that include  real estate deals with Fogelman. Fogelman is obligated to pay any shortfall  arising from the real estate portion of the contracts. Fogelman's creditors  want him released from that obligation and replaced by Kauffman.  </P> <P> Kauffman told the newspaper, "That just doesn't make sense to me because I  don't know if I'll continue to own the Royals."  </P></p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour plays game of Paddy in the middle - Moves to curtail Ashdown's influence in a hung parliament EVEN before a single vote is cast, Labour's game plan for the last three days of campaigning is being carefully formulated to maximise the party's leverage in the event of a hung parliament. The aim is to stress a programme for government finely tuned to appeal to Liberal Democrats and calculated to create nightmarish difficulties for Mr Paddy Ashdown should he want to persuade his MPs to vote it down. Before April 9 the message to voters is that Labour can be trusted. As Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, told a London news conference yesterday, Labour's intention is to build a national consensus beyond party politics. 'We do not intend to reproduce the disastrous experience of the Thatcher government, in which the winner-takes-all attitude was thought to be justification for inflicting extremist policies, such as the poll tax,' he said. This consensual appeal is intended to counter the Conservatives' claim that a vote for anyone other than Mr Major is a vote for a radical Kinnock government. As one Labour strategist put it yesterday: 'We want not just to hold on to the votes of those who have come to us from the Lib Dems, but also to ensure that the Tory voters now going for Paddy Ashdown don't shift back.' But there is a another game also being played: a game of political chicken that begins just as soon as the votes are counted. If, as almost all the pundits currently expect, Labour were to be the largest party in a hung parliament, its first objective is to formulate a Queen's Speech that commands the widest possible support. Mr Ashdown has said he will order his MPs to vote down any Labour programme that does not offer immediate legislation to introduce electoral reform for the Commons. But will he really do so if Labour's legislative package is full of Liberal Democrat policy objectives? And, if he does, will his troops follow? Labour party strategists say Mr Kinnock will not seek any formal pact with the Liberal Democrats in these circumstances. He will, instead, try to create the conditions where Mr Ashdown is unable to persuade his Scots MPs to oppose Labour's programme. That process began last week when Labour outlined a Queens' Speech of which the flagship bill will be the legislation to create a Edinburgh parliament - exactly along the lines painstakingly hammered out with Scots Liberal Democrats in the Scottish convention. Other bills on such issues as Freedom of Information will also prove difficult for the Liberal Democrats to oppose, as will the increases in pensions and child benefit: all proposals broadly parallel to those in Mr Ashdown's manifesto. To muddy the water further, Mr Kinnock and his team stressed last week that they are going a long way down the electoral reform road. Without any prior commitments, they are promising to convert Professor Raymond Plant's working party on electoral systems into an all-party commission, to report within a year. Although Mr Kinnock has expressed a personal preference to put the commission's ultimate conclusions on reform to the public at a general election, he has raised the option of a referendum once a decision on the best electoral system is reached. As Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, put it last week, can the Liberal Democrats really reasonably expect more when so large a question is at issue? With Mr John Major and the Conservatives definitively ruling out any discussion of a revision of the first-past-the-post system - 'never, never, never' were the prime minister's words - the Liberal Democrats cannot possibly reach an accord with the Tories. If the Conservatives voted against Labour's Queen's Speech, the Liberal Democrats' might well have to decide whether to vote it down and force another election, or to abstain. Mr Kinnock's team believes that if Mr Ashdown demands that his MPs vote the speech down, many of his Scottish MPs will rebel - knowing that to be seen throwing out legislation for a Scottish parliament will destroy their chances in the subsequent election. Publicly, Mr Ashdown has been categorical in his rejection of anything short of legislation in the first session for electoral reform. Even were this to be on offer, serious complications would arise - not least in agreeing rapidly what form of proportional representation should be adopted. Labour is convinced that the Liberal Democrats' dogmatic stance is a bluff as voters would take a fierce revenge on any party that forced another election immediately. If a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party is the election's outcome, it will not be long before Mr Ashdown's real hand has to be put down on the table.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc unit drops 21% RHONE-Poulenc Rorer, the majority-owned pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the French group Rhone-Poulenc, yesterday reported third-quarter earnings down 21 per cent to Dollars 102.7m from Dollars 130.5m. The results were affected by a slowdown in underlying sales and exchange rates. RPR is important for Rhone-Poulenc which is being privatised. Analysts expect the French group's healthcare business to contribute nearly 90 per cent of its operating profits this year. RPR's turnover fell 8 per cent to Dollars 960m from Dollars 1.05bn. The company said the US dollar was 17 per cent stronger against the French franc during the third quarter last year. About 25 per cent of the subsidiary's sales are in France. Excluding currencies, sales were up 3 per cent compared with the same period last year. Higher turnover in France was offset by a fall in sales in Germany and Italy, following healthcare reforms. Gross margins improved nearly 1 per cent on the third quarter last year thanks to reduced operating expenses and a reduction in interest charges. Net interest charges fell to Dollars 10.1m from Dollars 29.3m. Earnings per share fell to 51 cents from 66 cents for the same quarter last year. Without exceptional items in 1992 and this year, earnings per share for both third quarters would have been 62 cents.</p>

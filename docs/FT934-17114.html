			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Shanks shares fall as director retires SHARES IN Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company fell 8 per cent to 156p yesterday following the surprise news that Mr Alastair Fowler, finance director, has taken early retirement with effect from the end of September. The share price fall follows the downgrading of profits forecasts by a number of brokers after visits to the company last week before it went into its close period. Mr Roger Hewitt, chief executive, said that Mr Fowler had been discussing early retirement for a number of months and that there was nothing sinister behind the announcement. Shanks' share price has halved since a high of 319p in September 1991 when the waste sector still attracted a residue of its late 1980s premium rating. In January that year Shanks bought Rechem, the hazardous waste disposal company, but was widely thought to have paid a full price. Then in March 1991, Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, placed its 11 per cent stake in the company when the shares were trading at the equivalent of 278p. In late September that year, Rechem issued a warning that it would not be able to meet its own ambitious earnings growth targets. Mr Hewitt said yesterday that Mr Fowler, a Scot, was feeling the pressure of commuting between his family in Glasgow and Aylesbury, where the group had increasingly moved its corporate centre since the retirement of Mr Peter Runciman as chairman last year. In June Shanks reported a 62 per cent fall in full year profits, from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 10.2m, after heavy losses in its construction division. The group was forced to make a Pounds 19.3m provision to cover reorganisation of the division. 'There is no other issue lurking behind this announcement', Mr Hewitt said. The problems in the construction division, 'may have hastened the desire (of Mr Fowler) to go early', he said. Some analysts wondered why the company had given no warning of Mr Fowler's departure and had not named a permanent successor. Mr Michael Rundle, commercial manager, has been appointed acting finance director.</p>

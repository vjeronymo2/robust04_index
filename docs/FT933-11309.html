			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Elton John records sold for Pounds 181,694 more than 25,000 LPs and 23,000 singles - for Pounds 181,694 yesterday, comfortably exceeding the Pounds 150,000 estimate. A private collector from St Louis in the US bought it by secret tender, and the proceeds are to go to the Terrence Higgins Trust, the Aids charity. The records range from obscure 1950s blues singers through soul labels of the 1970s and limited-edition Beatles albums to jazz fusion. The same buyer paid Pounds 45,500 for John Lennon's original manuscript lyrics for the song 'I am the Walrus'. The main lot in the auction of rock and roll memorabilia was a recently recovered archive of Terry Spencer's 1963-64 Beatles photographs. The 5,000 black and white images were sold, with full copyright, for Pounds 91,700 to Bloomsbury Publishing, which plans to use them as the basis for an illustrated book. The Sotheby's auction totalled Pounds 441,697 and was over 83 per cent sold by value.</p>

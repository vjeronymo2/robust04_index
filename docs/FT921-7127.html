			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Far right shows strength in Nice THE FRENCH centre-right UDF political group secured a narrow victory in the second round of voting in the local by-election in Nice on Sunday. Its candidate, Mrs Marie-Jeanne Murcia (pictured left casting her vote), defeated Mr Jacques Peyrat of the extreme right-wing National Front with 50.65 per cent of the vote to Mr Peyrat's 49.35 per cent. The result was warmly welcomed by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, and by other mainstream French political leaders. However, the closeness of the result confirms recent indications that the National Front is gaining ground and can be expected to do well in next month's regional elections, especially in the south of France. The Front's leader, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, was elated, saying that Mr Peyrat had held his own against 'a shameful alliance' of conservatives, Socialists and Communists. He urged voters nationwide to support 'the party of France' next month. Nice has traditionally been a right-wing stronghold, and in the first round of voting a week earlier, Mr Peyrat had surged to a spectacular lead with nearly 38 per cent, whereas the traditional conservative vote was split between rival candidates. For Sunday's run-off all the mainstream parties, including the Socialists and Communists, called on the voters to rally behind Mrs Murcia against the National Front. In the final tally, the abstention rate fell from 64 per cent to 55 per cent.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / After-effects of 'bubble era' still hinder Japan JAPAN'S economy is still hindered by the after-effects of the 'bubble era', which are likely to lead to a weaker than expected recovery, the Economic Planning Agency warned yesterday in its annual white paper on the economy. But the agency's confidence that the economy has hit bottom was apparently challenged yesterday by its director-general, Mr Osamu Takatori, who noted that recent retail and production statistics have dipped and provide no reason for optimism. The white paper, subtitled 'What we learned from the bubble', examines the longer-term consequences of the easy money era of the late 1980s, and suggests that the government should have been more aware of the danger of frenetic speculation and fast-rising asset prices. In the report, the EPA is generally more optimistic than its director-general, partly because it was compiled during May and June, when there were signs of an imminent recovery, including an increase in housing starts and a halt in the build-up of inventory. The white paper suggests that the recovery will be evident late this year or early next year, but concedes that the upturn 'will likely remain more moderate than past recovery phases, due to sluggish consumption and business investment'. That judgment was supported by a 4.8 per cent fall in sales at large Japanese retail stores in June, compared to a year earlier. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday that June marked the 13th consecutive month of decreases, the largest period of decline since the collection of figures began in 1953. Meanwhile, the Cement Association of Japan said yesterday cement output in June fell 5.5 per cent following 14 months of increases. The association blamed the decrease on weak private construction orders, which also led to a 20.1 per cent rise in inventories, now at a record high. The EPA was hopeful that a 'decline in the propensity to consume seems to have come to a halt', though it conceded that land prices, which have fallen an estimated 30-40 per cent in the last three years 'still have a downward trend'. The white paper also notes some of the social costs of the bubble era. It said the distribution of assets in Japan was made less equal, and the excesses 'lowered the relative value of return for labour'. On Japan's politically-sensitive current account surplus, which rose from 1.1 per cent of GNP in 1990 to 3.3 per cent last year, the EPA conceded that the bubble had distorted the initial fall in the surplus. But foreign investment in the late 1980s had also altered the country's trade structure. The EPA recommends that the surplus be reduced by the stimulation of domestic demand, and the creation of an open market, while the surplus should be circulated 'in a way that would contribute to the development of the world economy'.</p>

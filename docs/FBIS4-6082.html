			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] will assist the six ASEAN nations in developing  industrial technology. First, a plan for cooperation will be  worked out to introduce the TQC [total quality control] system,  which is a typical method of production management adopted by  Japanese companies. Then, the system will be put into practice  in April 1995 according to the plan. Moreover, joint studies on  industrial technology will be promoted with Indonesia, Malaysia,  and Thailand, respectively. By assisting the development of  manufacturing industries in the ASEAN nations, the MITI will  establish a complementary system for Japanese companies and  companies of these nations.    A standardization and quality control committee composed of  representatives from MITI and quality control agencies in the  ASEAN nations will sign an agreement on this cooperative plan as  early as this month. According to the agreement, the Japanese  Government and the committee will work out a program to  introduce Japan's TQC system to the ASEAN nations; the program  will be implemented for five years from April 1995; seminars  will be held by inviting company executives and production  managers from those nations to Japan; and Japanese technical  experts will be sent to those nations to give instruction on  quality control.    As for bilateral cooperation in developing industrial  technology, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have been  initially selected as partners. MITI and these nations will  exchange information on policies of technological development.  Furthermore, joint studies will be promoted on selected  subjects by Japan's national research institutes and institutes  in these nations.</p>

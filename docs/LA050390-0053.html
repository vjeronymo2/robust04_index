			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: NO-KNEAD BREAD NEEDS LESS HEAT  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: We have baked this bread many times. The taste is good, but when  we cut it, the slice crumbles. What are we doing wrong? It is easy to make --  no kneading.  </P> <P> LILLIAN, Chicago  </P> <P> NO-KNEAD BREAD  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups milk  </P> <P> 1/2 cup shortening  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups water  </P> <P> 3 (1-ounce) cakes yeast  </P> <P> 3 eggs, beaten  </P> <P> 9 cups sifted flour  </P> <P> Scald milk. Add shortening, sugar and salt and stir until sugar and salt are  dissolved. Cool mixture to lukewarm by adding water.  </P> <P> Add yeast and mix, then add eggs. Gradually add flour and mix until dough is  well blended. Place in large greased bowl and cover (dough will be softer than  kneaded dough). Let rise in warm place until about doubled.  </P> <P> Punch down dough and shape into 3 loaves on lightly floured board. Place loaves  in greased loaf pans, cover and let rise again for about 1 hour or until  doubled. Bake loaves in at 400 degrees 45 to 50 minutes. Makes 3 loaves.  </P> <P> DEAR LILLIAN: After making the recipe your way, I had a similar problem with  the bread crumbling. I also found it cumbersome trying to deal with such large  quantities of ingredients, so when I worked on the revision I made it one loaf  at a time, which is much easier.  </P> <P> I used nonfat milk to lower the fat and cholesterol, whole-wheat flour for  added flavor and nutrients, and reduced the fat, sugar and salt. To eliminate  the cholesterol in the egg yolks, I used only the whites of the eggs.  </P> <P> After making these changes, I tried making the bread again, and still wasn't  satisfied with the resulting texture. Then I decided to try letting it rise  only once, which was better but not perfect. Finally I combined one rising with  a lower oven temperature and the result was wonderful both in taste and  texture. This bread is also fabulous toasted for breakfast.  </P> <P> EASY NO-KNEAD BREAD  </P> <P> 1/2 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup water  </P> <P> 1 package dry yeast  </P> <P> 2 egg whites  </P> <P> 3 cups whole-wheat flour  </P> <P> Scald milk. Remove from heat and add margarine, sugar and salt. Stir until  margarine melts. Add water and mix well. Add yeast and mix well, then set  aside.  </P> <P> Lightly beat egg whites in large mixing bowl. Add milk mixture and mix well.  Add flour, 1 cup at time, and mix until well blended and dough forms ball.  </P> <P> Place dough in bowl which has been sprayed with non-stick vegetable coating and  cover with towel. Allow to rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  </P> <P> Lightly flour dough so hands don't stick. Punch dough down and form into  loaf-shaped roll. Place dough in 8x4-inch loaf pan which has been sprayed with  non-stick vegetable coating and bake in at 350 degrees 55 minutes. Makes 1  loaf, 16 slices.  </P> <P> Note: Oat bran may be used in place of flour when forming loaf if desired.  </P> <P> Each slice contains approximately:  </P> <P> Original Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 114  </P> <P> Cholesterol: 18 mg  </P> <P> Fat: 3 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 285 mg  </P> <P> Revised Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 100  </P> <P> Cholesterol: Negligible  </P> <P> Fat: 2 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 100 mg  </P></p>

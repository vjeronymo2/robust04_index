Naumchik  have held a news conference at the Belarusian Supreme Soviet.  In the words of S. Naumchik, "despite the resistance of certain  circles," U.S. President Clinton will visit Kuropaty [burial  site of thousands of victims murdered by Soviet security police  in the 1930's] on 16 January and meet with BNF Chairman Z.  Paznyak. "The initiative to meet came from the American side,"  Z. Paznyak specified. The parliamentary opposition leader also  voiced harsh criticism of Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman  Shushkevich for signing the CIS Collective Security Treaty. He  accused Shushkevich of betraying the national interests of  Belarus. Speaking on the issue of unifying the Belarusian and  Russian monetary systems, Z. Paznyak noted that Russia is  "waging economic war against Belarus," and that the last  agreement concluded by Yeltsin, Kebich, and Chernomyrdin means  that "our country has surrendered." At the news conference,  parliamentary opposition activists denounced Belarus' entry into  NATO. "Only a policy of neutrality and the support of European  states will help Belarus survive," Z. Paznyak emphasized. In  addition, he said he doubted that the elections set for this  spring will actually take place.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Barclays to review chairman and chief executive joint role MR ANDREW BUXTON, chief executive of Barclays Bank, promised yesterday that the bank would respond to shareholder pressure to split the roles of chairman and chief executive by devising a new senior management structure. Mr Buxton said it would alter its corporate governance 'in the long-term'. This might mean appointing a new chief executive after he becomes chairman in January, or giving the power to dismiss the chairman to a committee of non-executive directors. 'In the long-term, we will take notice of what shareholders are saying, and we will take steps to split the job,' Mr Buxton said in an interview. He said institutional investors had signalled acceptance of this in meetings with the bank. He said he could not specify when a decision would be made. Controversy over the dual role had only emerged in the past two months, and a company the size and complexity of Barclays could not alter its management structure 'without thinking through the ramifications'. The disclosure follows criticism of Barclays' decision to combine the roles by a number of institutional investors. The controversy has grown with speculation that the bank could be forced to cut its final dividend because of poor results. The combining of the roles of chairman and chief executive at Barclays has been made more controversial by debate over Sir Adrian Cadbury's report on British corporate governance, which was published last week. An early version of the report said it would be preferable for companies not to combine the roles. The published report calls for 'a clearly accepted division of responsibilities . . . which will ensure a balance of power and authority'. Mr Buxton said he was 'unlikely' to become chief executive under a new chairman. But the bank would consider a suggestion from investors that he might become executive chairman reporting to a committee of non-executives. 'I think that kind of thing might be quite possible,' he said. The bank had to consider the best way of altering its proposed structure under which four heads of divisions - three of them titled 'chief executive' - will report to him. Mr Buxton said the bank had already started to put in place new strategies to restore its profitability over the next five years. But he believed that it would take two years before it achieved the changes that he wanted to implement. 'I think 1993 is going to be a year of recovery, I do not think it is going to be a year of prosperity,' he said. The bank was likely to have 'relatively high provisions' in the next financial year in spite of signs of economic recovery. Mr Buxton said the bank would consider the likely pattern of future profitability in deciding whether to maintain its final dividend. Imry refinancing, Page 18</p>

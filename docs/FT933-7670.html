			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Ulster company sells Arab headgear to the Mideast A NORTHERN IRELAND textile company has won an order to supply traditional Arab headgear to a distribution company serving Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Dubai and Bahrain. Lintrend, based at Larne, has adapted a technology it developed for producing wrinkle-free linen to cotton fabrics, and is to use it to make wash-and-wear cotton yashmaghs, ghuttras and thobes - respectively coloured headgear, plain white headgear and full-length white gowns. Mr Fred Sloan, managing director, said: 'The material maintains a permanent lustre like silk. It can be machine-washed, does not need ironing, does not fade with washing and keeps its appearance throughout its life. It looks like a million dollars.' He said his company had developed the technology to produce crease-resistant linen, 'but there has been strong market resistance. People seem not to believe it is linen if it doesn't crease.' Looking for an alternative market, he applied the technology to cotton fabrics, and found that there was a demand for non-crease cotton gar-ments in the Middle East. The initial Pounds 1.8m order will be to supply the ghuttra and yashmagh, and to then start producing the thobe, the full-length shirt which is worn throughout the Middle East. Mr Sloan said that the thobe will be made from a mixture of cotton and molinease, a natural cellulose fibre. He added: 'Unlike artificial fibres, this mixture will dissipate heat and will bring a big improvement in comfort for the wearer.' He plans to have orders worth Pounds 9m a year within five years, and to increase his Larne workforce from 26 to 300.</p>

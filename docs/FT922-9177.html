			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Stores to fight credit card rises THE UK's five largest supermarket chains have set up a joint committee to fight increased charges on credit and debit card transactions imposed by the 'Big Four' high street banks. The retailers  - Asda, Gateway, Safeway, J. Sainsbury and Tesco  - said yesterday they had already made a formal complaint to the Office of Fair Trading about what they claim are unfair trading practices by the banks. The chief executives of all four banks were sent letters on Wednesday, telling them of the retailers' desire for an urgent meeting of the banks, either together or separately, with the new joint committee in the next 30 days to reach an amicable solution. Mr Derek Henson, Sainsbury's finance director and chairman of the committee, said yesterday that the retailers were particularly upset by the doubling of the charges they pay on Switch, the electronic debit card system set up in 1988 by National Westminster, Midland and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Although the exact charges each retailer pays are confidential, Mr Henson said these appeared to have doubled to between 8p and 10p per transaction, because of the introduction of a 4p fee paid by the retailer's bank to the cardholder's bank. 'We don't mind paying what we consider to be reasonable processing charges, but we are hoping to learn from the banks at the meeting what these new charges are for,' Mr Henson said. He said that if the new charges were for the costs of fraud, they should be absorbed by the banks and not passed on to retailers. 'We really believe that the banks work together and are in concert,' Mr Henson said, adding that the retailers expect this fact would be uncovered by the OFT if it launched an investigation. The OFT said last night it had been aware of the retailers' complaints for some time and was engaged in routine preliminary investigation procedures. An official said the OFT would have to decide whether or not the retailers' decision to set up a joint committee to talk to the banks counted as a restrictive practice, which needed to be registered. 'It is difficult to see how a meeting with a small group of powerful retailers would be in the interests of consumers,' said Mr Richard Reay-Smith, the chief executive of Barclaycard.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu </F> by Katarzyna Kolodziejczyk; place and date not given:  "Irrational Partner" -- questions published in boldface]    [Text] [Kolodziejczyk] How serious, in political and  military terms, is the situation on the Korean peninsula?    [Han Sung-chu] The situation is no more dangerous that it  was before. Of course, considerable forces on both sides --  North and South Korea -- are still facing each other. However,  since the day the nuclear crisis began, we have not observed any  extraordinary movements by the North Korean Army. Thus, we have  no reason to expect any provocation on their part right now.  Therefore, on the 15th day of this month, just as in any month,  routine civil defense exercises were organized, the only  difference being that this time they were held nationwide.    [Kolodziejczyk] How do you think the situation will develop?    [Han Sung-chu] The development of the situation will now  depend on what steps are taken by the UN Security Council over  the next two or three months. During this time, a decision will  be made as to whether the Security Council will pass resolutions  concerning North Korea, and if so, when. There is a certain  hope that the North will nonetheless continue its cooperation  with international organizations and other states. Even though  it left the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it did  not expel the UN inspectors, who were sent to control its  nuclear program there.    [Kolodziejczyk] In such a situation, is the South Korean  Government going to focus its efforts on strengthening its own  defense capabilities, that is, military capabilities, or will it  focus on possibilities for resolving the crisis through peaceful  means?    [Han Sung-chu] I consider it vital and indispensable to act  in both directions. Of course, our primary intention is to  maintain the peace; however, we can see the poor results of our  talks, including those initiated by the Security Council.    [Kolodziejczyk] If the North had so desired, it could have  seriously threatened South Korea much earlier, with its  short-and medium-range missiles, by destroying your nuclear  power plants and some of your military equipment. However, this  is not what happened. What are the reasons, then, that the  North's holding of these weapons is seen as so dangerous?    [Han Sung-chu] There are at least three reasons why nuclear  weapons in the hands of North Korea constitute a real threat.    First, because we are dealing with a regime that is very  reckless and determined, if not unpredictable. For this reason  alone we cannot rule out the possibility of the North's  employing nuclear weapons -- if it had such weapons at its  disposal.    Second, even if they do not actually use the weapons, they  may use them for blackmailing purposes -- not only us, but  neighboring states as well; they would also be fully aware of  the fact that this would entail destroying their entire system  and themselves as well. At the same time, the possibility of a  provocation through the use of conventional means has increased,  which is a very important issue.    Third, if nuclear weapons were manufactured in the North,  there would arise the very important problem of nuclear  proliferation. Not only in our region, but across the world. In  other words, we would witness a threat not only in the region,  but also in the world; I must admit, though, that for us this  threat is more acute than for the rest of the world.    [Kolodziejczyk] Do you not think that direct talks between  the North and the South in the first phase of the crisis would  be a much quicker and more effective method of resolving this  problem, as opposed to third countries getting involved?    [Han Sung-chu] We have always advocated dialogue with  North Korea. As is known, we even reached some kind of an  agreement with them in the talks in the autumn of 1992; those  talks concerned, among other issues, the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons. We also established a joint committee.  Unfortunately, North Korea has so far not wanted to hold any  further negotiations with us. It does insist, however, on  direct dialogue with the United States. Now that it has  withdrawn from the IAEA, it does not want to talk with them  either. I would like to offer assurances that as far as we are  concerned, we have done as much as possible, and will do as much  as possible in the future to find a resolution to this problem  through dialogue.    [Kolodziejczyk] Why do you think the North has been avoiding  direct talks with the South?    [Han Sung-chu] I think they are afraid of the Berlin Wall  syndrome. That is, they are afraid that talks with us, or any  contacts, including exchanges, might encroach considerably on  their system. This, in turn, might cause consequences similar  to those triggered by the collapse of the Berlin Wall. In such  a situation, both North Korea's system and representatives would  lose the justification for their continued political existence.    [Kolodziejczyk] Some oppositional parties in your country  claim that the position of the United States on the issue of  controlling the North's nuclear program was considerably  exaggerated. These circles suppose that in the context of the  current nuclear crisis, the interests of South Korea may not be  identical with those of the United States.    [Han Sung-chu] This supposition is totally contrary to  reality. The patient and systematic policy of the United  States, the policy of constantly persuading North Korea to agree  to hold talks, refutes this opinion. Two rounds of talks have  already been held. If the North wanted, it could certainly, and  easily, meet the conditions, which, in turn, would be the  foundation of serious political dialogue. In the meantime, this  country ruined the foundations of such a dialogue by withdrawing  from the IAEA.    Now, the criticism of the U.S. stand has its origins, first  of all, in the United States itself. The opposition in the  United States is not unanimous on this issue, not to mention  that some of Bill Clinton's policy statements concerning the  Korean crisis are far less critical than some people would like  them to be. For the sake of clarity, I would like to add that  the policy of our government concerning this issue is the same  as the policy of the United States.    [Kolodziejczyk] Some political observers have suggested that  the goal of the mission by former President Carter was to  persuade the North to give up its nuclear program in exchange  for diplomatic recognition by the United States, in particular.  Would your government be willing to reach a compromise on this  issue?    [Han Sung-chu] Jimmy Carter did not go to Pyongyang to  negotiate anything, and certainly not the issue of North Korea's  return to the international political scene. However, we will  very seriously consider every suggestion that Carter brings back  with him. I would like to stress, however, that any suggestion  on the part of North Korea should be of a more formal nature.  We must be certain of what is going on; we must also be sure of  the intentions of any possible proposals.    [Kolodziejczyk] What is your evaluation of the stand taken  by China? This country has clearly stated that it does not  accept any sanctions directed against the North.    [Han Sung-chu] China has played a very serious role in this  crisis. So far the role has been rather constructive. China  has stated quite unequivocally that it is against the nuclear  program of the North; it tried its own methods to persuade the  North to conduct a dialogue and, first of all, maintain the  clarity of the nuclear program. I think that at the forum of  the UN Security Council -- the issue of the resolution is still  open -- China's stand will depend on how North Korea responds to  the international actions. If the North is inclined to  cooperate, then I believe there will be no reason for the  Security Council to pass any resolutions. However, if the North  rejects such a possibility, then I believe China will not be  able to continue supporting North Korea at such an important  forum.    [Kolodziejczyk] Would your government accept the concept  of an international conference addressing the situation on the  Korean Peninsula, as was once proposed by Russia?    [Han Sung-chu] On principle we are not against multilateral  talks; however, we doubt the usefulness of such talks if North  Korea does not agree to satisfy the fundamental conditions of  the dialogue. This is why we are skeptical about the idea of  holding such a conference.    [Kolodziejczyk] What is your evaluation of Japan's position  on the Korean crisis? As is known, many Korean workers in Japan  have family in North Korea.    [Han Sung-chu] It must be admitted that Japan was very upset  by the present situation. We have close relations with this  country which make it possible for us to hold constant  consultations among the three states: our country, the United  States, and Japan. This country has so far consistently  supported the idea of the Security Council's passing a  resolution if North Korea continues to refuse to cooperate with  the international body.    [Kolodziejczyk] In the situation that has developed now, has  the idea of uniting both Koreas become far more remote, or is it  the other way around?    [Han Sung-chu] It is difficult to say anything about it. A  similar situation was observed after the collapse of the Berlin  Wall. At that time, no one was able to predict that the  unification of Germany would come almost automatically after the  first breaches of the Berlin Wall were made. Thus, we cannot  say anything specific on this issue as well. Some people think  that the unification of both Koreas will occur next year, others  -- in two years' time...    [Kolodziejczyk] North Korea is to a considerable degree  isolated from the rest of the world. Do the government and  people of South Korea know how their countrymen on the other  side of the 38th parallel are living? Do they know, for  instance, whether -- just as in South -- they want to unite,  and, if it came to an open conflict, whether they would shoot at  their countrymen from the South?    [Han Sung-chu] Well, they have already done this. The  Korean war in 1950 cost both sides a lot of blood. However,  almost 40 years have passed since that time and the situation in  the world has changed dramatically. For example, there is no  longer any Soviet Union. Today the North -- unlike the South --  is experiencing a difficult economic situation. Apart from  that, our defense capabilities in the South are so great today  that they would have to act irrationally and be totally  desperate to attempt any provocation against us.    However, it is true that we simply do not know many details  of the lives of our countrymen in the North. Generally, we know  as much as the world does -- that the people complain about  living standards -- and we know the methods by which the  authorities manage the economy. I believe, however, that the  North Koreans know something; they secretly listen to our radio  broadcasts... Even the most closed society is not totally  hermetic, not to say watertight. I think that the Koreans from  the North realize the differences between themselves and the  rest of the world.</p>

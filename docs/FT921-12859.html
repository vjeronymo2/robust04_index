			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Westfield Trust registers record earnings WESTFIELD Trust, Australia's largest listed property trust, has shrugged off depressed property markets and reported record earnings for 1991. The Sydney-based regional shopping centre owner lifted earnings by almost 10 per cent to ADollars 121m (USDollars 93m) for 1991 from ADollars 110.3m a year earlier. The trust is maintaining its unbroken record of distribution rise since its inception in 1982 with a 20.01 cents pay-out per unit, up from 19.62 cents. Mr Frank Lowy, chairman, said yesterday that 10 of the trust's 16 properties were re-valued during the year, showing a net rise of ADollars 89.2m. This contrasted sharply with falls in valuations for many other types of property and lifted net asset backing of the trust's securities to ADollars 2.30 each from ADollars 2.21. The trust's properties had a vacancy rate of just 1 per cent and total sales rose 6 per cent to ADollars 2.54 m in the period. 'Westfield Trust is in a sound financial position, with no net borrowings at balance date,' he said. 'The underlying strength of regional shopping centres has become more apparent in these difficult times, emphasising their status as the premier form of real estate investment. 'Provided there is no further deterioration in the economic situation, directors believe that the distribution to unitholders will be maintained in 1992.'</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Natal emergency fails its first test South Africa's newly declared state of emergency in Natal province failed its first serious test yesterday when security forces were unable to disarm thousands of Zulu royalists who marched through a northern town carrying spears and clubs in defiance of emergency regulations. Police said it was too dangerous to disarm the marchers, despite the fact they were acting illegally. 'We could not disarm them without bloodshed,' Police Major Margaret Kruger said of the march in the coastal town of Empangeni. The incident raises questions over whether the state of emergency can reduce violence in Natal and the KwaZulu black 'homeland' which it includes. Police said 85 people had died in the five days since the emergency was introduced. Addressing the march, which ended peacefully, Mr Zenzele Phakathi, an Inkatha Freedom party official, urged marchers to defy the emergency. Doubts over the efficacy of the emergency highlight the need for an urgent political solution in Natal, due to be the subject of a peace summit on Friday between the country's main political leaders. Meanwhile, it was announced yesterday that international mediation, aimed at resolving the country's constitutional dispute, is to be delayed until next week. The ANC and Inkatha have yet to agree on the terms of mediation, casting doubt on prospects for rapid progress. A South African tripartite committee said yesterday that it would be impossible to hold elections in KwaZulu under the current conditions of violence and fear, agencies report from Johannesburg. The committee, consisting of the Independent Electoral Commission and the South African and KwaZulu governments, said that the police were not 'in a position in the present political climate to ensure that the elections are free and fair'.</p>

However, he maintained: "This is not disturbing, because  civil society has become increasingly organized, and will not  allow them to have their way."    This was his comment on the statements made by the director  of the Almoloya de Juarez prison, Juan Pablo de Tavira, who  charged that drug traffickers, through agencies of that type,  are attempting to have the country's high security jails  eliminated.    He declared: "It is obvious that, in places such as the  Federal District and Mexico State, the drug trafficking Mafia  has manipulated presumed human rights defenders, to plead in  cases of persons arrested for crimes against health, or to call  for the repeal of measures such as the establishment of high  security prisons." However, he added: "They have no prospect of  attaining their goals."    He also indicated that the state Congress might possibly  confirm him in his position for another three years. Otherwise,  he would accept the vice presidency of the Mexican Academy of  Human Rights.    He indicated: "There is a large number of drug traffickers  in  custody, accounting for 30 percent of the prison population in  the entire state."</p>

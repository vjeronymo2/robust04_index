			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Safety fears may force closure of Ekofisk tank THE NORWEGIAN Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, is considering an order to close the main processing and transportation facilities on the tank in the giant 10-platform Ekofisk field by the winter of 1995-96 for safety reasons. Phillips Petroleum Norway is the operator of Ekofisk, a major part of the world's biggest oil and gas transportation system, and holds a 37 per cent stake in the field. Petrofina holds a 30 per cent stake and Agip has 13 per cent. Oil is processed and transported via Ekofisk to Teesside, England, and gas to Emden, Germany. Mr Jan Hagland, an NPD official, said that about 40 per cent of Norway's petroleum production was transported via Ekofisk facilities. The directorate said ageing technical equipment combined with inadequate maintenance were the main causes for its concern and that subsidence of the field had contributed to a worsening of the situation. It added that studies carried out by Phillips also revealed safety-related deficiencies on the installation. Phillips and its partners have three weeks to reply to the NPD, which said that further modifications to facilities would not sufficiently compensate for continued deterioration in the situation. Mr Hagland said the NPD thought there was time for Phillips and other licence holders to establish new, similar capacity to avoid permanent closure of the field. In 1987 Phillips and partners invested NKr4bn (Pounds 395m) to jack up the steel platforms in the field's centre to secure them against the consequences of subsidence, which is thought to be caused by a drop in the pressure in the field's two reservoirs. In 1989 a protective concrete wall was installed around the Ekofisk tank to enhance safety, and a major water injection project is under way to increase recoverable reserves beyond the year 2011, when the group's licence in the field expires. Phillips said it was studying changes to the existing Ekofisk processing and transportation system and to this end would respond to the NPD within the stipulated period. The oil ministry, which oversees licensing of fields, has not yet received a request from Phillips to extend its licence beyond the year 2011, but analysts said this would be necessary if the group was to make significant investments to meet the NPD's demands.</p>

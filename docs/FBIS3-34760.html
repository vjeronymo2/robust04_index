			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colombo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Sri Lanka's Prime Minister  Ranil Wickremasinghe Monday rejected peace overtures from a  junior rebel and insisted that any serious offer to end the  bloodshed must come from the Tamil Tiger chieftain.    A local leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  (LTTE)  had asked the Colombo government last week to "create conditions  to establishing peace" in the embattled northeast where the  rebels are fighting for a separate state.    In the first reaction to the offer made by an LTTE  functionary known as Karikalan, the prime minister said that  rebel supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, 39, must be directly  involved in any new peace effort.    "Any response from the LTTE must come from Prabhakaran. We  have not closed the door for peace. But Prabhakaran is silent,"  Wickremasinghe told a public rally in central Kotmale region  Sunday.    He said 14 months of talks with the LTTE ended in failure in  June 1990, leading to more bloodshed, and he added that after  that debacle all political parties agreed that Prabhakaran must  be directly involved with any talks.    "No political party has changed that position. We do not  want  to discourage anyone from talking. But any serious move must  come from Prabhakaran himself and no one else in the LTTE,"  Wickremasinghe told AFP Monday.    The latest LTTE peace bid was conveyed to the government by  A.T. Ariyaratna, a leader of a non-governmental organisation,  who visited LTTE-held Jaffna Peninsula.    "I met the (LTTE's Jaffna political leader) Karikalan who  expressed their desire to bring about peace. I have conveyed  their message to the president," said Ariyaratna who heads the  voluntary organisation called Sarvodaya.    He said Karikalan's message in Tamil was tape recorded and a  transcript was given to President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga who  has often repeated that there was no ethnic conflict but a  problem of terrorism in the island's north.    "I only conveyed to the president (this message) and he said  he will give very serious thought to all that and for me to  continue what ever confidence building measures," Ariyaratna  said.    The Tigers had asked the government to create conditions  conducive to peace by dismantling a limited economic blockade on  the peninsula. There have been no concrete proposals from the  Tigers themselves.    Ariyaratna, a member of the majority Sinhalese community,  said he was planning several more visits to the Jaffna peninsula  to "build confidence" between Sinhalese and the minority Tamils  concentrated in the northeast.    The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Colombo Nicholas Marcus  Fernando and the Anglican Bishop of Colombo Kenneth Fernando  made separate visits to Jaffna recently and reiterated the need  for ending the 22-year-old war.    The two clergymen also met with several LTTE leaders,  although the Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabakaran did not make an  appearance.    Wickremasinghe also said the government hoped that the  LTTE's  political wing, known as the People's Front of Liberation Tigers  (PFLT), would contest local council elections in parts of the  embattled northeast.    "We wanted to give them a chance to test their popularity  and  then come for talks. But they have not responded,"  Wickremasinghe said. The elections are scheduled for March 1.    Security forces, who have been acquiring more hardware and  men in recent months, are currently conducting limited  operations against LTTE positions in the island's east ahead of  the local election.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: A lesson in leadership for all Sir, Your leader 'Pay-off punch' (June 8) is helpful as far as it goes in supporting the Postel move to curb directors' rolling contracts. But does it go far enough? Postel appears to have the limited objective of rolling back three-year contracts to 12 months at the outside. Surely, however, the real issue is whether or not it is appropriate for directors to have service contracts of any duration. Some interesting light is shed on this issue in the recently published 1993 report and accounts of Marks and Spencer. The section on corporate governance states categorically that neither the chairman nor any of the executive directors has any form of service contract with the company. If M and S is prepared to do without directors' service contracts, why shouldn't the same procedure be acceptable for all the top 100 UK companies without exception. This, after all, is what leadership by example is all about. David Grenier, chief executive, Independent Investment Management, Warnford Court, Throgmorton Street, London EC2N 2AT</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: MFI MFI's board seems content to wring its hands and blame economic conditions for the poor profits figures it turned in yesterday. That looks a little thick since the management picked up Pounds 11m in bonuses for successfully floating the company after a few weeks of improved trading in 1992. Doubtless MFI's board has had to struggle with difficult trading conditions over the past five years. But then, so has everybody else. Perhaps the bonus was simply a reward for good timing. MFI argues that devaluation had a disastrous impact on its business, yet interest rates are now four percentage points lower than at flotation and there are faint stirrings in the housing market. The dilapidated home improvement business would surely be a wasteland if sterling were still in the ERM and interest rates 10 per cent. The exit from the management buy-out thus leaves something of a nasty taste in the mouth. There are also reasons to be sceptical about the company's much-vaunted operational gearing. Consumers may be moving house a little more frequently, but they are loath to spend money on high-margin kitchen units which cannot easily be moved with them. Those tax increases already announced will hit MFI's blue collar customer base particularly hard. The sag in sales and margins which followed pressure from other DIY retailers earlier this year is also worrying. Even the most optimistic profits estimates leave MFI at a 30 per cent premium to the market. On that basis the market's love affair with recovery stocks is surely overdone.</p>

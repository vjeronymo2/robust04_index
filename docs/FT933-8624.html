			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Scottish TV plans sale or flotation of its Pauline Hyde offshoot SCOTTISH Television said yesterday that it would either float or sell Pauline Hyde &amp; Associates, its outplacement and career development subsidiary, before the end of 1998. A new management team had been appointed at PHA and a review of the future strategy of STV's investment in the offshoot had been undertaken. These moves followed a 'disappointing profit performance' of PHA in the opening six months of 1993. For 1992 the company returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of Pounds 12m. Directors of STV said PHA would be listed on the London Stock Exchange or be sold privately 'at a significant premium to its current value'. In that event Diplema, a company controlled by Mr Colyn Gardner and Mr Mark Allsup, and the new management team would be entitled, on a listing, to acquire up to 40 per cent of PHA's share capital. Mr Gardner, Mr Allsup and Mr Max Nicholson, majority shareholders in Fairplace Consulting, the outplacement and training consultancy in the City, have joined PHA as executive chairman, chief executive and executive director respectively. Diplema and the new management team will have the right to acquire PHA from STV in 1999 if a listing or sale is not achieved. STV's shares dipped 5p to 524p.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Leading Article: The MMC and British Gas YESTERDAY'S Monopolies and Mergers Commission's reports on the UK gas market are in some ways more radical and in some ways less radical than expected. The commission has been more radical in recommending a break-up of British Gas, but less radical in proposing that the company's domestic monopoly not be abolished until early next century. The overall thrust of the two reports, which aim at a more competitive gas market, seems about right. Although British Gas has certainly improved value for money and customer service since privatisation in 1986, much remains to be done. The company is still overstaffed, while its monopolistic culture remains strong. Greater competition will not only give British Gas an incentive to become more efficient, but also give customers a choice. Nevertheless, some of the commission's detailed recommendations are open to question. First, the proposed timescale for abolishing British Gas's monopoly seems too leisurely. The company currently has a lock on all customers using less than 2,500 therms a year. The commission thinks this figure should be reduced to 1,500 therms in 1997 with further liberalisation postponed for another three to five years. The reason for the delay is that the commission has been persuaded by British Gas's argument that a free-for-all could cause problems in balancing supply and demand through the pipeline system. This, it argues, would not only inconvenience customers but could lead to gas explosions. Safety argument While this safety argument cannot be ignored, a solution could surely be found in less than seven to nine years. The modest reduction in the monopoly proposed for 1997 will bring the benefits of competition, currently enjoyed by business customers, to only 500,000 of British Gas's 18m domestic customers. Customers, who can already choose their telephone company and who by 1998 will be able to pick their electricity supplier, will wonder why they are denied choice in gas. Second, the form of break-up advocated by the commission may not be ideal. It wants British Gas's trading arm - responsible for selling gas to customers - to be split from the rest of the business to ensure fair treatment for rival trading companies which have to send their gas through the company's pipelines. The commission argues that a complete separation was necessary. The less radical option of putting Chinese Walls between the pipeline and trading businesses would, it believes, still allow British Gas to show favouritism to its in-house trading company. And although break-up would have its costs, they would be outweighed by the benefits. Break-up costs Nevertheless, if the one-off costs of break-up are to be incurred, a preferable option may be for the pipeline business rather than the trading arm to be divested. This would ensure fair access to the pipelines not only for rival trading companies but also rival North Sea gas producers. The commission seems to have rejected this approach on the flimsy grounds that British Gas needs to be a large integrated pipeline and production company to compete in world markets. In deciding whether to accept the commission's recommendations, ministers will have to answer some awkward questions. Are they prepared to see an end to the system under which all domestic customers pay the same for each unit of gas? Unbridled competition could lead to prices going up for people who use little gas, such as the elderly, and those living in remote rural areas. Although heavy users and city-dwellers should benefit from competition, the government may feel uncomfortable if vulnerable groups end up with higher bills. Who should pay for the costs of divestiture? The commission has recommended that the costs are passed through to customers - a proposal that pleases British Gas. But the public will be rightly concerned if shareholders, who have already done well since privatisation, seem to benefit at the expense of customers. Quick answers are not likely. Nor are they desirable since most interested parties will not have access to the commission's full reports until next month. But the pro-competitive stance of these reports is the right one: action should follow.</p>

Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui, Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]  Director General of Policy Coordination Paek Nam-chi, and other  government and DLP officials agreed to revive Labor Day but put  off revision of the law for a year to reflect upon the position  of employers.    The move to reform labor policy seems aimed at easing worker  dissatisfaction on the eve of spring wage negotiations.    Dissident labor organizations, but not the Federation of  Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), have asked for a revival of Labor  Day for 36 years. FKTU, which stuck to Worker's Day (March 10),  officially decided to ask for the return of Labor Day in 1990.    In spite of the delay, party officials say they expect the  decision to revive Labor Day to be welcomed.    President Syngman Yi abolished Labor Day in 1958 and  replaced  it with March 10, anniversary of the founding of the right-wing  predecessor of FKTU, as Worker's Day.</p>

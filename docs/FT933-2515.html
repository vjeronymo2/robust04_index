			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Rebels claim PM may step down TORY discontent with the party's leadership continued to simmer yesterday as backbenchers speculated openly about whether - and when - Mr John Major might resign. While those raising fresh questions about Mr Major's authority are long-time critics of the leader and regarded as mavericks by many of their colleagues, their comments have reinforced the impression that the prime minister's efforts to draw a line under the divisions and disarray of the past year have not yet been successful.

But the attacks increase the pressure on Mr Major to use his conference speech to silence critics by setting out a clear vision of the direction in which he is taking the party. Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, told workers in his Tunbridge Wells constituency that Tories needed 'self-discipline, steadiness and teamwork'. 'Conservatives in the country can stomach anything but disloyalty . . ,' he said. 'They want to see staunch support for the prime minister.'</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders' rise held to 13% Holders Technology, the USM-quoted supplier of tools, materials and equipment to the European printed circuit board industry, lifted pre-tax profits by 13 per cent, from Pounds 394,000 to Pounds 446,000, in the year ended November 30 1993. Mr Rudolf Weinreich, chairman and chief executive, said the result was affected by Ferranti, one of its larger UK customers, going into receivership. That left it with a bad debt of Pounds 56,000, thus reducing the profit growth to about half of what it would otherwise have been. Turnover rose from Pounds 3.48m to Pounds 4m. Mr Weinreich said that in the current year the group expected to see increasing sales of the Espanex adhesives flexible circuit materials which it distributes across Europe. He added that the outcome for the year would depend on the group's success in shifting the product mix in favour of higher margin items. Earnings per share rose to 9.23p (9.07p). An unchanged final dividend of 4p is proposed to maintain the total at 6p.</p>

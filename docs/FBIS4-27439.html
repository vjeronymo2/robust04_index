			<p>BFN     [Text] The contents of a draft report on the package of  concrete measures to relax regulations which will be mapped out  in early June by the Administration and Finance Reform  Subcommittee (chaired by Otohiko Endo, a Komeito legislator) --  under the Tax System Reform Council of the ruling parties --  came to light on 28 May. The draft report proposes that a  system be created to provide information to companies desiring  to participate in biddings for government procurement, and  government procurement be opened to foreign enterprises by  simplifying the current business registration procedure. The  draft report calls for a sweeping review of regulations under  individual laws on the air transportation, communications, and  broadcasting sectors in order to encourage foreign investment in  Japan. The draft report is believed to have been compiled with  the aim of backing up Prime Minister Hata on the eve of the July  summit talks (the Naples summit) of the industrialized nations  by setting out a package of concrete deregulatory measures for  government procurement, which has been a focal point in the  Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks.    The Administration and Finance Reform Subcommittee is under  the Tax System Reform Council, which is to draw up plans by the  end of June for a sweeping reform of the current tax system.  The subcommittee has set up four working groups mandated to  study ways of keeping the raising of indirect taxes to a minimum.    The "deregulation and creation of new industry team," which  is mandated to discuss ways to correct the price differentials  between Japan and other nations and to rebuild Japan's  industrial structure, has proposed a 35-sector type of  deregulation. The draft report confines the deregulation to 30  areas and presents a package of concrete measurements of their  deregulation. The government is examining the possibility of  incorporating the concrete measures in the second package of  external economic measures to be mapped out in June.    The Foreign Ministry has not yet provided sufficient  information to foreign firms eager to participate in biddings  for government procurement. The draft report therefore stresses  the need to establish a channel through which information in  addition to the official gazette is supplied to foreign firms  which are small in their size and which have no history of  biddings for government procurement. The draft report calls on  local autonomous governments to provide foreign firms with full  information on their procurement procedures. With regard to the  procedure of filing business registration applications, it is a  mandatory to file individual business registration applications  with the concerned bureau and department of each ministry and  agency. The draft report proposes that the business  registration application be filed with a single government  office.    In pointing out that in the telecommunications industry, the  international telephone industry, and the car phone industry "it  is hard to think that foreign firms can easily participate in  those fields and establish their vested interests," the draft  report states unequivocally, "It is necessary to relax as many  regulations as possible concerning foreign access to the  telecommunications market and to remove regulations from the  market." The draft report calls for simplifying the current  license system in order for telecommunications companies to  jointly use their facilities and mutually connect their  facilities.</p>

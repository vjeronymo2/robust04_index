			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The former secret service, known as S-2, must be  investigated and eliminated once and for all, said Dr. Ruben  Zamora, Democratic Convergence presidential candidate, today.    The leftist political leader explained that it is necessary  to undertake a profound and in-depth investigation--which must  also include the Army's Military Intelligence Battalion--to  dismantle totally the apparatus that granted legitimacy to the  so-called death squads.    Zamora believes these groups are very small and that they  operate under the protection of the former intelligence  services, and, therefore, they must be sought out and eliminated  to end a yet unconcluded period of our history.    [Begin Zamora recording] It is much more possible now to  struggle against them and eliminate them from our history.    I believe that, in this case, they must be sought out at the  institutions in which they could exist; for instance, we know  that the S-2, and the police are places in which the death  squads had operated, and we know that in the National Police,  for instance, they have hired personnel that were members of the  Finance Police S- 2 and National Guard S-2. I would investigate  there.    I believe the Army's Intelligence Battalion must also be  investigated in this regard, as the former Secret Police, or the  Army's former secret intelligence, has practically become the  Intelligence Battalion. Those are the places where I think we  should, or the Armed Forces themselves should, investigate to  eliminate all of the personnel who could be linked to the past,  which, I think, we all want to overcome now. [end recording]    In that same regard, the leftist presidential candidate said  there is an apparent attempt at corrupting the National Civilian  Police [PNC], which was created in accordance with the Peace  Agreements. He also said it is necessary, therefore, to correct  the mistakes that are being made, such as the transfer of the  Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions to that institution.    [Begin Zamora recording] There is an apparent attempt to  bias or corrupt--as I call it--the PNC project. What worries me  most is the transfer to it of complete organizations, such as  the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions. There are  people involved who are involved in tortures and the practices  used in the past.    If you want to read about this, I recommend the last UN  human  rights report which, upon analyzing the case of Mr. Grimaldi  [not further identified], clearly states that the United Nations  already had the name of Grimaldi's assassin. They passed the  name on to the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions, and  the commission refused, for one month, to put him in jail. [end  recording]    Zamora reiterated the complaint of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal  [TSE] is resorting to what he called little tricks [triquinelas]  of the past to carry out a fraud in the next elections, in light  of which the pertinent corrective steps are already being  carried out before the UN Observers for El Salvador.    [Begin Zamora recording, in progress] ...little tricks  [words indistinct] by the TSE. I think that is incorrect; it  must not be allowed, because this country must have absolutely  open elections.    At the same time, I want to say that I have spoken to the  other candidates, the Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance]  candidate and the candidate for the Christian Democratic Party,  and they have both told me they think we must allow the  political parties with their representation.    I do not mean to say that Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena or Dr.  Armando Calderon Sol are involved in these little tricks. I  want this to be clear, because I have spoken to them and they  have said this to me and, to honor the truth, I have to say  this. [end recording]    The country's complex situation regarding the fulfillment of  the agreements, the development of the electoral campaign, and  the TSE's work are worrisome. There is still a will to  continue, however, working for the construction of democracy and  the development of an open electoral process based on the mutual  confidence of the political parties cited by Dr. Ruben Zamora.</p>

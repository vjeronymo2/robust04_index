			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Arts: Arnie's natal attraction - Cinema JUNIOR (12) Ivan Reitman ABOVE THE RIM (15)Jeff Pollack THE PUNK &amp; THE PRINCESS (15) Mike Sarne THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT] III (PG) Bud Friedgen and Michael J. Sheridan Junior is the sort of comedy that relies on a single, big concept for its laughs. In this case, it is the spectacle of Arnold Schwarzenegger pregnant. What better way to pack theatres with sniggering fans than to cast Arnie as a research scientist who impregnates himself with a fertilised egg to prove that his experimental cure for miscarriage is effective? But a funny thing happens on the way to the box office - the sight of Schwarzenegger pregnant is considerably less hilarious than director Ivan Reitman intended. While the thought of the world's foremost macho hero carrying a child seems at first to be the pinnacle of gender dissonance, the strange fact is that Arnie does not look all that different from normal with a bun in the oven. After all, there has always been something faintly prenatal about the guy, with his bulging pectorals, venous flesh and stiff-backed gait. The extra bit of distension is hardly noticeable. Once that rippling stomach begins to bulge, you find yourself thinking that if any man can carry a child, it is Arnie. Robbed of its big shock value, the film flounders in a sea of cliche. Writers Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad fail to milk this potentially fertile subject for its satiric worth, while Reitman foregoes wit for a parade of visual gags and tame one-liners. Despite a welcome breath of worldly sarcasm from Danny DeVito, the film keeps to the sentimental middle ground as Arnie decides to bring the child to term, a decision which allows him to get in touch with his feminine side. So instead of cutting satire on the often bogus politics of the 'new man', we get faithful old chestnuts about morning sickness, bizarre food cravings and the importance of family values. What few potentially funny lines exist are hopelessly mangled by Schwarzenegger's ham-fisted delivery. And though Reitman and company toil laboriously to explain how a fertile egg might be lodged in the male body, they then neglect to mention how a wombless man could possibly nourish a foetus. The film has a sheen of science, but it is ultimately deeply illogical. But its most disheartening aspect is the presence of Emma Thompson who, cast as Arnie's love interest, seems completely at a loss. She had better watch out - the enormous amount of good feeling she has generated with her Merchant/Ivory work will dissipate very quickly if she insists on involvement with such tired fare as this. Despite a welter of rap music, urban slang and noisy violence, Above the Rim is actually a deeply, even quaintly, old-fashioned movie. It tells the story of a young Harlem basketball star (Duane Martin) who tries to use his athletic prowess to escape the poverty, drugs and violence of the ghetto. Along the way he is tempted from the path of righteousness by a local gang-banger (Tupac Shakur) while also contending with a former basketball hero who is courting his mother. Not surprisingly, the whole thing winds up in a noisy shoot-out (first with basketballs, then with bullets) in which good overcomes evil. Writer/director Jeff Pollack keeps things moving along at a fast and furious pace, and his depiction of the high-pressure world of urban basketball is assured. He is greatly aided by some sterling performances, particularly by Martin, Shakur and Marlon Wayans as the neighbourhood clown. Where the film suffers is in its over-reliance upon on-court action and its supremely simplistic morality - virtue is rewarded, heroes prevail and the bad guys are the ones wearing black basketball jerseys. The Punk &amp; The Princess, on the other hand, could have benefited from a bit more simplicity. This unfortunate attempt to set Romeo and Juliet in contemporary Notting Hill is a messy stew of confused pretension and overwrought trendiness. The film concerns an aimless young punk (Charlie Creed Miles) who falls in love with a rich American girl (Vanessa Hadaway) when he stumbles upon her performing as Juliet at the Gate Theatre. Their affair sets off all the usual gang rivalries and familial ructions, resulting in fights, stabbings and ultimately death. Director Mike Sarne wears neither his learning nor imagery lightly - the film is fraught with hackneyed Shakespearian references, most notably a midnight balcony scene, a swordfight with pool cues and a very dodgy reference to 'Star-cross'd lovers'. There are some nicely done knockabout scenes between Miles and his mates, though these are ultimately sunk by the film's leisurely pace, careless camerawork and some truly appalling American accents. That's Entertainment] III is another welcome raid on the archives of MGM's legendary musical division. While it is hard to imagine how anybody could go wrong compiling this material, director Bud Friedgen and Michael J. Sheridan have concocted a skilful piece of nostalgia, including not only standards from the likes of Esther Williams, Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, but also a number of gems scooped from the editing room floor. Among these prized out-takes are Cyd Charisse brilliantly performing a dance number which Joan Crawford ultimately turned into screen suet, and Judy Garland's first use of her trademark half-tuxedo in a scene inexplicably cut from Easter Parade. There is also a remarkable sequence in which two takes of a Fred Astaire number are juxtaposed. They duplicate each other move-for-move in a stunning demonstration of the great dancer's sublime perfection. But the most memorable contribution to the film comes from Lena Horne, who with dignified yet justifiable anger protests at not being given the lead in Showboat for the simple reason that she was black. Her worthiness for the role is proven beyond doubt when her performance is compared with Ava Gardner's rather shaky, dubbed effort. It is a sad commentary on contemporary films that the stuff they used to leave out makes for better viewing than much of what they now put in.</p>

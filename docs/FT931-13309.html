			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Government says pit closures decision vindicated by reports THE GOVERNMENT yesterday claimed vindication for its decision last October to close 31 coal mines after independent reports pointed to an unprecedented decline in the market and broadly backed the selection of pits chosen for closure. However, the likelihood that the government will change its mind on some of the pits was reinforced by the conclusion of one of the reports, by John T Boyd, a US mining consultancy, that 13 could be profitable if there were significant changes to working practices. One of the 31, Point of Ayr, in north Wales, seems almost certain to remain open after Boyd said its 'room and pillar' mining system should be applied at other collieries. 'Priority should be given to continuation of this pit to demonstrate the feasibility and economics of the system.' Boyd said British Coal's strategy for selecting the 31 pits originally earmarked to close appeared reasonable. Among the 21 since granted a stay of closure by the government, the consultancy ranked Maltby and Hatfield the most economic, and Westoe and Easington the least so. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the reports broadly confirmed the assessments which led to the original decision in October to close the pits. The government would consider the reports in its white paper on energy but he added that no pit would be viable unless there was a market for coal. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry minister, said the reports made it hard to believe that ministers were carrying out a searching review of energy policy. The report by Caminus Energy, 'tells us nothing more than that on present policies coal is being shut out from the electricity market. We knew that in October,' he said. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said the reports failed to take account of subsidised imports and more expensive forms of energy including nuclear power. Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, said all 31 pits could be profitable. At Westminster last night there were fears that publication of the documents could provoke a split among members of the cross-party trade and industry select committee, which meets to finalise its report on the sector early next week. There were suggestions that Tory committee members might use the independent reports to argue for recommendations that would save too few of the 31 threatened pits to be acceptable to some Labour members. The select committee report is expected to be published on Friday. Among the reports, Boyd suggested that six of the 21 pits whose future is undecided could operate on a profitable basis within three years. The number would rise to 13 if laws restricting changes in working practices and management were removed. Caminus Energy said that in a free market where rival fuels were relatively cheap, British Coal's total sales, failing contractual arrangements with generators, could fall from 86m tonnes this year to 21m next. The two other reports, by Ernst &amp; Young and Pims, suggested ways for British Coal to make significant savings in management costs, presaging the loss of up to 3,000 redundancies among senior staff.

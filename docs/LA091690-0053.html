			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SPECTER OF ANTI-SEMITISM RISING ONCE AGAIN IN POLAND;  </P> <P> PREJUDICE: ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY IS NEARLY BEREFT OF JEWS, THE ANCIENT ISSUE IS  BEGINNING TO INFILTRATE POLITICS.  </P> <P> Four months ago, someone painted a small, rusty-red swastika on a stone pillar  a few steps from the Israeli ambassador's home.  </P> <P> He drives by it every day, neighbors walk dogs past it, children play nearby.  No one has tried to obliterate the ugly symbol.  </P> <P> Graffiti and other signs of anti-Semitism are being seen again in Poland, even  though it is nearly bereft of Jews, and the prejudice of the streets has begun  to infiltrate politics.  </P> <P> Some rightist politicians are fanning nationalist emotions and, with a seeming  inevitability, anti-Semitism.  </P> <P> On the other side, prominent anti-Communist figures like Adam Michnik, editor  of the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, and Zbigniew Bujak -- both leaders of the  pro-government Democratic Action party -- have been sounding the alarm.  </P> <P> Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, indignant at suggestions of bigotry on the  part of himself or some of his followers, declared, "Lech Walesa is not and  will not be anti-Semitic."  </P> <P> In a resolution July 29, Walesa's national Citizens Committee condemned both  prejudice and the use of unfounded charges of anti-Semitism to smear political  opponents. Members of the committee have accused foreign journalists of  exaggerating the extent of anti-Semitism in Poland.  </P> <P> The late sociologist Aleksander Hertz, a Polish Jew, said anti-Semitism grew in  the 19th Century in response to Poland's humiliating partitions, Russian  influences and the prosperity of a burgeoning Jewish population, which both the  declining aristocracy and impoverished peasants resented.  </P> <P> In politics, anti-Semitism peaked just before World War II, when it was a major  tenet of the popular National Democrats. University students hounded Jewish  colleagues and anti-Semites organized boycotts of Jewish businesses.  </P> <P> Three million Polish Jews were killed by the Nazis. Some of the half-million  who survived owed their lives to Poles who hid them, but others were betrayed  by Polish acquaintances.  </P> <P> Polish Jews who lived through the Holocaust were traumatized by it and feared  trying to reclaim homes and property from Christians, particularly after a  pogrom in 1946 that took 48 lives in Kielce. Most of them emigrated to Israel  or the United States.  </P> <P> An official Communist purge of "Zionists" prompted the last big wave of  emigration in 1968, reducing the number of Jews to 5,000-15,000 in a nation of  38 million people.  </P> <P> For the first time in centuries, Poland is without a large Jewish population,  and profound changes have resulted.  </P> <P> Before the war, Jews were about 10% of the population, concentrated in towns  and cities, and made up a large part of the middle class. The landed  aristocracy disdained commerce and peasants stuck to their farms, so much of  the small business, trade and industry were left to Jews.  </P> <P> Half a century after Nazi occupation, Poland still has not come to grips with  the loss of its Jewish population. Any discussion of Jews is likely to provoke  strong emotions, often defensive.  </P> <P> Poland's only rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, said he has observed more  anti-Semitism recently. He used to find respect and friendliness when he walked  the streets in his traditional Hasidic garb, Joskowicz said, but now encounters  hostility.  </P> <P> "Two weeks ago, I had guests from Israel, and we went for a walk," he said in  an interview. "Then youths, maybe 21, maybe younger, started shouting 'Jews to  Palestine!' and other slogans too. I did not pay any attention, let them shout.  </P> <P> "But when we walked a few meters they approached us and started hitting one of  the guests."  </P> <P> Joskowicz said he now avoids walking at night and does not know what to tell  Jews from abroad when they ask him if it is safe to visit Poland.  </P> <P> There is a tendency to blame Jews for the nation's troubles.  </P> <P> "I keep hearing that a gang has gotten to the feeding trough, they are probably  Jews and they are destroying us," Walesa told a meeting of his national  Citizens Committee on June 24.  </P> <P> He said such remarks do not mean anti-Semitism is increasing, but that the  government must do a better job of explaining itself to the people.  </P> <P> Farmers who occupied the Agriculture Ministry in June, demanding guaranteed  prices, were heard muttering about the "Jewish government."  </P> <P> That government is led by a devout Roman Catholic, Prime Minister Tadeusz  Mazowiecki, who identifies with Christian-Democratic politics and sometimes is  accused of being too solicitous of the church.  </P> <P> Allegations that Jews run the government rest on the fact that some prominent  Solidarity politicians are Jews. Two examples are Michnik and Parliament member  Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Citizens Parliamentary Club, who are of Jewish  descent but do not practice the religion.  </P> <P> Communist functionaries used such information in the past in the vain hope of  discrediting Solidarity.  </P> <P> In August, the National Party, a far-right group based in the southern city of  Krakow, said it was unfair for an ethnic minority to have dominance in the  government. The Grunwald Society, created by nationalistic Communists,  contended recently that "German and Jewish chauvinists" were the greatest  threats to Polish sovereignty.  </P> <P> Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska, who wrote a book on the  remaining Jews in Poland with her husband, a photographer, said anti-Semitism  is coming to the surface in the more liberal atmosphere since Communist rule.  </P> <P> "Now everything is free," she said. "Many good things have come out, but also  some bad things."  </P></p>

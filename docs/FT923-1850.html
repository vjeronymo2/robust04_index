			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Observer: Sterling work Judging by the fate of Lord Beaverbrook, the former Conservative party treasurer who is on the brink of personal bankruptcy, it is a brave soul who gets involved in Tory finances. Enter Martin Saunders, chartered accountant and finance director of P &amp; O. No prizes for guessing who introduced Saunders to Tory chairman Sir Norman Fowler as a suitable candidate for the new post of director of finance in a supposedly leaner, fitter political machine. P&amp;O boss and ardent Tory supporter Lord Sterling has, despite the recession, kept up his Conservative party donations at Pounds 100,000 a year and Saunders has worked for Lord Sterling since 1976, when he joined as deputy chief accountant of Town &amp; City Properties. With a deficit of an estimated Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m to worry about, the politically ambitious Saunders will have plenty to keep him interested - but the puzzle is why central office has made this appointment before filling the other new slot, that of chief executive.</p>

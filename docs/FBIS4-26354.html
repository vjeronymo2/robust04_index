			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- In the remaining years  of this century, China aims to use at least seven billion U.S.  dollars of overseas capital for the construction of posts and  telecommunications facilities.    Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of posts and  telecommunications,  said here today in an exclusive interview with XINHUA that since  1984, the ministry has used foreign funds of 5.67 billion U.S.  dollars.    The ministry hopes to use another batch of 2.1 billion U.S.  dollars of foreign funds by the end of 1995, while the planned  sum of foreign funds for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000)  period is five billion U.S. dollars, Wu added.    He said that in the past 10 years, with loans on favorable  terms from foreign governments, international financial  organizations and other overseas organizations and institutions,  the ministry introduced some 16.8 million lines of  program-controlled city telephone switch equipment and one  million lines of long-distance switch equipment; constructed  about 20,000 km of high-grade optical telecommunications cable  lines and 15,000 km of digital micro-wave telecommunications  lines; and set up 18 land satellite stations and 28 automated  letter distribution lines.    "Foreign capital has given a great push to China's  telecommunications construction," he said.    He said that China's fast economic development in the past  few years has brought about a nice opportunity for the country's  telecommunications development. However, being a basic  industry, telecommunications has been suffering from  insufficient infrastructures, which has, to some extent, also  hampered the country's economic development.    To step up the construction of telecommunications  infrastructures, the central government has drafted a series of  preferential policies, and priority has been given to the  industry in terms of using foreign funds. Considering the scale  of China's telecommunications market, the ministry will be fully  capable of repaying foreign investment, the minister said.    Telecommunications is one of China's industries with the  fastest development speed. In 1992 its business volume  increased by 42 percent; last year its growth rate rose to 59  percent, while in the first five months of this year the rate of  increase was 49.5 percent.    The high speed increase is closely related to China's huge  input in this field. Last year the industry finished an  investment of 40.4 billion yuan in fixed assets construction,  and this year's budget rose abruptly to 53.6 billion yuan. The  Eighth Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) will finish a total investment  of 160 billion yuan, while in the newly-drafted Ninth Five-Year  Plan the budget is a hefty 360 billion yuan.    Aside from a small amount of state allocations, most of the  funds will come from domestic and overseas loans or be raised by  various localities, Wu said.    He said that China will be the world's largest  telecommunications market in the 21st century. So far nearly  all of the world's large telecommunications groups have  established cooperative relations with China, and some  medium-sized and small enterprises are also preparing to have a  share in this large market. This is really a good opportunity  for China's telecommunications development.    Talking about foreign cooperation, Wu said that besides  engaging in direct management of telecommunications businesses,  or management through buying stock, overseas businessmen are  welcome to cooperate in the fields such as scientific research,  education, product development, engineering and design, and  equipment production and supply.    He said that China especially welcomes overseas businessmen  to invest in telecommunications construction projects. The  Chinese side will ensure their interests according to the rule  of mutual benefit.    He said that the production of telecommunications equipment  is fully open to foreign businessmen. They can construct  cooperative enterprises as well as solely-funded enterprises in  China.    So far all of China's newly-built advanced  telecommunications  equipment production lines are fruits of Sino-foreign  cooperation, such as the Sino-Belgium Switch Co. in Shanghai,  Tianjin-NEC Co. and Beijing Siemens Co. Presently Guangdong  Province is negotiating with Canadian Northern  Telecommunications Co. on cooperative projects.    Wu, 56 years old and a senior engineer of  telecommunications,  was appointed minister of posts and telecommunications last year.</p>

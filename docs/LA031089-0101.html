			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CENTINELA HOSPITAL FILES SUIT TO BLOCK FACILITY FOR MENTALLY ILL  </P> <P> Centinela Hospital Medical Center filed a lawsuit Thursday aimed at preventing  construction of a center for severely mentally ill patients across the street  from the hospital.  </P> <P> The hospital had threatened to file the suit after the Inglewood City Council  last week approved construction of the 14-bed facility, to be operated by the  Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center.  </P> <P> The lawsuit names the city, City Council members and Hirsch officials and seeks  to overturn the council vote as "arbitrary and capricious," hospital Vice  President Eric Tuckman said.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, says city officials disregarded  the danger the facility could pose for the neighborhood. It also asserts that  city lawyers erroneously interpreted a state law that bars discriminatory  treatment of mental institutions to mean that council members could not  consider the type of patients to be treated at the facility, Tuckman said.  </P> <P> Hospital officials say the severely mentally ill patients, who will live at the  center for up to two weeks and can come and go as they please, will endanger  Centinela's employees and patients. City and Hirsch officials disagree and  accuse the hospital of fomenting discrimination against the mentally ill. They  also say state and city law require approval of the proposed facility.  </P> <P> Hirsch officials deny that the patients will pose any danger because they will  be screened for admission.  </P> <P> Commenting on the filing of the lawsuit, City Manager Paul Eckles said: "That's  their privilege. That's why we have courts. But I would be very surprised if  they could prevail."  </P> <P> The hospital also alleges in the suit that City Council members held at least  one illegal private meeting to discuss the issue before the Feb. 28 vote.  Tuckman said hospital officials have information that such a meeting or  meetings took place. Eckles said that he knows of no such meeting and that the  council adheres scrupulously to state public meeting laws.  </P> <P> The legal action is only part of Centinela's all-out campaign against the  psychiatric center. Hospital officials said Thursday that they will try to  bring the Hirsch proposal to the voters by collecting signatures for a ballot  initiative that would prohibit the center -- planned for the 1000 block of  Myrtle Avenue -- through a zoning change. One possibility would be a proposal  to rezone the area from its current mixed residential-medical use to an  exclusively residential zoning, Tuckman said.  </P> <P> Eckles said that would be ironic because the city changed the zoning from  residential to medical several years ago partly to accommodate expansion by the  hospital.  </P> <P> Although Centinela and Hirsch representatives met Tuesday with Councilman  Anthony Scardenzan in an attempt to resolve the matter, a compromise does not  appear imminent.  </P> <P> In fact, Scardenzan said his wife, Franca, a member of the Centinela women's  auxiliary, was told after the council vote that she could no longer work as a  volunteer at the hospital. The Scardenzans say it was in retaliation for the  council vote.  </P> <P> But hospital President Russell Stromberg said Councilman Scardenzan's wife has  not been dismissed. Rather, he said she was told it would be in her best  interest not to work at the hospital while the controversy continues, because  some employees are upset about the city's action. Stromberg said Franca  Scardenzan may still work as a volunteer at an Inglewood thrift shop owned by  Centinela Hospital.  </P></p>

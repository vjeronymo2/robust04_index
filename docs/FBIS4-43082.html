			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, who left  Athens this morning for UN Headquarters, will begin  consultations in New York on the Cyprus issue. Mr. Mikhailidhis  will have contacts with UN Security Council members and will  meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Thursday  [16 June].    Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will also be  visiting New York and Mr. Mikhailidhis will have a meeting with  him to coordinate actions. Mr. Mikhailidhis will also have  contacts in Washington with leading U.S. State Department  officials and with members of Congress. [passage omitted]  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has stressed that the  role of the five Security Council permanent members is to  strengthen the UN secretary general's efforts and not to be a  substitute for him.    Responding to a correspondent's question on Rauf Denktas'  demand that the Robert Lamb ideas be incorporated into the 21  March document, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that there cannot be any  Lamb ideas and pointed out that, according to the secretary  general's mandate of good offices, those who can submit ideas  and discuss ideas at the negotiating table are the secretary  general and his representatives.</p>

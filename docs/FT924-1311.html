			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Spain secures deal from KIO THE SPANISH government says it has persuaded the Kuwait Investment Office to prevent any further corporate collapses in its troubled Spanish empire and to reverse its nomination of the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick as 'special representatives' to replace Kuwaiti management at the KIO's Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras. Mr Claudio Aranzadi, industry minister, also told parliament the KIO had promised to inject Dollars 45m into the failed Torras chemicals group, Ercros. Madrid had been trying to block the KIO's decision to withdraw from its direct investments in Spain. It failed when, on December 5, Torras called in receivers. Kuwaiti managers, who had been running the group for six months, left Madrid and appointed KPMG to replace them while court-appointed receivers wound up the company. A few days after the Torras filing, its large property group, Prima, also applied for receivership, prompting fears that Spain's biggest paper producer, Torraspapel - which is 90 per cent owned by Torras - would also collapse. Mr Aranzadi said he had been assured by the KIO that Torraspapel would not go into receivership. It has debts of around Dollars 1bn. He said the KIO had also promised to replace the KPMG partners running Torras with a new board comprising two Spaniards and two Kuwaitis. The receivers may decide not to place it into bankruptcy, as more than 70 per cent of Torras' debt is to the KIO itself. KPMG urged the KIO to convert this debt into equity a year ago and receivers may take the same view. It is also not clear, and KIO and Torras representatives and advisers were not available to comment yesterday, whether the Dollars 40m promised is new money or part of an earlier offer to pump Dollars 80m into Ercros to help pay salaries. Three months ago, the KIO promised to inject Dollars 1.4bn into its troubled Spanish companies but later decided to withdraw. A recent article in the FT on the KIO's investments in Spain referred to the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East as 'troubled'. This bank, like most Kuwaiti banks, has had difficulties recovering from the Iraqi invasion.</p>

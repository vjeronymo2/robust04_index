			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: THE HUMBLE ASPIRIN MAY BE THE WORLD'S WONDER DRUG  </P> <P> There is a wonder drug in your medicine cabinet and the chances are you don't  even appreciate it.  </P> <P> The greatest medication of all time was introduced in 1899 and even after 90  years, medical science is still discovering new uses for the humble aspirin  tablet.  </P> <P> Back around the turn of the century, aspirin earned a reputation for relieving  pain, lowering fever and reducing inflammation. Eighty years later researchers  are discovering that aspirin may prevent heart attacks, migraine headaches,  diabetic complications and maybe even Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> In the Physicians' Health Study, 22,000 doctors were recruited. Half took one  aspirin tablet every other day, while the other half received a placebo. The  study was halted prematurely because the results were so impressive.  </P> <P> The physicians receiving aspirin had only half as many heart attacks as the  others, and the researchers felt it would be unethical to deprive their MD  guinea pigs of this powerful prophylactic.  </P> <P> Further analysis of the data reveals that the doctors on aspirin also suffered  20% fewer migraine headaches. Although one aspirin every other day wouldn't  halt a migraine in progress, it seemed to discourage these vicious headaches  from getting started.  </P> <P> Researchers suspect that aspirin works this magic by keeping blood platelets  from sticking together. These cells are often responsible for blood clots that  can trigger a heart attack.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Peto reported equally encouraging results from a study of British  doctors. Aspirin-users had almost 30% fewer migraines. He suggests, "A migraine  patient should consider taking a baby aspirin a day."  </P> <P> Such a dose (80 mg -- one-fourth of a regular aspirin tablet) may end up being  the optimal dose against heart attacks as well. Although most people find it  hard to believe that such a tiny amount of ordinary aspirin could do anything,  these very low doses have profound effects on the blood.  </P> <P> A study of diabetics demonstrated that aspirin could slow deterioration of the  tiny blood vessels feeding the retina of the eye. As a consequence, aspirin may  help hold off damage to eyesight that is one of the serious consequences of  diabetes.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most extraordinary new use for aspirin may come from theories about  Alzheimer's disease. Researchers are speculating that inflammation in the  nervous system may be part of the process behind this destructive disease.  </P> <P> Dr. Patrick McGeer, professor of psychiatry at the University of British  Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, observes that aspirin may prevent inflammation  that leads to cell death in the brain. "I've never seen a rheumatoid arthritis  patient with signs of Alzheimer's on autopsy," he notes.  </P></p>

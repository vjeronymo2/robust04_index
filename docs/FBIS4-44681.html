			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France: Aerospatiale Reduces its </F> Losses in 1993"]    [Text] Paris--The state-owned Aerospatiale [National  Industrial Aerospace Company] group reduced its losses to 1.42  billion French francs [Fr] in 1993 (group share), compared to a  negative result of Fr2.38 billion in 1992, in a "very depressed"  aviation market, according to an announcement by the French  group on 16 March.    Operating losses were reduced from Fr1.218 billion in 1992  to  Fr258 million. Net indebtedness was reduced by Fr3.2 billion to  a total of Fr13.3 billion before posting the capital allocation  of Fr2 billion from the state. Turnover was down 3 percent in  1993 to Fr50.8 billion (-4.5 percent in terms of a constant  "perimeter" and at the same dollar rate).    The sharp increase in the value of aircraft deliveries is  explained by the fact that "sales of the A340 got up to speed, a  circumstance which," according to Aerospatiale, "partially  offset the sharp decline in the case of helicopters, the halting  of the Hades program, and suspension of the Hermes project."    The year 1994 "will probably not see significant cyclical  improvement," says Aerospatiale. The group feels that it  "maintained or even strengthened its market share in 1993" and  that it did so despite "the very difficult situation of the  airlines and the existence of overcapacity in their sector." The  state-owned group also draws attention to "the intense  competition in military markets, which are being subjected to  budget restrictions."</p>

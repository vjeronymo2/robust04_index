			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Tory revolution reaches heart of the civil service Yesterday's white paper brings to Whitehall, heart of the British civil service, the management revolution the Conservatives have introduced in public services such as health, education and local government over the last 15 years. Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, said: 'We must continue to cut the state down to size by demanding quality at a price the taxpayer can afford.' With the freeze in running costs announced in November's Budget, civil servants will have to join the struggle to find 'more for less.' As resources fall in real terms over the next four years, they will be expected to seek constant improvements in quality of service, in line with the approach of the Citizen's Charter. To help them, government departments will be given greater freedom over budgets, including the right to decide the pay and grading of staff, whose pay makes up more than half of civil service running costs. Permanent secretaries are to be encouraged to 'de-layer' - to reorganise their management structures with fewer grades. Senior civil servants at grade 5 and above - there are currently about 3,000 - will be put on personal contracts that emphasise their responsibilities to manage. There will be no targets for reducing the number of civil servants. Controlling staff numbers is not an effective way of reducing costs, the white paper says, and can even increase costs if more expensive outsiders have to be used. Civil service numbers have fallen by 32,000 since the start of 1993, and at 533,350 are the lowest since world war II. war. Mr Waldegrave said he expected the total 'to fall significantly below 500,000 over the next four years.' Much of this drop will be achieved by normal turnover, of about 5 per cent a year. Where 'early departures' are needed, the Treasury will cover 80 per cent of the redundancy costs to encourage reductions. Departments will be freed of much day-to-day interference by the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. Annual targets for the market-testing programme of putting work out to tender will no longer be set, for example. But permanent secretaries will require all the tools of modern management to achieve their departments' aims with declining resources in real terms, the white paper says. These will include contracting-out and privatisation, but the white paper adds three more items to the 'toolbox': Priority-based cost management, using customer preferences to decide how to spend limited budgets. Benchmarking, which compares performance with similar organisations in the public and private sector to identify the most efficient practices. Process re-engineering - redesigning how work is done from scratch, ignoring current approaches. There will be improved rewards for top mandarins, with increases in pay for the top three grades recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body in February but only partially implemented by the government. The range of pay for permanent secretaries, the top grade, will be widened to reflect the responsibilities of the 35 posts. A remuneration committee with a majority of non-civil servants will determine the pay of each permanent secretary. 'The government believes it will be in the national interest to have over a period a somewhat smaller but better-paid senior civil service,' the white paper says. Many of the white paper's recommendations reflect proposals in a Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit report on career management and succession planning in the civil service, published in November. The report said more top Whitehall jobs should be advertised openly to ensure that the best candidates are considered. In future, departments will have to consider advertising all senior posts. A decision not to advertise vacancies in the 160 jobs at grades 1, 1A and 2 will have to be approved by the Cabinet Office. There will be an annual report on advertised jobs.

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Abbey and Baring start swaps unit ABBEY National, in a radical departure from its traditional retail business base, yesterday announced plans to enter the highly complex and lucrative derivatives market through a joint venture with Baring Brothers. The new unit will be a branch of Abbey National Treasury Services, which has taken an unusually aggressive approach to treasury management, turning in profits of about Pounds 100m annually. It currently has a balance sheet of just over Pounds 30bn, compared with Pounds 7bn in 1989, following the former building society's conversion into a bank. For Barings, the joint venture provides an opportunity to expand its existing derivatives operation, which has been held back by the firm's lack of a long-term credit rating. Abbey National Baring Derivatives (ABND), which opens next month, will concentrate on selling interest rate and currency options and swaps to UK companies and banks. It will benefit from Abbey National's strong credit ratings, and its capital base. Abbey National is rated AA by Standard &amp; Poor's, Aa2 by Moody's and AA by IBCA. The lucrative Dollars 4,000bn (Pounds 2,600bn) market in over-the-counter swaps and options is extremely credit-sensitive, as many clients are limited to dealing with credits rated double-A and above. Consequently, institutions with strong ratings are at a competitive advantage in the struggle to gain a foothold in the market. The joint venture will have a staff of 30, with back office and other technical support provided by both organisations. The unit will be headed by Mr Graham Bird, head of risk management at Baring Brothers. Mr Jonathan Nicolls, assistant treasurer at Abbey National, said there had been informal talks with a few other banks, but that Abbey had found a 'match of culture' at Baring Brothers. 'We are both pretty risk-averse,' he said. Mr Nicolls said that the move into derivatives had some synergies with Abbey's retail business base, citing fixed-rate mortgages hedged in the derivatives market and a growing number of retail savings products structured by using derivative instruments. He added that the bank does not plan to enter other areas of the international capital markets. He described the move as part of the group's strategy to 'move up the manufacturing curve'. For example, Abbey had developed from a life insurance broker to setting up Abbey National Life in February, following the acquisition of Scottish Mutual. Abbey has been active in the swaps market since 1986. Abbey and Baring officials said the cost of the venture was 'minimal' against the cost of separately-capitalised units created by Merrill Lynch and Paribas. Lex, Page 14</p>

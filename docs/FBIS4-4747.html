			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the biggest group in the seven-party  coalition, gingerly stepped Tuesday [5 April] toward approving a  hike in the consumption tax in a policy reverse from its  long-standing opposition to the idea.    An SDP committee endorsed a draft policy outline on tax  reform that argues the aging society demands a larger role of  the consumption tax as a fund source. The draft outline calls  for redressing the inequity in the tax system and removing  shortcomings in the current 3 percent consumption tax as  conditions for endorsing the raise.    It noted the importance of creating a tax system with levies  on income, assets and consumptions well balanced.    In view of the rapidly graying populace, the weight of taxes  on assets and consumptions are bound to increase, while the  income tax should remain as a principal revenue source, it said.  The times require a shift in weight to the consumption tax from  the income tax, which places a lopsided burden on workers, it  said.    Support by the rank-and-file party members to the apparent  change in the party's basic stance on the tax issue, however, is  far from secured. The first vocal oppositions to the about-face  may be voiced by local party executives at their meeting on  Friday and Saturday, political sources said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, mindful of the possible  turmoil within the party, downplayed the importance of the draft  outline.    "We are still in the process of discussing the issue," he  told a news conference. "(The policy outline) is only a very  first proposal for the discussions. That doesn't mean we  support a raise in the consumption tax."    A senior SDP policy-maker sounded a bit more supportive to  the proposal. "We are not dead set against a consumption tax  raise," said SDP Policy Board Chairman Nobuyuki Sekiyama.    Sekiyama was speaking at a meeting among senior ruling  coalition officials and the Federation of Economic  Organizations, the most powerful business lobby. "But there are  a heap of things to do, like rectifying the inequality in the  tax system before we talk about a raise," he said.    The draft outline called for lower consumption tax rates on  food and other steps to improve the 5-year-old value-added tax.    It also recommended creating a local consumption tax to  finance local projects in line with the growing calls for  decentralization of power. The SDP's move received a warm  welcome from other coalition partners.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the  new  party Sakigake [Harbinger], said at a news conference it is a  "very good news."    The SDP, as the largest opposition party, strongly resisted  the introduction of the consumption tax when it was instituted  in April 1989 under the administration of then Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal Democratic Party.    The SDP was also the main force for thwarting Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's attempt in February to introduce a 7 percent  "national welfare tax," a new value-added tax to finance  proposed income tax cuts. Hosokawa then cited the need to raise  funds to prepare for the aging of the society and to offset  revenue shortfalls from income tax cuts.    The ruling coalition scrapped Hosokawa's new tax proposal  and  decided to set up a forum within itself which would make a final  decision by the end of the current ordinary Diet session on how  to fund the 6 trillion yen tax cuts included in the economic  stimulus package unveiled in early February. The 150-day Diet  session lasts through at least late June.</p>

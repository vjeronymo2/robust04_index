			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway increases gas supplies to Germany NORWAY is to increase its supplies of natural gas to Germany by 3.5bn cubic metres a year, and has secured a price rise for gas from the giant Troll field. The additional supplies will increase the value of Norway's gas sales to Germany by an estimated 3bn Norwegian kroner (Pounds 275m) a year. Ruhrgas of Germany has agreed to purchase an additional 2bn cu m of Norwegian gas a year and to exercise 50 per cent of a purchase option covering 1.5bn cu m a year from the Troll field. With half of the Troll purchase option exercised, Ruhrgas could exercise an option for a further 1.5bn cu m a year, but this would have to be decided by July 1 1995. Other companies with outstanding Troll purchase options, covering 5.4bn cu m of gas, include Germany's Thyssengas and BEB, Distrigaz of Belgium and Ferngas of Austria. Under yesterday's deal, Norway's annual gas supplies to Germany will increase from 9bn cu m a year now to 22bn in the year 2005, of which 14.2bn cu m will be purchased by Ruhrgas. The share of Norwegian gas in Germany's overall supplies will be lifted from 14 per cent to more than 25 per cent by 2005. A consortium of German gas buyers, including Ruhrgas, has also agreed to a price adjustment for Troll gas, which was priced at an estimated NKr0.70 per cubic metre under the original sales agreement in 1986. The price rise marks the end of a dispute between the Germans and Norway's gas negotiating committee, which has lasted for more than a year. Under the terms of the original Troll contract, representatives of both sides were entitled to demand a price review before deliveries of the gas commenced. The Troll producers exercised that right, seeking a higher price for the gas, which also included supplies from the Statfjord, Heimdal, and Gullfaks fields. However, under the price review, negotiations are still outstanding between Norway and buyers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and France. With the additional purchases by Germany, total Norwegian gas supplies to Europe under the Troll contract will reach 44.7bn cu m by 2005.</p>

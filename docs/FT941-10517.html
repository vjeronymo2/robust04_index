			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Auschwitz must be preserved Sir, I read with interest Christian Tyler's perceptive article (February 5) in which he raises the question of the future of Auschwitz and its conflicting role as a memorial, museum and tourist attraction. I agree with Dr Jonathan Webber: a Jewish memorial is needed and an educational centre outside the camp should contain all exhibition material. A possible venue, already extant on the camp's perimeter, is the convent nuns vacated in 1993 (not 1992) after intervention by the Pope. The convent building is now empty and in danger of being vandalised. It should be utilised while the camp itself is left 'silent and eerie', in the words of Dr David Cesarani. We should be guided by the survivors who, like Ben Helfgott, feel strongly that what is left should be preserved. The Holocaust denyers and revisionist historians will continue to claim that the most evil of crimes never occurred. But the appeal should be to those who wish to know the truth of what happened at Auschwitz, why it happened and to ensure it never happens again.

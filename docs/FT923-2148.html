			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Observer: Dead letter The pressures now being felt by the Bank of England were not quite so acute 61 years ago this week, when - as Observer reported yesterday - the UK was driven off the gold standard. The Governor of the Bank of England, the formidable Montagu Norman - was returning from a lengthy convalescence in the US when the Old Lady decided it could hold on no longer. Anxious to keep him informed, but fearful of security leaks, officials sent an artfully worded cable to the Governor on his transatlantic liner. 'Sorry we have to go off tomorrow and cannot wait to see you before doing so.' Unfortunately, the great man completely misunderstood the message and - according to the Bank's official history - it was only after landing at Liverpool that he realised that the international monetary structure for which he had striven for so long had collapsed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Rice Import and GATT Rules"] </F>   [Text] President Suharto opened a three-day national  coordination meeting on food industry at the National Palace in  Jakarta on Thursday (21/4). Adressing the ceremony, he said it  is not totally right to think that Indonesia would not be able  to sustain its rice self-sufficiency if it has to import rice  from other countries. The head of state said Indonesia can  still import rice, but at the same time it has to export its  rice. He said that Indonesia has to comply with this system  because this is a more profitable way of developing the national  food industry. According to the president, this mechanism can  also be applied to other commodities but inter-sectional  cooperation is essential in tackling difficulties in the  food-related businesses.    In the past, the import of rice had been linked to the issue  of Indonesia's inability to achieve self-sufficiency in the  commodity. This happened in 1991 when Indonesia imported 178  tons of rice, while there were no exports at all. In 1992,  Indonesia exported 72,000 tons and imported 63,000 tons of rice.  Indonesia had imported 375 tons and exported only 11,000 tons  prior to achieving self-sufficiency in 1984.    It is interesting to note that President Suharto's  observation on the food industry, especially when it is linked  to GATT rules on rice imports, signed recently at the GATT  ministerial conference in Marrakech, Morocco. Under the  agreement, every signatory is required to import rice amounting  to three percent of its domestic consumption. This means the  world rice market will be widened and that it will be possible  for Indonesia to increase exports of excess rice.    It has been reported that Indonesia's 1993 rice export  reached 30 million tons and its domestic consumption 25 million  tons. The extra five million tons are reserves and would be  exported should the surplus rise. Meanwhile, based on world  food statistics, the world supply of rice is about 12 million  tons or about four percent of the world output, or about 300  million tons. All this while the world rice market has been  dominated by the United States, Vietnam, and Thailand. These  three countries supply about 70 percent of the rice in the world  market. In such conditions, rice prices in the world market  have become unstable.    On the other hand, when all signatories are required to  strictly observe GATT rules on the rice trade, Indonesia is  required to import about 700,000 tons of rice. However, at the  Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in December 1993, Indonesia  managed to bargain for some relaxation to the rules. In the  meeting, Ibrahim Hasan, minister of state for food affairs and  head of the Logistics Board who was leading the Indonesian  delegation, explained Indonesia's difficulties in observing the  GATT rules in view of the characteristics of the world rice  market and the fact that it has a huge population to feed.    Some time ago, Syarifudin Baharsyah, minister of  agriculture,  announced that Indonesia had been forced to import 10,000 tons  of rice from the United States. This was not because Indonesia  faced a shortage, but the consequence of being one of the  signatories of the GATT multilateral trade agreement. With the  existence of the obligatory rice import rule, we can anticipate  that the considerable amount of rice being imported may  negatively affect our domestic rice market.    Even though the amount to be imported is relatively small  compared to the domestic consumption of 25 million tons,  Indonesia still has to take measures so that it will not affect  the domestic market where local farmers are the producers. In  addition, Indonesia must pick the quality of the rice it imports  from the United States. In connection with this, Ibrahim Hasan  said the rice imported would only be sold at special stores in  the country or consumed at hotels and restaurants.    Indonesia has to intensify efforts to increase its rice  exports to counter the pressure for rice imports due to the  minimum access opportunity (MAO) regulation under GATT. The  other alternative that Indonesia can resort to is to impose high  tariff barriers on imported rice. Somehow, in reality it looks  like Indonesia will pursue the two alternatives.    The nature of rice self-sufficiency achieved by Indonesia  depends on trend [two preceding words in English]. Its exports  or imports are based on economic considerations and efficiency.  On the basis of this, Indonesia has expressed its willingness  to import a maximum of 50 percent of the 70,000 tons of rice it  used to import with a 90 percent tariff quota. The tariffs to  be imposed on the remainder of the imports will depend on the  domestic price stability with a 180-percent tariff quota.  Ibrahim Hasan said Indonesia will also implement the CBO  (Ceiling Binding Offer) [preceding four words in English]  because CBO is more profitable than any open tariff system.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / California faces huge revenue refund / Assessing Barclays' tax suit as it reaches the US Supreme Court today Barclays Bank will have its chance today to argue in the US Supreme Court its 17-year-old case against California's unitary tax system. The British banking group, backed by an array of European governments and multinational corporations, complains that the unitary method of assessment, by which California calculates tax on a proportion of a group's worldwide income, unfairly taxes profits earned outside the state, and even outside the US. The nine justices of the court are to hear arguments on the Barclays case, with a similar case brought by Colgate-Palmolive, the household products group, which challenges the application of unitary taxation to US-owned groups. For California, which tiptoes along the brink of bankruptcy year after year, the stakes are high. If it were to lose the Barclays case, it would have to refund to the bank and other foreign groups about Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) it has already collected, and cancel another Dollars 400m it has assessed but not yet collected. If, on top of that, it were to lose to Colgate, it would have to refund another Dollars 1.3bn and cancel Dollars 2bn more in assessments. Mr Brad Sherman, chairman of the state Board of Equalisation, an elected tax commission, says losing the Dollars 4.1bn at stake would be 'an economic aftershock rivalling the damage done by the southern California earthquakes'. For foreign companies the issue is less financial, since California last year passed legislation that wipes out most of their objections to unitary taxation, also known as worldwide combination. The new law allows tax-payers to elect instead to be taxed under a 'water's edge' assessment that excludes all income earned outside the US. Even so, many companies and foreign governments fear that losing the case could encourage California and other states to move back to unitary taxation, which they see as threatening the whole structure of international tax law. 'There are many UK, German and Japanese companies which have made the water's edge election, even though it costs them more, because of their emotional opposition to the concept of worldwide combination,' said Mr Michael Lippman, partner for state and local tax issues at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting group. International tax treaties are built on the principle of arm's length taxation - a company's income on transactions with its parent and subsidiaries is assessed as though it were trading at arm's length with an independent company. Many US states, and some members of Congress, complain that this is impossible to calculate and allows multinationals to manipulate the transfer prices on transactions within the group so as to reduce their tax. Senator Byron Dorgan last week persuaded the Senate to pass a non-binding resolution in favour of unitary taxation, which uses a simple formula to calculate how much tax is owed in each state or country. 'Our current system is a huge bureaucracy that can't keep up with sophisticated multinationals that juggle income and avoid paying billions that should go to the US Treasury,' he said. The Supreme Court ruled in 1983, in the Container Corporation case, that California's unitary system was legal when applied to US companies, but it expressly set aside the question of whether that could be applied to foreign businesses. The essence of the Barclays case is that unitary taxation, because it conflicts with the arm's length principle preferred in international tax treaties, interferes with the federal government's right to speak for the US with a single voice on international commerce and is therefore unconstitutional. California responds that Congress has made its will very clear by refusing many opportunities to pass a law to ban unitary taxation by the states. Colgate's case is that to exempt foreign but not domestic companies from unitary taxation would be unfair. To win, it would have to persuade the Supreme Court to overturn, at least in part, its earlier Container decision. Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's conservative ideologue, is expected to lead support for California, in line with his usual position that, in the absence of explicit congressional action, the court should not interfere with the states. He is likely to receive the backing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas. On the other side, Justice Harry Blackmun was the lone dissenting voice last year in a case lost by Itel Corp against a Tennessee state tax. Judge Blackmun argued strongly against interpreting congressional silence as assent. The loneliest person in the court may be Mr Drew Days, US solicitor-general, who has the unenviable task of sustaining a brief that, in fulfilment of a campaign promise by President Bill Clinton, supports California, while not wholly repudiating the Justice Department's earlier briefs filed in support of Barclays. Washington lawyers expect the justices to question Mr Days harshly over this intellectual juggling act.</p>

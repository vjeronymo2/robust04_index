			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: The case for Africa CAMPING WITH THE PRINCE AND OTHER TALES OF SCIENCE IN AFRICA by Thomas Bass Lutterworth Press Pounds 15.95, 320 pages NOMAD: JOURNEYS FROM SAMBURU by Mary Anne Fitzgerald Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 16.95, 289 pages MONROVIA MON AMOUR: A VISIT TO LIBERIA by Anthony Daniels John Murray Pounds 17.95, 493 pages THE LINK between mouth rammers and pheromones, the fate of Africa, and why we should care, may not be immediately obvious. Read Thomas Bass's seminal book and find out. It not only gives reasons for not despairing of Africa; it suggests why it is in our self-interest to help a continent in crisis. Mouth rammers are fish found in Lake Malawi from whom we might learn more about our evolution; their cousins could help eliminate bilharzia, caused by water-borne parasites that debilitate millions in Africa and elsewhere. Pheromones are the molecular words used by insects to communicate. Research into their 'language' by a Kenyan institute could make insects our allies rather than adversaries in the battle against crop diseases. It is this combination of information that Africa holds, and the potential that could be unlocked, that makes Thomas Bass's account of seven scientific expeditions into Africa so important. President Hastings Banda's stewardship of Malawi becomes of more than passing concern when one learns that over-fishing Lake Malawi could threaten 'the most serious evolutionary laboratory in the world.' Its waters are home to 1,000 species of Cichlidae, a perchlike fish. In the process of evolving, Cichlidae have adopted virtually every form of fish behaviour, 'which makes the lake an encyclopaedic text for studying the mechanisms of evolution'. Mouth rammers, members of the Cichlidae family, provide one fascinating example. They are pedophagists: they attack a pregnant female, knock the eggs or fry out of her mouth, and eat them. If this seems an esoteric reason for being concerned that Lake Malawi is being over-fished, then consider the following. Cichlids may also help in the battle against bilharzia. Lake Malawi is free of the disease because several species of cyclids eat snails, including the type responsible for spreading the bilharzia parasites. The fate of Kenya becomes more pressing when one learns about the work of Thomas Odhiambo and his colleagues at Kenya's International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE). Pheromones are used for communications between insects; and insects and plants use other signals, known as semiochemicals, to communicate with each other: 'If scientists can learn to talk these languages, they should be able to direct insects among plants like boxcars in a switching yard.' It is unlikely that the ICIPE, the only research institute in the world devoted exclusively to the study of insects, could survive instability in Kenya. And if Mary Anne Fitzgerald is right, the country faces troubled times. But Nomad, her account of her travels and travails in and beyond Kenya, is more than a compassionate, engrossing account of Africa by one of the continent's most remarkable correspondents. It is the story of resilience in adversity, of how she rebounded after her expulsion from Kenya, home for 22 years, and the insights the experience afforded her. A white African living in limbo in London, she yearns for her homeland: 'I needed the comforting African odour of wood smoke, damp earth and rancid animal fat.' The way she comes to terms with this anguish makes Nomad into something more than a good book about Africa. The bleakest view of the continent comes from Anthony Daniels, who wrote an entertaining and pseudonymous indictment of Julius Nyerere's Tanzania (Filosofa's Republic, Pickwick Books). Reading his account of his visit to Monrovia in the aftermath of Liberia's horrific civil war is rather like travelling with a knowledgeable but opinionated companion, sometimes thought-provoking, sometimes entertaining, and sometimes so infuriating you wished you were in separate hotels. His dismissive, three-paragraph treatment of the US role in the tragedy prompted our first row. Washington sustained an evil regime, and then abnegated responsibility when it collapsed, I argued. Realpolitik, he replied, and could not resist lecturing me on liberals who protect Africa from the truth about itself. You do a similar disservice to your reader in your complacent treatment of Washington's record, I replied, getting hot under the collar. But I did not check out of our hotel.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Fujimori looks set to 'finish the job' PERU'S governing coalition has abandoned an impossibly tight race against the clock to get a new constitution promulgated by today, national independence day and third anniversary of President Alberto Fujimori's assumption of office. Parliamentary debate over a draft of the constitution is unlikely to be complete before mid-August. But the chief innovations - which include allowing the president to stand for a second successive term and the death penalty for convicted terrorists - already look set in stone. Both changes to the earlier 1979 constitution enjoy the virtually unanimous support of the majority alliance in congress, Cambio (Change) 90 and New Majority, both of which were created to support Mr Fujimori's candidacy. Both changes are almost certain, therefore, to become law, unless they are overturned by the referendum which Mr Fujimori has pledged before the constitution is approved. Many observers in Lima are convinced that the principal motive behind the military-backed coup last April, when congress was dissolved and the constitution suspended, was to ensure that Mr Fujimori could stand again. Since Mr Fujimori's earliest days in office, military and intelligence sources have stated their belief that a prolonged period of stable leadership was needed to consolidate the programme of liberal economic reforms begun in 1990. The new constitution is intended to enshrine those reforms, to 'embody very clear and tremendously precise rules which will attract foreign investors', in the words of Mr Victor Joy Way, Peru's second vice-president and a former trade and industry minister. 'We must free economic agents to shoulder responsibility for the development of the country - the state will no longer interfere nor intervene, simply orientate.' While the new constitution will be undoubtedly more 'modern' and economically liberal than its idealistic, socially-aware predecessor, lawyers complain it lacks coherence. Many grandly ambitious articles have been retained because they sound good - or to avoid confrontation with a vociferous parliamentary opposition. Innovations have been tacked on piecemeal. As the draft stands, the legislative body will be reduced to a single, 120-seat chamber. Representatives will continue to be elected via the traditional - and widely criticised - system of party lists. Reformers had hoped for the introduction of constituency-based elections to increase both regional representation and accountability. The questions of a second successive presidential term and the death penalty for terrorists have dominated an uninspired national debate, however. Successive terms for the head-of-state has traditionally been viewed with suspicion in Peru and other Latin American countries and is unconstitutional in most. But the 'Fujimori phenomenon' seems to have wiped clear the collective Peruvian memory. Mr Fujimori's domestic prestige and approval ratings, (still around 65 per cent, according to limited urban polls) are uncommonly high for a president past mid-term. The general feeling is that he should be given time to 'finish the job'. Mr Fujimori scoffs at the arguments against successive terms. 'Why should we follow the traditions of Latin America where corruption and poverty reign? We must break with taboos . . . modernise . . . look towards France, Spain, the US and Singapore,' he says. Introduction of the death penalty for convicted terrorists also appears to have broad popular backing. Peruvians believe that Sendero Luminoso and MRTA guerrilla leaders, held responsible for 26,000 deaths and Dollars 22bn in material damage over 13 years, richly deserve to die. One leading opposition congresswoman has even spoken of 'necessary social cleansing'. But the move will put Peru again on a collision course with human rights organisations. Crimes of terrorism in Peru are summarily heard by 'faceless' judges in secret military tribunals. Amnesty International recently expressed concern that, with the death penalty approved, 'prisoners could be executed . . . following conviction in military trials which fall short of international standards'. A last lament from constitutional critics concerns the enhancement of already wide presidential powers, including the right to dissolve congress, and to appoint ambassadors and senior military and other officials without need for congressional ratification. 'This is just what Peru does not need,' commented one senior diplomat in Lima. 'What Peru should be doing is to strengthen its institutions, not the person of its president.' For constitutional expert Mr Marcial Rubio, 'this one . . . will last only as long as Mr Fujimori remains in power; shortly after he leaves it will be drastically changed. But that's nothing new in Peru.'</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDITORS, PHILIPPINES IN ACCORD ON DEBT  </P> <P> The Philippine government and its major bank creditors said Wednesday that they  have substantially agreed on a financing package that would provide the country  with new loans and reduced debt.  </P> <P> The agreement, reached after only a week of negotiations, is the second since  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's debt-reduction plan was unveiled in  March. An agreement with Mexico was announced last month.  </P> <P> The bank committee represents creditors that are owed nearly half of the  Philippines' total debt of $28 billion. Because the banks involved are not  obliged to participate, it was not possible to determine the deal's exact  value.  </P> <P> Bankers had said Tuesday that the overall package would likely be worth  slightly less than the $1.7 billion that the Philippines requested when the  talks began Aug. 8.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Debt Buyback Plan  </P> <P> In a press release, the Philippine government and its bank advisory committee,  headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said the talks have focused on the  Philippines' intention to pursue its program in line with Brady's plan, which  includes debt reduction and access to new financing.  </P> <P> "Our objectives in this exercise were candidly expressed to the banks at the  outset of the talks," said Philippine Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez, who  led the country's negotiating team.  </P> <P> Bankers involved in the negotiations, which took only a week to conclude, said  the financing package is devised of a debt buyback plan that allows banks to  end their lending to the country or new loan options. The banks can choose  which course to take.  </P> <P> "The options of debt reduction and new lending are really directed at two  different categories of banks -- those that wish to exit from the process as  opposed to those that have determined to maintain their credit relationships in  the country," said David Pflug, senior vice president at Manufacturers Hanover.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financing 'Critical'  </P> <P> He said the panel of negotiators is convinced that the country needs new  financing and debt reduction.  </P> <P> "There is no question that we must reduce the country's existing stock of  commercial bank debt if we are to sustain the country's economic growth over  the longer term," Fernandez said.  </P> <P> He added that "new commercial bank financing is critical for our program as the  combined effect of our debt-reduction initiatives and our improving economy  work to bring about the end of the debt problem for the Philippines."  </P> <P> Veterans of the three-month-long negotiations with Mexico that yielded an  agreement July 23 said they were impressed by the speed and ease of the  Philippine talks. The talks had been expected to last two full weeks.  </P> <P> The Philippines and the committee of bankers negotiating on behalf of the  country's international bank lenders had already agreed to a lower interest  rate of 0.813% above the floating London Interbank Offer Rate on the new money,  bankers said. The Philippines pays 0.875% above the London interbank rate, a  main international benchmark.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Mayhew cautious over Ulster talks framework Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday warned that the government might be unable to agree with Dublin on a document to form the basis of a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick's note of caution came as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, attacked London for 'consistently trying to reduce the momentum of the peace process'. Meanwhile, Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, another senior Sinn Fein figure, warned that the process could break down if London insisted on paramilitary groups surrendering their weapons before agreement on political structures was in sight. These latest indications of the difficulty of the path ahead came on the eve of Sinn Fein's first meeting with the Republic's main political parties in the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Speaking in Dublin, Mr Adams dismissed the government's Irish policy as 'crisis management' and accused it of trying to avoid the political and constitutional change that was 'fundamental to a lasting peace settlement'. Sir Patrick told the first House of Commons debate on the province since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires that he greatly hoped London and Dublin would reach agreement but 'it is not certain'. His tone was less upbeat than that of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who met Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, at Chequers on Monday. Mr Major said after the talks that both were 'confident of being able to reach agreement'. Sir Patrick reaffirmed the government's readiness to hold preliminary talks with republican leaders by the end of the year if London could continue 'reasonably' to assume Sinn Fein was 'establishing a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods'. They would 'embrace the Republicans' proposals for depositing and de-commissioning their armaments', he said. Sir Patrick sought to reassure Unionists by saying there were no circumstances in which security would be reduced to a level below that needed to counter the threat of 'terrorist crime'. He hinted that the army would not pull out of the province entirely. Meanwhile, Dublin yesterday sought to play down the significance of a disclosure in yesterday's Financial Times that it had suggested draft amendments to article 2 of its constitution, defining Ulster as part of the republic's 'national territory'. Dublin said the reports were 'two or three months out of date'. The issue of article 2 was not raised at Chequers, an Irish spokesman said. 'At no stage has the British government asked the Irish government to define the nation in any way that would have left the Unionists out of the Irish nation.'

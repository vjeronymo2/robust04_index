			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS  </P> <P> In your recent article about a demonstration at Procter &amp; Gamble over the  increased use of dogs and ferrets in animal testing for their products, it was  implied that the Oxnard Republican Women's group was involved in the protest.  This is not the case.  </P> <P> The Oxnard Republican Women have not taken a stand and did not take a stand on  that day on the company's activities.  </P> <P> The implication mentioned above was derived by a reporter asking what groups  and organizations I was affiliated with. I am vice president, not president, of  Oxnard Republican Women; I will be installed as president on Dec. 7.  </P> <P> And, although as its newly installed president I may be working next year on  Assemblyman Tom McClintock's reelection campaign, I am not individually in  charge of it.  </P> <P> All those involved in the demonstration appreciate the Times' coverage of our  effort to alert the public to the unnecessary and cruel use of animals in  product testing.  </P> <P> BEVERLEE McGRATH  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

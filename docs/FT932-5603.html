			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Rebound in new home sales surprises analysts SALES OF new homes rose 22.7 per cent between March and April to an annual rate of 751,000, the highest level since the economic boom of the mid-1980s, the US Commerce Department reported yesterday, reports Michael Prowse in Washington. In a separate report, however, the department said the official index of leading indicators stagnated in April after a sharp decline in March. The leading index is designed to give early warning of changes in economic activity. The two reports were typical of recent economic statistics, which have been unusually volatile, frequently sending conflicting signals about the economy, which appears to be growing sluggishly after a depressed first quarter. Most forecasters had expected a small rebound in home sales after bad winter weather depressed the housing market in the first quarter. But the scale of the increase left analysts scrambling for explanations. The rebound was partly driven by improving fundamentals - the lowest mortgage rates in two decades and a relatively low ratio of home prices to incomes. But the outsized April increase also reflected downward revisions to figures for February and March and an erratic doubling of sales in the north-east, the region most affected by severe storms. Over the first four months as a whole, the annual rate of sales averaged 642,000, only fractionally above the average level in the second half of last year. April will thus have marked a turning point only if sales figures in May and June remain well above first quarter levels. The index of leading indicators rose 0.1 per cent between March and April, pointing to only a gradual improvement in the economy. Six of 11 components, led by an increase in the length of the working week, contributed positively to the increase in the leading index. Five components, led by a decline in industrial orders, made negative contributions. The official index of coincident indicators - a guide to current economic conditions - dropped 0.4 per cent in April after increases of 0.2 per cent in both February and March, confirming other signs of faltering recovery in recent months.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Technology: All fingers and thumbs - The search for a machine that reads prints A tussle is going on in the UK government over the politically sensitive issue of whether to bring in identity cards to tackle social security fraud. On one side is the Department of Social Security, which opposes such a move for the millions of social security claimants. On the other is the government's efficiency unit, which has just gained the support of the Treasury for its view in favour of identity cards. The Treasury's influence could be decisive in paving the way for the issue of cards. But whoever wins the argument, the search will go on for a foolproof biometric system of data access and cash and benefits dispensation. This is a system where a single body measurement, say a fingerprint, will suffice to identify a claimant and so authorise a payment. Thorn Secure Systems, part of Thorn-EMI of the UK, and Electronic Data Systems, the information technology subsidiary of General Motors of the US, are thought to be the frontrunners for welfare identity cards in Britain. They and others are believed to have offered various systems, including watermarks, handscans and fingerprints. All, however, would be linked to cards in some way - either swipe cards or smart cards. The problems with fingerprints are threefold: no one applies the same pressure twice; the angle of approach is always different; and scratches, cuts and scar tissue contaminate the print. This leads to an unacceptable level of false rejections and false acceptances. False acceptances can mean fraud; while false rejections can mean frustration - with a machine denying that you are who you say you are. The only fingerprint recognition system in operation over the past year is in Los Angeles County, for the welfare department's general relief scheme. Recently, it was extended to cover aid to families with dependent children. Well over 100,000 families are involved. Lisa Nunnez, the welfare department's head of computer services, claims the system, from software consultancy EDS, will save the county tens of millions of dollars each year. But she agrees that it is only 95 per cent effective, even though prints are taken from two fingers. This level of failure is probably too high for the UK, where there is a great aversion to identification cards of any kind. Cards linked to fingerprinting are a particular anathema, conjuring up images of criminal activity and a police state. Now, however, Harry Takhar of Jasper Consulting in Bemidji, Minnesota has made an extraordinary claim for a fingerprint biometric system, which may have cut the mistakes to an acceptable level. The problem is speed. To be useful in the real world, recognition must take only fractions of a second. Human fingerprint experts are adept at matching 'cold' prints with samples held in a fingerprint library, but they take minutes if not hours to complete a match. Computers are fast but cannot approach human pattern-recognition abilities. Takhar is enthusiastic about the way his system solves the problem. Prints are scanned raster-fashion, the way a television picture is built up, and the result processed to present a clean image. Elements of the print - distance from the core to the periphery, the numbers of whorls and arches and so on - are then calculated. Takhar describes this in terms of a child's join-the-dots picture. The fingerprint image represents the completed picture, the calculations place the dots in the picture. It is then possible to calculate a unique number from the position of the dots. Combined with other information - a social security number, for example - a 64-element number can be constructed which is unique to a particular fingerprint. Comparison with a reference number for the individual takes only a fraction of a second. Only the unique number is stored for each claimant; there is no need to maintain politically sensitive files of fingerprints. Takhar says his product cost Pounds 1m to develop. It combines the techniques of 'neural networking' - high-speed computing similar to the way some researchers believe the human brain operates - and 'fuzzy logic', which allows answers between 'true' and 'false'. These techniques are well understood. But eyebrows may be raised at Takhar's claim that, in volume, he can sell a complete system, hardware and software, for Dollars 300. According to Brian Maitland Reynell, government services director of EDS: 'Takhar has contacted us. My technical people are very sceptical. Biometrics is a very small world, and it seems highly unlikely that this man's system would not have been heard of. 'They feel the mathematical probabilities are against him. However, we are certainly prepared to take a look. We would need to take the thing apart and examine everything thoroughly.' David Arnold, business development and marketing director at Thorn's transaction (security card) division, says the same. 'Our technical people have heard from him and have done a preliminary test, but they would need to have a much closer look.' Takhar shrugs off the derision. 'We expected disbelief. But we have got international patents in place and now want to market our product.' Asked why companies are not beating a path to his door, he replies: 'They are. We only finalised the product last November and we wanted to make the product known to the public before we approached the big companies.' Takhar may be deluding himself, but as Reynell says: 'Stranger things have happened. We are definitely interested in checking out the system.'</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE WILL MISS NATIONAL TOURNEY, COACH DISAPPOINTED  </P> <P> Pepperdine men's basketball Coach Tom Asbury said he is disappointed that his  team, which finished the season with a 17-11 overall record, was not selected  for the National Invitation Tournament.  </P> <P> He added, however, that he believes the cancellation of the West Coast  Conference tournament after the death of Loyola Marymount star Hank Gathers was  the correct decision.  </P> <P> The Waves had been scheduled to play the University of San Diego in a  tournament semifinal, but the rest of the conference tournament was canceled  after Gathers collapsed in the first half of the Lions' semifinal against  Portland and later died.  </P> <P> Loyola, the WCC regular-season champion, was awarded the conference's automatic  bid to the NCAA tournament, but Pepperdine, which had hoped to go to the NIT  for a third straight year, did not make the NIT's 32-team field.  </P> <P> "Needless to say, it was a disappointing way for us to end our season," Asbury  said, "especially for the four seniors on the team (Craig Davis, Shann Ferch,  Dexter Howard and Tom Lewis).  </P> <P> "We went into the WCC tournament playing our best basketball of the season, and  the team was confident it could beat Loyola Marymount in the championship game.  (Pepperdine won eight of its last nine games.)  </P> <P> "Under the circumstances, the conference had to suspend the league tournament.  It was a difficult decision, but I believe the proper action was taken in light  of Hank's death."  </P> <P> The Waves had a 2-5 record against teams that are in the NCAA tournament. They  defeated Loyola Marymount and Towson State, but lost to Loyola Marymount,  Boston University, Kansas, North Carolina and UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Asbury said: "In retrospect, the close losses that we had during the first half  of the season came back to haunt us in March. We lost six ball games by a total  of 14 points. If we had won just three of those games, our record would have  been 20-8, and we would be preparing to play somebody this week."  </P> <P> Davis finished third among Pepperdine's career scoring leaders with 1,619  points, behind first-place Dane Suttle, who scored 1,702 in 1979-83, and  second-place Eric White, who had 1,674 in 1983-87. Davis also is first in  career steals with 173.  </P> <P> Lewis, who scored 475 points as a USC freshman, was fourth on the Waves  all-time chart at 1,575, and Howard finished sixth at 1,548, behind Levy  Middlebrooks, who had 1,546 points in 1984-88.  </P> <P> Six players from this season's roster are expected to return next season:  all-conference sophomore center Geoff Lear, sophomore forward Doug Christie,  sophomore center Damon Braly, freshman forward Steve Guild, junior  forward-center Rex Manu and sophomore guard Rick Welch. Freshman redshirts  Damin Lopez, a guard, and Derek Noether, a forward, also should be back.  </P> <P> Sophomore center Mark Georgeson, seriously injured in an auto accident in  February, is recuperating from hip surgery and is not expected to play next  season.  </P> <P> Three high school seniors who signed early letters of intent with Pepperdine  are guards Steve Clover of Rolling Hills High, Rodney Sanders of Fairfax and  forward Dana Jones of North Hollywood High.  </P> <P> The All-Western State Conference men's basketball team included sophomore Mark  Moton and freshman Cornelius Banks of Santa Monica College, and sophomore  Anthony Gates of West Los Angeles College. Honorable mention went to WLAC  freshman Booker Waugh and SMC freshman Donald Smith.  </P> <P> Santa Monica College women basketball players Jackie Nikzad and Illana Mazingo  were named to the All-Western State Conference team. Crystal Nettles of SMC  made the second team, and honorable mention went to Katarina Nordin and CoCo  Jones.  </P> <P> Nikzad made 108 three-point baskets this season, which led the nation and set a  state record.  </P> <P> The UCLA women's gymnastics team (10-3), three-time defending Pacific 10  Conference champion, will compete in the conference championships at 7:30 p.m.  Saturday at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Last week the Bruins lost at Georgia, 192.55 to 191.35.

She also won the vault with a 9.8, the beam with a 9.85 and floor exercise with  a 9.85.  </P> <P> Freshmen Rhonda Faehn and Carol Ulrich were second and third, respectively, in  the all-around, and each had career-high marks in two events, Faehn with a 9.8  on the bars and a 9.6 on the beam and Ulrich with a 9.6 on bars and a 9.75 on  beam.  </P> <P> The second-ranked UCLA women's tennis team (13-2 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10  as the week began) will play host to Texas at 1:30 p.m. today at the Sunset  Canyon courts on campus.  </P> <P> Last week the Bruins, playing without top singles players Jessica Emmons and  Kimberly Po, who were both injured, lost to USC, 5-4.  </P> <P> A winner of seven straight matches, the No. 5 Pepperdine men's tennis team  (13-2 at the start of the week) will play host to North Carolina at 1:30 p.m.  Friday and No. 10 Kentucky at 1:30 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Senior David Wells-Roth (9-4) is ranked 12th in the nation in singles and  freshman Alejo Mancisidor (13-2) is No. 50.  </P> <P> The No. 8 UCLA men's tennis team is 15-2 after defeating West Virginia, 6-3,  last week.  </P> <P> Junior Jason Netter, who had lost seven of his previous 13 matches, won four  straight in the Southern California Intercollegiate tournament in Pasadena,  advancing to the semifinals before rain halted the tournament.

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Aid efforts to CIS republics criticised THERE are significant gaps in the efforts of industrial nations to spread economic, management and political expertise to the former Soviet republics, says a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Reviewing 'technical assistance', or the spread of know-how to the newly independent states, the OECD said: Western donor countries were providing insufficient guidance to the republics on environmental problems. The donors' aid efforts, in both the humanitarian and know-how sectors, gave too little attention to the republics' need to improve shelter, housing and construction. The number of projects aimed at building democracy was, at only 2 per cent, too small in view of the republics' inexperience in such matters. The provision of expertise about health and social safety nets is neglected in some republics. The geographical spread of technical assistance is uneven, with the needs of the central Asian republics being crowded out by larger republics. The OECD's report was prepared for a meeting in Tokyo later this month of ministers and officials from up to 70 donor and recipient countries and international organisations. This will take a critical look at the provision of technical and humanitarian aid to the former Soviet republics. Aid officials say pressure is growing to abandon 'horizontal' co-ordination of assistance across the republics of the former Soviet Union in favour of aid that is tailored to the needs of individual states.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 14 (ANTARA) -- Minister of Mines and  Energy I.B. Sujana said Monday that OPEC's strategy of  maintaining static quota of 24.2 million barrels per day (BPD)  is effective in keeping prices at the stable level.    The static quota has up to the second quarter of this year  proved to be effective in stabilising prices, and therefore it  is expected that the quota will be maintained until the end of  this year, the minister said.    OPEC countries must also maintain their discipline,  violating  their respective quota, Sujana said when installing a number of  senior officials at the state-owned Perum Gas Company.    In reply to a question in connection with the planned  meeting  of the price monitoring committee of OPEC's oil ministers in  Vienna on June 15, the minister said that the decision by OPEC  to maintain the production level is correct.    The OPEC oil ministers will discuss in the Vienna meeting  the  developments of oil prices, the minister said adding that the  present quota was decided in March in anticipation of an  increase in demand for oil supplies.    The prediction of increased demand was based on the recovery  of economies of advanced countries after recession over the past  few years.    Although the dry season has fallen in the countries of the  Northern Hemisphere, the oil demand on the world market remains  stable so that prices are improving.    According to the minister, the other factor which  contributes  to the improving price is the on-going repair of oil  installations in the North Sea producer countries.    Supply of oil from the North Sea producing state was reduced  temporarily as a result of the installation repair.    It seems that the non-OPEC producers have yet to increase  their output from 4.5 million barrels per day to 5.3 million BPD.    Besides, the discipline of the OPEC members to abide by  their  respective production quota was able to prevent oil oversupply,  he added.    The minister said that oil price at present is about 16 US  dollars per barrel, higher than the price during the March-April  period which stood at US$13 per barrel.    The price of Indonesian minas oil has since last month  reached 15.9 dollars per barrel, he said.    He expressed the hope that the OPEC oil ministers will in  the  next meeting reach consensus that will continue to improve oil  prices.    Minister Sujana said that the agenda of the meeting  consisted  of 15 items, including the succession of OPEC secretary general.    Current OPEC secretary general Subroto is to complete his  tenure of office this month.    Sujana said that Subroto cannot be elected for the next  period as he had occupied the post for two consecutive terms.    Venezuela's Oil Minister Dr. Parra and his Iranian  counterpart Gholam Reza Aqazadeh are strong candidates for the  secretary general post.    For Indonesia, the two candidates have similar commitment to  OPEC, the minister said.</p>

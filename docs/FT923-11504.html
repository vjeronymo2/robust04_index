			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Elf leads east German oil project ELF Aquitaine, the French oil group, and Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday confirmed that they had won a DM6bn (Dollars 4.5bn) contract to take over and modernise eastern Germany's main petrol station network and build an oil refinery there. Elf, majority owned by the French government, is to take full control of Minol, which owns more than 1,000 filling stations in eastern Germany, or 74 per cent of the market. Elf will also have two-thirds control of a joint venture to build one of Europe's largest oil refineries, with a capacity of 10m tonnes a year. The facility is scheduled to open in 1996 at the Leuna chemical complex. Thyssen will hold the remaining third of the joint venture. This is the largest Franco-German investment since the second world war and confirms an outline deal struck in January with the Treuhand, the body handling eastern German privatisations. The project will support between 6,000 and 10,000 jobs in the east. The deal reinforces France's position as the biggest foreign buyer of privatised eastern German companies, with FFr7.7bn (Dollars 1.54bn) of investment since unification, not including the Elf deal. However, western German buyers hold 95 per cent of the privatised eastern companies, in spite of the Treuhand's efforts to stimulate more foreign interest. Elf and Thyssen won the deal in competition against two rival groups, one headed by British Petroleum and Italy's Agip oil concern, and the other involving Middle Eastern interests including Mannai Corp and Kuwait Petroleum. The acquisition of Minol, which will function under Elf's brand name, will double the French company's 4 per cent share of the overall German filling station market. This would lead to an inevitable loss of market share by Minol as competition from other distributors builds up in the east, said Elf officials. Of the total DM6bn investment, DM4.3bn will go on the Leuna refinery. Elf and Thyssen are taking over a petrochemicals producer at Zeitz, near Leuna, and Elf also plans to buy on the site a formaldehyde resin plant, which uses methanol. Elf and L'Air Liquide, the French industrial gases producer, plan to build a plant at Leuna to make hydrogen peroxide - used in bleach and disinfectant. Leuna already has two inefficient and polluting oil refineries which will continue production until the new plant is ready. The Treuhand will then take them over and arrange for their dismantling. Elf also plans to discuss with local partners the possible construction of an oil pipeline from the port of Rostock to feed the refinery.</p>

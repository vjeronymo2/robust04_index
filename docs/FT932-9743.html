			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: FASB rule would cut earnings, study says HIGH-TECH companies in the US face a 49.5 per cent reduction in earnings if a recently-proposed accounting ruling is approved, according to a study released today by Wyatt Company, a leading consulting firm in employee benefits. Companies outside the high-tech sector would see earnings decline by a more modest 5.8 per cent, the study found. The survey comes as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) prepares its official draft of new rules governing the disclosure and accounting methods for share options. The proposed measures would make companies report the value of share options granted to employees and deduct them from profits. Wyatt based its findings on a survey of 139 companies in the high-tech, service and minerals/manufacturing sectors. It found the median option value at high-tech companies was 58.8 per cent of the actual stock price on the date of the option grant, against 35.9 per cent for other companies. In addition, the average high-tech company grants nearly five times as may options to employees as other companies. If the FASB proposal goes ahead in its present form, most companies outside the high-tech sector will not alter their stock-option policies, said Wyatt. 'Apparently, most of these companies assume that sophisticated financial analysts will look beyond this expense in assessing company performance, value and potential,' said Mr Matt Ward, a Wyatt consultant. Wyatt's findings may give weight to critics of the FASB proposal who claim it will have a disproportionate impact on start-up companies with little working capital. FASB will release its official draft in June. If adopted, the full proposal would not take effect before 1997.</p>

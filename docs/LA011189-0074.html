			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo explained to President-elect Bush his  country's concern over the prolonged presence of thousands of Nicaraguan  Contras in bases in Honduras. "I told him we needed some time . . . to  formulate our policies," Bush told reporters in a terse statement after the  30-minute meeting in Washington. Azcona said he outlined for Bush the  "difficult situation of Honduras in this problem of the Contra revolution."  Since Congress suspended military aid to the rebels last February, most of the  estimated 12,500 Contras have suspended operations in Nicaragua and withdrawn  to bases in Honduras near its border with Nicaragua.  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Treasury upbeat on recovery A buoyant view of the economic recovery was presented in the Treasury's monthly monetary report yesterday. The report was published as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, met Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, to discuss whether a rate cut was needed in the midst of turmoil in the financial markets. The Treasury report dismisses a number of recent economic statistics, which appeared to suggest that the recovery was weakening, on the grounds that they were caused by seasonal factors. Describing the fall in manufacturing output in December, the report says: 'The difficulty of seasonal adjustment around holiday periods always casts extra uncertainty on the allocation of output between December and January.' The surprise rise in unemployment in January is described as being 'broadly consistent with a continuing improvement in labour market conditions'. Overall, the report says: 'The latest indicators are mixed, but consistent with a trend of continuing recovery.' Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The Treasury is clearly trying to talk up the recovery. This will be one of its major themes as long as the story is remotely plausible.' The Treasury's optimism was given some support by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, who said that regional members were becoming increasingly confident that the recovery remained on course. Mr Davies said that given the turmoil in financial markets the CBI was not calling for an imminent rate cut. The chancellor and the governor will have decided whether to cut base rates at yesterday's meeting. The timing is in the Bank's hands. Mr Briscoe feels a unilateral UK rate cut is implausible but one might occur as part of a co-ordinated international series of cuts. Meanwhile, reports from two analysts, published today, predict higher interest rates in 1995. Mr Bill Martin of UBS says base rates will have to rise from the current 5.25 per cent to 10 per cent by the end of next year as underlying inflation hits 5 per cent and headline inflation surges to 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1995. Mr David Kern of National Westminster Bank sees a more modest rise in base rates to 6.5 per cent by the end of 1995, with headline inflation averaging 4 per cent next year.</p>

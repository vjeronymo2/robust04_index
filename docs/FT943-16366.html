			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): JCB's venture offer Whatever happened to corporate venturing, the practice of big companies making equity investments in private businesses? It is in rude health in the US, less so in the UK, is the verdict of University of Southampton researcher Kevin McNally. But it is not as moribund in the UK as its recent absence from the limelight might suggest, he says. Supporting this assertion last week was an unusual open offer to engineers from JCB, one of the UK's biggest private companies and maker of the ubiquitous yellow construction equipment. Sir Anthony Bamford, JCB chairman, has invited designers, inventors and companies with under-funded engineering projects to contact his company with ideas which need backing*. Based partly on altruistic interest in the development of a stronger manufacturing base in the UK and partly on self-interest, Sir Anthony believes many more companies have the potential to follow JCB's successful path if given an early and understanding leg up. He is coy about the total cash on offer. But he suggests up to Pounds 1m could be available for the right projects. JCB, he says, is not looking for a quick return. It would also lend the services either of an executive director or a nucleus of recently retired directors to pass on JCB experience. JCB's move appears to be going against the trend towards concentration on core businesses that has so far marked the 1990s. Indeed, several companies, notably BP and Hillsdown, have closed their corporate venturing arms in recent years. But there is a sign of renewed interest, McNally says, particularly from some UK utilities seeking to diversify. However, past experience suggests converting that interest into a cheque may yet be a hard struggle. * Sir Anthony Bamford, JCB, Rocester, Staffordshire, ST14 5JP</p>

General Dynamics ended 1992 with some Dollars 950m in cash and marketable securities. The company's fourth-quarter net earnings totalled Dollars 174m, or Dollars 5.59 a share, compared with Dollars 166m, or Dollars 3.87, in the corresponding period of last year. The company repurchased some 30 per cent of its shares outstanding last July. Earnings from continuing operations, which excludes businesses up for sale, totalled Dollars 153m, or Dollars 4.92 a share, on sales of Dollars 915m. This included a tax credit of Dollars 95m and a Dollars 14m after-tax gain from the sale of securities. Fourth-quarter 1991 earnings from continuing operations were Dollars 7m, or 16 cents a share. For the full year, total net earnings were Dollars 815m, or Dollars 21.56 a share, against Dollars 505m, or Dollars 11.80, in 1991, on revenues of Dollars 3.4bn, up from Dollars 3.3bn. The company's funded backlog for continuing operations at the end of 1992 stood at Dollars 7.7bn, down from Dollars 8.7bn at the end of 1991. The company's nuclear submarines operations earned Dollars 25m in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 21 a year ago, while armoured vehicles made Dollars 40m, compared with Dollars 26m.

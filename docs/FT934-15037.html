			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (34): Global village gathers speed - Mickey Kantor argues that, while other economies move towards greater openness, European protectionist impulses are growing / Guest column IN NOVEMBER, the United States will host a very important meeting in Seattle, the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) gathering of foreign, economic and trade ministers, as well as a meeting of Apec leaders. While most people have never heard of Apec, I would wager that this will change in the next few years. As a new organisation, it is growing in importance and taking on a greater role in facilitating commerce in Asia. Meanwhile, we have completed negotiations on supplemental agreements on the environment and labour to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and are working towards its passage in the US congress. President Clinton has made clear he supports additional countries in South America joining Nafta, assuming they have made the proper steps towards trade opening and expansion in order to create jobs and spur economic growth. With Apec and Nafta, the United States is taking advantage of the two fastest growing areas in the world: Asia and Latin America. Many of those countries have chosen, in recent years, to cast off the controls on their economies and the shackles on their political systems. The Asia Pacific region has had the fastest growth in the world for 30 years. East Asia is the number one export market for US products. US trans-Pacific trade was 50 per cent more than its trans-Atlantic trade in 1992. Since 1989, US exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have increased more than 50 per cent and are growing at more than twice the rate of US exports to the rest of the world, making this region our second fastest growing market. They have become a growing market for US products; 43 per cent of Latin American imports come from the US. Meanwhile, while the economies of most of the world are moving towards greater openness, European protectionist impulses are growing, particularly in the areas of autos and agriculture. The most recent example is France's insistence on renegotiating the Blair House Accord, which would reduce agricultural subsidies tied to production. The French position, which threatens the entire Uruguay Round, is opposed by nearly every country, especially those that export agricultural products. This leaves some wondering if the United States is turning away from Europe  -its ally and close trading partner for decades. Others worry that the world is entering a period with regional trading blocs competing against each other. The United States will have an active role in Europe for as long as we can see. Our desire in Europe is to have greater access for US goods, not to see US businesses focus on other parts of the globe. If Europe blocks efforts to expand trade, it will be hurting itself most. US trade will continue to expand with Asia and Latin America, and Europe will be left out. As to the concern for regional trading arrangements, they have emerged as a new tier in the world trading system. The fact is, they are here to stay. The question is whether they will facilitate global trade, or hinder it and result in competing blocs. The Clinton administration believes they can be used to facilitate global trade by two methods. First, they can prepare developing nations for admittance into the global trading system. Second, they can serve as a complement to global trading arrangements and a way to lubricate those negotiations when they are stuck. For example, one of the greatest trade priorities of this administration - if not the greatest priority - is to complete the Uruguay Round and then move into further discussions that will reduce trade barriers worldwide. The Uruguay Round has taken seven years, an absurd length of time, especially when a good part of that period has been characterised by a global recession which would have been eased by the reduction of trade barriers that would result from completion of the Round. Issues that will arise in future Gatt discussion, such as environmental co-operation and investment, will be discussed by the nations of Apec. To the extent that the United States can move an issue forward in regional trade discussions when it is stalemated in global discussions, it will do so. The United States supports a stronger, more active Apec that will take on a role as a forum for consultations on trade policy and expansion of trade and investment with a goal of lowering trade barriers in-the region and supporting the multilateral system. While Apec is still evolving, it is clear that it is developing into just such an organisation. The Clinton administration's trade policy is based on a new reality: we are living in a post-Cold War global economy. We are committed to building the strongest, most productive, most competitive economy in the world and expanding high wage and high skill job opportunities for United States workers. We are finally facing the fact that our economy, as well as the global economy is changing. Economies of the world are no longer self-contained. We all compete in a global economy, where capital and technology are mobile. These trends are here to stay. The question is not whether we adapt to them, but how. Our economic strategy - reducing our budget deficit, health care reform, reinventing government, changes in education, worker training and investing in technology - works in pursuit of the same objective: to build a more productive and competitive economy. Our trade policy is an essential part of that strategy. Opening up new markets is the key to new job creation and economic growth. So the United States is anxious to seek out opportunities in areas of fast growth, such as Asia and Latin America, with the hope that new trade agreements in those areas will increase opportunities for US companies and workers, while also moving multilateral talks forward. But the existence of the new global economy is also a fact for Europeans workers. Concluding talks such as the Uruguay Round will ultimately help European workers and consumers, it should be remembered. These regional trading arrangements - with Nafta, an actual free trade agreement; with Apec, a forum for discussions among the most dynamic economies in the world - ensure that these nations continue to grow, that they are brought into the global trading system. In addition, these arrangements ensure that the movement towards more democratic governments and more open political and economic systems - which triggered the energetic growth in Asia and Latin America - will continue. So we are not turning away from old responsibilities in Europe; we are embracing new responsibilities and engagement in Asia and the Americas. Mickey Kantor is US trade representative</p>

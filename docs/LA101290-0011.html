			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EMPEROR HAS NO PRINCIPLES;  </P> <P> PRESIDENT: THE BUDGET FIASCO REVEALS BUSH'S LACK OF INTEREST IN OR BELIEFS ON  DOMESTIC POLICY; HE'S VAGUE EVEN ON TAX ISSUES SO DEAR TO REPUBLICANS.  </P> <P> The budget fiasco in the nation's capital has left few politicians untarnished,  but the damage to President Bush is particularly serious -- for good reason.  The President has revealed to the nation's voters that you can't have the  courage of your convictions if you lack convictions.  </P> <P> Bush reached the White House without ever pausing to reflect on what principles  guide his approach to the domestic bargaining process. He not only appears to  be rootless, he is rootless. He occupies a philosophical ground as ill-defined  as his home bases in Connecticut, Maine and Texas.  </P> <P> My guess is that the reason Bush cares much more about foreign policy than  domestic issues lies in his personal history. Family wealth sheltered him from  the consequences of the Depression, when the welfare-state questions that still  dominate the domestic agenda were formed. But his life was wrenched out of its  expected pattern by World War II, teaching him before he was 20 that  national-security issues really are life-and-death matters.  </P> <P> Still, his lack of involvement in domestic policy is stunning. Although he  served on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee back in the '60s, there is  no evidence that the experience deepened his understanding of the revenue  system. Even as vice president in the eight years of the Reagan Administration,  when the tax code went through several major overhauls, Bush managed to avoid  thinking about the basic principles that should shape the code.  </P> <P> His original view of Reagan's crusade to reduce marginal tax rates was  skeptical. The "voodoo economics" phrase he applied when running against Reagan  in the 1980 primaries came from his aide, Peter Teeley, but it captured Bush's  doubts. Once on the ticket with Reagan, however, he swallowed his reservations  and kept them down during all his time as vice president.  </P> <P> But his attention to the topic was fleeting and fragmentary. He lobbied for  oil-industry tax breaks in the 1986 code revision as casually as he latched on  to the proposal for a capital-gains tax cut in the 1988 campaign and again this  year.  </P> <P> This absence of a guiding principle, let alone an overall plan, has left  everyone -- including his own fellow Republicans -- in doubt about where Bush  really is on the question of the tax policy that has been one of the two or  three real anchors of Republican politics for the past dozen years. His  flip-flops this past week are not out of character; they fit a pattern.  </P> <P> That same equivocation applies to basic social issues, including abortion,  education and affirmative action. And it applies to basic issues of governance,  such as the question of term limits.  </P> <P> Fortunately, he can still "draw a line in the sand" of foreign policy and have  it accepted. But his eroding domestic credibility will make even that strength  harder to maintain.  </P></p>

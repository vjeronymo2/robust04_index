			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by JINRONG SHIBAO correspondent Ji Sanmeng (6060 </F> 0005 3718): "Review of the Past and Prospects of the Future  Performance of the Bank of Communications--Meeting the  Challenges of Financial Reform"]    [Text] The State Council decided in 1986 for the Bank of  Communications to resume domestic business operations. The  leadership of the People's Bank of China pointed out at that  time that this would be an experimental arrangement, that the  Bank of Communications would operate as the bank of the reform,  but not become a reform target.    What kind of an experiment will it then be, and what kind of  a reform?  <H3>  I. No More Feeding From the "Large Rice Bowl" in the  Financial System </H3>   The fundamental reasons for this kind of an experiment by  China's financial establishment had been the sharp  contradictions that had arisen since the start of reform and  opening up to the outside world between the pressing needs for  capital funds and China's inappropriate financial and monetary  system.    Throughout the country, everybody wanted to start up  large-scale developments, great undertakings, and new projects.  All this needed money, and people rushed to the State Planning  Commission and the Ministry of Finance, but that ministry's  funds were limited. If some items were serviced, funds were  short for others, and then the banks would be asked to grant  loans. In the end, as loans were granted year after year,  deficits increased year after year. Later, everybody got to know  the ingenious way of "business on borrowed money," everybody  borrowed from the banks, and economic development was being  pursued with much borrowing, as expressed in such common sayings  as "much in and much out," "borrow a hen to lay eggs," and  "borrow a ship to sail the oceans."    Development was given priority, while reforms were being  held  up. In all quarters, high and low, right and left, pressure was  put on the banks, as everybody tried to squeeze money out of  them.    The organizational system of China's state banks was one of  soft restraints, so that anyone clever enough could always  squeeze some money out of the banks. If the lower-level banks  would be out of cash, they would ask their superior  establishments for allocations, and if these higher-ranking  banks would be out of cash, they would ask for money supplies  from the central bank. "Enterprises were feeding from the `large  rice bowl' of the specialized banks, and the specialized banks  were feeding from the `large rice bowl' of the People's Bank of  China." This system of soft restraints left almost no other  devices to the central bank and for the state in its  macro-regulation and control of the economy than to take  administrative measures, which would then "cut everything with  one and the same knife." On the other hand, it is  characteristic of administrative measures that "applied loosely,  they will lead to chaos, and applying stricter restraint, they  will be fatal strangleholds." Their remedies will only be  superficial, and if applied repeatedly will inflict immeasurable  damage on the Chinese economy.    Is there then no better way?  <H3>  II. Indeed, One Ship Has Already Been Launched on its Long  Experimental Journey </H3>   Policymakers in China's financial establishment are now  planning to change the said situation: First, a balance has to  be established as between development and reform; it is just not  possible under the old system of organization to maintain the  drive for high-speed development. Second, the state's  specialized banks are to be converted into state-owned  commercial banks. These banks should truly become financial  enterprises with autonomy in their business operations,  responsibility for profits and losses, and that operate with  self-restraint and responsibility for self-development. Third,  separate banks shall be set up for "state policy-directed"  operations. These banks shall be specially charged with the  handling of all "state policy-directed" financial operations.  Fourth, the position and functions of the central bank shall be  strengthened. The second point in fact constitutes the core of  the entire financial reform.    Reforming the banks as they presently exist will be an  extremely protracted and arduous process. The fastest method  would be to set up a new bank, operate it as an experiment, and  if successful promote the experience on a broader scale.  Finally, we may cite the case of the newly reconstituted Bank  of Communications, which is already engaged in experimental  operations since the end of 1986.    This is the first publicly owned bank of the shareholding  system. The central bank, representing the state, is controlling  23 percent of the shares, finance departments of various local  governments are holding 42 percent, and various state-owned  enterprises are holding 35 percent of the shares.    It is the first bank with a comprehensive sphere of business  operations; it has the capability to transact at all times  foreign remittance, securities, leasing, insurance, real estate,  and investment business.    It is the first bank establishing branches throughout the  country according to the location of economic centers, and not  according to administrative regions.    It is the first commercial bank with responsibility for its  own profits and losses, with autonomy in its business  operations, with responsibility for self-development and  self-restraints, bearing responsibility for risks taken, and,  all of its own, endeavoring to maintain a well-balanced fund  situation.    The central bank granted the Bank of Communications a large  array of powers, which actually had been of the nature that the  various large state-owned special banks at that time had yearned  for for a long time. However, the central bank had decisively  cut its links with the Bank of Communications as a supplier of  funds. If the Bank of Communications should run out of cash, it  might as well declare bankruptcy, but will definitely not be  allowed to stretch out its hand to demand money from the central  bank! This amounts to having the Bank of Communications, even  though only recently reconstituted, so to say, fight with its  back to the wall.  <H5>  III. Victory in its Initial Battle </H5>   On 10 December 1986, when the Bank of Communications had  been  operating in Shanghai on an experimental basis for not quite two  months, it is very interesting to hear what some of its  customers have to say during this period of its experimental  operations.    The director of Shanghai No 7 Watch Factory said: "The Bank  of Communications approached us on their own accord three times,  inviting us to open an account with them. We have never before  met with that much warmhearted enthusiasm...."    The director of the Shanghai Sports Shoe Main Factory said:  "For many years we have tried to raise funds to build a new  factory building, but have been rebuffed everywhere. Much steel  material has been stored in the open and was getting rusty. It  was then that the Bank of Communications helped us out with a  loan, `sending charcoal in snowy weather,' as the saying is...."    After having been in business for four months, the Shanghai  Branch of the Bank of Communications had taken in 530 million  yuan of deposits at its deposit department; the per capita  deposits exceeded 100 million yuan.    Li Xiangrui [2621 4382 3843], the then president of the Bank  of Communications, went every day several times personally to  the big hall of the bank building. He was that eager to have  everybody come to the Bank of Communications! In the past, when  he had been president of the People's Bank, he had never been so  concerned about these kind of things.    After four years, the Nanpu Bridge project, that had  attracted worldwide attention, has been completed. The one that  had undertaken financial responsibility for this huge  engineering project was none other than the Bank of  Communications, as it had then just started operating.    At that time, the chief engineers were rather contemptuous  of  the young female whom the Bank of Communications had sent them  as head of the bank's loan department. They even asked: "Bank  of Communications? Never heard of it?"    After the spring and summer of 1989, the Asian Development  Bank temporarily suspended further loans for the Nanpu Bridge  project in Shanghai, and work came to a halt. It was then that  the Bank of Communications bravely stepped forward, determined  to make use of its own banking reputation in the international  financial market to raise funds for the project. It was  precisely the female employee of the loan department, whom those  oldsters had treated contemptuously, who had arduously struggled  on her computer for 10 days, produced a plan to raise funds for  the project, and who had startled everybody with her expose at  the meeting of those in authority, where her plan was  immediately approved.    On 17 August 1988, the Bank of Communications issued in  Singapore bonds to the amount of $100 million, which were an  immediate success!  <H3>  IV. Soul of the Bank of Communications: Control of  Assets-Liabilities Ratio </H3>   A person with inside knowledge of the Bank of Communications  once said: "The soul of the Bank of Communications is control of  its assets-liabilities ratio."    The basic cause for the phenomenon of "everybody feeding  from  the big iron banking bowl" was precisely that there was no firm  self-restraint in matters of bank loans. The thousands of large  and small banks shifted the pressures of society's demand for  funds on to the shoulders of the central bank, compelling the  central bank to again and again expand its scale, increase its  currency issue, and thus create an uncontrolled situation as far  as the currency was concerned.    What if all banks could themselves bear these pressures?    The Bank of Communications is a publicly owned bank of the  shareholding system. Its ownership is separate from its  management right. If it were to run out of money, its  shareholders would not stand it, and management would have a  hard time.    The Bank of Communications has therefore gradually perfected  three large systems: One is the system of controlling the use  ratio of funds, the other is the system of supervising and  checking the quality of its assets, and the third is the system  of composite analysis of its financial targets. These together  may be called "the system of controlling the assets-liabilities  ratio and the system of controlling the risks."    The major points of this system are: The total amount of  loans must not exceed 85 percent of the aggregate of bank  deposits plus capital funds plus annual accumulations. The  provision of ready cash must not be lower than 15 percent of  total deposits. Fiduciary loans must be limited to within 20  percent of the total amount of loans. Overdue loans must be  controlled to within 6 percent. Slow-moving and uncollectible  accounts must be controlled to within 3 percent.    The Bank of Communications and its various branch  institutions are setting up assets-liabilities control  committees at every level. These will effect periodical checks,  and on the basis of such decide on the promotion or transfer of  managers and on the bonuses and welfare benefits for staff and  workers.    Up to the end of last year, the Bank of Communications has  not taken a penny of the central bank's money, but even had a  deposit surplus of 12 billion yuan over loans. In transactions  with associated banks, its short-term loans to them were 10.7  billion yuan above short-term borrowing from them. Overdue,  stagnant, and uncollectible loans accounted for 4.66 percent of  all loans, and among these the uncollectible accounts amounted  to 0.07 percent.    The assets of the Bank of Communications are, within the  domestic financial system, undoubtedly first grade quality.</p>

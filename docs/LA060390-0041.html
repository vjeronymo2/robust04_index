			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts  (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek San Francisco burglar who falls for a  high-tech interior designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her  stolen diaries.  </P> <P> Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.)  finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an  all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), whose sons (Corey Haim,  Christopher Collet), ages 10 and 15 respectively, view with increasing horror.  </P> <P> The deft and amusing Back to the Beach (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.)  imagines that Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party"  movies of the early '60s got married and settled down in Ohio where Frankie has  become a workaholic champion car salesman and Annette a model housewife and  mother; what gets them back to Malibu is a visit to their daughter. The film is  nostalgic without being embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or  cynical.  </P> <P> Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty  Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis  as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice  Hitchcock touches along the way.  </P> <P> Battle Beyond the Stars (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon  with a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor.  </P> <P> Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of  the most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love  triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere,  Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious  70mm camerawork.  </P> <P> The Kidnapping of the President (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980  theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a  U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director  William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to  disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner.  </P> <P> Elia Kazan's unforgettable 1955 film of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (Channel  13 Friday at 8 p.m.) stars James Dean as the tormented Salinas Valley youth  with a stern father (Raymond Massey) and a mother (Jo Van Fleet) who turns out  to be the local hard-bitten madam.  </P> <P> A Special Day (Channel 28 Saturday at 10:40 p.m.), Ettore Scola's stunning 1977  film of strong contemporary implications, teams Sophia Loren as weary,  oppressed Roman housewife and mother of six and Marcello Mastroianni as a  homosexual threatened with imminent deporation to a concentration camp who meet  during Hitler's triumphant procession through Rome on May 6, 1938.  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: A desperate need for hits in an intensive price war / A look at Amstrad, a 1980s success story, as it reports a first-time loss IN EARLY 1990, after Amstrad had suffered a sharp deterioration in profits, Mr Alan Sugar emerged from one of the rockiest periods in his company's history and declared that he had put the bad times behind him. The next financial year, he stated confidently, 'will be the year to make money.' Two years later, in the face of the first loss his company has ever reported, Mr Sugar is making no such predictions yet. The group which he built up from scratch into a success story of the 1980s is facing what could be its most difficult test to date. Amstrad is having to retreat in main product areas at a time when it has not yet found the next blockbuster hit to keep the group going. The PC market, which it depends on for over 40 per cent of turnover, is in turmoil. Production of PCs has been halted since last summer in an effort to reduce stock levels and speculation that Amstrad will pull out of the PC market altogether prompted a statement by Mr Sugar of his commitment to the computer market. Recession in economies throughout the world and the changing market environment for PCs has forced manufacturers at the higher end of the market, such as IBM and Compaq, to slash their prices. Amstrad, which built up a significant market share largely on the strength of competitive pricing, has been a loser in the price wars which have robbed it of its main advantage over the larger industry leaders with their premium brands. Conditions in its other product markets have been just as dismal in the prolonged recession. The market for VCRs and home computers have been a battleground for intense price competition. In the case of home computers the competition has been such that Amstrad has had to pull out of the market for games and entertainment computers where it was faced by the formidable popularity of Nintendo games. The only areas where Amstrad has maintained resilience are in satellite receivers and dishes, its second largest consumer product category, fax machines and word processors. However, even in the satellite division where sales have been buoyant, profits have been affected by the slowdown on the continent, particularly in Germany where Amstrad has been building up satellite market share. Amstrad's current plight raises the question of whether the group's strategy of providing consumer electronics and computer products at competitive prices, is appropriate in the more sober and more competitive trading environment of the early 1990s. Its response to the situation so far has been to make sure its house is in order to weather the tide. It has introduced management and financial controls, kept inventory control a priority and strengthened its balance sheet. If Amstrad can see through the current storm, with the help of its restructuring program and healthy balance sheet, it is bound to come out of the recession leaner and stronger than it was when it went into it. With an optimism only slightly more measured than two years ago, Mr Sugar points out that the large PC manufacturers have suffered just as heavily from the price competition and 'once their inventories have been depleted the market will come back profitably for Amstrad.' As soon as the recovery comes, Amstrad will be able to ride ahead again on the strength of its competitive prices and new products. The group has already proved with its double deck VCRs that it can still deliver a market hit in the middle of a recession. Mr Sugar has shown himself to be a tireless source of inspiration for new ideas for the consumer market and Amstrad is still a flexible enough organisation to move in quickly to take advantage of gaps in new product areas and out again when the going gets rough. The recently announced decision to return to its audio roots and move out of the computer games business at least for a while, suggest that it can still play that game well. The question in the short term is, if Amstrad intends to stick to its strategy of bringing competitively priced hit products to the market to stimulate sales, where are those profits likely to come from? Last autumn it announced a colour laptop computer and notebook PC which it has been putting considerable effort into developing. These are likely to be the more popular products this year, but whether or not they will measure up to the earlier success of Amstrad's PCs is still open to debate. The videophone, another product which Amstrad expects to be a hit, is still very much in the engineering stage and unlikely to be a mass market item until at least 1993. Even then, unlike Amstrad's previous hit products, the videophone is a relatively new concept that is going to need to build up consumer acceptance. Without the blockbuster hit, a return to the peak turnover level of over Pounds 600m it achieved three years ago is 'a very distant target,' says Mr Mark Loveland at Warburgs. In the long run, Amstrad will need to address the question, of whether its strategy of providing basic technology to the mass market at the lowest possible prices is still relevant in a changed environment for many of its markets. The philosophy that supported Amstrad's growth from a small one-man operation to a company with a turnover exceeding Pounds 600m, was to provide standard products in consumer electronics that were stripped of unnecessarily complicated gadgets but did the job well enough for the average consumer. Its strength was based on its ability to deliver these goods, many of which were also hit products based on simple but inspired product improvements, at extremely low prices. The strategy clearly works when the products that are targeted are based on relatively new or complicated technology that commands premium prices. In its high growth period, Amstrad was able to take advantage of demand among consumers who were willing to forego brand premium for simple and competitively priced electronics products and more recently, computers. But once those products become commodity products, subject to price cutting by manufacturers at the top end of the market, the strategy leaves Amstrad with little to compete on. That strategy crumbled under fierce competition that has driven it out of the home computer sector and raised considerable doubt about its commitment to the PC sector. Mr Sugar says that the group has no intention of moving into technology led businesses or the high end of the market. 'Our vocation is always in the lower end of the market, especially in recessionary times,' he emphasises. In order to be profitable with that vocation Amstrad needs to ensure it has the lower end of the market to itself, or that at least it has a dominant share of it. Given the intense pressures facing consumer electronics and computer manufacturers, it is unlikely that that is a luxury that can be counted on. But Amstrad can no longer say that it does not know what it is like not to be alone in its sector of the market.</p>

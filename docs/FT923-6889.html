			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / OFT asks for details of credit-card pricing BANKS AND building societies are bracing themselves for a fresh investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into the pricing of their credit and debit card services. The OFT has written to them asking for detailed technical information about the way they run their credit card pricing systems. The organisations have until the end of next week to provide the information. Several say the OFT's request - which follows a series of submissions from large food retailers - is so detailed that the deadline cannot met. The investigation is the latest in a series by the OFT in the past 14 years. It has twice referred the problem to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for inquiries, the last of which reported three years ago. Neither investigation resulted in radical changes in the industry. The latest investigation is the most disturbing for the banks since retailers have succeeded in focusing the OFT's attention on the two main elements in the credit card business: 'merchant acquiring' - the handling of retailer card transactions - and the interchange fee, the fixed charge paid by a retailer's bank to the cardholder's bank each time the card is used. The changes that retailers are pressing for would produce a transformation of the credit card industry. Five supermarkets have pressed the OFT to allow them to handle their own transactions. The rules of Visa International and MasterCard International prevent the retailers from doing this by barring non-bank organisations. The retailers' moves follow increases in January in the commissions they pay to banks. The OFT letter, signed by Mr Andre Hook of the competition policy division, says retailers believe the increase in charges follows a rise in the interchange fee.</p>

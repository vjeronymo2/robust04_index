			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE INTERVENE IN BID TO END GANG FEUD  </P> <P> In what authorities called an effort to end a continuing war between two gangs,  a task force of 125 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies raided and searched  11 alleged gang hangouts Friday in Norwalk and Santa Fe Springs.  </P> <P> Nine guns were seized during the searches of homes where members of the two  gangs are known to live or hang out, Deputy Hal Grant said. Two suspected gang  members were arrested for resisting arrest and a third for possession of a  controlled substance, he said.  </P> <P> On April 15, members of the gangs had a gun battle at Los Nietos Park in Santa  Fe Springs in which one youth was wounded in the stomach, Grant said. "In order  to prevent further bloodshed and minimize their activities," he said, deputies  acquired search warrants for the homes to seize weapons.  </P> <P> The raids were conducted by the Operation Safe Streets' anti-gang teams at 1  p.m.  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Opting for disarray over confusion - Argentina's pension reforms are proving difficult Argentina's private pension system is off to a slow start - and it has not been helped by bureaucratic disarray and stronger-than-expected resistance to change by pensions contributors. The main difficulty has been government regulations limiting the marketing campaign of the new pension fund management companies to barely two months, from May 2 until the end of June. The result has been a blizzard of confusing and sometimes misleading sales advice by the 21 fund managers competing for a slice of Argentina's monthly pension cashflow, estimated at between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m. Some 5m pensions contributors must eventually choose between remaining in the state system or joining a private scheme. So far, pension fund managers report that less than 150,000 have moved into the private sector. Private pension funds are to be financed by a compulsory 11 per cent levy on wages. Alternatively, people can decide to remain in the state system. Although ridden by deficits, inefficiency and allegations of corruption, the state scheme does offer a guarantee against the bankruptcy and fraud that have beset Argentina's financial system for decades. Furthermore, contributors who have chosen the private schemes cannot return to the state system. This has understandably encouraged potential savers to wait and see just how private schemes progress before burning their boats and leaving the state system. Signs of disarray in the pension fund regulatory agency has further discouraged people from moving into the private sector. Three senior officials of the Pension Fund Superintendency have resigned over what they claim was inadequate policing of private pension marketing campaigns. Mr Oscar Rabinovich, who resigned as assistant superintendent of the PFS, says: 'If we are controlling publicity this badly, I do not want to imagine what is going to happen (later). I am basically in favour of the new retirement system, but it can only work if the state exercises strong controls.' For their part, private pension fund managers complain that the PFS is excessively rigid and bureaucratic. President Carlos Menem recently added to the confusion when he revoked a clause that ordered state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), Argentina's biggest bank, to offer dollar-linked pensions in competition with the private funds. The clause was the price of the congressional Peronist party's support for the controversial legislation. However, fund managers say BNA's dollar-indexed pensions would distort the financial system. Congress is now working on a new system of state guarantees to be provided by BNA. Still, some observers hope the planned new pension system can provide the catalyst for reform within Argentina's rudimentary capital markets. Mr Ted Truscott, principal of US fund managers Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, says 'the long-range impact of pension funds cannot be underestimated'. He expects private funds to boost Argentina's low savings ratio, reduce its reliance on imported capital, and provide borrowers with long term finance.</p>

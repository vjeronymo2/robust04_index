			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Gardner to sell training division for nearly Pounds 4m DC GARDNER has agreed to sell its banking and management training division in order to cut costs and concentrate on its outplacement and conference businesses. The company, which has been substantially restructured in the last 18 months, has agreed to the disposal of its training division to Euromoney Publications for Pounds 3.7m, which includes Pounds 1.8m of inter-group debt. As a condition of the sale, the division will retain the DC Gardner name. The company will seek shareholder approval to change its name to Coutts Consulting Group, derived from the name of its personnel business. The company has also agreed to terminate a long term lease on a property in London's Docklands where the training division was based. Although the termination will cost Pounds 5m, it will lead to longer term cost savings. Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive, said these were designed to be the company's last set of changes. Last November the company issued a profits warning, replaced its chief executive of less than a year, Mr Barry Topple, and appointed Sir Kit McMahon, former chairman of Midland Bank, as non-executive chairman. Mr Johnson said the changes would save nearly Pounds 1m a year in reduced costs. 'We will have the cash to devote to the other businesses,' he said. The training division, which employs nearly 70 people, has been affected by recession and made a pre-tax loss last year. At the operating level, the company returned to profits. At December 31, the division's net assets totalled some Pounds 690,000. Gardner will use the proceeds of the sale towards the termination costs on the Docklands property. The balance of the costs will be provided from new loan facilities. Mr Johnson said gearing, which stood at 30 per cent in December, would not go beyond 100 per cent this year and would fall below 70 per cent by the year end. The company also intends to seek approval from shareholders and the courts to reduce its share premium account. Once the company has restored distributable reserves, it intends to pay the arrears of Pounds 480,000 on its convertible preference shares. Ordinary dividends would follow, depending on earnings and cash resources.</p>

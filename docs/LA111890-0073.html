			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE HELPFUL ADVICE ON CHOOSING COLLEGE  </P> <P> Mary Yarber's column on the college selection process (Westside, Nov. 1) made  some fine suggestions to students seeking the best college choices but worked  with a time line far shorter than we urge for our students. In our experience,  the college selection process should begin in grade 11, with the student and  his or her family assessing the student's study objectives, learning style,  financial resources and other preferences.  </P> <P> Based on that study and the student's academic record, preliminary research can  begin.  </P> <P> The choices ought to be defined late in grade 11 or during the following summer  so that the early part of grade 12 can be devoted to applications and  interviews, if necessary. Delaying until senior year can create a troubling  diversion from academic obligations. The applications demand time, energy and  some imagination; the deadlines create panic if homework has not been done in  advance.  </P> <P> While it is true that many schools cannot offer college counseling as early as  grade 10 or 11, students and their families can begin intelligent exploration  before the last year of high school.  </P> <P> DEBRA W.

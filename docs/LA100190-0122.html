			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION SPENDING HOLDS STEADY IN AUGUST  </P> <P> Construction spending was unchanged in August after posting its first gain in  four months in July, the government said today. Government spending offset  declines in residential and non-residential construction.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government  spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $442.5 billion, after a  revised 0.3% increase in July.  </P> <P> July's advance originally was reported to have been 0.4% and was the first  since a 0.4% gain in March. Spending fell 2.8% in April, 0.2% in May and 0.6%  in June.  </P> <P> Analysts have attributed the general weakness in the construction industry to  high interest rates, tight lending requirements, consumer caution over the  state of the economy and the Persian Gulf crisis and, in some areas,  overbuilding that has resulted in lofty vacancy rates.  </P> <P> The weakness has been illustrated in recent Labor Department reports showing  the loss of nearly 100,000 construction jobs in the past three months. This  included 40,000 jobs, after a seasonal adjustment, in August, the sixth  consecutive monthly decline.  </P> <P> Construction spending in August was 2% above the $433.9 billion in the same  month of 1989.  </P> <P> Residential spending in August fell 1.2%, to $186.9 billion, after a 0.2%  decline in July.  </P> <P> Single-family spending was down 1.3%, to $108.5 billion, after a 1.2% loss a  month earlier. Apartment construction was up 1.1%, to $19 billion, after a 0.5%  gain in July.  </P> <P> Non-residential spending fell 4.3%, to $104.8 billion, erasing a 4.2% advance  the previous month. Industrial spending, which jumped 16.2% in July, slipped  back 12.7% in August.  </P> <P> Government spending rose 6.1%, to $115.1 billion, after a 2.7% decline the  previous month. Spending on highways and streets led the advance with a 9%  gain.  </P></p>

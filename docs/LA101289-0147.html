			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SRI LANKA;  </P> <P> BODIES OF 80 SLAIN SINHALESE FOUND  </P> <P> Police discovered the bound bodies of 80 murdered young Sinhalese men along a  road in southern Sri Lanka, a day before the final round of peace talks to try  to resolve ethnic conflicts that have claimed more than 16,000 lives. The  victims, all between age 18 and 30, had their hands tied behind their backs  before they were shot to death, police said. No one claimed responsibility for  the massacre, one of the worst this year. But authorities blamed pro-government  death squads seeking revenge for the murder Monday of three Sinhalese soldiers  in Kalutara district.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: IN AMERICA, THERE'S REASON FOR OPTIMISM  </P> <P> What's going on? The stock market careens like a drunken driver while big-name  bankruptcies and junk bond defaults produce a mean hangover to start 1990.  </P> <P> But don't panic. It's not the end of the world, only the end of the 1980s -- a  decade of easy money, big deals and rising stock prices for many companies --  the Dow Jones industrial index started the decade below 1,000 and finished it  above 2,600, where it remains even after Monday's volatile price swing.  </P> <P> Those swings reflect confusion among big institutional investors -- the pension  and mutual funds, bank trust departments and international insurance companies  that make up 85% of the trading on major stock exchanges. They're worried that  inflation will increase in the U.S. economy, that interest rates will rise and  that company profits will decline.  </P> <P> But a calm look at the situation says the institutions are mistaken on two of  three of their worries. And beyond the near term, the outlook for the U.S. and  world economies is bright.  </P> <P> Inflation, which totaled 4.6% last year, is not a real concern for the U.S.  economy. Business is slowing, and prices are under pressure. The car rental  companies recently tried to lift rates, couldn't do it. Energy prices went up  with the cold snap in December and are now backtracking. Industrial raw  material prices are down.  </P> <P> Interest rates aren't falling at the moment, but they may soon because demand  for credit in the United States is low. Total borrowings by households,  companies and state and local governments grew only 4% -- less than inflation  -- in last year's fourth quarter, notes Charles Clough, chief investment  strategist for Merrill Lynch.  </P> <P> It's hard for interest rates to rise when loan demand is falling -- although  one explanation for continuing high rates is that overseas economies are  growing and increasing demand for U.S. dollars and fresh capital. Still, the  prospect for the year ahead is that U.S. interest rates will decline.  </P> <P> Which leaves lower corporate profits as a possibly valid worry. Some big  companies and major banks have lately reported profit declines, and this has  shaken the institutions that concentrate their investments on big companies.  </P> <P> But the economy has been slowing for a while. The gross national product may  have grown only 0.4% in last year's fourth quarter, virtually a standstill.  Declines in small company stocks on over-the-counter markets and major  exchanges already reflect this slowdown.  </P> <P> The point to keep in mind, though, is that the slowdown is a pause in a healthy  economy, not a symptom of lingering illness -- as the aftermath of the 1980s  often makes it seem. Borrowings grew tremendously in the last decade --  commercial and residential mortgages went from $1.5 trillion in 1982 to $3.4  trillion last year. The result is a glut of buildings in many parts of the  country and, inevitably, troubled markets.  </P> <P> Junk bonds, at $200 billion total, make up only a fraction of the total debt  buildup. But junk's after-effects will be with us for a while. Moody's  Investors Service estimates that $20 billion in junk bonds will default this  year, causing troubles for high-yield mutual funds, savings and loans and a few  insurance companies that have large junk bond holdings.  </P> <P> But leverage is history. Individual Americans are now saving 6% of their income  -- up from less than 3% in 1987 -- and banks are making fewer loans, cleaning  up their balance sheets. And companies troubled by debt are vastly outnumbered  by well-capitalized firms.  </P> <P> Rather than looking back, institutional investors should look ahead. For  individuals, it promises to be the decade of the saver not the spender. And for  industry, it should be a decade of export opportunity as Europe, led by West  Germany, and Asia, led by Japan, enjoy growing consumer economies that in good  measure will be supplied from the United States.  </P> <P> Economists such as Clough of Merrill Lynch and Edward Hyman of C. J. Lawrence  Morgan Grenfell see the United States as supplier to the world in the 1990s,  with low capital costs and the dollar as the strongest currency. It's a vision  of a fully employed, high-export, low-inflation United States, contrasting with  other countries just entering the era of personal consumption that America has  completed.  </P> <P> And those who would question such optimism might reflect on how much the United  States is capable of: After all, even in the last decade of easy money and  spurious deals it managed to maintain the defense of the Western nations and  lay the groundwork for world prosperity.  </P> <P> Sure it's sometimes the land of the quick buck and short-term focus. But at  other times it's the land of the honest dollar and faith in the future. The  1990s could be one of those other times.  </P></p>

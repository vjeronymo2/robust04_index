			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech delivered by Premier Li Peng to the National </F> Conference on Work To Assist the Poor in Development on 3 March  1994: "Work To Assist the Poor in Development Is a Major  Strategic Task"]    [Text] I. Implementing the "80-Million-People  Seven-Year Plan" and Helping Impoverished Regions Change Their  Backwardness Is the Historical Responsibility of the Party and  the Government    It has been seven or eight years since we began assisting  the  poor in development on a large scale across the country. Since  we have always stuck to the principle of assisting the poor in  development, we have obtained very great achievements. Vast  numbers of cadres and people in impoverished regions across the  country have made huge efforts on this, and various relevant  quarters, both in the central and local authorities and all  circles in society, have given vigorous support, thus making an  important contribution to assisting the poor in development.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping says socialism is about eliminating  poverty. This is a long-term and arduous historical task. The  task of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan," as was  discussed at the meeting, is to resolve the problem of food and  clothing for 80 million people in the seven years from now to  the end of this century and to help them escape poverty and  attain prosperity. This is an unshirkable historical  responsibility of our generation of communists and the people's  governments at all levels.    Completing the task of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year  Plan" is of great significance. First, it has a bearing on  whether or not we can satisfactorily achieve the second-step  strategic goal of China's modernization. At present, everyone  across the country is striving hard with a view to doubling GNP  again and allowing the people to lead a comparatively  comfortable life. If the problem of clothing and food for tens  of millions of people in China remains unsolved by the end of  this century, then we cannot say that the second-step strategic  goal has been satisfactorily achieved. Second, it has a bearing  on whether or not our party and the people's government stick to  the goal of attaining common prosperity. The PRC will have  through half a century by the year 2000. If, in struggling for  two generations, tens of millions of people still cannot solve  the problem of food and clothing, but live in poverty, how can  we embody the aim of communists wholeheartedly serving the  people? How can we bring to light the superiority of the  socialist system? Whenever we, communists at all levels who  shoulder heavy responsibilities, recall this question, we will  feel uneasy when eating and sleeping. The "80-Million-People  Seven-Year Plan" formulated by the State Council is determined  to steadily solve the food and clothing problem of the masses by  the end of this century. We must never postpone the problem to  the next century. This is a major strategic plan which is of  significance both economically and politically and which must be  carried out without failure. Leading comrades in party  committees and governments at all levels and comrades in charge  of all quarters and divisions must consider this task an  important matter, attach great importance to it, do it properly,  and strive to complete it as scheduled.  <H5>  II. Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" </H5> and Assisting Impoverished Regions To Develop Their Economies Is  a Strategic Measure To Gradually Narrow the Difference Between  the Eastern and Western Regions    Of the 80 million people throughout the country at present  who have not completely and steadily solved the problem of food  and clothing, over 80 percent are concentrated in the central  and western regions, and most are concentrated in the southwest  and northwest. Speaking in this sense, solving the problem of  food and clothing for the masses in impoverished regions and  helping them escape poverty and attain prosperity is a question  of gradually narrowing the difference between the eastern and  western regions.    On this question, we should have a correct and comprehensive  understanding. 1) Differences exist objectively. The  development of things is unbalanced. There are differences  between different countries around the world and differences  also exist within countries. This is determined by historical,  natural, geographical, social, economic, and other factors. It  is impossible to completely eliminate differences within a short  time. 2) We should gradually narrow differences with a  positive attitude with a view to eliminating them in the end.  We will stick to the policy of encouraging some people and  areas to get rich first through honest labor and legitimate  operations so they can bring along and help the development of  backward areas in order to achieve the goal of ultimately  attaining the common prosperity of the whole nation. If all are  poor, then nobody can help. Only when some areas are a little  developed earlier and have stronger economic strength will they  be in a position to help the backward areas. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping said: "Poverty is not socialism (The Collected Works  of Deng Xiaoping, Volume Three p 225)." He also said:  "Socialism is not where a small number of people are rich while  the majority of people are poor."    "The greatest superiority  of socialism is common prosperity. This is something that  reflects the nature of socialism (p 364, the same volume)." In  order to narrow differences and achieve common prosperity, we  have already done a great deal of work. Viewing the matter  vertically, we see when comparing ourselves that both developed  areas and impoverished areas are developing. Viewing it  horizontally, the difference between impoverished and developed  areas is tending to widen. Therefore, we must draw the great  attention of party committees and governments at all levels,  adopt effective measures, and make efforts to narrow differences  between regions.    Encourage and urge advanced coastal areas which have  become prosperous first and large and medium-sized cities to  bring along and help the impoverished regions. Generally  speaking, there are two channels to help and assist impoverished  regions. The first channel is that we distribute national  income a second time through the state and then tilt toward the  impoverished regions. The second channel is that we have those  who have become prosperous first help and assist those who will  become prosperous later. Big cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and  Shanghai, as well as the coastal provinces whose economies are  comparatively developed, all have this responsibility and  obligation. But this does not mean the simple uncompensated  supply of money and goods, but union and cooperation on the  basis of common development mainly through mutual benefit and  reciprocality. There are varied forms. They can jointly  exploit resources and transform the resource advantages into  economic advantages. They can offer technical support to help  upgrade quality and product standards and enhance the ability of  economic growth. They can offer a stable sales market to  encourage the development of production. They can offer  employment opportunities through the importation of labor  services. They should combine the resource advantages and labor  advantages of impoverished regions with the technology,  information, and capital advantages of the developed regions to  achieve a rational allocation of resources. This is both  beneficial to the development of impoverished regions and  developed regions and to the coordinated developed of the entire  national economy. This kind of cooperation is worthy of  vigorous promotion and must be carried out.    The state will give sufficient financial and monetary  support to impoverished regions. To assist the poor in  development, there must of course be appropriate capital inputs.  Without inputs, there will be no output, nor will there be  enough food and clothing or development. Over the years,  financial authorities and banks at all levels have made very  great efforts to increase inputs to assist the poor in  development, and they have attained good results. But in our  work to assist the poor, we have now entered a stage where major  difficulties have to be tackled. As time is very limited, it is  will be very difficult to completely and steadily resolve the  problem of food and clothing for the masses by the end of this  century. Without corresponding guarantees of capital, it will be  very difficult to do so. The State Council has already decided  to provide an additional one billion yuan of work relief funds  and one billion yuan of poverty-assistance credits at discount  interest rates [tie xi dai kuan 6317 1873 6313 2949] beginning  this year. In the future, as financial strength expands, the  state will continue to increase inputs to assist the poor.  Local governments at all levels should also increase inputs in  impoverished regions accordingly. The three municipalities of  Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the six coastal  provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, and  Liaoning, should raise their own poverty-assistance funds. The  central authorities' poverty-assistance funds will be  concentrated in the poverty-stricken central and western  provinces (regions).    To increase inputs in poverty assistance, we cannot merely  depend on the government, but also forces in society must pool  poverty-assistance funds in various areas within the scope  allowed by state policy.    The state should tilt major projects toward  impoverished regions. Although impoverished regions in the  western regions are comparatively poor at present, they are rich  in resources, which is a big advantage. When formulating  development plans, all divisions of the State Council should  fully consider this advantage. They should arrange for some  resource exploitation projects of a comparatively large scale  and some infrastructural projects for impoverished regions in  keeping with the principle of giving equal priority.  Fundamentally speaking, in order to thoroughly change the  backwardness of impoverished regions, we should, to a very large  extent, depend on the impetus of these key large-scale projects.    Gradually straighten out prices of raw materials and  primary products through reform. Under the previous  planned economic structure, prices of raw materials and primary  products were very low, and prices of farm products were not  high either. Presently, the price structure and the circulation  structure are being reformed in keeping with the requirements of  establishing a socialist market economic structure. As reform  is deepening, it will be possible to achieve exchange at equal  prices for timber, petroleum, coal, nonferrous metals, and all  other resources in nationwide integrated markets and developed  areas. This is an important measure to promote the development  of the central and western regions. The impoverished central  and western regions should also use the favorable opportunity of  reform and opening up to develop themselves.    Improve the quality of personnel and scientific and  technological levels in impoverished regions. This is a  very important measure of fundamental significance. Over the  years, we have had very good progress in training personnel in  impoverished regions and in exchanging cadres between the  western and eastern regions. We should continuously stick to  this and expand it. There are now two kinds of noteworthy  large-scale flows across the country. The first is that of the  labor force flowing from the west to the east and that the scale  of labor service exports is continuously expanding. The second  is that craftsmen and skilled personnel are flowing from the  east to the west and that they are found in every corner of the  cities and countryside of the western regions.    The flow of  labor from the west to the east not only enables impoverished  regions to participate in the development of the national  economy by making use of the large numbers of employment  opportunities created by developed coastal regions, but can also  improve the quality of laborers in impoverished regions. This  is a special kind of training. The flow of craftsmen and  skilled personnel from the east to the west is, in fact, a kind  of technology export. It can improve the technological level  and expertise of impoverished regions in a more effective and  more practical form. These two flows are of very great  significance to improving the quality of laborers and improving  scientific and technological levels and must be fully affirmed  and continuously developed. As for the large-scale "wave of  migrant workers," we must not let it flow freely but should  actively divert it and rationalize its flow in an orderly way to  reduce confusion in social order and economic losses.    It is necessary to experiment with open-style poverty  assistance on the basis of sticking to developmental poverty  assistance. In order for impoverished regions to develop,  they surely need to develop township and town enterprises and  develop their tertiary industry. While setting up township and  town enterprises in these regions, we can also experiment with  developing industry in areas with appropriate conditions by  giving profits and tax income back to the impoverished regions  and arrange for the employment of the labor force in these  regions. This may overcome the unfavorable position of  impoverished regions in developing enterprises and is beneficial  to enhancing the efficiency of enterprises, enhancing the  efficiency of poverty-assistance funds, and upgrading  poverty-assistance work overall.    Mobilize forces in society to support the development  and construction of impoverished regions. Over the years,  various quarters, including state organs, mass organizations,  democratic parties, large and medium-sized cities, developed  regions, industrial and commercial enterprises, universities and  colleges, scientific research academies and institutes, and the  People's Liberation Army have carried forward the spirit of  assisting and aiding the poor and have actively participated in  the development and construction of the impoverished regions.  In addition to giving financial and material support, they have  utilized their own advantages and assisted the poor with their  knowledge, science and technology, and talented personnel. They  have acted as go-betweens for impoverished regions, come up with  proposals and plans, and introduced projects and technology to  them. They have undertaken to help a region until it finally  gets out of poverty and attains prosperity. All these methods  have made important contributions to poverty-assistance work at  the previous stage. This not only reflects the affectionate  concern of all circles in society for the impoverished regions  but also embodies the traditional virtues of our Chinese nation.  We hope that all circles in society can further mobilize  themselves, have genuine affection and love, and make  contributions. Here we have to specifically stress that I hope  that large state industrial and commercial and foreign-trade  enterprises extend to the impoverished regions, set up projects  there, choose projects with good efficiency, and combine their  own development with the development of the impoverished regions.    Alleviating poverty and eliminating poverty is a global  issue. It is also the duty of the United Nations and numerous  other international organizations. China's elimination of  poverty is part and parcel of the world's elimination of  poverty. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation  between China and international organizations in assisting the  poor in development so that the international community can  better understand and support China's poverty-assistance work.    Impoverished regions should carry forward the spirit of  self-reliance and arduous struggle. Support from the state  and help from society are both necessary, but the efforts of the  impoverished regions themselves are more important. External  factors act through internal factors. Henan's Lin County and  many other counties, townships, and villages that have become  prosperous first have a history of arduously pioneering a cause.  We should learn from their spirit and experiences. Only when  we have this can we overcome difficulties, escape poverty, and  attain prosperity. Moreover, we should pay attention to picking  good cadres who have a spirit of making sacrifices, who can bear  hardships and stand hard work, and who maintain ties with the  masses; consolidate leading groups at all levels in impoverished  counties; maintain relative stability; and allow them to rest  assured and lead the masses in changing their backwardness.  <H5>  III. In Implementing "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan," </H5> We Should Carry Out the Provincial Governor Responsibility  System, in Which Responsibility Rests at Every Level, Mainly at  the Provincial Level, Under the Unified Leadership of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council    I agree to the principle of unified leadership with  responsibility resting at every level and mainly at the  provincial level stressed in the 80-Million-People Seven-Year  Plan. Taking the provincial level as the mainstay demands that  the major responsible comrades in the provincial CPC committee  and provincial government care for and pay good attention to  assisting the poor. We should be clear about one point,  however, namely that the provincial governor takes charge.  Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" and  solving the problem of food and clothing for the masses is a  systematic project. It involves such economic activities as  finance, banking, agriculture, water works, industry, and  commerce, as well as various aspects such as culture, education,  public health, and family planning. Practice over the years  proves that it is not enough for vice governors to take charge  separately as it is very difficult to coordinate various aspects  and various quarters. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the  head of the government to take charge of everything and make  overall plans and arrangements.    The very criterion with which to measure whether or not  leading cadres at all levels really work for the benefit of the  people and care for the plight of the people is whether or not  they can complete the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" as  scheduled and solve the problem of food and clothing for the  poor population of their own localities. When determining the  good and bad work of a province, region, or municipality, we  must not merely look at the rate at which its economy grows but  also at whether its efficiency is good or bad, whether the  people's living standards have improved quickly or not, and how  well the problem of food and clothing for the poor population  has been solved. Our leading comrades at all levels must not  merely pay attention to developed regions, but must all the more  place in their hearts the plight and warmth of the ordinary  people of the impoverished regions. All provinces, regions, and  municipalities must formulate their own plans in keeping with  the demands of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan." They  must set demands for progress and make specific plans regarding  how many people have had their problems solved this year, how  many will have their problems solved next year, and how the  problem has been solved. They should conduct an inspection each  year during which the good will be commended and the bad  criticized so that everyone is urged to complete their tasks as  scheduled and do not slacken their efforts at all.    All divisions of the government should continue to make it  their unshirkable duty to assist the poor in development. In  addition to mainly helping a particular impoverished region,  they must formulate poverty-assistance plans for their own  business or division in keeping with the tasks set forth by the  "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" as specific contents and  measures for implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year  Plan."    Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" is an  arduous and glorious duty. I believe that as long as everyone  has confidence, is united as one, makes concerted efforts, and  courageously tackles difficulties, we will surely be able to  achieve the goal of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" by  the end of this century, and the economic and social development  of the impoverished regions will enter a new stage.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (6): Foreign opportunities beckon - Emerging markets are attracting more attention IT IS said that in Turkey, the secondary market for stocks and shares consists of men outside the exchange building selling suitcases full of certificates for cash. While that may be an exaggeration for Turkey - or indeed for many of what are now known as emerging markets - it offers a glimpse into one of the most problematical, but potentially most interesting and lucrative, aspects of the global custody business. Deciding on exactly which markets are still emerging is a subject of some debate, but broadly speaking, most Latin American markets, many Pacific Basin markets and almost anything in Africa, eastern Europe or the Middle East fall into that category. And, because of the handsome returns investors have earned from those markets, global custodians have been forced to sit up and take notice. Dr Mark Mobius, chief investment director at Templeton Emerging Markets, one of the world's largest investors in that sector, has long complained that the reluctance of custodians to service these markets has been the greatest barrier to investment. 'If we have to wait around for the banks to be more aggressive, it's a great disadvantage,' he said. 'But custodians are changing their attitudes.' Over the past year or so, he said, custodians have been more willing to invest capital in nascent markets from Pakistan to the Philippines, although not nearly enough to suit the needs of professional investors. In part, this willingness to take on greater risk has been prompted by the intense competition for new business. 'One area which has caused fund managers a great deal of difficulty was the reluctance of custodian banks to offer their services until long after the market was open to foreign investors,' said Mr Jeremy Paulson-Ellis, chairman of Genesis Investment Management, a company which invests exclusively in emerging markets. 'With banks losing large amounts of money elsewhere, the custodians are not willing to put in the necessary development capital to emerging markets,' he said. Entry to an emerging market requires not only investment in technology, but also expert knowledge of securities and banking regulation, market practice and tax law. Mr Ranjit Chatterji, head of Latin American securities at Citibank's global custody operations, said that part of the complaints from fund managers stems from the inability of banks to overcome the very real operational difficulties of trading in these markets. Deregulation in emerging markets has raised investors' expectations beyond the capacity of markets to receive their cash. 'Regulation isn't always well designed in attracting investment flows because there is too little investment in settlement and post-settlement systems,' he said. 'This leads to a mismatch between investors' expectations and what can be done.' Also, many of the countries deregulating their securities markets have also been simultaneously deregulating their foreign exchange markets, although not necessarily in tandem. The inability to obtain local currency for investment or to earn a return on it while it lies idle, has frustrated institutional investors. Emerging markets fund managers note that just as the quality of service from custodians varies, so, too, there is a wide range of fees. In a recent analysis of fees, one fund manager said he found a 42 per cent variation between the highest and lowest fees charged by any of his custodians on an average Dollars 100m portfolio and a 26 per cent variation in fees on a Dollars 50m portfolio. 'There was no correlation between fees and service,' the fund manager said. It is not that fund managers do not appreciate the risks of being a custodian in some of these global markets. 'There are markets where you shouldn't invest at all,' said Mr Richard Watts, head of Latin American investments at Gartmore Fund Management. 'The custodial operations are poor, the stock market practices are poor, the market isn't transparent and the locals don't play by the rules.' Mr Watts said that in Venezuela, for instance, where settlement is officially three to five days after trade date, he has found settlement may not actually take place for 125 days after trade date. Citicorp has found that while failed trades occur in roughly 10 per cent of all bargains in Latin America as a whole, in Venezuela the figure for failed trades is 70 to 80 per cent of all bargains. In India, there are 19 separate exchanges, the largest of which is in Bombay. In Indian market practice, there is no delivery against payment. Also, due to settlement delays brokers can find themselves holding cash and securities for considerable periods. Buyers and sellers are exposed to the broker for the entire settlement period. Such inefficiencies leave custodians open to risks which they are unwilling or unable to accept. Also, the information base on which custodians must act is poor in many emerging markets. For instance, in some countries, there is no up-to-date central register of stock ownership. As a result, clients may be unaware of corporate actions such as stock splits or dividend increases. Local regulations also hamper development of efficient custodial systems. For instance, in Pakistan a rule requiring foreign investors to re-register every time stock changes hands means a foreigner buying a share is effectively forced to hold it for up to 75 days until registration is completed. Institutional investors say the best custodians are those who learn the nuts and bolts of markets and work with local authorities without considering the operational difficulties. Meanwhile, Templeton's Dr Mobius said one means of dealing with troublesome local markets may be Citicorp's idea of designating a single local sub-custodian in each market. The single sub-custodian might then be encouraged to make a substantial capital investment in improving the service it offers in that market because it would have a captive clientele. Citicorp says that in markets where it is a sub-custodian, it would designate itself. But other fund managers are sceptical. 'I would never leave myself in a monopoly supplier situation,' said Mr Paulson-Ellis. Placing too great a reliance on a single sub-custodian, could hinder the ability to negotiate the best price for the service or to select a competitor if the service deteriorates.  ---------------------------------------------------                 COUNTRY FOCUS LIST  ---------------------------------------------------                      Primary Companies operating in the following countries are        currently considered for investment  ---------------------------------------------------                 Asia and Pacific                      India                    Indonesia                      Korea                    Malaysia                    Pakistan                Papua New Guinea           People's Republic of China                   Philippines                    Sri Lanka                    Thailand  ---------------------------------------------------                     Europe                     Greece                     Hungary                     Poland                    Portugal                     Turkey  ---------------------------------------------------             Middle East and Africa                    Botswana                     Zambia  ---------------------------------------------------           Caribbean and Latin America                   Argentina                     Brazil                     Chile                     Mexico                   Venezuela  ---------------------------------------------------                   Secondary    Countries to be monitored with a view to               future investment  ---------------------------------------------------                Asia and Pacific                   Bangladesh                      Fiji  ---------------------------------------------------                     Europe                 Czechoslovakia  ---------------------------------------------------             Middle East and Africa                     Egypt                  Ivory Coast                     Jordan                     Kenya                     Malawi                   Mauritius                     Morocco  ---------------------------------------------------             Middle East and Africa                    Nigeria                   Swaziland                    Tunisia                    Zimbabwe  ---------------------------------------------------          Caribbean and Latin America                   Costa Rica                     Jamaica               Trinidad and Tobago                     Bolivia                     Colombia                     Ecuador                      Peru                     Uruguay  --------------------------------------------------- Source: Genesis Investment Management Limited  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

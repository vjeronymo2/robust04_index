			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian National Registrar Luis Camilo </F> Osorio by Jesus Garzon in Santa Fe de Bogota; from the "TV  Today" newscast--live]    [Text] [Garzon] Good evening. It is now 2058, and we  have a last-minute bulletin after 22.5 percent of the Liberal  Party's internal votes and the Senate votes have been tallied.  According to the latest figures from the National Civil  Registry Office, 48.94 percent of the tables have been tallied  throughout the country. Mr. Registrar, according to the  National Civil Registry Office's figures, who has won the  Liberal Party's elections?    [Osorio] Ernesto Samper leads with 43 percent, followed by  Humberto de la Calle with 15 percent, and Carlos Lleras with  7.42 percent. I want to warn this barely represents 42.5  percent, meaning the situation may change in different regions  of the country.    [Garzon] There is a low voter turnout and many null votes.  Why? How can you explain this, Mr. Registrar?    [Osorio] Apparently some people did not know how to use the  ballot, so they simply deposited it, believing they were thus  voting for a given party when they should have marked a  candidate.    [Garzon] Who has swept the votes for the Senate of the  Republic so far?    [Osorio] Two candidates from Caldas lead right now, but I  must warn you that Caldas is in second place. We have 100  percent of the votes from Amazonas Department, and Caldas  follows with 98 percent of the votes, so it is not strange for  two candidates from Caldas-- Victor Renan Barco in first place  and Omar Yepez Alzate in second-- to lead.    [Garzon] What is the situation regarding the Chamber of  Representatives, Mr. Registrar?    [Osorio] Regarding the Chamber of Representatives, we have  information about a 100-percent count in certain departments,  and there are others where over 90 percent of the votes have  been counted, meaning more than 10 departments. We are still  gathering information, so we do not have a distribution by party  and movement.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER BILLBOARDS  </P> <P> The column by Edward McMahon "That 'Upscale Art' Quality Claimed for L.A.'s  Billboards Is Actually Litter on a Stick," Op-Ed Page, Aug. 22) is the product  of a fertile imagination which McMahon unleashes freely, totally uninhibited by  the truth, on whomever will listen.  </P> <P> For example, he claims that despite the Highway Beautification Act, billboards  are "still going up everywhere." Not true. The objective of the act was to  control billboards, not ban them. There were 1.2 million billboards in 1965;  only 500,000 remain today. California granted 35,000 permits for outdoor signs  in 1965, only 13,000 permits in 1987, down two-thirds. That's control.  </P> <P> McMahon claims communities that banned billboards always prosper. Not true.  Vermont banned billboard since 1968 and according to the latest census  projections will be the 50th state in population by the year 2000. Vermont  already has the lowest per capita retail sales of any state in the nation.  </P> <P> McMahon claims that the billboard industry pays more honoraria to Congress than  any other industry except defense and tobacco. Not true. On July 11, the  Washington Post printed a list of the top 20 honoraria contributors and the  outdoor industry is nowhere to be found.  </P> <P> He claims that we oppose regulation. Not true. We are the most regulated  industry in America, affected by laws passed at every level -- federal, state  and local. We don't want signs everywhere or in the wrong places. We do want  them to be effective -- to sell, and we want them to blend in -- to complement  the aesthetics of the communities they serve.  </P> <P> B. ROLAND McELROY  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Outdoor Advertising Assn.  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

The director of the Wuhan-based Chang Jiang River Harbor and  Shipping Superintendent's Bureau, Huang Jianping, said today  that from January 1, all vessels sailing the international  channel would need only to stop once at the Liuhe Anchorage on  the upper stream in Shanghai Port to get in and out of the Chang  Jiang River.    Currently vessels traveling along the Chang Jiang River have  to anchor twice, when going in at Wusong Anchorage and going out  at Liuhe, to allow Shanghai Port pilots and those of the Chang  Jiang Shipping Bureau to go on board.    Too many stops and formalities, plus the problem of the  shrinking Wusong Anchorage due to sludge deposits, have caused  delays to many vessels and led to complaints by shipping  companies, the director said.    After a working group investigated the problem, the Ministry  of Communications recently approved the new scheme.    While improving the traffic and telecommunications at the  Liuhe Anchorage, the director said that his bureau would also  seek to expand the anchorage by 30 percent to allow 15 vessels  of 30,000 dwt [deadweight tonnage] to anchor simultaneously.</p>

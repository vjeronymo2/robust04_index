			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Fishermen all at sea at The Pit in London's Barbican - are the fishermen of Wexford, or more exactly the about-to-be ex-fisherfolk. One had always suspected that Wexford might be a bit dull outside Festival-time, and so it seems here to be. Roche's three previous Wexford plays have been widely admired; perhaps the onus of an RSC commission was the wrong kind of challenge for him. Of his 11 characters ten are of fisherfolk-stock, and the eleventh is the plump young inheritor (educated upper-middle) of the town factory, which employs the people who can no longer live by fishing. He is called Brian Taylor; the others are called names like Humpy and Broaders and Dribbler (a devoted fan of the novelist Louis l'Amour). Wexford's rivers and coast, we are told, are steadily more polluted, and poor Eagle - still an independent soul - cannot catch enough to support his wife and his young son Isaac. The two days of the action are the last before he too signs on at the factory. Meanwhile he escorts Isaac to his 'traditional', manhood-proving night alone on Useless Island (I think I heard that right), erotic tensions and envy - notably between Eagle's sister Sonia, her rejected swain Zak and her new beau Mr Taylor - simmer away, and all the actors take decent advantage of their individual turns. There is a lot of Irish chitchat, no doubt quite realistic, some routine invective and folk-singing, and several quaintly spun yarns. We realise early on that something nasty must happen on Useless Island to bring matters to a head. At long last, it does - but any of several alternative scenarios might have done as well. Dramatic inevitability is not on offer, nor any delving into character. Perhaps Roche has been too generous to his extended cast, with the result that the most prominent roles seem under-written and under-explored: Eagle and his worried wife, and especially lovelorn Zak, who surely deserves more attention. Young Isaac, who might have supplied a poignant focus, is played modestly and seriously by 13-year-old Kevin Burke, but with a piping voice (we missed a lot of his words) and a bland face which deny us entry to his thoughts. Though the distant lights of Wexford look pretty from the island, as imagined by Michael Taylor and Geraint Pughe, the mainland sets are cluttered and clumsy. As Zak, Eagle and his upwardly-mobile sister, Barry Lynch, Ian McElhinney and Lesley McGuire make us wish we could know them better. I admired the other women, Hilary Cromie and Jane Gurnett, no less than Albie Woodington's lusty pub-turn as Dribbler and Sean Murray's Broaders, whose bumptious cynicism insinuates something over the top long before the gory climax. Everybody else plays up with spirit, though we have seen clones of Lalor Roddy's dim, convulsive Humpy too often before. Michael Attenborough directs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Kirillov and Aleksandr </F> Romanov]    [Text] Moscow May 16 ITAR-TASS -- The year of "shuttle  trading" between Russia and China is not yet over but its end is  in sight, a Chinese Embassy official told ITAR-TASS.    The official, Ho Chushen, said the future belonged to major  trade and industrial associations capable of ensuring  high-quality deliveries. The Chinese diplomat said there was no  ground behind allegations that China is implementing  "expansionist plans" in Russia through its numerous individual  traders. "We are striving exclusively for the development of  trade and to our mind there is nothing bad about it," he said.    Trade between Russia and China amounted to 5.6 billion  dollars in 1992 and rose to 7.68 billion dollars in 1993. This  growth can be accounted for by the complementary character of  the two countries' economy, Ho Chushen said. The Chinese  leadership considers the Russian direction a priority one and  China imposes practically no restrictions on export-import  operations with Russian partners.    "The Russians are hardly likely to find a more capacious  market for their goods than China," Ho Chushen said.    Chinese modifications of the Russian airliners and transport  aircraft, the Il's, the Tu's and the yak's, are in high demand  in present-day China, as are Kamaz trucks, Lada cars, steel and  timber.    Russia is now delivering 12 power units for Chinese thermal  power stations with a total capacity of 5.4 million kilowatt,  worth 1.8 billion dollars. Work continues on designing and  building a nuclear power station in northern China with Russian  assistance, although some financial questions have yet to be  resolved.    The Chinese diplomat said it was expedient for Russia to  adopt a law on investments to stimulate the establishment of  joint Russian- Chinese ventures, particularly in the production  sphere.    Barter trade is being replaced with trade for hard currency,  which both countries consider to be more promising. Last year  it reached between 30 and 50 per cent of the total bilateral  commodity exchange.    Although favourable tendencies prevail in the  Russian-Chinese  commercial relations on the whole, the volume of trade  diminished by half in the first two months of this year as  compared with the same period last year. According to Chinese  specialists, this is partially due to the delay in the signing  of the intergovernmental agreement on mandatory deliveries of  goods, the growth of Russian customs duties and the expansion of  licensing of export commodities. One of the main reasons for the  reduction is a tougher approach to the issue of visas in both  countries. There have been failures in the execution of  contract obligations by both sides.    Ho Chushen thinks it necessary to involve banks and  insurance  companies in Sino-Russian trade relations to provide necessary  guarantees of commercial operations.    China is concerned about the problem of ownership in Russia,  where the Chinese, as well as other foreigners, are hard put to  understand who owns what and who is responsible for what. In a  broader context this question relates to the country's social  and political stability.    China and Russia do not have open political contradictions,  like those which complicate China's trade with Western  countries. The main problems for the two countries are  transportation and finances. Another acute problem is security  of railway haulage.    Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's forthcoming  visit to China this month and China's Chairman Jiang Zemin's  visit to Russia scheduled for the third quarter of this year  will undoubtedly facilitate the development of mutually  beneficial trade and economic relations, Ho Chushen said.  According to experts, the value of bilateral trade is likely to  exceed 11 billion dollars by the end of the century.</p>

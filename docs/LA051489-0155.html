			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EERIE DEATHS OF 17 WOMEN BAFFLE MIAMI  </P> <P> In what has become a bizarre and persistent pattern, 17 women have died here in  the past 2 1/2 years. All of them young. All of them black. All of them found  in empty lots or gutted buildings.  </P> <P> Almost all were prostitutes. Almost all held traces of cocaine in their  systems. Almost all were discovered naked from the waist down, with their legs  spread apart.  </P> <P> Last week, for the first time, the county's chief medical examiner, Dr. Joseph  Davis, pronounced the deaths probable homicides. "I suspect we are looking at  the work of one man," he said.  </P> <P> And the people of Miami, until now largely unaware of the ghastly sequence,  began facing the possibility that a serial killer was in their midst.  </P> <P> For months, detectives and pathologists have been confounded. None of the dead  bodies shows any signs of trauma. No bruises. No internal injuries. No needle  marks.  </P> <P> Even now, investigators remain unsure whether this is a medical mystery or a  criminal one. If prostitutes are being murdered, why no signs of struggle?  After all this time, why no reports of a near miss?  </P> <P> "When you talk about mysteries in deaths, these are by far the most mysterious  you'll ever find," said Miami Police Sgt. David Rivero, who worked some of the  first cases. "I mean, usually you have a motive or a witness or at least a good  cause of death. Here, forget it."  </P> <P> All the corpses have been found in the north half of Dade County, though  prostitutes and cocaine are commodities in the south end too. The first death  dates back to September of 1986 -- or even earlier if, as some investigators  figure, the list includes more than 17 names.  </P> <P> For a long time, the prevailing theory about the deaths was a highly unusual  one -- that the prostitutes died from the toxic effects of cocaine accompanied  by the stimulation of sex. Neural exhaustion, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner  Charles Wetli called it.  </P> <P> If true, that would explain the partially disrobed bodies. Cheap hookers often  exchange sex for crack cocaine. They ply their trade in abandoned buildings or  the tall weeds of vacant lots.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Linked to Deaths  </P> <P> The theory has an impressive advocate. Back in the late 1970s, Wetli was among  the first to show that cocaine, even in modest amounts, could lead to death. He  is the co-author of articles commonly cited in texts and journals, implicating  the drug in a variety of fatal illnesses.  </P> <P> Many of the police think the theory is very plausible. "We're just finding out  all of what crack does to people," said John Farrell, chief of detectives for  the county police, which has jurisdiction in most of the deaths.  </P> <P> "In men, we're finding that crack -- in amounts 10 times lower than a basic  overdose -- sometimes triggers psychotic episodes where a guy just goes  berserk, starts running a real high fever, then just dies."  </P> <P> Maybe these women, then, were victims of prolonged binges on crack, living on  the edge until even the relatively low arousal of sex-for-hire was enough to  finally induce a fatal reaction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seemed Far-Fetched  </P> <P> To some, however, the theory has always seemed far-fetched. Why were the  prostitutes dying in only one part of the county? Or, for that matter, in one  part of the state or the nation?  </P> <P> "As you went through any medical theory, you always came back to why not this  and why not that," Chief Farrell said. "Same thing with the question of murder.  You always came back to why weren't there any signs of trauma."  </P> <P> Last fall, meetings began taking place at the senior level between the county  police and the medical examiner's office, Farrell said. Inquiries were made  around the nation. More tests were done on the bodies. Crack was purchased on  the street, then analyzed for toxins.  </P> <P> A flyer was even distributed to prostitutes -- at once a warning and plea for  information: "If you should experience a reaction to crack cocaine, please  furnish us a sample so we can analyze it. You may save a life!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Theories  </P> <P> Not much came back that was helpful. The hookers had as many theories as the  cops: The drugs. A killer. A killer and his friends.  </P> <P> Then, last December, Body No. 12 was found. Antoinette Burns, 14, died in a  junk-strewn yard under a Brazilian pepper tree. She was lying on her back. Her  skirt was pulled up. Everything fit the pattern.  </P> <P> Or almost everything. The girl's body tested clean for drugs. There was no  evidence she worked the streets.  </P> <P> And that complicated the riddle. Either the teen-ager did not belong on the  list -- or her case tipped the scales further toward homicide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Can't Figure It'  </P> <P> What was going on? "We just can't figure it," Chief Farrell said. "There may be  the possibility of different causes of death. Is there a serial killer? Is  there a medical explanation? Maybe yes to all possibilities."  </P> <P> The list has grown by five in 1989. More help has been sought.  </P> <P> The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has been consulted regarding  extensive toxicology tests. The FBI in Quantico, Va., has been asked to help  put together the profile of a serial killer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Forensic Dentist  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Souverin, a well-known forensic dentist, has been called in to  examine the lips of the dead women. One theory suggests that they died from  "forced fellatio," which cut off their air supply.  </P> <P> In that regard, Souverin is also comparing the women's teeth with any marks  found on suspects -- so far unproductively. "If the skin is broken and a scar  is left, you can make a match," he said.  </P> <P> And Dr. George Hensley, who teaches pathology at the University of Miami  Medical School, has been asked to offer his opinion. He believes someone is  suffocating the women in a way that leaves no signs of trauma.  </P> <P> But how? "You're talking about little girls on the street, and it's not too  hard to asphyxiate them, especially when you have their backs on the ground and  your weight on their abdomen," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Escaped Attention  </P> <P> Oddly, in a city where strange crimes ordinarily enjoy a long run of lurid  retelling, this investigation largely escaped the media's attention until a  local weekly, New Times, ran a lengthy cover story about it.  </P> <P> Since then, the airwaves have filled with the views of several of the  participating investigators. Finally, the chief medical examiner weighed in:  probable homicide.  </P> <P> But if so, by whom? And by how many?  </P> <P> There are other questions as well. Amid the sudden glare of publicity, some  wonder if the cases of 17 dead black women -- mostly prostitutes -- have been  given short shrift. The Miami Times, a newspaper for the black community,  charges that there has been an "intolerable delay" in solving the cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Women's Families  </P> <P> That feeling is shared by some of the women's families. Thelma Rahming, the  grandmother of Antoinette Burns, said the homicide detectives were uninterested  in what she had to say last year. "Now they're back telling me they're starting  from scratch," she said.  </P> <P> Chief Farrell, however, insists the cases have been vigorously investigated all  along. "And we've reached out to the group we need to, and that's not the  general public," he said. "These are not women just walking down the street  getting accosted. These are women having sex near crack houses."  </P> <P> And, yes, a prostitute who identified herself only as Lynette along busy  Biscayne Boulevard, said she has been well aware of the deaths -- in fact knew  a few of the victims.  </P> <P> "A bad dude is taking out the girls," she said. "Of course, we're just a bunch  of black whores. He'd go do it to a white woman and you'd see the FBI, the CIA  and the Marines down here, for a thing like this."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Igrunov, deputy of the State Duma: </F> "Crimea Has Decided--Not That Meshkov Is Better, But Simply That  There Has Been Enough of Bagrov"]    [Text] When, during the first round of presidential  elections in Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, unexpectedly for most  politicians, took 37 percent of the vote, a commotion was raised  in Kiev. From the outside one got the impression that Ukraine  was ready to intervene in order to prevent a second round. L.  Kravchuk received special authorization, and Ukrainian  nationalists urged him on to use force. If he had given in and  had not allowed for the resolution of the Crimean question "from  the inside," an outpouring of political emotions and  confrontations with the participation of the Black Sea fleet  would have become inevitable.    As a member of the Duma committee on matters pertaining to  the CIS, I decided to travel to Kiev and Crimea, and to look at  the whole situation on the spot. The trip was a private one,  since our committee at that point had not been able to work out  a common position.    Indecisiveness reigned in Kiev--that very condition in which  the most serious mistakes are allowed to occur. Sensible  Ukrainian politicians understood that the unwillingness of  Crimeans to live as before was so strong that changing the  situation would be possible only by force--force that was not  there, since Ukraine as a state found itself on the verge of  catastrophe, on the threshold of a possible explosion of social  discontent. On the eve of the new elections, when the Ukrainian  state would inevitably have to change its orientation, the  politicians in Kiev found themselves unwilling to take upon  themselves the responsibility for forcible pressure on Crimea  and a possible armed conflict.    Bagrov, who had been Kiev's favorite going into the past  elections, had in the past been a pro-Russian pioneer and,  essentially, of Crimea's anti-Ukrainian orientation. But having  worked for a bit under the new conditions, he grasped the  realities and thought it advisable to stand up for the unity of  Ukraine--with Crimea as a component part of it. With this  pragmatic position of his, he identified himself with Ukraine,  and lost the support of the population in almost total measure.    In Kiev, Meshkov was viewed as a protege of imperial forces,  a separatist, ready to violate the integrity of the Ukrainian  state. In actual fact, the situation was much more complicated.  Meshkov found himself a hostage to an idea: He demanded decisive  actions for the obtaining of independence, and he agitated for a  referendum on the restoration of the Crimean Constitution, which  was adopted in May 1992. But already as he was taking part in  the elections, he realized that immediately incorporating Crimea  into Russia was impossible. Meshkov understood that Crimea's  rapprochement with Russia would not happen all at once, but in  stages, and would most likely take place not at all in the form  of a separation from Ukraine and entry into Russia. Crimea could  become that locomotive that pulls Ukraine toward Russia, aiding  in their rapprochement. And that was why, directly after the  first round of voting, Meshkov made the appropriate  announcement. Bagrov played on this, saying: "See--there is no  alternative to my way!", which compelled Meshkov again to  emphasize his radicalism. As a result, from the outside one got  the impression that this was an irresponsible person who was  grasping for power, a person who would quickly proclaim Crimea's  independence. And further on, Ukraine would answer with forcible  methods, and a war would start.    In fact, Meshkov has no program that differs from Bagrov's.  He proposes different methods. Bagrov trod only those paths that  had been trampled smooth by the party nomenklatura: He traveled  to Kiev, reported on everything, and supposed that the matter  was in the bag. And when parliament did not approve or did not  carry out the arrangement, it came as a surprise to him. But  Meshkov and other opponents believe that it is necessary to seek  to achieve not arrangements, but the adoption of corresponding  laws; it is necessary to make a break and to forge ahead. This  is an objective contradiction, which cannot be avoided in this  changing world.    Of course, a changing of the guard must take place from time  to time. I met with many very highly placed bureaucrats of  Bagrov's team. And they gave me to understand that they were  tired of Bagrov: That was it; they could do no more. It was not  that Meshkov was better, but simply that they had had enough of  Bagrov. Another segment felt that Bagrov was losing the reins,  that power was slipping away and was already switching over to  other banners. As a result, even before Meshkov's victory, the  level of control in Bagrov's team approached zero.    Meshkov gave me the impression of being a rather well-bred  person. He tries to act like, and copies the behavior of,  "decisive" people, who can bang their fists on the table. But he  is a mild person, and one feels a pose, an artificiality, in his  decisiveness. Some seek to alarm us, saying: "He is a Crimean  Zhirinovskiy!" Nothing of the kind. It is another matter that  the motives for voting for Meshkov are the same as those of the  Russian population for voting for Zhirinovskiy. If one gets rid  of Meshkov, a Zhirinovskiy will be there next, because that is  precisely the mood in Crimea.    Bagrov sits in the luxurious building of the Supreme  Council;  I met with Meshkov in a not overly clean, unfurnished room in  the Veterans Union. He was guarded by Afghan veterans with  submachine guns; these guys sat around in everyday sweaters.  None of them wore jackets or ties. A completely different  atmosphere. There is some kind of political fanatic on his team,  but there are also former political prisoners, members of the  local intelligentsia, and so on. It would be a mistake to expect  of him the same as from Zhirinovskiy. The people surrounding  Meshkov understand the complexity of the problems and are  willing not to be in a hurry, to act together with Ukraine and  Russia without any extravagant steps. They understand the needs  of the population and are ready to move in that  direction--understanding the difficulties, they are prepared to  act with moderation. But it is immediately apparent that they  cannot deal with the situation. They will not know how to work  with the apparat.    Bagrov is surrounded by a very bad circle: It includes many  corrupted bureaucrats and mafiosi. And here come young people,  who want to realize their program by honest means, not behind  the scenes, not over the telephone, but in a normal way, through  the legislature. They are planning to struggle with corruption,  but economic monsters have already sucked onto power there.    What are the new politicians to do? Needless to say, a panic  begins. I can understand Meshkov, hiding behind submachine guns.  After all, how many political figures and entrepreneurs have  been killed! I do not rule out the possibility that a disruption  of production and an outflow of capital will begin in Crimea.    Now let us imagine that Meshkov really does conduct a  referendum with strict formulations on the status of Crimea. I  do not think that the Ukrainian Government will embark on any  kind of resolute actions. One scenario, however, is possible,  where the Ukrainian National Self-Defense Organization would  send its detachments there. Then a catastrophe would be  inevitable. There is enough militia presence summoned from  Galician parts, and there are extreme nationalists there--both  Ukrainian and Russian. Clashes take place with Crimean Tatars,  who are prepared to act in the most resolute manner. In such a  situation there are enough sparks to start a Dniester region.  And a Dniester region in Crimea would be horrifying, if only  because the Black Sea fleet is no 14th Army. A catastrophe could  happen here. Neither Ukraine nor Russia could remain uninvolved,  even if they very much wanted to. The Cossacks would come in  from Russia, and the Zaporozhtsy would come in from Ukraine. And  after them, like it or not, our tanks and Ukrainian tanks....    Just one gaffe in Meshkov's behavior, or Bagrov's refusal to  participate in the power structures, could provoke a serious  conflict in Crimea. Russia would do well to act as an active  mediator and avert hasty actions. It would be possible to make  an announcement that would restrain the population from making  extreme demands, and this would allow Meshkov to save face. It  would be possible to try, on the one hand, to convince the  former executive power to deal with the new president and the  new realities. To propose some kind of paths that would inspire  the confidence of Ukraine, to prepare Ukrainian dialogue with  Moscow. Moscow's moderation in its demands of Crimea, and a  refusal to carry out the decisions of the former Supreme  Soviet--even without their formal repeal--would create the  prerequisites for the rapprochement of Ukraine and Russia. That  would help support stability in Crimea.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev reached a principal agreement on  establishment of a Russian military base on Armenian territory  during their talks in Yerevan.    Grachev told journalists on Thursday that the base would be  situated in two cities - Gyumri and Yerevan and would represent  a potent group of troops, including not only infantry but also  air defense units, all types of air forces, except for the  distant ones, and supply units.    The group of troops is expected to be so that it could be  brought to any of threatened directions and to conduct military  actions for a certain period of time until the main forces come,  Grachev said.    Grachev emphasized that the final decision on establishment  of the Russian military base would be made by the Russian and  Armenian presidents.    Ter-Petrosyan and Grachev also discussed creation of a  single  air defense system for the two countries. Grachev said that  additional air defense units would be brought to Armenia in  order to "cover some directions where he can carry out no  surveillance over the air space." These would be surface-to-air  missile forces and a squadron of interceptor jets.    Grachev pointed out that all these issues were expected to  be  resolved in June or July so that the establishment of the  Russian military base in Armenia be completed in August.    In accordance with the achieved agreement, the Armenian  party  will take active part in the financing of the Russian military  base. Grachev stressed that Russian would pay no rent for this  base. He added that establishment of Russian military bases on  Armenian and Georgian territory would be carried out according  to the will of the leadership of these republics.    Reliable sources told Interfax that the Russian party had  proposed that it lease the newly established base during 25  years with further extension of this term on the basis of an  agreement between Moscow and Yerevan.    Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan believes that the  Armenian parliament will ratify the Russian-Armenian inter-  governmental agreement on the status of Russian troops in the  republic. IF Note: This agreement was signed in 19992 and  ratified by the former Russian parliament in February, 1993.    Sarkisyan said in an exclusive interview with Interfax that  the Armenian leadership did not demand Russia to pay for leasing  the base and for public utilities. He added that Yerevan, in  its turn, wanted Armenian citizens to receive education in  Russian military colleges for free. Some Armenian servicemen  may serve on the Russian military bases which are expected to be  created in Armenia.</p>

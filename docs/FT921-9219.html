			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: News Corp up despite BSkyB loss NEWS CORPORATION has overcome continuing losses in the 50 per cent-owned BSkyB satellite TV operation in Europe and the Ansett Transport group in Australia to increase profits for the six months ended December 1991. The Australian-based international media conglomerate, controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, lifted net earnings by 38 per cent, to ADollars 252.2m (USDollars 189.60m), despite an 8 per cent slide in revenue to ADollars 5.3bn from ADollars 5.7bn. The interim dividend is being held at 5 cents a share. The profits progress was achieved despite almost ADollars 62.7m in equity-accounted losses - compared with a ADollars 13.9m profit previously - from BSkyB and Ansett plus continuing asset disposals. News said BSkyB should be in profit by the final quarter of 1991-92, and improved results were expected from Ansett. BSkyB, with more than 2m domestic satellite dish customers in the UK, is expected to reach operational break-even next month, News said. It is believed that financing charges on the venture still account for around Pounds 3m a week. News Corp directors outlined a period of asset sales and debt restructuring, including disposal of the Enquirer/Star newspapers in the US. Proceeds from the disposals and cash raisings totalled ADollars 1.5bn, with most going to debt repayments required under banking agreements. This helped to reduce net interest payments in the six months to ADollars 497.3m from ADollars 593.0m, and depreciation charges eased to ADollars 115.2m from ADollars 152.7m. The US-based Fox Broadcasting television operation emerged as the big earnings improver in the six months. Gross television income jumped to ADollars 124.4m from ADollars 10.7m. Newspapers, however, remained the group's mainstay, lifting income to ADollars 286.8m from ADollars 255.2m. All other business areas recorded lower gross income, with magazines down to ADollars 104.9m from ADollars 128.2m; films falling to ADollars 67.7m from ADollars 93.7m; and book publishing off to ADollars 156.7m from ADollars 160.4m. Other operations dipped to ADollars 106.4m from ADollars 148.6m. On a geographic basis, the UK recorded the biggest gross income rise, up to ADollars 173.9m from ADollars 39.3m. Directors said this reflected improved margins on the company's five main newspapers. The US remained the News group's most profitable region, even though its gross income contribution fell from ADollars 571.5m to ADollars 471.8m. Directors said US earnings were hit by the sale of nine consumer publications, while Twentieth Century Film's result was also down. Lex, Page 20</p>

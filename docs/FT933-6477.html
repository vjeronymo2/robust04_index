			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Technology: A rose by any other shape - Worth Watching A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but genetic manipulation is required to ensure that it has a stem as smooth as a tulip, or a flower as large as a chrysanthemum. The International Floriculture Co-operative Research Centre, in Australia, is spending ADollars 18m (Pounds 8.18m) to develop tailor-made flowers, with the colour and fragrance that fashion predicts. The work is funded by the Australian government, research organisations and businesses - including Calgene Pacific, which is about to produce a blue rose. Calgene Pacific: Australia, 3 419 9844.</p>

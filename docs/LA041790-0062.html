			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOCKEY / STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> OILERS WIN, 4-1, EARN CHANCE TO GET EVEN WITH KINGS  </P> <P> Mark Lamb scored a breakaway goal late in the first period at Edmonton to put  the Oilers ahead to stay as they defeated the Winnipeg Jets, 4-1, Monday night,  becoming only the seventh team in NHL history to win a playoff series after  trailing by three games to one.  </P> <P> The Oilers, who blew a 3-1 lead and lost to the Kings in the Smythe Division  semifinals last year, will get a chance to avenge that loss in the division  finals beginning Wednesday night at the Northlands Coliseum.  </P> <P> Lamb took a pass from Glenn Anderson and beat Stephane Beauregard at 17:52 to  give the Oilers a 2-1 lead. After a scoreless second period, Esa Tikkanen gave  Edmonton a two-goal lead at 5:09 of the final period before Lamb set up Jari  Kurri's fourth goal of the series with 2:12 remaining.  </P> <P> Anderson gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead when he beat Beauregard, one of the Jets'  two rookie goaltenders, at 8:54 of the opening period. But Thomas Steen fired a  wrist shot from the right wing past Bill Ranford 27 seconds later for the Jets'  lone goal.  </P> <P> Ranford stopped 26 of 27 shots.  </P> <P> The victory was the sixth for the Oilers in as many NHL playoff series with the  Jets, who won only one of 19 games in the first five.  </P> <P> The Oilers were 4-2-2 against the Kings during the regular season. The two  teams have not met since Feb. 28, when they brawled their way to 356 penalty  minutes in Los Angeles' 4-2 victory at the Forum.  </P> <P> Chicago 5, Minnesota 2 -- Wayne Presley and Jeremy Roenick each scored in the  second period and the Blackhawks rolled to victory over the North Stars,  winning their Norris Division semifinal series in seven games.  </P> <P> Chicago, the regular-season Norris Division champion, will open the division  finals at home Wednesday night against the St. Louis Blues, who eliminated the  Toronto Maple Leafs in five games.  </P> <P> Presley tied the score, 1-1, three minutes into the second period and put the  Blackhawks ahead to stay at 4:06 with his fifth goal of the series. Both came  from directly in front of goalie Jon Casey, the second on a short wrist shot  during a delayed penalty.  </P> <P> Roenick knocked in his own rebound at 12:41 for a 3-1 lead, then scored again  at at 14:06, giving him five goals for the series.  </P> <P> Goalie Greg Millen stopped 30 of 32 shots for Chicago.  </P></p>

The  belligerent parties used heavy artillery, missiles, and aircraft  in the battles, which broke out day before yesterday between  President Borhanoddin Rabbani's forces on the one hand and  General `Abdol Rashid Dostam's Uzbek militias and the parties  allied with Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami  on the other.    Local sources spoke of "hundreds of dead and wounded" in the  clashes, and medical sources were not at first able to broadcast  an official count due to the continued fighting. however, they  commented that 70 people were killed and almost 700 wounded. The  sources expected the count to rise, especially since the  president's side used aircraft to bomb Bala Hesar Palace in the  capital, where Dostam's forces are concentrated.    Sadeq Tashkari, one of President Rabbani's aides, told  AL-HAYAH that responsibility for the fighting lay on the  shoulders of the Uzbek militias, which previously supported the  Communists and hold strategic positions in Kabul. He said the  Hezb-e Eslami and the Shi'ite Hezb-e Wahdat forces allied with  it entered the battle at the side of the militias afterward.    The presidential official mentioned that President Rabbani's  Jam'iyat-e Eslami forces, led by former Defense Minister Ahmad  Shah Mas'ud, had been able to repel the attackers. However,  Hezb-e Eslami sources strongly denied this and said the  attacking forces had taken over major strategic areas in Kabul  and that the fighting is concentrated around the Presidential  Palace. Meanwhile, General Fowzi, a commander of Dostam's  militias, said they had captured the radio and television  station, the Defense Ministry, and the president's Central Corps  General Headquarters.    President Rabbani day before yesterday called for a jihad  against his adversaries. he described the current battles as  being "a new stage in the jihad that cannot be distinguished  from the past 14 years" against the former Communist regime and  the Soviet forces that invaded Afghanistan to support it. He  said the goal of the alliance hostile to him "is to defend the  cause of former Communist President Babrak Karmal." He described  the Kabul attackers as "Karmal gangs."    The Hezb-e Eslami responded with a communique yesterday  carrying counter-charges against Rabbani for cooperating with  former Communists in the current fighting in Kabul.    Tehran radio said the Iranian Embassy in Kabul was hit  yesterday by several shells for the second time in the space of  24 hours, and that there were no losses among its employees.  Iran announced Saturday its "deep regret" for the new clashes,  which have broken out in Kabul. It requested of all sides "rapid  action to put an end to these battles by peaceful means."    An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Iran "is  ready to intervene and participate in putting an end to the  clashes."</p>

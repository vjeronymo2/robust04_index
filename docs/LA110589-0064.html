			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SHE WAS NO ANGEL  </P> <P> Back in the late '60s, Theresa Saldana's mom was furious when she joined a  Brooklyn gang called the Little Warriors. Now the actress portrays a mom who's  harassed when her son refuses to join a gang in "Angel Town," an independent  action flick (it stars kick boxer Olivier Gruner) set for Nov. 22 release.  </P> <P> "It was nothing like the gangs we have now," said Saldana, who was "12 or 13"  when she briefly became a Warrior. "Our gang was more for the purpose of  hanging out together than anything else. It was like a baby version of (the  movie) 'Turf.' But in truth, there are violent gangs in that same neighborhood  today. If some of the same kids had grown up later, who knows?"  </P> <P> Saldana's mom, feeling the other gang members were "too rowdy," shipped young  Theresa off "to a Catholic camp in the Poconos, where I was frankly much  happier."  </P></p>

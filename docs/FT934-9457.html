			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg gain reversed THE RECENT boom in London's financial markets was underlined yesterday by a surge in profits for SG Warburg. However, the reaction of investors suggested that confidence in further rises in equity and bond markets may be coming to an end. One analyst said: 'All markets have gone their way, but this is a cyclical business and Warburg will struggle to maintain momentum.' After hitting a high of 890p in the morning, Warburg's share price closed 20 lower on the day at 857p. However, even the more pessimistic analysts were forced to upgrade forecasts after Warburg announced first-half profits of Pounds 148.8m, against a market consensus of Pounds 135m and a profit of Pounds 51.2m last time. NatWest Securities, which had advised clients to take profits when opportunities presented themselves, has shifted its full-year forecast to Pounds 275m from Pounds 248m. Among the more enthusiastic analysts, Mr Martin Green of Smith New Court said he would be upgrading to above Pounds 300m, while Mr Martin Cross of UBS also expected to be around Pounds 300m. Mr Cross said that if first-half earnings were annualised, that would indicate an undemanding p/e ratio of 11 times. He added that there were no signs that the present economic conditions, which had done so much for financial markets, were about to end.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Liberal Democrats unveil six-point plan - In A Nutshell The Liberal Democrats last week unveiled a six-point programme to back small businesses. The programme calls for a government subsidy for bank loans to small and medium-sized manufacturing companies; grants for innovative small businesses in high-technology areas; and government subsidy for private-sector regional venture capital funds which back start-ups. It also urges the banks and government support agencies to offer equity finance, for a study of the use of mutal guarantee schemes by groups of businesses and for a statutory right to interest on unpaid debts.</p>

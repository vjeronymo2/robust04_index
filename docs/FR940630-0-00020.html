The rate savings must be directly related to the actions of the HA and must be cost effective. In addition, the rule eliminates the need for a waiver before operating subsidy may be paid for certain units approved for nondwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services and anti-drug activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John T.

No person may be subjected to a penalty for failure to comply with these information collection requirements until they have been approved and assigned an OMB control number. The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public reporting burden for the collection of information requirements contained in this rule is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Information on the estimated public reporting burden is provided under the Preamble heading,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Other Matters. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for HUD, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background on Shared Utility Rate Savings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9(a)(3)(B)(i) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g) (the ``1937 Act'') provides that under the performance funding system in the first year that the reductions occur, any public housing agency shall share equally with the Department any cost reductions due to the differences between projected and actual utility rates attributable to actions taken by the agency which lead to such reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 114(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (the ``1992 Act'') amended section 9(a)(3)(B)(i) of the 1937 Act to provide that in subsequent years, the Secretary may continue, with regard to energy savings, the sharing arrangement with the public housing agency for an additional 6 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of section 201(b)(1) of the 1937 Act, the provisions of Title I of the 1937 Act apply to low-income housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority. Therefore, the shared savings provisions under section 9(a)(3)(B)(i) extend to Indian housing authorities. However, under section 201(b)(2) no provision of Title I, or amendment to Title I, that is enacted after the date of enactment of the Indian Housing Act of 1988 (June 29, 1988) shall apply to public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority unless the provision explicitly provides for applicability. Therefore, absent such a provision, section 114(c) of the 1992 Act does not extend to Indian housing authorities. The Department, however, as matter of policy, is extending the shared savings arrangement to Indian housing authorities also. Not to do so would frustrate the goals of providing incentives to undertake energy conservation activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utility rate reduction measures include wellhead purchases of natural gas and administrative appeals or legal action beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings. It is important that an extension of the shared savings term provide adequate incentives and cover the increased administrative expense involved in undertaking energy conservation activities as sophisticated as a wellhead purchase program. The Department has a manifold interest in promoting the most economical purchasing arrangements in order to reduce the need for operating subsidies. There is, first and foremost, a national interest in reducing consumption of non-replaceable energy resources, and a parallel interest in making sure that energy resources are purchased economically and efficiently. In the context of the housing assistance programs, HUD is obliged to honor these over-all goals by encouraging energy conservation in assisted housing environments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

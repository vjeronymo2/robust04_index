			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroaki Ito] </F>   [Text] Washington -- U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor, who has made "Japan bashing" a daily task, recently  stopped making critical comments on Japan. He is believed to  have changed his comments on Japan out of concern that if his  criticism of Japan spurs further appreciation of the yen against  the U.S. dollar, this may result in higher interest rates and  lower stock prices in the United States at a time when fears are  rising of a crash on the New York Stock Exchange.    In his lecture to a gathering of medium and small businesses  on 5 April, Mr. Kantor only cited the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks as an example of U.S. efforts to open foreign  markets. In his lecture he did not mention the "closed nature  of the Japanese market," a term that he has frequently used.    Foreign investors rushed to U.S. stock markets in search of  profits from a rise in stock prices after interest rates were  lowered last autumn in the United States, but they recently  began suffering losses in their stock holdings in the wake of a  recent rebound in interest rates and a plunge in stock prices.    If the yen appreciates further against the U.S. dollar in  this situation, foreign investors would suffer another loss from  the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the yen and dollar.  A major Japanese securities firm says, "Under the present  situation, we want to pull out of U.S. stock markets after  selling off our stock holdings even if we risk losses."    The U.S. Government is conspicuously jittery about the rise  in interest rates and the plunge in stock prices. Robert Rubin,  chairman of the National Economic Council (NEC), appearing on  television on 3 April; Tyson, chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisers; and President Clinton, speaking on television  on 4 April, appealed to investors to respond calmly to plunging  stock prices. Mr. Kantor appears to be "taciturn" about Japan as  a result.    If the present situation continues, the U.S. Government will  be pressed to alter its strategy toward Japan that aims at using  the Super 301 provision to apply pressure on Japan.    It has been said within the U.S. Government that the "United  States should pursue closer policy coordination with Japan and  European nations to keep the rise in long-term interest rates in  check, and curb further plunges in stock prices." Hence, there  is a possibility that the low stock prices and the high interest  rates in the United States will be taken up as an agenda item  for discussion at the talks of G-7 financial ministers and  central bank governors scheduled to be held in late April.</p>

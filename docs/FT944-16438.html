			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / RJB Mining set to pay Pounds 900m for English pits RJB Mining, a coal company listed on the stock exchange only last year, is the government's preferred candidate to take over British Coal's English mining assets, after it is believed to have made an offer of more than Pounds 900m. If the agreement is sealed over the next few weeks, the company will take over all three English regions, which include 15 of British Coal's 16 remaining pits. Celtic Energy, a management buy-out team, is the preferred bidder for South Wales. Mining (Scotland), a consortium, is favourite for the Scottish region. A consortium including the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the breakaway union whose members worked during the 1984-85 miners' strike, failed to win its bid for the two central England regions. The UDM miners' union lodged its bids in partnership with Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal commercial director. Shares in Coal Investments, one of the stock market's top performers in the past year, fell by 20p yesterday to 118p. The company operates under licence four former British Coal mines. The government aims to complete privatisation of the industry on December 24. Its decisions on preferred bidders, announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, at the Conservative party conference, took the industry by surprise. Although British Coal had argued strongly that the industry should be sold as one company, many industry executives assumed that the government's desire for competition would lead to a break-up. If the talks with RJB are successful, the company will produce more than four-fifths of Britain's coal. RJB won the government's backing by putting in the highest combined offer for the three regions. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the predominant criterion for all the bids had been financial. The government also announced yesterday that it had selected preferred bidders for four pits closed by British Coal this year. CI has been chosen for Annesley/Bentinck in Notts, RJB for Thorne in Yorkshire and Ellington in Northumberland and an employee buy-out team for Tower colliery in south Wales. Mr Eggar said that the value of the bids could not be disclosed. But he would announce the total proceeds of the sale of British Coal after it had been completed at the end of December. RJB Mining, named after Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, has been involved in opencast mining for about 20 years and already operates three mines closed in the past two years by British Coal.

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Bank builds bridges to S Africa / A look at Pretoria's bid for international financial respectability AFTER A quarter of a century's estrangement, South Africa and the World Bank are well on the way to reconciliation. Mr Lewis Preston, the Bank president, is to visit South Africa next week, his first trip to Africa since he took up the job last September. For months, World Bank officials have pursued informal contacts with the various political parties and groups in South Africa. Several teams have been to research an economy which has been virtually unknown to the Bank since lending was suspended for political reasons in 1967. Now, relations seem set to assume a higher profile. Immediate access to Bank funding is not in prospect, however. The Bank is expected to resume lending only when a multi-party interim government is in place. Even then, there will be room for disputes within the Bank's board over what constitutes an interim government. Would a multi-racial executive with only limited powers (one option) qualify for renewed access, or will the board demand more fundamental change? In practice, it seems likely that the board will follow the advice of the African National Congress on the issue. Once formal relations are restored, debate will begin in earnest over whether South Africa should qualify for heavily subsidised loans from the International Development Association (the Bank's soft loan agency which lends to the world's poorest countries), or only for the mildly concessional loans available to middle-income countries. Income per capita in South Africa, at Dollars 2,520 a year in 1990, far exceeds the limit of Dollars 740 normally imposed on IDA recipients. However the grossly unequal distribution of income between whites and blacks might mean that South Africa could be treated as a special case for soft loans. But with the IDA's funding already under serious pressure from claimants worldwide, officials in Pretoria seem resigned to doing without heavily subsidised finance. The size of any World Bank programme for South Africa would thus be determined by demand from Pretoria: how much would a new government wish to borrow, given that the terms are only mildly concessional? South Africa could benefit indirectly from IDA finance by participating in regional projects aimed at low income countries such as neighbouring Mozambique. South Africa's electricity utility, Eskom, is keen to develop a regional electricity grid and various energy projects involving South African companies are under discussion. But the recipient government in such cases would be Mozambique, not South Africa. Government officials say no project plans have yet been drawn up for South Africa itself, nor have amounts been discussed. But World Bank lending is likely to focus on education and urban development, the two areas already researched by Bank officials. With 7m people living in informal settlements countrywide - including millions in squatter shacks - urban development will be a high priority for the new government. Education, too, is in crisis, with black schools desperately overcrowded, facilities poor and teachers poorly qualified. Already, the Bank is ready to provide informal technical assistance to black South Africans, with plans afoot to train those who might be officials of a future government through the Bank's Economic Development Institute. The ANC, for its part, remains deeply suspicious of international financial institutions such as the Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with some officials adopting the rhetoric of the 1960s to condemn them as neo-imperialist organisations. But ANC officials have met previous World Bank teams, and two of the movement's senior leaders are to see Mr Preston during his visit. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), another World Bank finance affiliate, is likely to be active in the South African private sector. Once lending resumes, the IFC is expected to focus its efforts on helping non-white entrepreneurs, selling management consultancy services and setting up an 'enterprise fund' aimed at small businesses, as it has done elsewhere in Africa. Eventually, the IFC could become involved in project finance in areas such as mining and chemicals.</p>

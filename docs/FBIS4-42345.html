			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Turkey has announced that the recent Cyprus report  issued by the UN secretary general disregards the  accomplishments made toward reaching an agreement on the  confidence-building measures package. A Foreign Ministry  announcement on the issue states that Turkey will not allow the  Turkish Cypriot side to be unjustly treated. The Foreign  Ministry statement is as follows:    The recent Cyprus report issued by the UN secretary general  within the framework of his goodwill mission disregards the  accomplishments made toward reaching an agreement on the  confidence-building measures. Rauf Denktas, president of the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], yesterday informed  the UN representatives that if the planned benefits to the TRNC  from the implementation of the confidence-building measures made  in accordance with the agreement reached at the meeting held  with UN officials in Vienna are reflected in the final  agreement, then the Turkish Cypriot side accepts the map of  Maras [Varosha] and the arrangements regarding access to Maras.  The fact that the report accuses the Turkish Cypriot side,  despite its justified and constructive attitude, of not having  the will to reach an agreement is incompatible with the  realities. This approach does not contribute to the efforts  being exerted in Cyprus toward a solution. The principle of  reaching an agreement on the island based on the will of the two  sides and through free negotiations has been ignored. It is  clear that a positive result cannot be achieved through pressure.    Turkey shares and supports the views expressed by the TRNC  authorities regarding the UN secretary general's report. Turkey  will not allow the Turkish Cypriot side to be unjustly treated.  Turkey has always favored a realistic and viable solution in  Cyprus and with this understanding in mind it has supported the  positive and constructive attitude the TRNC has so far pursued  in the negotiating process for the confidence-building measures.</p>

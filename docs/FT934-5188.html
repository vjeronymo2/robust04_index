			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / People: Drummond leaves Grosvenor Robert Drummond, chairman of Grosvenor Venture Managers, has stepped down following a disagreement over the future direction that the company is to take. Drummond, who joined Grosvenor three years ago, still retains a 49.2 per cent holding in the venture capital company though the long term future of this holding is now uncertain. Drummond, who is 47, is probably better known than most venture capitalists because of his appearance in a BBC2 television series featuring Grosvenor, a medium-sized company based in Slough. The aim of the programmes, which appeared at the beginning of this year, was to explain the workings of venture capital. The timing of the series, called the Adventurers, was embarrassing for Grosvenor because it coincided with the company's unsuccessful attempt to raise Pounds 60m from institutions. At the end of the series it was clear that Grosvenor had only raised Pounds 7m. Both sides deny that the TV exposure was behind Drummond's decision to quit. Drummond has spent more than 20 years in the venture capital industry with prominent players such as 3i, Alta Berkeley Associates and County NatWest Ventures. He went to Electra Kingsway in 1989 but after only a short stay moved to Grosvenor the following year. He is now determined that when he goes back into the venture business he will be working for himself. 'I want to be the boss,' he says. His place as chairman has been taken by Bill Edge, 57, a Grosvenor veteran who has been with the company since its inception in 1981. Edge initially went into his family business, which made household chemicals and medicines, until it was taken over by Reckitt and Colman. He subsequently worked for Wyeth Laboratories and S&amp;W Berisford.</p>

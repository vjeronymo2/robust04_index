			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SHOW ON BEHALF OF ARTISTS' 'LIBERTIES'  </P> <P> Nearly 100 would-be artists got a chance to work alongside the real thing on  Saturday at the Woman's Building. The event was the opening of "Taking  Liberties," an exhibition by visual and performance artists whose work has come  under fire for its political, sexual or religious content.  </P> <P> For the exhibition, the artists created new works on the gallery walls during a  3-hour "freedom of art-making marathon" in which audience members were welcome  to join in by either creating their own art works or writing comments about the  artists' works.  </P> <P> "This is all about getting people to express themselves," said lesbian folk  singer Phranc, who wrote the lyrics to her new song, "Dress Code," on one of  the gallery walls. "Nobody can keep us from doing what we do no matter what."  </P> <P> "Taking Liberties," on view through Dec. 28, includes works by noted artists  active in the freedom-of-expression debate, including May Sun, Cheri Gaulke and  Erika Rothenberg. According to Woman's Building artistic director Kathy Clark,  the show comes at a time when some members of the arts community may be  relenting in their pressure on foes such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.).  </P> <P> "It's important to not just let the issue die because some concessions have  been made," said Clark, referring to recent legislation affecting the National  Endowment for the Arts. "It's still important to create a forum where reaction  to potential oppressions of freedom of expression can be expressed."  </P> <P> Gaulke, who photocopied her entire body to create a nude crucifix form on the  gallery wall, called the event "an environment where the artists can  deliberately not censor themselves." Gaulke's artwork, which contains  strategically placed picture frames and is called "We Will Not Be Framed," grew  out of her censorship-related performance piece, "Hey Jesse, You Ain't Seen  Nothing Yet," in which she performs nude with frames around her breasts and  pubic region.  </P> <P> Also expanding on a previous work was Rothenberg, whose "What Some People Had  to Say About Censorship (Melrose Ave., Sept., 1990)" grew out of a window  installation she did at the Soap Plant store in September. During that  installation, she provided books for passersby to write their comments. For her  Woman's Building piece, she chose some of the most interesting comments -- such  as "Given the choice between censorship and lobotomy, I'll take the lobotomy,"  and "If 'pro' is the opposite of 'con,' then it stands to reason that  'progress' is the opposite of 'Congress,' " -- and posted them on the gallery  wall.  </P> <P> Also participating Saturday was visual artist Karen Atkinson, whose NEA-related  show last May at Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies resulted in more  than 20,000 pro-NEA postcards being sent to Congress and NEA committee members.  </P> <P> Atkinson's "Taking Liberties" exhibition expanded on her previous "Visionaries  of Their Time" poster depicting Helms along with Joseph McCarthy and Adolf  Hitler. At the Woman's Building, Helms is shown with such political figures as  Ronald Reagan, Christopher Columbus, Saddam Hussein, Oliver North, John  Frohnmayer, Dan Quayle and George Bush. "I want viewers to think about it and  respond to me," said Atkinson, "whether they agree or not."  </P> <P> Other artists participating in "Taking Liberties" include Mark Niblock, Rosalie  Ortega, Johana Went, Terry Wolverton and Liz Young. A number of others,  including visual artist Robbie Conal and performance artists Tim Miller and  Rachel Rosenthal, did not participate Saturday because of scheduling conflicts,  but may add works to the show later this week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS BLAME BRADLEY, COUNCIL, CRA FOR L.A. ILLS  </P> <P> More than 800 community leaders and neighborhood activists on Sunday assailed  the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, Mayor Tom Bradley and the City  Council for pursuing policies they say are turning Los Angeles into an  increasingly polarized city of "haves and have-nots."  </P> <P> The activists, representing scores of groups ranging from Concerned Citizens of  South Central Los Angeles to the Westwood-based Not Yet New York, put forth a  platform of proposals to take power away from the CRA, begin economic  rebuilding in depressed areas, reform city land-use policies and limit elected  officials to two terms in office.  </P> <P> "If you want to remake this city, you are certainly not going to do it with the  present set-up downtown," Barbara Blinderman, an attorney and member of Not Yet  New York, told a cheering crowd at UCLA.  </P> <P> Participants at the two-day gathering organized by the L.A. Weekly newspaper  and the Minority Assn. of Planners and Architects, were told by Deputy Mayor  Mike Gage on Saturday that the city will sponsor a three-day conference to  continue the discussions begun by the activists over the weekend.  </P> <P> However, Gage proposed that it be held after the mayoral election April 11.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Failings in South-Central  </P> <P> Dozens of speakers on Sunday decried the city's failure -- and Bradley's low  profile -- in bringing economic development, new jobs and affordable housing to  South-Central Los Angeles and other depressed areas that were hit hard by plant  closures and a citywide move away from heavy manufacturing in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Robin Cannon, president of Concerned Citizens of South Central, said that while  the media focuses almost exclusively on gang troubles in the black community,  there are far more destructive forces at work.  </P> <P> "Besides facing the eminent domain powers of the school district, which wants  to tear down an entire neighborhood for a school, we are under siege by the CRA  and by the University of Southern California, both of whom want to expand at  our expense," Cannon said. "Banks have accepted our savings deposits but refuse  to make us home improvement loans, and invest the money elsewhere. The city has  done nothing to stop it."  </P> <P> Gage, who spoke on Saturday along with officials invited from Boston and  Toronto, defended Bradley's policies and said elected leaders have "done a good  job" responding to the city's vast challenges of homelessness, growth and  downtown revitalization.  </P> <P> However, Gage conceded that far more intensive efforts are required if the city  is to follow more innovative cities -- notably Boston and Toronto -- that are  well ahead in tackling urban crises.  </P> <P> However, many who heard comments from Gage on Saturday, and from CRA Board  Chairman James Wood on Sunday, said the city has already proved it is on the  wrong track.  </P> <P> Bob Erlenbusch, of a group known as the Campaign for Critical Needs, noted that  Los Angeles has one of the worst housing affordability problems in the country,  a sewage-polluted bay, intractable smog and growing traffic ills.  </P> <P> "What we really need is a new mayor," Erlenbusch said. "He and other elected  officials are hopelessly out of touch with what is happening in this city, and  that is part of the reason 1,000 people showed up here this weekend."  </P></p>

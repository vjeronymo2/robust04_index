			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / French defeated on plan for early trade reprisals A FIRM Anglo-German alliance last night beat back a French move for early reprisals against the US in the looming EC-US trade war. This coincided with intervention in the dispute by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Dunkel decided to go to Brussels and Washington within the next few days to press the EC and the US to resolve their dispute over European oilseeds subsidies and to reconvene talks on world trade liberalisation in Geneva. At a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the French urged that the EC begin preparing reprisals against the US threat to levy punitive tariffs on Dollars 300m (Pounds 193.5m) of European exports on December 5. But, instead, a majority of ministers called for urgent resumption of negotiations with the US. Only Spain, Belgium, Portugal and Greece rallied to the French call for a muscular response to Washington. However, most of the 12 agreed that EC counter-retaliation would be inevitable if the US goes ahead with its sanctions after the 30-day waiting period it has set. The EC ministers expressed 'severe disappointment at US threats to withdraw, unilaterally, Gatt-bound concessions' while trade talks were still going on in Geneva. The ministers warned 'that such action could only lead to a retaliatory spiral, which would damage both sides through a slump in business confidence and lost jobs'. Senior EC diplomats said last night that the European Commission in Brussels would be told at its meeting tomorrow to bury its internal differences over who negotiates for the Community in the trade affair. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, last week relinquished responsibility for the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round of trade talks because he felt Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was undermining him by siding with France. Tomorrow's meeting could therefore be a showdown between Mr Delors and Mr MacSharry. 'There is urgency about getting (the talks with the US) going,' a UK presidency official said. 'Let us say that there will be urgent disappointment if (after Wednesday) they haven't sorted themselves out.' French officials would not be drawn on whether Mr MacSharry had exceeded his mandate - as Paris and Mr Delors have claimed - in the deal he was close to reaching in Chicago. Mr Bruno Durieux, French trade minister, said: 'We do not want the Gatt agreement to go any further than the effort demanded (in farm subsidy cuts) by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.' Mr MacSharry maintains he has kept within the CAP reform's projected cuts in subsidised food exports. But Mr Durieux said yesterday this remains 'to be confirmed'. The Commission yesterday undertook to demonstrate whether the price and production cuts the 12 agreed in May for the CAP reform fit within any eventual Gatt deal. Mr Dunkel's intervention came after ambassadors to Gatt said at an informal meeting with him yesterday that they wanted him to talk to the two trading powers urgently. At today's emergency meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee, the top-level supervisory body for the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, Mr Dunkel is expected to be given a formal mandate to sound out the US and EC on getting the Geneva talks restarted.

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSENFIELD ON ENFORCING AUTO INSURANCE ROLLBACKS  </P> <P> I am continually astounded that someone who talks as incessantly as Rosenfield  can display such naivete about his intended subject.  </P> <P> Would he really replace the relatively streamlined insurance industry with a  government bureaucracy which would be even less efficient? And does he really  think the people of California are so stupid as to believe it would work to  their advantage?  </P> <P> Rosenfield is right on one point: So far, it's only the lawyers who have  benefited from the insurance reform effort. I would urge him to turn his  attention to that sector if he sincerely wants to reduce the cost of insurance,  since that is where 75% of his premium dollars are going.  </P> <P> FREDERICK C.

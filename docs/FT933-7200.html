			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation euphoria begins to wane GOVERNMENT bond markets do not like booms. Any doubters have only to look at how the long end of the gilts market has been propelled to the highest levels for more than a generation by the UK's low inflation and modestly-paced economic recovery. Reflecting on recent statistics, Mr Neil Williams, economist at Daiwa, the Japanese bank, said: 'The past three months have seen nothing but good news, particularly on the inflation front.' But are the figures too good to be true? Towards the end of last week, profit-taking and a slight waning of bullishness saw prices ease slightly. 'The danger is that this current mood of optimism about inflation won't last,' said one London fund manager. 'If there is just a ripple of inflation in the autumn the long bonds, which are super-sensitive, will come down.' Furthermore, when looked at in comparison with European bonds, the rally at the long end looks less justified than it does in a domestic context. The spread between gilts and German bunds, for example, has become so tight that some analysts do not believe gilts have much further to rise, other than in the context of a general rally in European government bonds. 'This rally has been an out-performance relative to the rest of Europe,' said Mr David Mackie, UK economist at JP Morgan, the US investment bank. The current spread between bunds and gilts is 75 basis points, compared with more than 100 basis points six months ago. Between French OATs and bunds the spread is close to zero, while the spread between bunds and Spanish bonds is about 300 basis points. 'If one sees the spread as a reflection of inflation expectations, then clearly the market expects French inflation to match German inflation in the medium term, even though French inflation is currently much lower,' said Mr Mackie. The implication of the spread between Germany and Spain is that the market does not expect Spain to be able to control inflation in the long run. 'So to have a spread of 75 for the UK probably means that, on average over the next few years, UK inflation is going to be only less than one percentage point above German inflation. I think that is too optimistic in the medium term,' said Mr Mackie. There are reasons to be sceptical about the UK's chances of performing so well in relation to German inflation, even if price rises remain subdued by UK standards. Underlying inflation in Germany, which strips out the distorting effects of taxation, is at roughly 3.5 per cent, while underlying inflation in the UK - the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments - is just under 3 per cent. But Germany is some two years behind the UK in the economic cycle, and has further big gains in inflation to look forward to. Although inflation in the UK may stay low, there is a general feeling among economists that it has already seen most of the gains it can expect to have on the inflation front. This view was reinforced by the small upwards movement in both the headline and underlying rates of inflation revealed in official figures published last week. These showed that prices rose 1.4 per cent in the year to July, compared with 1.2 per cent in the previous month. Underlying inflation was 2.9 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent. 'From a purely domestic point of view, the rally in gilts looks justified,' said Mr Mackie. 'But vis-a-vis Europe, it looks as though we have overshot.' In spite of these gloomy thoughts, the gilt bulls are still out there. 'These stunningly good levels can be maintained,' said Mr Nick Knight, head of strategy at Nomura Research. 'I think the fact that the inflation picture is sufficiently stable, and that news on the public sector borrowing requirement will improve as growth picks up, means that we can hold these levels.' Mr Nigel Richardson at Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, echoes these thoughts. 'The shift in inflation expectations means we have seen the gilts market shift to a new yield level of between 7 1/4 and 7 1/2 per cent at the long end,' he said. Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a rise in yields of about 10 basis points. The increase was slightly less further out. On Friday night, the 8 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2003 was quoted at 107 9/32 to yield 6.96 per cent, almost a point lower on the week. Further out, the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2017 was quoted at 115 3/8 , yielding 7.37 per cent compared with 115 13/16 .</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / US to press Moslems to accept partition The United States is expected to play a much greater role in pushing forward the Geneva peace talks on the former Yugoslavia now that Washington has backed the use of Nato air strikes against Serb-held positions around Sarajevo, diplomats said yesterday. The US seems likely to use its influence to try to persuade the Bosnian government to accept the latest peace plan, they said. 'If the US wants to co-operate - and we need all the help we can get - it is very welcome,' said an official involved in the peace negotiations headed by Lord Owen and Mr Thorwald Stoltenberg. Mr Charles Redman, Washington's special envoy, has been attending the recent round of talks in Geneva. Any greater US involvement would give weight to the Geneva talks, despite sharp differences of policy and style between President Bill Clinton and Lord Owen. Last year, the Vance-Owen peace plan was openly rejected by the Clinton administration on the grounds that the Serbs were being rewarded for grabbing territory while the Bosnian Moslems were being left with an unviable state. The US however failed to put in place any alternative peace plan. In Washington, officials denied the administration was shifting its policy. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said the US was not trying to force the Bosnian Moslems to accept the plan. 'The idea that we would try to force a settlement on them which they would not be comfortable with would be just flat wrong,' she said. The current plan, which envisages the creation of three ethnic mini-states within a notional republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, has been partly rejected by the Bosnian government. The Bosnians would be given a third of the territory, the Serbs over a half, and the remainder allocated to the Croats. All three sides have agreed that the Sarajevo government can have a 99-year-lease for the use of the Adriatic port of Ploce and access to the port on the Neretva River, both crucial for conducting international trade for the new Bosnian state. But diplomats yesterday said a serious dispute over the status of 15 regions, mostly in eastern and north-eastern Bosnia, has prevented an overall agreement. The Bosnians argue that the swathes of territory being allotted to them by the negotiators are not a viable geographical entity. As a means of creating such a state, the Bosnian government is proposing that refugees who were forced to flee should be allowed to return to the disputed territories. But the negotiators say this would mean more land would have to be granted to the Bosnian government, while the Serbs, for their part, yesterday said they would not make any more compromises. Despite the threats of walk-outs, all three sides held bilateral talks yesterday on the disputed regions, and today, the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs will meet. 'We do not expect agreement in the coming days. So much also depends on what happens on the ground, especially in Sarajevo,' an official said.</p>

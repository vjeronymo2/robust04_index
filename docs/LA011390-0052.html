			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS, CHILDREN RECALL KING SPEECH  </P> <P> The voice of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. rang out once more at the Lincoln  Memorial on Friday as government officials and schoolchildren joined in a  birthday observance highlighted by a recording of the slain civil rights  leader's "I have a dream" speech.  </P> <P> "As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can feel his presence,"  James M. Ridenour, director of the National Park Service, told a crowd of  several hundred assembled in chilly, windy weather at the memorial.  </P> <P> King was shot to death on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. Had he lived, he  would be 61 on Monday. His speech at the memorial was the climax of a civil  rights march in 1963.  </P> <P> Effi Barry, wife of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, blinked back tears  as the recording came to the climax of King's speech, ending with the words,  "free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, we are free at last."  </P> <P> Later, Mrs. Barry joined Ridenour and two children representing District of  Columbia schools in laying three floral wreaths at the memorial in honor of  King.  </P> <P> Earlier, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. told an overflow crowd in the  850-seat Interior Department auditorium, "If Dr. King were alive today, he  would be marching hand in hand in the war against drugs, fighting to stop the  next generation from destroying itself.  </P> <P> "There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There is no dream,"  Lujan said. "There is only the nightmare of the fatal consequences of drug  use."  </P></p>

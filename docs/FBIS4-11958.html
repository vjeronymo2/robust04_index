			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The government does not plan on giving prior  warning of any decision to evacuate Jewish settlers from Hebron,  according to the State Attorney's Office response to a High  Court of Justice appeal by Uri Karzan, a resident of Tall  al-Rumaythah. Karzan, who demanded that the security forces be  ordered to give prior warning of a decision to evacuate Jews,  withdrew his appeal after being convinced that the government  does not intend to make such a move in the near future. Yiftah  El'azar reports:    The scenario was probably taken from the settlement leaders'  threats in the media: Thousands of settlers flowing into Hebron  preventing the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] from evacuating the  Jewish settlers. Uri Karzan, a resident of Tall al-Rumaythah,  appealed to the High Court to give prior warning of any  evacuation. The state's response indicates that the government  is worried that the above scenario could turn into reality. An  early warning, the State Attorney's Office said, might foil the  implementation of the government's decision. Although the  government did not accept Karzan's demand for an early warning,  Attorney Elyaqim Ha'etzni withdrew the appeal. [passage omitted]    Karzel became convinced that the government does not plan to  transfer the Hebron settlers at this stage. The state attorney  said so in the response to the appeal. The government added in  more legal terms: There is no reason why Karzal cannot appeal  to the High Court after a decision on evacuation is made and he  should not try to put the cart before the horse. The High  Court, however, gave Karzel the right to appeal later on.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> A SHOCK TREATMENT THAT MAKES NO SENSE  </P> <P> Daniel Patrick Moynihan set Washington's monuments whirling by suggesting that  people may stop reading President Bush's lips and start reading their pay stubs  when they see that a whopping payroll tax increase has made this month's check  much smaller than last month's.  </P> <P> The funds are ostensibly being withheld for Social Security -- but in fact,  they're just being used to pay for assorted federal expenditures, and the huge  trust fund surpluses are being used to distort the true size of the  Gramm-Rudman deficit targets.  </P> <P> "There is a word for this," Moynihan said. "The word is thievery."  </P> <P> First, the White House scoffed at the idea of a Democrat being for any tax cut.  But then it was endorsed by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has  become a retirement home for former Reagan Administration ideologues. And soon  Republican congressional leaders were warning Bush aides that Moynihan might  have sparked a Grand Old Party stampede.  </P> <P> Now the Bush team is complaining that Moynihan is just trying to make the  Administration look bad in an election year by pushing a Populist tax cut when  they're pushing their capital gains tax cut -- all of which will make the  deficit look so much higher than it does now.  </P> <P> Another way to say it is that it's time for the Administration to stop  deceiving the public.  </P></p>

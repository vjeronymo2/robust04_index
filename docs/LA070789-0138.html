			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FDA BANS ALL OTC BALDNESS CURES AS USELESS  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said today it is banning the sale of  non-prescription creams and lotions whose manufacturers claim they grow hair or  prevent baldness, because none has proven effective.  </P> <P> The FDA said in today's Federal Register that no manufacturer has been able to  show that such a product works.  </P> <P> The ban applies to products available without a prescription that are used  externally. These products are usually sold by mail or through barbers or  beauticians.  </P> <P> The ban will become effective in six months, the FDA said.  </P> <P> The FDA also said there is no evidence that vitamins, food supplements or other  products taken orally retard baldness or grow hair. The agency said it will  remove these products from the market on a case-by-case basis if their  distributors continue to make such claims.  </P> <P> The only product approved by the FDA for stimulating hair growth on the crown  of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2% solution of minoxidil, which is  applied externally. The drug is manufactured by the Upjohn Co. and sold under  the name Rogaine.  </P> <P> The FDA's ban is based on a recommendation of an advisory panel that evaluated  a number of ingredients, including lanolin, olive oil, wheat germ oil and  vitamins. The panel found none of these prevent baldness or promote hair  growth.  </P> <P> The FDA said that once the ban is in effect, manufacturers of any  non-prescription drug claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair will have to  provide proof to the agency that it is safe and effective before it can be put  on the market.  </P></p>

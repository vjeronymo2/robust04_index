			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Mitterrand will pick pro-Europe PM PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand indicated yesterday he would choose a politician who favoured closer European unity as France's new prime minister after next month's legislative elections. The president, whose governing Socialist party faces defeat in the elections, is entitled under French law to choose the next prime minister providing he or she can command a parliamentary majority. This means he will almost certainly have to choose a candidate from the conservative RPR and UDF alliance coalition, which has a clear lead in the opinion polls. However, President Mitterrand, a staunch supporter of European unity, said in an interview with Le Monde newspaper that 'it is obvious I will not call on a prime minister who would be against the construction of Europe', he said. The obvious casualty of the presidential veto is Mr Philippe Seguin, the RPR politician who was one of the most active campaigners against ratifying the Maastricht treaty in last autumn's referendum. Mr Seguin yesterday announced his candidature for the premiership. Front-runners for the premiership with pro-European views include Mr Edouard Balladur, the finance minister in the previous cohabitation government from 1986 to 1988, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president and now leader of the UDF, and Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the RPR who was Mr Mitterrand's choice as premier for the 1986-1988 government. President Mitterrand, who devoted his considerable political skills to out-manoeuvring Mr Chirac in the last period of cohabitation, said in the interview with Le Monde that he would co-operate with a future conservative administration and would share control of defence and foreign affairs. 'When one is not made for it, working together requires a modus vivendi,' he said. Yesterday's declaration from Mr Seguin marked the start of the public jostling for position among the conservative candidates for the premiership. Although there are only six weeks before the first round of the elections on March 21 the campaign has yet to hot up. The RPR and UDF are expected this week to announce joint proposals for the economy which will include continuing the Socialists' franc fort policy of preserving a strong currency.</p>

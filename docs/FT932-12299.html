			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / 20% of tankers 'below safety standards' ONE IN FIVE of the world's tankers is below international safety standards, the inquiry into the implications of the Braer tanker disaster heard yesterday. The Chamber of Shipping, which represents UK owners and operators, giving evidence to the inquiry, blamed cut-throat pricing and accused governments of lacking the resources and the will to police ship safety properly. It said freight rates had fallen in real terms from a 1973 peak of Dollars 69.4 a tonne to less than Dollars 12 a tonne in 1991. The chamber said a 'significant number of owners' were willing to cut corners on safety because of inadequate inspection by flag and port states, while some charterers did not care about the state of vessels. Inspections by oil companies had shown that '20 per cent or more of the world's tankers do not meet existing internationally agreed standards. The operators of these ships need to be driven out of business or compelled to bring their operations up to current international standards'. Accident rates were increasing after declining between 1975 and 1989. Companies found it difficult to justify replacing old ships 'in the current economic climate' even though they needed higher maintenance. The chamber also warned of a coming shortage of officers. Captain James Irvine, from Shell, one of the chamber witnesses, accused ship safety regulators - including the Department of Transport - of 'lacking the resources and determination' to keep sub-standard vessels from ports in the UK and elsewhere. Asked by Lord Donaldson, the inquiry chairman, if one solution to the inspection problem might be to recruit former mariners to carry out safety checks, Capt Irvine said this would make 'an incalculable contribution to safety'. The chamber said better enforcement of regulations was needed before additional rules on routeing or ship design. But the chamber has said it favours greater use of high-tech navigational aids, including satellite positioning systems, and the fitting of ships with transponders to help ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications. The inquiry continues.</p>

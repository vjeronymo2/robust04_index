			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London cocoa prices at one stage dropped by up to Pounds 30 a tonne as New York continued to move lower, but traders were still struggling to find any fresh fundamental reason for the fall. 'At first I thought there had to be some origin selling but not at these prices. It really just looks like tired long liquidation,' one dealer said. By London's close, New York had also recovered from its lows. But should the downside move be resumed, next support was plotted at Pounds 610 for the December contract. 'It's not cocoa that is weighing on the market, but speculators. The problem is there's been no decent buying around. A lot of bulls are happy to see the market come down so they can buy on the dips," another dealer said. London's robusta COFFEE prices also dropped back after New York scored new life-of-contract lows, weighed down by the abundance of supply. Trading remained dull on the LME as the summer slowdown in physical interest and an absence of fresh news continued to restrict activity, dealers said. Prices closed mixed, although COPPER and ZINC slipped through the floors of their current trading ranges, while ALUMINIUM was near its downside support, they said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

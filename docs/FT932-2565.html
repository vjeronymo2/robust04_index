			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Reform vote may herald Japanese poll JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party was scrambling last night to muster the numbers to stave off defeat in a no-confidence vote, scheduled for today, that could force Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to call a snap election. The no-confidence motion was proposed yesterday by three opposition parties, which are confident that defections from the ruling party will swing the vote their way. The move came after the LDP in effect ended debate on changes to the scandal-prone political system, provoking anger among LDP reformers who wanted party leaders to negotiate a reform package with the opposition. The prospect of instability has cast a shadow over the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations, due to be held in Tokyo on July 7-9. If the LDP is defeated in today's vote, Mr Miyazawa's grip on power will be greatly weakened, and he may be forced to resign to take responsibility. Visiting leaders could find themselves caught in the middle of an election campaign, as a poll should be held within 40 days of a successful no-confidence motion. The government hoped the summit would be a showcase for the country's growing international role but, instead, the event could highlight the inadequacies of the LDP's leadership. The no-confidence vote will hinge on the actions of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the leader of a pro-reform faction in the LDP, who yesterday suggested that he was prepared to vote against his party. If the 35 Hata faction members do defect, the motion will be carried. The likelihood of continuing instability prompted business leaders to call on the LDP to reach a compromise with the opposition parties. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of international trade and industry, attributed the weakness of Tokyo stock prices in recent days to political conflict. LDP officials were hoping last night to convince reformers to stay with the party by offering to extend the present session of parliament, scheduled to end on Sunday, by another two weeks to continue the reform debate. But Mr Hata has indicated that he sees the no-confidence vote today as an important turning point in Japanese politics. If his faction does retreat from the commitment to reform, Mr Hata's personal credibility will be undermined and the LDP will be able to return to politics as usual. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today's session of the Crimean parliament adopted a  law restoring the Constitution of 6 May 1992, INTERFAX reports.  This Constitution envisions that the legal basis of relations  between Ukraine and Crimea will be a treaty. It also stipulates  that inhabitants of the peninsula are entitled to dual  citizenship.    As has already been reported, Ukraine's President Leonid  Kravchuk earlier warned that if the Crimean Supreme Soviet  restores the Constitution, he will immediately ask the Ukrainian  parliament to suspend the decision.</p>

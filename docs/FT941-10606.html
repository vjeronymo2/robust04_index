			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Blow to Clinton's healthcare reforms: CBO says plan would be drain on budget Congress's independent budget monitors dealt a severe blow yesterday to President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform plan with an analysis that sharply undercuts the administration's claims that its proposals will reduce the federal budget deficit within a few years. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan agency, said the Clinton plan would indeed cut health spending from its current path and would, from 2004 on, cut the budget deficit. But the CBO's analysis shows that for the next 10 years the plan would be a much heavier drain on the federal budget than the administration has calculated. 'For the six year period from 1995 through 2000, the administration's estimates indicate that the proposal would reduce the deficit by about Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn). In contrast, CBO estimates that the deficit would increase by more than Dollars 70bn over that period,' the study says. Mr Clinton's healthcare proposals have suffered a string of setbacks over the last week, with three big business groups denouncing his plan and opting for the slimmer version proposed by Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee. In a further reversal, CBO also concluded yesterday that the Clinton plan would 'establish both a federal entitlement to health benefits and a system of mandatory payments', and should therefore be reflected in the budget in the same way as the social security programme. Although largely symbolic, this conclusion provides ammunition to Republicans who contend the Clinton plan will create a vast government bureaucracy. Mr Clinton counterpunched yesterday with a speech to General Motors workers in Shreveport, Louisiana. 'Our plan does not put the government in control of health care. What it does is to reduce the control of the insurance companies and give more influence to workers and businesses,' Mr Clinton said. He also dismissed the significance of the CBO report. 'We'll fix that. . . That's a Washington policy wonk deal,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Robert Reischauer, CBO's director, said yesterday that he issued his organisation's study with 'considerable foreboding that the information contained might be used largely in destructive rather than constructive ways'. He emphasised that the differences between the CBO and White House estimates were a small fraction of health spending in the US, or even in comparison to the deficit. Mr Reischauer also said the Clinton reform would save the US Dollars 337bn on its total health bill over the next decade, reducing overall health spending by Dollars 150bn in 2004. But the analysis is a body blow to the administration, which had calculated that, even allowing a cushion of Dollars 41bn, its plan would cut the projected budget deficit by Dollars 59bn in 1995-2000. Mr Clinton had expected higher government costs, because his proposal subsidises small businesses and low-income individuals, and extends coverage of prescription drugs and long-term nursing under the government-run Medicare programme for the elderly. But he planned to offset this by savings on Medicare and Medicaid, and by higher tobacco tax.</p>

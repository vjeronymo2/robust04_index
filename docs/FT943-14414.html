			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Toyota cuts domestic sales target to 2.13m Toyota is unlikely to meet its target for car sales in the domestic market this year due to a sharp drop in sales between January and April, the company said. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Japan's largest carmaker, said the company was now forecasting domestic sales of 2.13m units rather than the 2.17m forecast earlier in the year. The figure was still 3 per cent up on last year when domestic sales totalled 2.07m vehicles. Exports, on the other hand, are expected to be higher than earlier forecast at 1.44m vehicles, while overseas production is likely to increase to 1.04m units - up from a forecast 1.02m units, the company said. Mr Toyoda also indicated that the company expected an average exchange rate of Y105 to the dollar for the fiscal year beginning this month. At that rate, the company should be able to increase pre-tax profits in fiscal 1994 to more than the Y200bn (USDollars 2bn) forecast for the year just ended from July 1993 to June 1994.</p>

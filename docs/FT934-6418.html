			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Gas monopolists with an eye on the regions: Industry views on the type of break-up the government should favour As the government approaches a decision whether to abolish British Gas's monopoly of household gas supplies, it has to consider what sort of market might be put in its place. In its report last August the Monopolies and Mergers Commission did not offer a blueprint for the new market except to say that its success would depend on the break-up of British Gas. The details could be left to Ofgas, the regulator. British Gas's potential competitors are now trying to promote their own ideas to the Department of Trade and Industry. There are two basic issues. One is whether the market should be thrown open to competition as a single entity, or chopped up into regions, as is the case in electricity and water. If various regions are formed it has to be decided whether they should be monopolies, at least initially, as is also the case in electricity and water, or whether they should be opened up to several competitors at once. A number of independent gas companies have teamed up to promote the idea of a single, competitive market. A leading member of this group is United Gas. Its chairman, Mr Peter Bryant, said: 'Chopping the country up into regions is nonsense. You don't license Tesco to serve just the Manchester area.' But other independents are calling for a regional approach. Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, which is part-owned by Elf, the French oil group, is sounding the alarm about the dangers of a 'free for all' in which the interests of domestic consumers could get trampled underfoot. Instead, he is proposing a series of regional franchises. Each would be the territory of a single company which would have the right to supply gas to consumers, but would also have to accept obligations to ensure that everybody who wanted gas got it. The issue is not just one of geography. Mr Marshall's concern is that a free-for-all would enable new entrants to go for the most desirable markets, and leave the rest either with British Gas or without gas at all. He believes the more vulnerable consumers might be disadvantaged by de-regulation. 'The government is in danger of creating unregulated monopolies which can cherry-pick their customers and dump costs on British Gas,' he told a conference earlier this month. 'This sort of free-market purism cannot be in the best interest of consumers at large.' Mr Bryant dismisses these fears. Under his group's plan, gas companies would have to be licensed as public gas suppliers. They could select their own territory, but would have to be approved by the regulator and they would be obliged to serve everybody in it. A variation of the regional franchise idea has been put forward by Mr Jonathan Stern, a consultant with Gas Strategies. He proposes breaking the country up into defined geographical areas - as many as 100 of them based on British Gas's districts. The regulator would award franchises to new suppliers in each area on the basis of competitive tender, taking into account their ability to meet a set of conditions. Franchises would be for five years, or long enough to underpin contracts with gas producers. Franchisees would be required to advertise their terms and accept any customer who came forward. Gas companies could apply for as many areas as they wanted, although the number of successful bidders in any single area might have to be limited. Mr Stern agrees there is a danger that nobody might bid for some areas, in which case British Gas would be left to supply them. But he says British Gas would be compensated for the cost of this by having its monopoly phased out rather than abruptly terminated. Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers Council, said yesterday that members would be opposed to regional franchises if they contained any suggestion of regional monopolies for any length of time. He said, however, that the council might accept some geographical system if it was a necessary step to a free market, provided that consumers were not denied choice.</p>

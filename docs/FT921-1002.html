			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Portugal sheds some light on a gloomy market PORTUGAL continues to be a bright spot amid the otherwise gloomy scenery of European bond markets, a fact underlined by the warm reception given to yesterday's Es10bn issue by the European Coal and Steel Community. The five-year deal saw strong demand from continental European investors, including Italian retail buyers who pay no withholding tax on bonds issued by supranational organisations of which Italy is a member, and institutions in Germany and Switzerland. The 11 1/8 per cent bonds were issued at 100.90 and traded down to par during the day, well inside full fees of 1 3/8 per cent. At this level the yield is 11.25 per cent. Syndicate officials said that demand for Escudo bonds remained buoyant, with investors attracted by high yields and the strength of the Portuguese currency, which been informally linked to the Ecu since last year. Primary market issuance remains limited to supranational institutions. Yesterday's deal was only the second this year. This has contributed to a steady decline in yields while other European markets have retreated over the past two weeks. The other deal this year, a Es16.9bn five-year issue by the World Bank in early February, was priced to yield 11.65 per cent. Even borrowing by approved supranational agencies is restricted by a government ruling that currency swaps can only be undertaken with Portuguese counter-parties, such as companies with matching foreign currency exposures. This limits the number of currency swap opportunities available. Yesterday's deal was swapped into floating-rate dollars for the issuer by Banco Portugues De Investimento, which also lead managed the transaction. The only approved borrower with a natural requirement for Escudo funds is the European Investment Bank, which makes loans denominated in the Portuguese currency. The EIB is likely to be the next borrower to tap the market and is expected to launch a Es15bn issue next month. Elsewhere in the international bond market, new issue activity remained light. Late in the day, the Council of Europe launched a CDollars 125m two-year issue, lead-managed by Morgan Stanley, aiming to attract investors switching funds out of money-market instruments. The 8 3/8 per cent bonds were reoffered to investors at a fixed price of 99.76. At this level the yield is around 1 per cent more than that available from Canadian dollar cash deposits, and 35 basis points more than two-year Canadian government bonds.</p>

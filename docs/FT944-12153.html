			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hershey shake-up cuts 400 jobs Hershey Foods, the biggest US confectionery maker, yesterday said it planned to carry out a restructuring over the next 12-15 months that would mean the loss of about 400 jobs and result in a charge of Dollars 97m-Dollars 105m to net profits in this year's fourth quarter. In last year's fourth quarter, Hershey made net profits of Dollars 92.2m. Mr Kenneth Wolfe, chairman and chief executive, said part of the reason for the restructuring was the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In response, Hershey was combining its confectionery operations in the US, Canada and Mexico into a consolidated unit to be called Hershey Chocolate North America. 'In doing so, we hope to capitalise on Hershey Chocolate USA's strengths to improve our competitive positions in the Canadian and Mexican markets and enhance our overall returns,' Mr Wolfe said. Like other manufacturers of branded goods, Hershey is facing a growing competitive threat from cheaper own-label products. Mr Wolfe said that another reason for the restructuring was to make sure that the company was making the most productive use of all its assets.</p>

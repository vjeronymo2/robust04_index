			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMAN UNITY COULD BE NEAR, U.S. ENVOY SAYS  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters declared Sunday that the current flight of  East Germans to the West indicates that East and West Germany might be united  in the near future.  </P> <P> It marked the first time that a senior allied diplomat has spoken of the  possibility of German reunification in the short term -- rather than in the  distant future.  </P> <P> And it underscored a new feeling among West German analysts that the exodus of  East Germans from the Communist state, and the illness of East German leader  Erich Honecker, might lead to dramatic changes in the East Berlin regime sooner  rather than later.  </P> <P> Interviewed in German by West German radio, Walters was asked whether he could  "foresee a united Germany in the near future," and the veteran American  diplomat answered: "Yes."  </P> <P> "It is not normal with two Germanies," added the 72-year-old Walters. "We must  live with realities. We have an embassy in East Germany. But I believe that  this stream of people coming out shows that Germans are concerned about the  division."  </P> <P> About 90,000 East Germans are expected to obtain legal visas to leave the  Communist state this year. Many of them are young and in their most productive  working years.  </P> <P> About 6,000 more have fled from East Germany by way of Hungary since May when  the Budapest regime began dismantling fences along its border with Austria.  </P> <P> Currently, several thousand East Germans are in Hungary awaiting a possible  deal between Bonn and Budapest that would allow them to emigrate to West  Germany via Austria.  </P> <P> Hungarian diplomats were in East Berlin last week reportedly seeking East  Germany's approval for Budapest to let the East Germans leave, in what is said  to be a one-of-a-kind deal.  </P> <P> While it has been the policy of the United States and its European allies to  support eventual German reunification, most Western officials have privately  been chary about seeing a massive, reunited Germany in the middle of Europe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 'German Question'  </P> <P> Thus, in the past the "German question" -- reunification -- has been kept on  the diplomatic back burner in order not to arouse hopes and passions on both  sides of the frontier.  </P> <P> Not long ago, senior officials such as Chancellor Helmut Kohl believed that  reunification was a distant goal, but now with the influx of East Germans, Kohl  and others have been urged to make contingency plans for rapid developments in  East Germany.  </P> <P> In his remarks Sunday, Walters said, "President Bush has said that we are for  such a development, if it were to be achieved peacefully and through free  elections by the population."  </P> <P> Walters, who took up his post here in April, said that Eastern Europe could be  helped by a new Marshall-type plan, with financial credits earmarked for  specific projects that would aid the economies of East Bloc nations.  </P> <P> The American diplomat made his remarks on the same day that East Germany opened  its semi-annual Trade Fair in Leipzig, where the top West German official based  in East Berlin, Franz Bertele, declared bluntly of the massive exodus: "The  problems started in the DDR (East Germany), and they must be solved here too."  </P> <P> The East German regime, which has resisted Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's call for reform and liberalization, seems at a loss to devise a  workable policy to keep its young citizens from fleeing to the West.  </P> <P> Honecker, at 77, is recuperating from a mysterious operation on his gall  bladder, and the East German leader did not make a scheduled appearance in  Leipzig.  </P> <P> Instead, he was represented by Prime Minister Willi Stoph, 75, who replied to  Bertele's remarks by declaring that East and West Germany must "proceed by  mutually respecting sovereignty and without interfering in internal affairs."  </P> <P> The Leipzig fair is the showcase for East German products and a major source of  foreign exchange from the business deals that are signed there.  </P> <P> Currently, 116 East Germans have sought refuge in the West German mission  compound in East Berlin, hoping to get accelerated permission to emigrate.  </P> <P> Others are in the West German embassies in Budapest and Prague waiting for the  chance to head to West Germany.  </P> <P> Today, many of the East Germans vacationing in Hungary and other Eastern  European countries are due back at work and school. Some authorities in  Budapest believe there will be a rush for the Austrian border if word comes  that the frontier will be opened this week.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Niamey, 26 Jun (AFP) -- Niger President Mahamane  Ousmane announced in Niamey today that Niger is prepared to send  troops to participate in the French military and humanitarian  operation launched on 23 June in Rwanda if France makes the  request.    At a news conference, President Mahamane Ousmane stated that  they were prepared to send "a contingent or any other form of  contribution depending on the exact request that will be made to  us."    He added: "The French initiative deserves to be supported.  We have given it our moral and political support. At this  stage, no other request has been made to us."    President Mahamane Ousmane made the statement at the  departure ceremony for Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore, who  left Niamey this morning at the end of a 24-hour visit.    When interviewed on his position on the French operation,  President Compaore expressed his "support" for the operation but  explained that Burkina Faso did "not have the means" to  contribute materially. He said France was "forced" to make this  decision due to the "resignation of the international  community," including Africa.    He added: "What are Africans doing? People are killing each  other, but Africans are doing nothing to intervene. That was  why France was forced to make that decision."    He further stated: "Whether the solution comes from Africans  or from others, we think that if anything can be done to save  people now, it should be done."</p>

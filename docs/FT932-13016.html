			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Damaged buildings may be destroyed AT LEAST one office building and a parade of shops will need to be demolished in the wake of Saturday's blast, construction experts said yesterday. St Ethelburga's, one of London's oldest churches, was also destroyed in the blast. Two other offices, the headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and a building belonging to the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, were also severely damaged. A decision on their future will not be taken until a full structural assessment can be made. The initial reaction of experts was that more windows had been destroyed than in the explosion which last year badly damaged London's Baltic Exchange, but that structural damage was less. The streets around Bishopsgate are broader than those around the Baltic Exchange, which allowed the effects of the blast to spread. Among the first engineers to be called out was the dangerous structures team run by Costain, the UK contractor. The unit is under contract to a consortium of 12 London boroughs and has been present at virtually every disaster in the capital during the past 20 years - including the Baltic Exchange bomb, the Brixton riots and the Iranian embassy siege in 1981. Its first job yesterday was to ensure that damaged buildings were made safe for repair work to start and allow for emergency services to conduct more detailed searches for clues. Mr John Milcock, the team's foreman, said: 'It could be several weeks before the full extent and cost of the damage is known. 'First impressions are that three or four buildings may have suffered structural damage. In addition there are vast quantities of broken glass. 'The church has been wiped out and the offices next to it (Kansallis House, occupied by the Finnish bank Kansallis-Osake Pankki) are severely damaged. The Hongkong and Shanghai bank appears to have some of its pillars damaged. Almost all of its windows have been destroyed.' Mr Peter Bennett, deputy city surveyor for the City of London said: 'Most of the damage to Hongkong and Shanghai bank was blast damage rather than structural. All the internal walls have been blown through.' Mr Bennett added that Kansallis House would have to be demolished as it was in a dangerous state. The blast had shattered the concrete frame and blown away some of the reinforcing. The National Bank of Abu Dhabi at 90 Bishopgate, next door to Kansallis House, was also severely damaged and might have to be pulled down, Mr Bennett said. He said that a parade of Victorian shops on the corner of Wormwood Street and Bishopsgate would also have to be demolished.</p>

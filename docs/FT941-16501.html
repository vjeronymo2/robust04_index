			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: A promising start to 1994 - Architecture The new year has started very merrily with the amusing attack on Brian Sewell, art critic of London's Evening Standard. Apparently some of his articles have caused such offence that several self-important, self-styled 'members of the art world' (presumably they inhabit a different earth from the rest of us) wrote a letter which, in effect, asked for him to be silenced. I can only suppose that some of the 35 signatories had nothing better to do in the post-Christmas limbo. They accused him of being both homophobic and misogynist (I'm not quite sure where that leaves him . . . ), ignorant and hostile when it comes to their kind of contemporary art. On top of all that they accused the poor critic of, 'sexual and class hypocrisy. They were just kind enough to say that he was 'very occasionally . . . sometimes perceptive'. The fun continued when none other than the Secretary of State for Education, John Patten, wrote a letter supporting Mr Sewell. He made a very good point about the 'art world' which applies to certain aspects of the professional architectural mafia as well: that 'cultural life is only for the self-styled cultured, a narrow group alternately puffing and then gently 'criticising in context' each others work'. Mr Patten went on to say that the letter from the 35 worthies 'marks the barrenness and imploding nature of so much British intellectual and artistic life, with a few notable exceptions'. Critics must have views and express them with knowledge in a way that provokes debate and interest. I think Mr Sewell is right about the fashionable shibboleths that dog the visual arts in this country. He is right to puncture the cloud of putrid political correctness that has replaced reason and thought in much of the 'art world'. He is also right to cry out for quality and integrity in art. He is criticised for this elitism by a group who are so elitist as to be, culturally speaking, almost incestuous. This fruity and encouraging debate about criticism in the visual arts is a promising start to 1994. Also, at last, there is a new chairman of the Arts Council - Lord Gowrie, who is seriously knowledgeable about the arts, who will undoubtedly be able to clear up the mess left by his predecessor. He also loves architecture in an intelligent and thoughtful way - he is a bridge builder who, I trust, will not underestimate the public as the Arts Council and its minions has for so long. Furthermore, I am happy to declare an interest in a new architectural magazine that will be launched on March 15 in London called Perspectives, with the object of encouraging the kind of informed architectural debate that was started by many of the speeches of the Prince of Wales. He was able, as no architect, critic or member of the 'art world' has been able, to encourage widespread debate about contemporary architecture. The new magazine, which will make architecture a live subject, has the support of the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture. There are also some very encouraging new buildings to write about in 1994. Richard MacCormac's new student rooms for St John's College, Oxford, also has generous commissions for works of art as part of the whole project. This is one of the buildings that will be interpreted at length in Perspectives and on these pages. On May 28 the new Glyndebourne Opera House by Michael Hopkins will open. At about the same time, Eurostar trains should be running into the new Channel Tunnel rail terminal at Waterloo. This is a dramatic, beautiful place designed by Nicholas Grimshaw. I was lucky enough to have a preview the other day and it is remarkable - just as good as any of the grands projets that architects are always complaining we never build in this country. I noticed that Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, was too politic to sign the letter attacking Mr Sewell. I imagine he is much too worried about the decision his trustees are apparently about to make to offer to convert Bankside Power Station into a Museum of Modern Art. We have such good architects in Britain at the moment that a new building is surely the best answer. The conversion of the Gare d'Orsay into a major museum in Paris was only a partial success. The decision to appoint an old hand at architectural politics, Gordon Graham, to run a competition for the future of London's South Bank suggests that plans for the new Museum of Modern Art should be held over until the Hayward Gallery is demolished and plans are ready for an art venue of international standard, which London badly needs. I relish the thought of the opening of the Channel Tunnel making trips to Europe easier. I wish there was a tunnel to link the UK to the countries of the formerly communist eastern Europe. The future of cities such as like Prague and St Petersburg depends on the spread of the work of enlightened architects, or they risk repeating all our commercial and architectural mistakes.</p>

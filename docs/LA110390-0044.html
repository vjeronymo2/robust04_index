			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE VANISHING SINGLE SCREEN;  </P> <P> LANDMARKS: THE OWNERS OF A 50-YEAR-OLD STUDIO CITY MOVIE HOUSE THAT WILL CLOSE  IN FEBRUARY REPORTEDLY HAVE NO INTEREST IN RAZING THE BUILDING, WHICH MAY  BECOME A BOOKSTORE.  </P> <P> Mann's Studio Theatre in Studio City, one of only two operating single-screen  theaters in the San Fernando Valley, will go dark in February, a victim of the  burgeoning trend toward multi-screen complexes.  </P> <P> But the 50-year-old landmark may be saved from the wrecking ball and restored  to its original grandeur. The landlord, a family that has owned the Ventura  Boulevard property for generations, reportedly has no interest in redeveloping  the site and hopes to sign a lease with a Texas-based book chain that has  turned other old theaters into stores.  </P> <P> "They actually have some sentimental attachment to this building," said Bruce  Bailey, a real estate broker representing owner Ray Rothman and his family.  </P> <P> "They, like a lot of citizens, are against some of the types of developments  that have gone on and believe that residents should have some say in what goes  up in the community."  </P> <P> Bailey said the family had originally hoped another motion-picture chain would  replace Mann Theatres, expected to leave the site in February.  </P> <P> He said Mann decided against renewing the theater's long-term lease because  single screens are no longer profitable and the 65-foot-wide movie house was  found to be too narrow for multiple screens, among other factors.  </P> <P> The prospective tenant -- the Austin-based Bookstop Inc. -- approached the  family after a number of other movie chains were dissuaded from operating there  for similar reasons, Bailey said. Bookstop, which opened a store last February  in San Diego's Loma Theater, is a division of Barnes &amp; Noble that operates  under the name Bookstar Inc. in California.  </P> <P> The Studio Theatre opened in the late 1930s in the streamlined Moderne style of  its time -- but rather plain in design compared with its more elaborate Art  Deco sisters, according to theater historian Preston Kaufmann of Pasadena, who  described the movie house as a "pleasant neighborhood theater" if  architecturally unremarkable.  </P> <P> Kaufmann cited the Highland Theater, the Fairfax Theater and the Pacific  Hollywood Theater as examples of single-screen movie houses converted to three  screens since the 1970s. There were about 230 single-screen theaters in the Los  Angeles area in 1950, according to the Film Daily Yearbook of Motion Pictures.  Kaufmann estimated that there are fewer than 50 today.  </P> <P> Bailey and Jill Doland, managing director of the Los Angeles Historic Theatre  Foundation, said the Studio Theatre was the last single-screen theater in the  Valley. However, Kaufmann, a foundation member, noted that the Fox Theater on  Van Nuys Boulevard also remains in operation with a single screen.  </P> <P> Studio City neighbors said they are sorry to see the old movie house go, but  praised the landlords for trying to preserve the building and for shunning the  retail-office centers that have replaced one traditional shop after another  along Ventura Boulevard. Representatives for the owner and the bookstore met  with the Studio City Residents Assn. last month to discuss their plans.  </P> <P> "There's no way to turn that theater into a bunch of theaters economically so  the Rothmans are looking for a viable lease, and I'm really pleased they didn't  just say, 'We'll tear the whole half-block out and do a retail center or  something,' " said Polly Ward, the association's president.  </P> <P> Another Ventura Boulevard movie house, the single-screen La Reina Theater in  Sherman Oaks, was turned into a small mall three years ago. The shopping center  has been plagued by store vacancies and temporarily lost its occupancy permit  last spring after the developer repeatedly failed to complete the street  improvements promised to the city. A temporary occupancy permit has since been  renewed.  </P> <P> "One thing we hope is that they don't make it like the La Reina, because that  was just a disaster," said Lenore Leon, a real estate broker who works on the  same block as the Studio Theatre and has lived in the neighborhood more than 30  years.  </P> <P> Ward and others expressed some concern that the site may eventually be  redeveloped into either a multiplex cinema or shopping center. The Rothmans own  approximately 3.5 acres of increasingly valuable property, from the theater  itself west to Vantage Avenue, according to Bailey.  </P> <P> But Bailey said that competition from multi-screen movie theaters in nearby  Universal City, coupled with the limited parking that would be available under  the proposed Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, left the prospect of a large  redevelopment project unlikely.  </P> <P> He also said that the landlords have no secret agenda.  </P> <P> "I've known the Rothmans for approximately 10 years now and I can tell you  they've had unbelievable offers on their property from developers and I'm  absolutely convinced they will never sell those properties," Bailey said.  </P> <P> "I'm also convinced they won't change the property unless it is falling down.  They are against mini-malls. They like the look of Studio City. They've had  tenants ask if they could clear a portion and they won't do it."  </P> <P> Thomas Christopher, president and chief executive officer of Bookstop, said  details remain to be worked out before a lease is signed. He confirmed that his  company wants to open a discount bookstore in the theater that would include  120,000 volumes and a newsstand of 3,000 titles.  </P></p>

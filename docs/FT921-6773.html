			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Increased share of premiums for life salesmen POLICY HOLDERS paid a larger slice of their life assurance premiums to salesmen last year, according to Lautro, the UK insurance industry's self-regulatory body. In a study released yesterday Lautro found that commissions paid to tied agents, including banks and building societies which sell the products of one company only, have risen much more than those paid to independent financial advisers. In the 18 months since Lautro's last survey, average commissions to tied agents have risen as a proportion of premiums by 3-6 percentage points, depending on the product. Those paid to independent advisers have risen an average of 1-2 percentage points. More than 90 per cent of firms surveyed said they were also prepared to make loans to tied agents, typically equal to half the expected commissions paid in a single year. Twelve per cent make additional cash gifts to tied agents beyond commission payments. Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of Royal London Mutual Life and head of the Association of British Insurers' life council, said the rise in commissions reflected 'market conditions'. 'Companies want to secure distribution,' he said, explaining that building societies, with ready access to potential customers, have been able to command particularly high commission payments. The Lautro data mean that someone buying a conventional 25-year mortgage-linked endowment policy, paying monthly premiums of Pounds 50, yields an average commission of Pounds 570 to a tied agent, up from Pounds 534 in the last survey. Typically commissions are paid at the outset, although salesmen may have to fund a portion of them if the policy is terminated soon afterwards. Thus, a sales agent selling two policies a week, with a fortnight's holiday a year, could have an annual pre-tax income of up to Pounds 64,152. Independent advisers averaged Pounds 498 in commission for selling a similar policy. A survey last year by the Securities and Investments Board found that up to 44 per cent of insurance and pensions policies sold by tied agents were terminated within the first two years. Regulators believe that high termination rates are linked to mis-selling - the practice of urging consumers to purchase inappropriate policies. Since industry-wide ceilings on commissions were scrapped at the insistence of the Office of Fair Trading at the end of December 1989, those earned by tied agents have risen above the old limits by an average of 47 per cent for 10-year endowment policies and 44 per cent for 25-year policies. For 10-year pensions the average increase is 44 per cent, and for 25-year policies the figure is 40 per cent. The Consumers' Association, said: 'These figures are phenomenally depressing, but they are not surprising.' Unit trust charges, Page 6</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SOCCER TEAM, AFTER TWO LOSSES IN EUROPE, PLAYS ICELAND  </P> <P> The United States soccer team, after a brief and not quite happy trip to  Eastern Europe, will have a chance to meet a team more to its level when it  plays Iceland today.  </P> <P> The U.S. team's 0-2 swing through Hungary and East Germany left it wiser and  determined to improve on its 3-5 record compiled since qualifying for the World  Cup for the first time in 40 years.  </P> <P> The good news for this young team is that despite a 2-0 loss to Hungary and a  3-2 loss to East Germany last month, it is progressing. The team is still  learning to react to different styles, and Coach Bob Gansler has been juggling  his lineup to find the right combinations.  </P> <P> With the World Cup only two months away, there are few spots on the team that  are locked up. Perhaps the most interesting battle is at goalkeeper, where Tony  Meola and Kasey Keller have been battling. Meola played both games in Europe so  Keller is likely to start against Iceland.  </P> <P> Iceland has a lot to gain by beating the United States. Iceland did not qualify  for the WorldCup, despite tying two teams that did -- the Soviet Union and  Austria. Iceland finished 1-3-4 in its group.  </P> <P> Iceland is providing a new look on this tour. It has a new coach in Bob  Johansson, who has been in that position only a month. At least five of  Iceland's best players are not with the team because they are fulfilling  obligations to European professional teams.  </P> <P> The team playing here will be young and inexperienced and not familiar to  playing together. But Iceland is still favored to win the game. JULIE CART  </P></p>

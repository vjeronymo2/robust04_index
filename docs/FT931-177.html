			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Diverting unemployment from coal industry to oil and gas Sir, For someone who works in oil and gas exploration and production, the difference in treatment given to this industry (a long-term cash cow for the national exchequer) and the coal industry (a long-term drain on the national exchequer) is of continuing concern. Currently, for example, public opinion appears to favour spending taxpayers' money to divert unemployment from the coal industry into the oil and gas industry. This is well illustrated in your story 'Heseltine fails to calm Tory fears on pits' (March 29), where further hand-outs to the coal industry are said to provide 'dramatic opportunities', whereas lower taxes paid by the North Sea oil industry ('Spoils of the North Sea', March 29) are described as 'subsidising sub-optimal investment'. The oil industry would like to know how its 'sub-optimal investments' may be converted into 'dramatic opportunities'.

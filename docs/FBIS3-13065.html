Hashemi who was addressing a reception at the embassy of  Sudan said since the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1979,  Iran has been a friendly country to all African states, and  supports the struggle of African peoples against racial  discrimination.    He said the Africans have added a golden leaf to the history  of the struggles of world nations, and today certain sources  that claim to be concerned about the status of human rights  accuse certain African states of human rights violations while  they continue to plunder the resources of the very same African  countries.    He said the Islamic Republic looks forward to broader  cooperation with the African nations in the area of politics,  economy and culture.</p>

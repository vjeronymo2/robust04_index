			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Geevor blames CIBC for its 'traumatic year' IN AN emotional statement accompanying the news that Geevor, the UK mining company with an 85-year history, suffered a net loss of Pounds 16.4m in the year to March 1991, Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, chairman, said the 'traumatic year' resulted from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce withdrawing Geevor's banking facilities in controversial circumstances. He said CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, claimed in its advertising in the mining press 'to have shared in the dreams of many entrepreneurs, large and small. I would suggest that in Geevor's case they turned the dreams of our shareholders into nightmares.' Some of Geevor's institutional shareholders took up Pounds 1.25m of convertible loan notes after CIBC's move, partly so that Geevor could pursue the bank in the courts. Mr Wellesley-Wood reported that Geevor now had a number of claims outstanding against its former bankers. He said that only the support of the institutions enabled Geevor to continue trading and that the company's new advisers, Smith New Court Finance, 'went further than the normal call of duty in assisting me in protecting (shareholders') interests in difficult circumstances.' Negotiations for a reverse takeover of Geevor by a private UK company with North American coal assets - which Mr Wellesley-Wood refused to name - have dragged on much longer than anticipated but 'the board remains hopeful of a successful outcome.' Geevor has closed down or disposed of most of its operations, including its tin mine in Cornwall, and reduced staff and board numbers to a minimum. The pre-tax loss for the year was Pounds 12.87m compared with Pounds 1.43m. Extraordinary items accounted for Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 4.06m) and the net loss of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 5.4m) equates to 48.5p a share (6.52p). Geevor's auditors have qualified the 1991 accounts, saying they were not able to form an opinion as to whether they showed a true and fair view.</p>

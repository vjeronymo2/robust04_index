			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Barclays board loses confidence of some institutions A NUMBER of Barclays Bank's big institutional shareholders said yesterday they planned to tell the board that they were losing confidence in its top management. Institutional shareholders contacted by the Financial Times, which hold roughly 15 per cent of the bank's shares, expressed varying degrees of discontent following the news of Barclays' Pounds 242m pre-tax loss and the halving of its final dividend. Their comments ranged from the view that Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman and chief executive, should resign, to a desire for board changes. Mr Buxton said after Thursday's announcement of the loss that investors had expressed their support for the bank's directors, and their business strategy. A number of institutions said they would urge the board to appoint a new chief executive from outside Barclays - a move they believed it would resist. The bank has said it will take steps to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. Barclays' share price rose yesterday after a near 10 per cent fall on Thursday. Most securities analysts are forecasting a recovery in Barclays' fortunes. Despite doubts about the bank's management, some institutional shareholders said profits were likely to improve following a pick-up in the economy, declining interest rates and greater internal lending controls. Several said they had bought more Barclays shares as prices fell after the earnings announcement. Others, accounting for about 6 per cent of the bank's shares, said they intended to tell management not only that Mr Buxton should cease to hold one of his two posts but also that he should leave the board entirely. 'I think it is in the interests of shareholders to get a new chairman and a new chief executive. One of the problems with Barclays is that it has had a power vacuum at the top,' said one shareholder. The board's appointment of Mr Buxton as both chairman and chief executive this January despite reservations among some shareholders was criticised. Shareholders also pointed to the concentration of losses in the construction and property sectors as evidence that the bank had not exercised prudent judgment in allowing itself to become highly exposed to a single sector of the economy. They said they would seek details of the steps taken to tighten up the bank's risk management. London stocks, Page 15 Bottom Line, Weekend II</p>

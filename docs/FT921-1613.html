			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (9): The threat of green protectionism THE GREENING OF WORLD TRADE ISSUES edited by Kym Anderson and Richard Blackhurst Harvester Wheatsheaf Pounds 40/Pounds 13.99, 275 pages EVEN BEFORE the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations draws to a close, new issues are piling up on the agenda of the General Agreement on Tariffs and trade. Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior European Commissioner, recently confirmed what many trade experts have accepted for some time - that competition policy will feature large in trade negotiations of the future. This book deals with the other, and possibly more urgent issue of the 1990s: the link between trade and environment policy. It is not difficult to see why the two are related. The bottom line for trade policy is, after all, the location of jobs. The ultimate reason why Italy has fought to keep Japanese cars out of its home market is to preserve employment at Fiat. Environmental controls may, however, distort the international competitive conditions in which particular industries operate. As a result, jobs may be lost and growth opportunities jeopardised. There are already several examples of how environmental policy can clash with the free trade principles espoused by the Gatt. The US embargo on Mexican tuna which was imposed to protect the dolphin is one such case. European aluminium makers are complaining about the way in which Russian producers, who do not face strict pollution controls, are flooding the West with cheap products. Conservationist lobby groups in the rich developed world have succeeded in curbing trade in African ivory. The Greening of World Trade Issues explores the link between trade policy and the environment from a number of perspectives. How far are 'solutions' to environmental problems likely to provoke trade friction? How far is there a conflict, as some US environmentalists claim, between the ideals of free trade and environmental protection? Will it be necessary to use trade incentives to persuade countries such as Brazil to protect the rain forest? And, if so, will this also conflict with the ideal of non-discriminatory free trade. While recognising the legitimacy of environmentalist aims, the book argues that the impact of certain policies on the trading environment could be enormous. Severe restrictions on the use of coal, for example, would be a threat to the China's development prospects. Since some compromises will have to be made, it is all the more imperative that the right policy approach is chosen. Some environmentalists argue that trade liberalisation is a priori harmful because it increases consumption, but this need not be the case. Liberalisation of world farm trade could help by reducing the use of pesticides in over-farmed industrial countries. The book takes the form of a carefully structured series of essays originally written as background papers for the recent Gatt report on International Trade 1990-1. It should be noted that this is a book written by economists for economists. A large part of it is taken up with the development of models showing the impact of various environmental policies on the trading system and vice versa. The underlying message is, however, clear. There is a real fear of an unholy alliance between environmentalist and protectionist lobbies which could be seriously counter-productive. Indeed, as the book concludes: 'It is even possible that protectionist groups would manipulate the design or implementation of environmental measures to such a degree that the net effect would be an increase in environmental degradation.' Trade policy-makers must therefore alert themselves to the implications of the environment debate. In particular, a clear idea is needed as to what set of policies would best meet both the objectives of free trade and environmental protection. There is a clear preference in the book for a market orientated approach, even possibly involving the freedom to auction 'pollution permits.' There is a difficulty with this kind of approach in that a windfall benefit would accrue to firms which sold their permits. Similarly, the idea of a worldwide tax on polluters raises questions about how the proceeds should be distributed. However, many other controls favoured by environmentalists, such as production restraints or process and product standards, lend themselves more readily to abuse by protectionists. While the argument over policy rages, the risk is that all sorts of protectionist measures will be introduced in the name of the environment. The academics will have to refine their argument quickly and ensure they get a proper public airing, if the baby is not to be lost with the bathwater. This book, and the recent Gatt report, constitute an admirable effort, though they are only a start.</p>

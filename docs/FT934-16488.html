			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television The idea of a documentary about traffic jams is hardly more appealing than a programme about having teeth descaled at the hygienist. However, tonight's Inside Story: Traffic Jam (BBC 1, 9.30), holds out the lure of providing answers to the questions that circle mantra-like in the numbed mind of the impotent driver. Why do roadworks take so long? Why is there never anyone working in the closed lane? As every admirer of Anthony Trollope knows, John Major, the prime minister, is a character who could step straight out of a Trollope novel. On Bookmark: The Trollopians (BBC 2, 8.00), the prime minister has more to say about his affection for the novelist. ScreenPlay: The Vision Thing (BBC 2, 9.25) is an entertaining satire on a premier in touch with the Almighty. Years ago I was told that chips are full of vitamin C so it has always been a surprise to hear people inveighing against children eating chips. Perhaps Eat Up (C4, 8.30), the new series on the eating habits of the modern child, will explain the position.</p>

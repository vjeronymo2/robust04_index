			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Maxwell pension plea rejected Action brought by the Maxwell pensioners to claim up to Pounds 235m from the administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation was dismissed yesterday by the Court of Appeal. Three judges rejected the argument of the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former manager of the Maxwell pension funds, that it had a prior claim to the first Pounds 235m of the money raised from the sale of MCC assets. Price Waterhouse, the administrators of the largest quoted company run by Robert Maxwell, have so far raised about Pounds 680m from such sales. BIM had argued that it had a prior claim over pension money wrongly paid to MCC and should be paid before unsecured creditors. The court awarded costs against BIM and refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. Lawyers for the former pension managers said later that they intended to apply to the Lords for a further hearing.</p>

The center will aim to put new life into the city's auto  industry, and thus promote related industries.    In the government plan, by the year 2000 auto manufacturing  will become one of the city's pillar industries, with an output  of ten billion yuan, accounting for ten percent of Shenzhen's  total industrial output that year.    In its preliminary efforts, the city government will invest  150 million yuan (about 17.2 million U.S. dollars) in the  construction of the center.</p>

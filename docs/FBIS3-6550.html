			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement issued by a spokesman for the DPRK Atomic </F> Energy General Bureau in Pyongyang on 18 March -- first  paragraph is introduction]    [Text] In connection with the fact that the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat has unjustifiably  assessed [pudanghage pyongga] the results of its inspections of  our nuclear facilities [haeksisol], a spokesman for the DPRK  Atomic Energy General Bureau has released the following press  statement [tamhwa]:    Press statement by a spokesman for the DPRK Atomic Energy  General Bureau    According to the 25 February letter of agreement at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, we received inspections from the  IAEA for ensuring the continuity of safeguards on 1-15 March.    The recent inspections were designed to purely ensure the  continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksongul  pojanghanunde] in conformity with the special status [tuksuhan  chiwi] in which our country had temporarily suspended the  effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.    In the negotiations in Vienna with us on 15 February, the  agency's Secretariat admitted that the inspections were for  ensuring the continuity of safeguards and agreed on the scope of  such inspections.    Therefore, throughout the period after we received the  inspection team, out of a desire to sincerely implement the  DPRK-U.S. agreement and the agreement between us and the IAEA,  we allowed all activities necessary to ensure the continuity of  safeguards and positively cooperated with the inspection team's  work. As a result, the agency's inspection team was able to  satisfactory carry out all activities pointed out in the 15  February Vienna agreement, including replacing and maintaining  [chongbi] sealing and surveillance devices [pongswae mit  kamsisudan], examining inventories [chaegoryang], examining  [komto] various documents, verifying design information [solgye  tongbo], and obtaining and measuring samples [siryo chaechwi mit  chukchong].    Nevertheless, during the period of the recent inspections,  the agency's Secretariat and the inspection team unilaterally  insisted that the inspections were not inspections for ensuring  the continuity of safeguards but inspections under the  safeguards accord. And, quite contrary to the 15 February  Vienna agreement, they put forth an uncourteous request for  inspections almost tantamount to regular and irregular  inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi].    Not keeping with the Vienna agreement, the IAEA Secretariat  gave directions [chiryong] to the inspection team, and taking  the inspection team's incorrect report [kuruttoen pogo] as an  established fact, it insisted on unfair demands, including the  issues of extracting samples from places where seals, which are  locking devices, remained untouched; gamma measuring of all  parts, not selected spots; and checking of the cooling system,  which was not even mentioned in the Vienna negotiations.    The IAEA Secretariat continued to intimidate us by sending  three telex messages saying if its demands were not fulfilled,  it would report to the Board of Governors that it could not  confirm nuclear materials were not used for other purposes.    On the other hand, when the members of the inspection team  in  our country could not make any more objections to the  administrators' logical explanation regarding the extraction of  samples from places where seals were maintained, they made an  excuse that they had no choice but to carry out the task  [extracting samples] because it was assigned by the IAEA  Secretariat. Even after personally confirming that the seals  they put themselves in August 1993 remained untouched, they made  an absurd assertion that they could not trust the seals because  they were over a year old.    The IAEA Secretariat's unfair demands, including the sample  extraction from the inlet measurement tank [ipku kyeryang tank]  locked by IAEA's seals, have nothing to do with the objective  and nature of the inspection--which was to check that no nuclear  activities had been carried out--but are a grave violation  [omjunghan wiban] of the agreement reached in Vienna on 15  February.    We have even shown a good intention by flexibly carrying  out the IAEA's unreasonable [murihan] demands, including the  issues of extracting samples from some places where sealing  devices are installed and measuring gamma from all necessary  places. Since it is so, the recent nuclear inspection  activities carried out by a IAEA inspection team are sufficient  to confirm that nuclear materials from our nuclear facilities  are not used for other purposes and to firmly ensure the  continuity of safeguards.    In fact, these facilities were blocked doubly and triply as  the gate of the radiochemical laboratory and major processes  [kongjong] were frozen [tonggyol] with numerous seals,  surveillance cameras, and marks of the IAEA.    Nonetheless, the IAEA Secretariat, even before analyzing the  results of the inspections, made an unjust assessment that it  cannot guarantee that nuclear materials were not used for other  purpose at these facilities because some inspection activities  were restricted at the radiochemical laboratory, even though  many inspection activities were carried out in accordance with  the Vienna agreement. In connection with this, the IAEA is  causing a stir that it will convene a meeting of the IAEA Board  of Governors.    This is an utterly unjust act of openly turning over the  agreement reached with the United States and with the IAEA on  ensuring the continuity of safeguards, and can never be  justified under any circumstances.    All these facts prove that the IAEA Secretariat attempts to  widen the scope of unjustness and, under the U.S. manipulation,  invariably pursues sinister political aims to crush [apsal] us.    If the IAEA Secretariat truly hopes for a fair solution of  our nuclear problem, it should withdraw its unjust hasty  assessment on the results of the recent inspections    We will watch the attitude the IAEA Secretariat will assume  at the upcoming Board of Governors meeting. Based on this, we  will judge whether it intends to resolve our nuclear issue  fairly or attempts to use this for political aims.    If the IAEA Secretariat again tries to agitate the unjust  pressure commotions against us by finding faults with us, we  will have no choice but to respond to this with a resolute  measure [manil kukchewonjaryokkiku sogigugi urirul  kolgodulmyonso ttodasi uriege pudanghan amnyoksodongul polliryo  sidohandamyon urinun tanhohan chochiro kue  taeunghajianulsuopkedwoelgosida].

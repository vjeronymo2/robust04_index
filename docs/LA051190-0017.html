			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BIG BANG' A WITTY, VENAL LOOK AT FILMMAKING  </P> <P> As the genial documentary "The Big Bang" opens, its director is wooing a money  man across a dinner table with that patented combination of cool and fervor  that constitutes the perfect pitch. The filmmaker may be a little fuzzy about  his project, but it came to him at the Shangri La Hotel when he realized he  knew how it all started.  </P> <P> "How what started?" the backer asks, carefully.  </P> <P> "The cosmos," the director expands, "with the orgasmic explosion of God."  </P> <P> And that's what he wants the backer to put up money for a film with no stars,  no script, no sets, just a buncha people talking about the Big Question. And  besides God and orgasms, they'll touch on creation and disintegration, life,  love, sex, crime, madness, death, everything.  </P> <P> Of course, this opening is all a bit disingenuous. The money is already, as  they say, on the screen. Prospective backer Joseph Kanter, whose last time out  was as a co-executive producer of "Ironweed," is "The Big Bang's" producer; the  ebullient James Toback ("Fingers," "Love and Money") is its director, and the  film is already underway. And for a movie whose staple element is conversation  and revelation -- blurted or weighed for effect -- it's a surprisingly  interesting way to spend an evening.  </P> <P> Although the guests never do solve the Big One, "The Big Bang" (at the AMC  Century 14 and Beverly Center Cineplex) has wit and unfolding moments of  poignancy, unexpected depths and a flash or two of pure venality -- just enough  to keep the eyes open wide and the jaw a little dropped.  </P> <P> Toback blandly describes his guests by their professions. In outline, it sounds  like the cast of an epic disaster movie: a model, a philosopher/nun, a writer,  a medical student, a gangster, two children, an astronomer, a painter, a  "survivor." A few people may spot New York restauranteuse Elaine Kaufman of  Elaine's, NBA notable Darryl Dawkins, violinist Eugene Fodor, New Yorker  magazine humorist Veronica Geng, jazz saxophonist Julius Hemphill, former light  heavyweight boxing champ Jose Torres and producer Don Simpson.  </P> <P> You can find tragedy, irony, banality, self-importance. There are lives pulled  back from suicide by a sheer act of will, stories that have the patina of many  repetitions and some that seem to come out spontaneously, even in this  hot-house environment. There may even be a surprise or two, like filmmaker  Simpson's account of his hellfire and damnation Southern Baptist upbringing in  Alaska, and of a life lived in retaliation for it. ("Love is not something that  I understand. . . .")  </P> <P> As frequently happens, intrinsic natures come across absolutely. Some are  self-effacing and all the more interesting for it: Anne Marie Keyes, a  philosopher who is a member of the order of Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary  and was this year one of the international team of observers at the elections  in Nicaragua; novelist Barbara Traub, an Auschwitz survivor, is marked by a  remarkable clarity and lack of self pity; Elaine Kaufman is a nice, brisk whiff  of New York smelling salts.  </P> <P> Sometimes-actor (for Toback) Tony Sirico is defined by the movie as a  "gangster"; is that what gangsters call themselves? Aren't they all  entrepreneurs? Or venture capitalists? A few, like Darryl Dawkins, come on  strong -- "I'm 6-foot-11 inches of steel and sex appeal and I try to live up to  that" -- then develop unexpected vulnerability. And some, pick your candidate,  just sail off like hot-air balloons.  </P> <P> While the deliberately crisscross editing of Stephanie Kempf keeps the R-rated  film moving briskly and probably glosses over a few wobbly thought processes,  it sometimes breaks up a narrative or makes it unnecessarily melodramatic. Yet,  all in all, this is fascinating stuff.  </P> <P> And when Don Simpson -- cheerfully grandstanding an image -- says, "I would  kill somebody with absolutely no compunction if they transgressed me. . . . I  have seen people killed -- I have seen them killed in the act of self-defense,  not by me, by somebody else -- it was justified, and you know what . . . that's  show biz," one or two people may be more inclined to believe the tone and the  words of the man than any previous image concocted by a publicity department.  </P> <P> 'THE BIG BANG'  </P> <P> A Triton Pictures release. Director James Toback. Producer Joseph H. Kanter.  Cinematographer Barry Markowitz. Supervising editor Stephanie Kempf. Executive  in charge of production Tony Conforti.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 18 minutes.  </P> <P> MPAA-rated: R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  </P></p>

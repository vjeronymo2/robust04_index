			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Co-operation of lenders is welcomed  -Mortgages MR Nicholas Scott, Social Security minister of state, last night welcomed the co-operation shown by building societies and other lenders in helping to reduce the numbers of people evicted from their homes for defaulting on mortgage repayments. He said the council of mortgage lenders had agreed to make a contribution towards the extra administrative costs arising from the new arrangements which enabled social security payments for outstanding interest payments to be made direct to building societies, banks,insurance companies and other organisations. Mr Scott, who moved the second reading of the Social Security (Mortgage Interest Payments) Bill, appealed for co-operation from all parties in securing its speedy passage to the statute book.</p>

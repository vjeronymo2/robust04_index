DPR&hyph;70 and DPR&hyph;75 issued to the Public Service Electric and Gas Company (the licensee) for operation of the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Salem County, New Jersey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would increase the storage capacity of the spent fuel pool (SFP) from its current 1170 storage cells to 1632 storage cells. This would be accomplished by replacing 9 out of twelve of the existing high density fuel racks with 9 maximum density rack modules constructed of stainless steel and a neutron absorber material (boron carbide and aluminum-composite sandwich, product name ``boral''). The proposed change would extend the date when full core discharge capacity is no longer available for Salem 1 from 1998 to 2008, and for Salem 2 from 2002 to 2012.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed amendment would extend the decay time for refueling operations from 100 hours to 168 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Public Service Electric and Gas Company] PSE&amp;G has evaluated the following postulated accident scenarios:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A spent fuel assembly drop in the SFP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Loss of SFP cooling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A seismic event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. An installation accident during reracking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Salem SFP has been analyzed considering fuel handling equipment, operating procedures, SFP cooling system, and seismic events. Reracking involves replacing 9 out of the 12 existing high density racks with 9 new maximum density racks. It does not require any system modifications or modifications to the cask handling crane, which by its physical location and design is prevented from moving over the SFP. Results confirm that the proposed modification does not increase the probability of the first three postulated accident scenarios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUREG&hyph;0612, ``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.6, provide guidance for heavy load handling operations during spent fuel storage rack replacement. Section 5.1.2 lists (4) alternatives for assuring safe heavy load handling during a fuel storage rack replacement. Alternative (1) satisfies the control of heavy loads guidelines through the implementation of defense-in-depth measures. These measures ensure that the potential for a heavy load drop is extremely small. PSE&amp;G intends to utilize the defense-in-depth concept during reracking activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

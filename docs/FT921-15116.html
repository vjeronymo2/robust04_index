			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses run into profit-taking after recent strength Continental bourses saw some profit-taking yesterday after a generally firm start to the year, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose on hopes that steelworkers, due to talk to employers again tomorrow, could settle for 5.3 per cent. The Bundesbank's average bond yield dropped another 7 basis points to 8.18 and steels and engineering shares led the equity market up. The FAZ index put on 7.18 to 652.51 at midsession, almost unchanged on the week, but the DAX closed 25.95 higher at 1,615.71, up 0.8 per cent on the week. Volume rose from DM4.7bn to DM6.2bn. However, some question were raised after hours. Mr Michael Geiger of County NatWest said that steels could be brought back to earth next week by the Thyssen Stahl press conference which was likely to shed more light on the depressed state of the industry. Furthermore, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, forecast high interest rates for the foreseeable future. PARIS failed to build on Thursday's gains, as profit-taking emerged after the market's recent rise. The CAC-40 index rose 3.58 at 1,837.44, up 3.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr3.8bn after FFr4bn. Elf continued to weigh on the index, losing FFr8.60 to FFr355.90 in the day's heaviest turnvover of 767,100 shares. The stock fell 5.7 per cent on the week on lower oil prices and reports of earnings downgrades. There were also rumours that the government would force Elf to buy into the ailing Groupe Bull. The drinks company Remy made a rare appearance in the most actives list, as it fell FFr3 to FFr210 in 328,600 shares. Dealers attributed the high volume to an internal crossing of treasury stock. Credit Local de France continued its quiet recovery. The stock fell as low as FFr190.10 after its flotation in December but yesterday it closed FFr3.80 higher at FFr209.80, just below the issue price of FFr210. MILAN was encouraged by the near-certainty that the general election would be held in the first half of April. Dealers also attributed the firmer tone to short-covering ahead of Monday's expiration of the monthly options. The Comit index rose 8.24 to 531.76, a rise of 4.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at near Thursday's L102.6bn. Turnover has doubled since the start of the year, reflecting the new requirement that all trading on behalf of third parties must be conducted on the bourse. Generali touched L30,000 before closing up L600 or 2.1 per cent at L29,550. ZURICH was inspired by interest rate hopes as the Credit Suisse index rose 3.6 to 465.7, slightly higher on the week, in good volume. MADRID saw lively trade, turnover rising from Pta16.5bn to Pta22bn, but profit-taking left the general index 0.12 lower at 253.09, up 3.9 per cent on the week. BRUSSELS continued to focus on retailers, with Colruyt closing up 4.1 per cent or BFr200 at an all-time high of BFr5,100 after the company announced a 62 per cent rise in six-month profits late on Thursday. The Bel-20 index closed up 6.06 to 1,107.00, little changed on the week, in heavy turnover of BFr1.07bn. AMSTERDAM was lifted by the dollar and a cut in domestic interest rates. Dealers detected interest from international investors, since Amsterdam has lagged behind the rest of Europe. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 116.2, up 2.3 per cent on the week. The photocopier and office systems maker Oce-van der Grinten soared Fl 3.50 or 5.5 per cent to Fl 67 as the company's forecast of an 18 per cent gain in 1991 net profit to Fl 101m surprised the market. STOCKHOLM advanced for the fifth consecutive session in heavy trading, but was worried by specific proposals for drug prices in yesterday's budget. Astra A fell SKr15 to SKr580 as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 7.8 to 954.0, up 3.5 per cent on the week. HELSINKI gained 2.2 per cent on the day and 6.1 per cent on the week as the Hex index closed 18 higher at 829.9.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm      3 pm     Close 1103.52  1103.61  1104.03  1105.58  1105.95  1106.87+ 1107.06+  1105.40  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Day's High  N/A     Day's Low  N/A  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Jan 9     Jan 8     Jan 7     Jan 6     Jan 3  1100.02   1080.21   1086.06   1092.05   1087.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). +Indicative.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

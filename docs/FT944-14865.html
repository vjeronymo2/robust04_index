			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Electrical flaw stops Eurostar from shining The passengers were waiting to board. The champagne was on ice. The driver was in his cab. But nothing happened. Two minutes before the Pounds 24m Eurostar train was to pull out of Waterloo station yesterday morning, an electrical fault forced engineers to call off the inaugural London-Paris run. There was a one-hour delay while embarrassed Eurostar officials ordered a replacement train from its north London depot, and hastily stocked it with food and refreshments for the European press on the trip. In spite of making the journey in a record time of 2 hours 49 minutes, the event, designed to let the Eurostar show off its paces to the press, became a public relations disaster, the latest in a long line of setbacks that have dogged the Pounds 10bn cross-Channel rail project. Eurostar, open to the public from November 14, is run by the railways of Britain, France and Belgium. News of the electrical fault helped to depress the shares of Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, by 12p to a record low of 199p. 'This is all very embarrassing for us,' an official of European Passenger Services, the British partner in Eurostar, said yesterday. 'Things had been going well and we did not think it was necessary to put on a back-up train (at Waterloo).' EPS said its engineers had discovered a fault in a circuit breaker controlling the power supply, which would have meant the train could not have run at its top speed of 186mph in France. Mr Malcolm Southgate, deputy managing director of EPS, commented: 'We wouldn't have announced that we were going to start commercial passenger services next month if we were not satisfied that the trains were okay. Obviously there are lessons to be learnt.' Tickets for Eurostar services go on sale on October 24. Picture, Page 9</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Saison to buy SAS hotels stake SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS), the cash-strapped airline, is planning to sell its 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental Hotels, the international hotel chain, to Inter-Continental's controlling shareholder, Saison group, the Japanese retail and leisure combine. SAS, which bought its stake for Dollars 500m just two years ago, has decided it no longer wants to carry the heavy cost of its investment in Inter-Continental, one of the world's biggest luxury hotel groups. SAS and Saison group are expected to announce an agreement later this week. SAS's pull-out will be a setback for the Saison group, which acquired Inter-Continental for Dollars 2.3bn in 1988 and brought in SAS as a partner to expand the chain's international appeal and help pay for a large-scale refurbishment and hotel-building programme. Quite apart from SAS's problems, Saison's ambitions have been hit by the effects of rising interest rates, the impact of the Gulf war on international travel and of the slow down in the world economy. Inter-Continental has been running in the black at the operating level but financing costs have pushed it into the red in each of the last three years. Last year, the hotel chain made an operating profit of around Dollars 50m and a pre-tax loss of about Dollars 100m. Saison officials have denied that losses at Inter-Continental were putting pressure on the whole group's finances. But they admit that Inter-Continental missed a target in failing to break even at the pre-tax level last year. To relieve part of Inter-Continental's debt burden, other Saison group companies are injecting a substantial amount of new capital into the hotel chain, though the precise amount has yet to be disclosed. Also Mr Sueaki Takaoka, the chairman of Saison Corporation, a core company in the group, last month also assumed the post of chairman of Inter-Continental. Inter-Continental is slowing down plans to expand its 100-plus hotels. However, large-scale disposals to clear debt have been ruled out on the grounds that the group wants to enhance Inter-Continental in the future and that world property prices are now depressed. Saison officials believe re-acquiring 100 per cent of Inter-Continental would allow Saison group to take decisions more quickly.</p>

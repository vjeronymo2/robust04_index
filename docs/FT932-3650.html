			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Books: Big Brother arrives THE SILENT CONSPIRACY by Stephen Dorril Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 521 pages WITH exquisite timing, the British Security Service (MI5) has moved into a new, hideous headquarters on Millbank just as it has become all too apparent that Boris Yeltsin's Russia is no more capable of posing a threat to the UK than it is of conducting its own affairs. Yet it is an historically demonstrable fact that Soviet Russia has always been regarded by MI5 and the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police as an enemy of Britain. Those in Britain who have, or are alleged to have had, overt or covert sympathy for Soviet Russia have been regarded in the same light as committed supporters and traitors. Stephen Dorril therefore argues that MI5 and the Special Branch are now planning to concentrate their energies on closer investigation than ever before of the lives and beliefs of British citizens, in order to persuade the government that their tasks remain unchanged despite Soviet Russia's demise. Terrorism in its many forms, with Northern Ireland the scene for prolonged undeclared war, will justify greater activity, not only by MI5 but by the other civilian and military agencies which operate there. The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the Postal Services and British Telecom will seek to penetrate ever more closely into private lives. Dorril's Big Brother world is described soberly, and with abundant corroborative material. Dorril has also worked hard to sustain the thesis which complements his account of MI5's and the Special Branch's determination to survive at all costs. Dorril states not only that the Cold War is over but that 'it is debatable whether terrorism poses a real threat to the realm.' Therefore, there is no longer any need for MI5 and its associates. Dorril is clearly convinced that this simple assertion requires no evidence to support it. Given such a conviction, Dorril finds no difficulty in arguing that MI5 and the Special Branch manufacture crises and distort the terrorist factor in order to strengthen what he calls 'the secret state'. Linking issues which should be treated separately is a device much employed by conspiracy theorists, and Dorril is no exception. He has, however, striven so hard to sustain his case against MI5 and the Special Branch that the issues do emerge in terms which enable two key questions to be asked: do we need security services, and are these services so anxious to convince their political masters of the existence of new threats to the realm that intensified interference with ordinary British citizens occurs almost without check? The first question can be bluntly answered in the affirmative. All Dorril's denials cannot alter the fact that a major terrorist threat does exist to the lives of just those ordinary citizens about whom he professes such concern. When people get blown up or maimed, and when evidence emerges that the Provisional IRA is not the only terrorist organisation operating in the UK, the thoughtful reader could well decide that the author represents a generation which lacks direct experience of an ugly world. Yet Dorril not only calls the Provisionals 'terrorists' but applies the word to others, notably those who perpetrated the Lockerbie massacre. Dorril also states that 'with substantial arms supplies from Libya the IRA will always be able to mount operations.' There is much mental confusion here. Nevertheless, and coming to the second issue, Dorril does have a constitutionally and politically very important case in exposing the degree to which our lives are under surveillance, and on a scale which poses a specific threat to civil liberties. The Police Review, hardly a journal of the left, provides Dorril with an apt text regarding surveillance operations: 'Much of the information is valid intelligence. A substantial proportion is unchecked bunkum.' Searching further back in time, Dorril finds Erskine May criticising the Special Branch: 'The freedom of a country may be noted by its immunity from this baneful agency.' If therefore there is nothing new about the secret British state, Dorril has still done good work in giving examples of unwarranted interference with our lives; justified on no possibly valid security grounds; apparently controlled by recent legislation; yet exonerated in practice by governmental authority in terms which could well have been laid down by Sir Humphrey Appleby. In the event, therefore, Mr Dorril has put it in his debt. The security services are necessary, but require urgent overhaul and Parliamentary oversight. Attention John Major, our populist prime minister. While he is about it, Mr Major could do worse than take a close look at 'private security organisations,' as they tend, euphemistically, to dub themselves. Some of these firms are perfectly proper and have saved lives rather than taken them. But all merit investigation - by Parliament, not by some neutered Whitehall committee. The case for investigation is clear and straightforward: the electronic age enables all kind of folk, well intentioned and otherwise, contracted, covertly, to 'government' or not, to poke and pry. Orwell's frightening vision is coming closer to realisation, not because of 'the secret state' mentality but because it is now all too easy to dig deep into another's private life.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (3): An investment backwater - The Kuwait stock exchange has its limits Here is the good news: according to official figures, the 1993 average daily volume of share transactions of the 47 companies listed on the Kuwait stock exchange was 13m-14m with an average daily value of Dollars 11m. In terms of both value and volume, these figures represent twice those recorded in 1989, the last full year before the Iraqi invasion of August 1990. Here is the bad news: in 1989 the Kuwait stock market was almost moribund, moving barely one per cent. The government owned more than 50 per cent of all the listed shares. Today, through the Kuwait Investment Authority and other agencies, it owns, according to Mr Hilal al-Mutairi, director-general of the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry, over 45 per cent of the total market capitalisation of some Dollars 11.5bn. KIA alone owns 20-25 per cent of the market, according to its managing director, Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader. If the government tried to get rid of its shares to the private sector given the present levels of turnover, it would take many years if the market was not to collapse, according to one accountant. In 1989 some 70 per cent of all daily trading was in six bank stocks out of the 42 different companies spread across eight sectors. This year, in the week ending February 9, the banking sector, comprising stocks of eight banks, accounted for 63.8 per cent of total traded value, according to Alshall Economic Consultants. These eight banks collectively represented 46.2 per cent of traded volume. The trading in just two banks, National Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait Finance House, represented 52.3 per cent of all traded value. In short, the market is almost irrelevant as a barometer of economic health or as a source of new money. According to a Kuwaiti industrialist, people are holding on to their money, waiting to see whether the government is actually capable of pushing through a privatisation programme and deregulating the economy. 'I feel as though we are sailing on a ship with no compass,' said the industrialist. 'The government has no plan except to set up more committees. We are lost with all these committees.' But there was also a good side. 'There are plenty of good Kuwaitis, intelligent and hard-working, who know what needs to be done, but who are forced to wait for a government which can't apply itself. Privatisation cannot be applied by bureaucrats. I have never seen, in a third-world country which ours is, a government employee willing to leave his office on someone else's behalf.' The private sector possibly has more than Dollars 60bn abroad, perhaps half that of Saudi Arabia, a businessman with 17 years experience in Kuwait suggested. 'But for what would the private sector repatriate its funds? Only for the opportunity to make more money at home.' There is only one listed company, Mobile Telephone Systems Co., 49 per cent of which is owned by the public, whose shares are actively traded - 5.2 per cent of volume and 13 per cent of value in the first week of February - which is likely to attract the attention of investors. So far it fulfils all three criteria for a successful public issue. These are, suggested Mr al-Mutairi, timing; state of the market and profitability of the company; and quality of management advising the privatisation programme. But the most important element is the government's political will. In the case of Mobile Telephone Systems Co, it appears to be present. By contrast, Kuwait Airways Corporation, another candidate for privatisation singled out by a government-appointed committee which this month made its recommendations to the finance ministry, does not fulfil at least one of the three basic criteria. On top of which one businessman said: 'I doubt whether any airline in the region is genuinely profitable in a full commercial sense.' But the government may be forced to privatise at moments not of its own choosing. Keeping nationals in government jobs has simply become too expensive. It takes some 70 per cent of the annual national income - and some 75 per cent of gross domestic product according to the Central Bank governor Sheikh Salem al-Sabah - to pay public sector wages and salaries to Kuwaitis, 93 per cent of whom work for the government. Moreover, 6,000-7,000 nationals join the labour market every year. But the government's inertia is not the only problem. The national assembly is suspicious of any shake-up which might attract non-Kuwaitis at the expense of nationals. In the meantime, the stock exchange stands idle, grand and gaunt behind its black marble facade, waiting for serious business.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Observer: Deuce Has Guardian Royal Exchange launched a grand plan to compete with Direct Line and the other fast-growing motor and household insurance telesales operations, or not? It was impossible to tell from yesterday's announcements about its new direct selling operation. Of the two sparsely-worded press notices, the one about Ray Pierce, the 47-year-old financial services executive who will head the new subsidiary, was the most informative. GRE discloses that he is married with two teenage daughters and his interests 'include tennis - plays at county level - squash and golf'. Information like that is hardly going to spoil the game of Peter Wood, Direct Line's tennis-playing boss.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Agreement on 'solidarity pact' lifts senior bourses AFTER the slump last Friday afternoon on storm signals in Russia and the New York equity market, bourses mostly recovered yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Sentiment, especially in Germany, France and Switzerland, was lifted by the weekend conclusion of the German 'solidarity pact', involving agreed political, corporate and trade union initiatives in the financing of German unification. FRANKFURT looked undecided, the DAX index ending 4.57 lower at 1,702.57. But this obscured the recovery from the tumble share prices had taken on Friday afternoon. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, of James Capel in Frankfurt, said that on the Ibis screen system, share prices yesterday afternoon were running 1 1/2 per cent of Friday evening's with Deutsche Bank DM11 higher at DM723 against an official close of DM720.80, down 20 pfg. Turnover fell from DM6.8bn to DM6.2bn. Exceptions to the solidarity celebration included Volkswagen and Hoechst, which closed DM7.30 lower at DM285.50, and DM4.80 down at DM249 respectively. Over the weekend, VW lost a senior management prospect as General Motors's J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua announced he would stay with GM. VW subsided further to DM283.60 in the aftermarket on industry indications that the carmaker's dividend would be cut from DM11 to DM2 for 1992, rather than the expected DM4 or DM5. Hoechst hit more trouble when its Frankfurt plant suffered an explosion early yesterday, the chemical group's fourth accident in Germany in the last month. MILAN reacted fairly calmly to news that Iri, the state holding group, was to take a L340bn loan from its telecommunications subsidiary Stet in exchange for granting it the dividend rights for three years in another of its subsidiaries, Banco Commerciale. The Comit index, on the last day of the March account, lost 5.82 to 508.42. In spite of the slight losses, Stet down L13 at L2,174 and Commerciale off L170 at L4,830, some analysts commented that the news placed doubts on the success of the government's privatisation programme: with Stet holding some 52 per cent of Commerciale's equity it was now problematic how the latter's planned privatisation could proceed. Olivetti was the day's other story, although the shares were suspended at L2,202 pending its surprise announcement of a L900bn rights issue. Mr John Stewart of Pastorino commented that the group, in effect, was seeking the new funds to rebuild its net assets after sustaining losses of over L1,100bn during the last two years. PARIS strengthened on hopes of easier European interest rates and the CAC-40 index closed 20.80 firmer at 1,986.03. However, turnover was relatively thin at FFr2.3bn. Interest rate-sensitive stocks were the day's main gainers in the absence of fresh corporate news. Euro Disney advanced FFr2.40 to FFr89.35, also helped by the warm weather which has recently boosted attendance levels. Paribas rose FFr6.20 to FFr422.20 and Suez was up FFr6.20 at FFr320.90. AMSTERDAM recovered from Friday's losses with a gain in the CBS Tendency index of 1.3 to 105.5. Wolters Kluwer, the publishing group, which reports 1992 earnings today, stood 80 cents higher at Fl 89.80. Analysts expect the group to see an improvement in last year's results of between 15 and 20 per cent. Fokker put on 20 cents to Fl 11.20 and announced that it was delaying publication of its 1992 earnings, which had been due on Thursday, until April 2 pending confirmation that the takeover by Deutsche Aerospace was to proceed. ZURICH took its recovery mainly in chemicals and Nestle as the SMI index rose 28.1 to 2,157.0. Roche gained SFr80 to SFr4,090 on anticipation that the company will simplify its share structure and will post good 1992 results, and Nestle rose SFr30 to SFr1,160. Banks were firmer on interest rate hopes, although CS Holding stood out with a rise of SFr40 to SFr2,270. Insurers were weak on fears that storms in the US would lead to high claims, Swiss Re losing SFr60 to SFr3,120 and Winterthur SFr40 to SFr3,320. STOCKHOLM remained subdued as investors awaited tomorrow's vote of confidence in the government. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 11.4 to 1,001.1 in turnover of SKr533m, down from Friday's SKr635m. Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group, went against the trend, rising SKr2 to SKr190, still helped by last week's publication of good 1992 earnings. HELSINKI was pulled lower by financial difficulties facing construction company Polar and the Hex index fell 28.2 to 963.1. Repola, which has a 12.9 per cent stake in Polar, lost FM4.30 to FM56.70. OSLO, however, strengthened with a gain in the All Share index of 8.02 to 442.61, for a rise of some 10 per cent since March 4.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- March 15                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1155.56      1156.80      1156.44      1154.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1152.83      1152.36      1153.70      1153.62  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1221.97      1222.49      1222.00      1220.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1219.72      1219.61      1219.70      1219.52  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Mar 12    Mar 11    Mar 10     Mar 9     Mar 8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1145.86   1163.60   1167.52   1164.26   1165.04 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1212.44   1232.53   1231.98   1230.72   1229.32  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1156.80; 200 - 1223.34 Low/day: 100 - 1151.96  200 - 1217.67.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

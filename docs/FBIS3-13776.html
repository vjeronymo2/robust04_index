The UN Security  Council is scheduled to hold another session at 1900 today,  Baghdad time. Sources that participated in the council's  deliberations yesterday told journalists that a clear rift in  the positions of UN Security Council members has resulted in two  groups. The first adopts the formula of previous council  statements that automatically renew the embargo every two  months. This group comprises the United States, the United  Kingdom, and Argentina. The second group adopts a new formula  for the president's statement reflecting the progress achieved  in the implementation of resolution 687 and Iraq's acceptance of  resolution 715. This group is led by France, China, and Russia,  and is supported by other member countries.    It has been noticed that this time the Russian envoy has  spoken forcefully in favor of the new formula, in accordance  with instructions the Russian ambassador received from Moscow.  Other sources said the Spanish and Czech ambassadors have asked  to consult their governments before defining their position on  the new statement.    Another report from New York says diplomats from various  delegations today emphasized that UN Security Council members  are divided about the position to take toward Iraq because both  the United States and the United Kingdom strongly oppose any  recognition that Iraq has made some progress in implementing the  UN Security Council resolutions.    It has been decided to hold new consultations in this  respect  this evening, 18 March. However, Vorontsov, the Russian  ambassador to the United Nations, ruled out the possibility of  reaching an agreement on any formula. Vorontsov said the UN  Security Council members are divided on this topic for the first  time in four and one-half years.    Other diplomats in the United Nations said France, China,  Russia, and Brazil and other countries want the UN Security  Council to recognize that Iraq has made some progress in  implementing the council's resolutions. However, the United  States and the United Kingdom reject this idea. They voiced  their displeasure with the recent Iraqi letter to the UN  Security Council in which Iraq asked the council to respect the  provisions of its resolutions on lifting the oil embargo from  Iraq.    A diplomat from Latin America who was present at the UN  Security Council session yesterday said U.S. Ambassasor  Madeleine Albright appeared to be very disturbed and agitated by  the Iraqi letter, describing it as humiliating. She said UN  Security Council resolutions are adopted by council members, not  by Iraq.    UK envoy Sir David Hannay was also disturbed by the Iraqi  letter. He said: The letter is the cause of the problem that the  council is experiencing. When the journalists asked him why the  embargo against Iraq continues after it has demonstrated obvious  cooperation in implementing UN Security Council resolutions, he  admitted Iraq has shown cooperation. However, he claimed his  country and the United States need some time to test the  seriousness of Iraq's cooperation. This is a diplomatic  expression to cover up a position that is hostile to Iraq.    In a related development, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz  last night met with special commission Chairman Ambassador Rolf  Ekeus. The meeting, which went on for one and one-half hours,  was attended by members of the Iraqi delegation, the special  commission vice chairman and some of its members.    Before entering the meeting, Ekeus told journalists outside  the house of the Iraqi UN envoy that the technical meetings were  good. He said: These meetings helped us clarify certain issues.  We hope we will be able to complete them quickly.    Asked about what he will discuss with Tariq 'Aziz, Ekeus  said: I will clarify certain basic points. We are interested  in listening to his remarks.    Ekeus expressed dissatisfaction with Iraq's letter that  Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz presented the day before  yesterday. Ekeus did not say why is he is dissatisfied. The  letter reminds the Security Council of its obligations to lift  the embargo because Iraq had fulfilled its obligations according  to Resolutions 687 and 715.    Following his meeting with Tariq 'Aziz, Ekeus told  journalists outside the Iraqi ambassador's house: We have  exchanged views as part of the ongoing dialogue between us. I  must not say anything further.    He then said: Every day, we in the commission are  progressing further toward the future monitoring. We will  continue the technical talks. We hope to complete them today,  Friday.    Asked by journalists about issues that are still pending,  Ekeus said: After Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 715, last  January we received statements from Iraq that were needed to  start the monitoring. In the commission, we are trying to mass  all of our resources to start the monitoring and resolve the  remaining problems, or so he alleges.</p>

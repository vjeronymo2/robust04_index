			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Moshechkov article: "Russia in Bosnia: Get Out in </F> Order To Remain"]    [Text] In recent days the Western allies were unable to  hide their "sigh of relief" when Russia left the negotiations  with the Bosnian Serbs, saying that they do not keep their word  and are taking a great power for a "banana republic."    Yet immediately after Russian Special Representative V.  Churkin's return to Moscow, Washington and the UN mediators  achieved certain results at the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters in  Pale. R. Karadzic agreed to put heavy weapons around Sarajevo  under the control of international observers, and to release  detained servicemen from the peacekeeping contingent. Western  news agencies are delightedly informing the world that "the  agreements in Pale were achieved as a result of efforts by the  international community, first and foremost the United States."    Have we not left the Bosnian "operating table" too soon?  True, you have to recognize that the Serbian "patient" has  behaved in a fairly violent manner. Just last week the Bosnian  Serbs agreed to deal only with Russia and made generous promises  to V. Churkin and A. Kozyrev that they would calm down in  Gorazde, but.... As local observers report, information on  their actions is very contradictory and their behavior very  unpredictable.    Whom will Moscow believe now, which side will it take?  Hopefully, only our own. You could spend a long time pondering  why the Serbs set us up and who benefited from all this and why.  At the moment one thing is clear -- by getting out of the  Balkans Russia will definitely lose.    The Kremlin understands this. B. Yeltsin has proposed  calling a summit meeting on the situation in former Yugoslavia.    One more thing. It would be naive to believe the claims that  our diplomats have weak nerves. Even at a personal level. We  should not forget that V. Churkin himself received a wonderful  education as a young interpreter participating in negotiations  on global international problems. It was our star diplomats who  conducted these negotiations, people who avoid slamming doors  and have the patience to seek compromises and take adjournments  at the right time in order to finally achieve concrete results.  Adjournments which, perhaps, it behooves a great country to make  in its relations with impatient or inessential partners.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (8): Picture of satisfaction - Peter Wise investigates foreign investment and finds a . . . LEICA camera bodies, the most expensive and prestigious in the world, are made in Germany. But an important part of their manufacture, together with the full production of high-precision binoculars and microscopes, is carried out near the town of Vila Nova de Familicao in north-west Portugal. Here, 500 employees match their German colleagues for quality and are only marginally behind in productivity, according to Mr Wolfgang Koch, the group's general manager for Portugal. The only difference between the Portuguese plant and Leica's two factories near Frankfurt is that labour costs are 65 per cent lower. 'We would not be in the market at all if it were not for our lower wage costs in Portugal,' says Mr Koch. Leica, now owned by Cambridge Instruments of the UK and Switzerland's Wild group, set up a subsidiary in Portugal in 1973 when the pressure of Japanese competition forced the company to choose between cutting costs or closing down. The Portuguese operation, Leica Aparelhos Optica de Precisao, has since increased its workforce more than twentyfold, investing a total of Es1.5bn (Dollars 10.6m) over the past five years. Two new factory units were recently opened, raising the value of the company's exports to Es3bn a year. Management is now considering negotiating a new investment contract with the Portuguese Institute of Foreign Trade (ICEP). Leica's success in Portugal bears out the assertion of Mr Antonio Neto da Silva, the secretary of state for foreign trade, that, 'allied to efficient management and modern technology, Portuguese workers achieve productivity and quality levels to equal the best in Europe'. Twelve German technicians work at the Vila Nova de Familicao plant. But the head of the quality department is Portuguese. 'They like to say he is more German than the Germans,' says Mr Koch. Local women, who make up 60 per cent of the workforce, show particular prowess at close precision work. 'The calibre of our workers; their willingness to learn skills and work hard is one of the most satisfying aspects of being in Portugal,' says Mr Koch. Low costs and high productivity such as those enjoyed by Leica are drawing other foreign investors to Portugal in record numbers. Direct foreign investment grew to Es509bn (Dollars 3.6bn) in 1990, a 46-per cent increase on the previous year - the increase in dollar terms was over 60 per cent. Most investment originated from Britain, followed by France and Spain. German investment, in fourth place, increased more than fourfold to Es60bn. Foreign companies already established in Portugal accounted for 56 per cent of the total through capital increases and expansion projects. Heavyweight projects such as the Es27.5bn investment by Continental of Germany in a tyre manufacturing joint venture made the headlines. But only two out of a total of 3,500 foreign investment projects went above Es10bn. 'It is the small and medium-sized foreign investments that are providing our industrial fabric with density and critical mass,' says Mr Miguel Athayde Marques, vice-president of ICEP. Besides illustrating the comparative advantages that are pulling foreign investors to Portugal, the Leica subsidiary is also a prime example of why the government is so keen to attract them. The high-tech, high value-added plant is set in the Vale do Ave, the most depressed industrial region in the country, where the government estimates 45,000 jobs could be lost by 2000 as textile, clothing and footwear companies - Portugal's principal sources of export revenue - fall victim to increased competition. 'Investment in new areas with a high technological component is vital for the structural adjustment of Portuguese industry and the efficient reallocation of manpower and resources,' says Mr Athayde Marques. The sectors pinpointed by the government as having the most potential for investment are information technology and electronics, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, technical ceramics, special purpose plastics, medical equipment, agribusiness, cars and components, equipment and machinery, sporting goods and tourism. Foreign investment in such areas has been highly beneficial to the Portuguese economy over the past six years. Exports are becoming increasingly less dependent on the labour-intensive, low value-added sectors of clothing and shoes and moving into more technologically sophisticated areas. Foreign manufacturers are forming upstream links with local suppliers. Their demanding requirements are helping to promote the upgrading of Portuguese companies, forcing them to improve their performance in terms of specifications, quality, and delivery times. The benefits are also being felt in Portugal's backward agricultural sector where productivity is less than a third of average EC levels. The Plein Sud group of the French entrepreneur Mr Thierry Roussel recently launched the first stage of a planned Dollars 100m investment in two large farms to produce off-season fruit and vegetables in the southern Alentejo, and plants and flowers in northern Portugal. Both farms use modern production and management techniques that contrast dramatically with traditional methods. The Lisbon government's eagerness to capture foreign investment is backed by attractive investment incentives for projects considered to have a positive structural impact. According to the Institute for the Support of Small and Medium-sized Industries (IAPMEI), foreign investors account for 16 per cent of the Es149bn that has been awarded in investment incentives since two EC-funded grant schemes were launched at the beginning of 1989. That percentage is likely to undergo a substantial increase if a plan by Ford Europe and Volkwagen to invest more than Es300bn to manufacture a new multipurpose passenger vehicle in Portugal goes ahead. Officials are waiting for Brussels to approve finance for an incentive package reportedly worth between Esc 100bn and Esc 130bn before finalising the project. The Portuguese Confederation of Industry complains this will be equal to the amount of incentives awarded to Portuguese companies over the past three years and has called for more support for local industry. But government officials say the amount of incentives for the Ford/Volkswagen plant has been exaggerated. They defend the project, which will be the largest single foreign investment ever made in Portugal, not only for the 5,300 jobs it will create directly but for the structural impact it will have on the economy as a whole, increasing the value of exports with the planned production of 173,000 vehicles a year, promoting the growth of supply industries and indirectly creating thousands of other new jobs.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SOURCES OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT (PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL FOREIGN INVESTMENT, 1980-89)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                       23.1 US                       12.6 France                   11.4 Spain                    10.9 Sweden                    6.1 Netherlands               5.6 EC                       64.5 EFTA                     10.5 Japan                     1.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ICEP  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN PORTUGAL (ES BN)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1980                 6.2 1981                 9.2 1982                 9.7 1983                15.7 1984                27.6 1985                42.3 1986                24.5 1987                61.6 1988               138.0 1989               353.8 1990               509.0 Total 1980-90    1,197.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Portuguese Institute of Foreign Trade (ICEP)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

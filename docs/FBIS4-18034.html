			<p>BFN     [Text] On Thursday the speaker of the Russian State Duma  Ivan Rybkin sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin urging him  to discuss the defense budget at the next session of the  Security Council attended by representatives of the ministries  of defense, finance and economics as well as the defense  committee of the lower house of parliament. This was reported  in an interview with Interfax by the chairman of the committee  Aleksandr Piskunov. He also heads a working group for the  classified part of the government-made draft of the federal  budget which includes defense spending.    Piskunov said the need for addressing the president was  prompted by the conclusions drawn by his group and by the  Wednesday meeting with representatives of the leading munitions  company Barrikady from Volgograd.    According to Piskunov, the working group compared government  estimates concerning the defense budget for 1994 with actual  spending during the first quarter. It discovered that during  the first three months of the year the debt of the Defense  Ministry to the defense industry increased from 2.1 to 4.7  trillion rubles.    Proceeding from this it is suggested spending 55 trillion  rubles on defence in 1994. In this case, Piskunov said, it  would be possible to support the presidential proposal on  spending ten percent of the defense budget on research and  testing. Overall investments in the defence industry would then  go up from 20.7 to 28 percent of the general volume of defense  spending, which would be a return to the 1992 situation.    At the same time the working group invited the Defense  Ministry to take emergency steps to stabilize the situation in  the armed forces. According to Piskunov, this could be achieved  through minimizing defense spending this year through stopping  the contract system for privates and retired officers and  changing the whole system of military training proceeding from  actual needs. Besides, combat units should be fully staffed and  their combat capability should be guaranteed by taking the  remaining units into reserves or disbanding them.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Big brother's Haiti blueprint: US efforts to create a workable grovernment As soon as Haiti's President, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, stepped out of a US military helicopter on to the grounds of his national palace, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, was studying his every move. The Americans have made a big investment, both political and financial, in bringing Fr Aristide back to power, and now they want their dividend: a stable Haiti. That is why, on leaving Haiti late on Saturday, Mr Christopher stressed the US would continue its military presence until the country was 'secure', and President Aristide would be firmly pushed to bring his enemies into the political process. In the task of 'institution building', Haiti would receive important guidance from the state department's Agency for International Development (USAID). As the US military's Haiti mission was ambiguous on arrival and largely shaped by events on the ground, the US blueprint for creating democratic institutions and ensuring development of a political centre that will hold is in a constant state of revision. 'Developing policy in Haiti is like going around a blind curve at 100mph,' says one USAID official . You simply don't know what's next.' Nevertheless, the central issues, culled from previous US experience in El Salvador, Panama and South Africa, have largely been defined. The Aristide government is being pressured to construct a wide political centre that shuns mob violence and paramilitary terror, wrest judicial tasks away from the army and police force, and build up other branches of government, notably the legislature and municipalities. Crucial to completing these tasks is finding the right mix of reconciliation and justice. But here, US policy officials are divided. Some feel a Truth Commission which would name those responsible for the estimated 5,000 murders under the military government but not prosecute them would be enough to calm many of President Aristide's followers. By doing this, President Aristide could quickly change himself from a polarising force into a cohesive, healing figure, similar to the political transformation undergone by his friend Nelson Mandela. But unlike the anonymous death squads in El Salvador, Haiti's killers are well-known public figures and President Aristide, without being specific, seems to be leaning towards some form of prosecution. 'Aristide understands the need for reconciliation but not so far as to establish impunity,' said a US official who believes if Haitians are ever to believe in their justice system, they must be shown that it can produce upright results. Still, President Aristide may find that forgiveness is politically more astute, given his need to cajole moderates into legitimate political participation. 'In Haiti, you don't have a governing class, you have a ruling class,' says Mr Rick Barton of the State Department's office of transition initiatives (OTI). He says that for the political system to be inclusive, a broad coalition willing to play by new and unfamiliar rules must be created, and to do this, people must feel as if they are not under attack. The centre-right is expected to be held in check by liberal economic reform and what US officials hope will be a new prime minister from outside the president's inner circle. The violent and extreme right has to deal with the US military. If a centre can be found and security ensured, then OTI's job of demobilising those ousted from the military for human rights violations will be easier. OTI is the brainchild of USAID head Mr Brian Atwood, who believes the cycle of poverty and humanitarian assistance cannot be broken until basic issues of governance are solved. OTI will pay the salaries of former military and police officers for six months and voluntarily relocate them to other parts of the country, where their reputations are less of a threat to their own security. OTI teams will ask local community leaders to nominate upstanding young people as new members of Haiti's police force, who will then be trained by another state department agency. Interim budgets for local judges, to be autonomous from the military and police force for the first time, is also part of USAID's financial assistance package. Bringing in mentor judges from the nearby French-speaking countries of Guadaloupe and Martinique is also being considered. Much of the Americans' political development plans and budget will go towards providing a check on President Aristide's power by attempting to strengthen other areas of government. Programmes for raising tax revenue on a local level will be implemented, while the legislature is to be prodded into expanding the constitutional authority of local governments. The goal is to restrain both a president on the left and rural strongmen on the right.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Wellcome Trust seeks move to venture capital The Wellcome Trust, the UK's largest charitable trust, is seeking to persuade the Charity Commission to approve a trustees' decision to invest Pounds 100m in venture capital projects. Permission of the Charity Commission is not legally required, but Wellcome Trust would be uncomfortable in making a significant investment which regulators might be unhappy about, said Sir Roger Gibbs, trust director. In July 1987, Wellcome Trust secured legal permission to engage in a variety of investment activities, including venture capital. The move, which would place 2 per cent of the roughly Pounds 5.5bn of assets into venture capital, could provide a fillip for the sector. It appears the trust would like to invest in US-based venture capital projects. The process might take up to three years. Sir Roger said: 'We believe it imperative to protect the capital value of our fund whilst at the same time generating a sizeable income for the benefit of medical research.' He added that income from the trust's investments was expected to generate more than Pounds 220m this year, more than enough to meet commitments. The average UK charity has a 'negligible' exposure to venture capital, while the average UK pension scheme has less than 1 per cent of assets in the sector, according to WM Company, a performance measurement service. However, a handful of the UK's largest pension schemes, such as those of British Coal and PosTel, have as much as 3 per cent of their assets in the sector and have profited handsomely over the years. Venture capital is considered more risky than investment in securities although potential returns are higher. The projects are more speculative and the investments are illiquid, depending on either a trade sale or a flotation for investors to realise a gain. The Charity Commission said on Friday that while it had no specific rules barring venture capital investment, charities might invest only in areas set out in their trust deeds. Venture capital is an unusual investment for a charity because it is unlikely immediately to generate the cash most charities require. There is concern that the Charity Commission may view venture capital investment as engaging in a trade or business, activities forbidden to charities. However, investment advisers to Wellcome Trust believe the charity has a strong case for venture capital investment. First, its existing portfolio and 40 per cent stake in the Wellcome drug company give it ample cashflow to meet its charitable objectives, which are to fund research in the bio-medical field. Venture capital would provide capital growth. Second, a portion of the venture capital funds might be invested in start-up bio-technology companies which commercially exploit scientific research. This would be consistent with the charity's mission, its advisers believe. The Trust has professional advisers on investments and risks would be reduced by diversifying them.</p>

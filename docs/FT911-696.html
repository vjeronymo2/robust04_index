			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Nissan Capital America in Y20bn five-year issue ONE new issue emerged in the Eurobond market yesterday as the market came to a virtual standstill due to the Ascension Day holiday in continental Europe. The sole deal, a Y20bn issue of five-year bonds for Nissan Capital America, a subsidiary of the Japanese car manufacturer, was targeted at Japanese investors and will not be actively traded. There is strong demand for corporate debt from yield-hungry Japanese investors, and the Eurobond market is the cheapest route for borrowers, bankers said. But a benchmark issue for the World Bank, which traders expect to emerge next week, is likely to be placed mainly in continental Europe, where the emphasis is strongly on credit quality. European funds are starting to shift from underweight positions in Japanese assets to neutral or overweight, often as they shift out of overweight positions at home. Traders say many fund managers are positive on both the currency and the prospect of interest rate cuts in Japan. Under its borrowing programme, the World Bank has Y50bn left to raise before the end of its financial year on July 1. Nomura is set to lead the deal, under the rotation system. Dealers expect the Bank to launch a 10-year deal, but say it is uncertain whether to issue a new offering due 2001 or to add a tranche to an existing Y30bn issue of 6 3/4 per cent bonds due 2000. A World Bank official declined to comment on specific market rumours, but confirmed the bank was looking at the market. Meanwhile, activity is expected remain subdued today as most continental European investors have taken a long weekend. However, a sterling mortgage-backed offering is said to be on the way.</p>

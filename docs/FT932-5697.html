			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (5): Ports share a history of trade and culture - A tale of two cities / Liverpool and Shanghai TRADING with China depends on guanxi, says Mr Ben Chapman, whose last job was as commercial counsellor at the British embassy in Beijing. Guanxi is a combination of goodwill and friendship: people prefer to deal with those they know and are wary of buying from strangers. Mr Chapman is now director of the Merseyside office of the Department of Trade and Industry in Liverpool and is confronted daily with the locality's biggest and chronic problem: unemployment and the search for new jobs. Over several decades, Merseyside's economic structure has wobbled and weakened as its port has modernised and shed thousands of jobs. The port is now successful and profitable, but male unemployment on the Liverpool side of the Mersey exceeds 24 per cent - on the Birkenhead and Wirral side it is more than 21 per cent; nearly 100,000 people are out of work. Merseyside needs investment and new trading opportunities. When Mr Chapman arrived from China three years ago it immediately struck him that here was somewhere capable of developing some guanxi and benefiting from it. Shanghai looked particularly promising as a potential twin. The reason went beyond superficial similarities between the famous waterfronts that symbolise both Liverpool and Shanghai as deep-water ports with long traditions of trading worldwide. Several large and nationally important Merseyside companies are already in China, with developing links to Shanghai or other crucially important regions through substantial joint ventures or trading agreements. For example, Pilkington's float glass plant is now regarded as an archetypal example of a successful joint venture, involving transfer of strategically significant technology and know-how to China and good returns now for the UK company. Pilkington is based in St Helens, one of the five Merseyside boroughs. Another borough, Knowsley, is the home of BICC, the cables manufacturer, which is also a significant China trader. GPT, the telecommunications company which, in its Plessey days, developed System X digital telephone exchanges in Liverpool, is also well-established, while Balfour Beatty is playing a central role in the Beijing metro. In addition, Littlewoods, the most dominant private sector business on Merseyside, is developing ever-stronger manufacturing and trading links with China in textiles and clothing. And on top of this, Liverpool has a special, cultural affinity with China. Although Manchester's Chinatown has grown rapidly in the past decade because of that city's emergence as the undisputed capital of Northern England, it sprang from Liverpool's Chinatown, which most regard as Europe's oldest. There has been a Chinese community on Merseyside for 125 years. The first Chinese were sailors but they were followed by fellow-countrymen who set up warehouses and ships' chandleries. About 15,000 people of Chinese descent now live on Merseyside, forming a substantial and coherent community. The DTI was sufficiently confident of prospects to turn last January's Chinese New Year celebrations in Liverpool into a well-organised festival of eating, drinking, and Chinese cultural events - with a trade seminar on the side. Just in case anyone thought this might be a unilateral declaration of a quest for guanxi, the Chinese authorities soon dispelled the thought. The Orchestra of Canton arrived to make its British debut at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, accompanied by three singers from the Cantonese Opera. The festival included art workshops, exhibitions, folk art, cinema, Chinese medicine demonstrations and lectures by Mr Kwok Man Ho, an expert on the five Chinese sciences of astrology, geomancy, palmistry, medicine and enlightenment through meditation and martial arts. The DTI's seminar attracted 300 people representing companies which wanted to do business in China. But the most significant step for improved guanxi was the presence of Mr Huang Ju, the mayor of Shanghai, who spent the Chinese New Year in Liverpool. The importance of his presence was not so much concerned with the ceremonial trappings of his office but the real power vested in the mayoralty. He is the political chief of a region of 13m people with an economy growing at 15 per cent a year. His importance was further confirmed less than three months later when he became a member of China's politburo. In April, Merseyside sent its own delegation to Shanghai, led by Liverpool's Lord Mayor, Ms Rosemary Cooper, whose non-political career was as a menswear buyer with Littlewoods. With her went Mr Chapman, Mr John Entwistle, chairman of Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, and Mr Arthur Rothwell, the retired chief of Ford Halewood who now chairs the Mersey Partnership. The newly-formed partnership pulls together local public and private sectors and has promotion of industrial development as one of its main aims. Guanxi is a central part of its role. 'The partnership cannot clinch a deal at the end of the day, but we can direct Merseyside companies and potential inward investors to where there are opportunities in both country's markets,' Mr Rothwell says. He was not expecting to come back with orders for Merseyside companies, only to develop more guanxi, but this aim seems to have hit the mark. 'Three steps down a very long road,' was one description of what had been achieved when the delegation returned. Tangible results are in sight, however. The Shanghai authorities are now planning to send a trade mission to Merseyside. Mr Furlong's Liverpool Freeport - the most successful experiment of its kind in Britain - is likely to be an attractive selling point. It allows goods to be imported into the Mersey docks and worked on or stored, with no VAT being due until they are moved out into the market to be sold. Another Merseyside mission will probably take place next year, while the Chinese New Year festival next winter will continue to be used as a showcase for the cultures and markets of both countries - and to encourage guanxi. As Mr Chapman puts it: 'Guanxi doesn't guarantee you will get business, but you won't do any at all without it. It gets you on the list of people to do business with.' Merseyside seems to have made the right start.</p>

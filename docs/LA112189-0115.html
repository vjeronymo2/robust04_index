			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARTIST'S STARDOM DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE;  </P> <P> ART: RAUL GUERRERO, WHO CALLS HIMSELF A "WORKING-CLASS ARTIST," HAS LONG BEEN  KNOWN IN SAN DIEGO. BUT HIS FAME IS GROWING AND NOW INCLUDES A SPREAD IN  "VANITY FAIR."  </P> <P> He is modest, serious, private -- not the kind of person you'd expect to see on  the glossy pages of "Vanity Fair." But there he was last month, peeking out  among the perfume ads and gossip, under the headline, "Hot Paints."  </P> <P> Now that the art world has become hopelessly star-struck, perhaps the magazine  was a good place for local artist Raul Guerrero to be seen. His Los Angeles  dealer thinks so. Guerrero, mildly allergic to marketing strategies and hype,  just smiles.  </P> <P> "I'm a working-class artist," he said in a recent interview at his San Diego  home and studio. "I'm in a situation where I need to make a living off my art,  to continue my artistic quest."  </P> <P> That quest, begun in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, where he attended the  legendary Chouinard Art School, has gradually but steadily assumed the  characteristics of a successful career. Guerrero's third one-person show at Los  Angeles' Saxon-Lee Gallery opened last month and continues through Nov. 25. He  is one of 13 artists -- and the only one living outside the L.A. area --  featured in the inaugural exhibit at Pasadena's Armory Center for the Arts  (through Jan. 31).  </P> <P> The current issue of the art quarterly, "Visions" carries a statement by  Guerrero in its special section on multiculturalism and the arts. And next  year, a fountain designed by the artist will be unveiled as part of the Hope  Street redevelopment project commissioned by the city of Los Angeles. Other  participants include architect Frank Gehry and artist David Hockney.  </P> <P> Guerrero's work is, indeed, "caliente," as Karen Smith exclaims in "Vanity  Fair." But the artist, 44, is no overnight sensation. He has had nearly 20 solo  exhibitions in San Diego, Los Angeles and elsewhere since his first show in  </P> <P> 1974 and a healthy dose of attention from the press as well. One critic  dismissed the inverted pyramid, flying saucer hubcaps, rotating Indian mask and  other symbolic constructions in his first show as "irritatingly hip." Others  since have labeled his photographs, paintings and constructions mysterious,  disturbing, vital, intriguing, timeless, gentle, ironic and haunting.  </P> <P> Despite the extreme permutations in style that his work has shown, varying from  severe conceptualism to lyrical romanticism, Guerrero said he has been  following the same line of thought for the last 15 years. He's searching, he  said, for a poetic reality that exists between an object or situation and the  person perceiving it.  </P> <P> "To illustrate reality is, in itself, not significant enough to achieve a level  of poetics," he said. "There's a moment when you enter that realm, a transitory  zone between fiction, what you imagine and what you perceive, based on your  entire contextual history, your background, education, what conditions you to  see."  </P> <P> Guerrero's interest in reconciling reality and fiction surfaces in perhaps its  most accessible form in his paintings of the last few years. The suite,  "Reflections on the Life and Times of a Venetian Jewess," conveys Guerrero's  impressions of the textures, light and color of the Italian city as much as it  restates certain cliches about the place, stemming from "what Hollywood fed me,  what I read in books." The melange of expectations he brings to a place, he  said, are as tangible as the direct sensations experienced there.  </P> <P> The Venetian series launched a trilogy, whose second part is the current  series, "Aspectos de la Vida Nocturna en Tijuana B.C. (Aspects of the Night  Life in Tijuana B.C.)." Each of these environments required a different  attitude, he said.  </P> <P> "I set out to do places that were exotic, romantic, that offered the  possibility of color, places that were a celebration of life, places that I had  an affinity for."  </P> <P> Venice, he said, is "part of our collective knowledge as one of the grand  cities of the world," while the bars and clubs of Tijuana summon more personal  memories. Painting this series "was part of re-experiencing what I had done as  a teen-ager, as a rite of passage, to go down to the Blue Fox."  </P> <P> Guerrero still sees work ahead for the Tijuana series, which was shown locally  at the David Zapf Gallery and is now on view at Saxon-Lee in Los Angeles, but  his third destination is already set: Iowa.  </P> <P> "It's part of my cultural heritage, since I was brought up in the U.S. It  affected my psyche, because many of the dreams lived out in Southern California  originated in the Midwest."  </P> <P> Though he has never been there, he expects his visit will be like "going back  and delving into the historical side of myself."  </P> <P> Each of the locales Guerrero chooses poses a different structural problem, he  said, and each calls for a different solution. An earlier series based on a  stay in Mexico related to the "magic realism" of such Latin American authors as  Gabriel Garcia Marquez in its combination of the imaginary and the concrete.  The current trilogy draws comparisons in style to the loose, buoyant brush  strokes of Matisse and the color-saturated romanticism of Delacroix.  </P> <P> Fundamental to all of his work, however, is a curiosity about symbols, myths  and the cultural archetypes that strike deep in the viewer's unconscious. His  passionate pursuit of these essential symbols led artist Ed Ruscha, who  collects Guerrero's work, to believe that "he has some demons haunting him and  he lets them out in his work."  </P> <P> Guerrero chuckled at the thought, then quickly sifted the comment for insights.  </P> <P> "I had never thought about it like that, and I think he's right. But I think he  missed the angels hovering around me. I think what he meant was that I'm  obsessed by it. I'm totally captivated by the creative act, the creative  pursuit. I think about it all the time."  </P></p>

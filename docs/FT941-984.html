			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / European Press Review FRANCE The French press is preoccupied with upheaval - both on the streets of the nation's cities and, closer to home, in the newspaper industry itself. The wave of student demonstrations, which has brought tens of thousands on to the streets in protest at a new law allowing young apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage, has prompted a bout of soul-searching about the state of society and the potential for an explosion of social unrest. 'Are we experiencing a return to 1968?' asked Le Figaro in an editorial, posing the question of the moment. For most of the press, the answer is No, or at least not yet. But there is high anxiety nonetheless. 'The young are angry,' proclaims the front cover of Le Point magazine. Le Monde writes of 'a blocked society', while Ouest France, one of the largest regional papers, describes a dangerous divorce between politicians and the French people. There has also been much soul-searching over the future of the press itself. Falling readership, the impact of new publications, and changes in management and ownership have prompted newspapers to reconsider their strategies. Last week the right-wing Quotidien de Paris launched a redesign which affected both presentation and editorial content. Photographs sprung on to the front page and long opinion pieces took a back seat to punchier news items. 'There will be no more grandstanding or pages of debate, because I think people don't read them any more,' said Mr Philippe Tesson, manager of the newspaper. Most significantly, however, the newly-named Quotidien cut its price from FFr6 (Pounds 0.68) to FFr4 (Pounds 0.45). The move, partly in response to January's launch of Infomatin, the small-format morning paper priced aggressively at FFr3, reflects the emergence of a circulation war in the recession-hit industry. The turmoil has extended to the loftiest titles. Le Monde, a bastion of the traditional French press, is also reviewing its strategy. 'To be passive is to be beaten,' wrote Mr Jean-Marie Colombani, the newspaper's managing editor, quoting President de Gaulle. Mr Colombani, who took over the top editorial job earlier this month after the surprise resignation of Mr Jacques Lesourne, has spelled out a policy of change. 'The idea of a more compact paper, from Monday to Friday, and a thicker weekend edition, in the Anglo-Saxon way, has been raised. But we must also take account of the pricing strategy,' he said in an interview with the left-wing daily, Liberation. As with the student demonstrations, the common element behind the manoeuvrings in the newspaper industry can be traced to the economic environment. Estimates suggest advertising revenues for the national press have fallen by almost 30 per cent in the past two years and are set to decline by 10 per cent this year. The trend, partly the result of a reform of the media buying system under the previous Socialist government, has been compounded by falling sales resulting from depressed consumer spend-ing. In many cases the result has been an urgent search for new partners. Earlier this year the Expansion group was rescued by CEP, an investment consortium. Infomatin, which has seen its sales slip following a successful launch, is believed to be seeking additional backers. Amid the turmoil, however, there is also stability - particularly in editorial opinion. Le Figaro, which has been closer than its rivals to the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, has been relatively supportive of the prime minister's actions in the face of the student demonstrations. 'One must always be wary of popular anger or public opinion,' wrote Mr Franz-Olivier Giesbert in a front page editorial on Saturday. 'It is urgent that France accepts a certain number of reforms, in employment, social security and national education.' Not surprisingly, Liberation sees it differently. 'The only intelligent decision which could be taken today by the prime minister would be to withdraw the decree implementing the CIP,' it said, referring to the apprentice contract at the centre of the student storm. It concludes, however, that such a measure is unlikely, given its importance to Mr Balladur's credibility. Upheaval on the streets, and in the press, is likely to continue.

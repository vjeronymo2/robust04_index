			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wembley losses double to Pounds 66m - Write-downs and weak balance sheet behind sharp setback Wembley, the debt-burdened stadium and greyhound track operator, yesterday blamed large property write-downs as pre-tax losses for 1993 almost doubled from a restated Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 65.7m. The company said it no longer had any distributable reserves and, following its first property valuation in three years, admitted net assets were now worth Pounds 98.3m less than the Pounds 175.1m reported last time. Faced with borrowings of Pounds 152.1m - equivalent to almost three times shareholders' funds - the balance sheet proved too weak to absorb the write-downs and the company was forced to set Pounds 48.3m against operating profits. Together with a further Pounds 3.2m charge for refinancing banking facilities, exceptional items totalled Pounds 51.5m. Those charges undermined operating profits of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 12.7m) on continuing activities and contributed to operating losses of Pounds 39.2m, against a Pounds 3.7m gain last time. The company was also hit by banking covenants requiring a Pounds 40m debt repayment by March 31 this year, which it met only by selling non-core subsidiaries for Pounds 24.4m and, since the 1993 year-end, disposing of a 50 per cent stake in Pacer CATS, the computer ticketing concern, for Pounds 15m. Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said: 'We've been to hell and back. We were fighting uphill to make every disposal.' He also warned that the company - which is unable to pay the dividend on both its ordinary and convertible preference shares - could be in breach of its borrowing powers and would be seeking shareholder approval for revised terms. In addition to the Pounds 40m repaid so far, the company is committed to a further debt reduction of up to Pounds 39.5m by the end of this year and Sir Brian said the board was considering a court application to approve a financial reconstruction. Any refinancing would be used not only to reduce borrowing but to provide fresh investment for its three divisions. Of those divisions, the Wembley complex saw operating profits decline from a restated Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 5.1m as bookings for the arena and stadium declined. The greyhound business reported virtually flat profits of Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 5.5m), and profits in leisure services - including Pacer CATS - fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.9m. Group turnover declined 21 per cent to Pounds 150.5m (Pounds 191.4m) including a contribution of Pounds 21.6m from discontinued operations. Describing the results as a 'watershed', Sir Brian said prospects this year were improving and it had resolved its dispute with the Football Association over sponsorship and television revenues. A 10-year advertising contract has been signed with Coca-Cola and the disposal programme was said to be largely completed. Losses per share, however, increased from a restated 15.4p to 26.6p and Sir Brian conceded 'we've got a big challenge ahead'. The shares closed up 1 1/2 p at 12p.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.B.: "Tiaret: A Hostage City"] </F>   [Text] Tiaret is still living in anguish. The city  closes the curtains at 1800.    "It is the curfew of fear!" we were told by one young Tiaret  resident who can no longer bear to live in a region whose  residents easily give way to panic and lose their heads at the  slightest rumor. "You would think we had no more men in Tiaret,"  he added, seemingly disgusted by the passive attitude of the  citizens and especially the laxness of the local authorities,  who do nothing to reassure people and provide them with a  climate of confidence.    Reports from Tiaret give one the impression that there is no  more state presence in that city, since it seems to have been  abandoned to the fundamentalist terror that is continuing its  insidious undermining work. Objective: to subject the citizens  to the diktat of the terrorists so as to prove that the latter  are stronger than the state. Here, too, the "words of command"  that one hears are the same as those heard just about everywhere  else: the veil must be worn, hairdressing shops for women, video  stores, and the few bars still open must be closed, and  parabolic antennas must be taken down.    The fundamentalists operate by means of large-scale  propaganda, the arrogant presence of bearded men, racketeers,  and death threats sent by letter and addressed collectively or  individually. Besides that climate of terror being maintained by  "henchmen" working at various levels, we were told of the  existence of fake mobile roadblocks being set up by terrorists  on the roads leading to Tiaret from Theniet El-Had, Frenda, and  Zemmoura.    "The terrorists have taken over Tiaret, and I can tell you  that former prisoners from Ain M'Guel are their main henchmen  for terror. They move around the city with an arrogance that is  effective," we were told by another young man from Tiaret.    According to another source, the fundamentalists hold  frequent meetings in mosques. They inventory the property of the  rich with a view to expropriating it. That news has reportedly  caused many of the city's notables to flee. The fundamentalists  are able to build their pressure because of submission by the  citizens. The more afraid Tiaret's residents become, the more  they give ground to the "bearded ones" who want to rule over the  life of the city with their prohibitions. That is what interests  them the most about the "hogra" [scorn, contempt] of women.    So is the situation desperate? "Not at all," comes the  answer, "because there are still many citizens who resist and  reject the lifestyle the fundamentalists are trying to impose on  them."    In that connection, the demonstration held on the day of the  funeral of the DEC [expansion not given], who was killed in his  office in cowardly fashion, was a popular demonstration of that  rejection.    The man was highly regarded, and Tiaret's residents, both  men  and women, wanted to shout their anger at a gang of criminals  that lives on murder and sabotage. The citizens say: "The city  must wake up and get back to its normal life. People have had  enough of this terror and are ready to fight, but for them to do  that, the authorities must not let them down."</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RABBI CALLS ON U.S. TO STOP 'MENACE' IN MIDDLE EAST AS HANUKKAH BEGINS  </P> <P> The rabbi of one of Orange County's largest temples called on the United States  to uphold freedom in the Middle East as Jews all over the world Tuesday  celebrated the first day of Hanukkah.  </P> <P> Speaking to about 20 people who had gathered at Temple Beth Emet to celebrate  the Jewish Festival of Lights, Rabbi Irvin Brandwein said that the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait was unacceptable and that the U.S. military presence in the  Persian Gulf, as well as its strong alliance with Israel, was necessary to  pressure Saddam Hussein into withdrawing his forces.  </P> <P> "America must fight to put a stop to this menance that is a threat to the  world," Brandwein said.  </P> <P> As Cantor Philip Moddel lit the first candle of the menorah, Brandwein also  called upon Saudi Arabia to allow American servicemen to practice their own  religions.  </P> <P> "We are sure Americans are suppressing not just their flags but their crosses  and Stars of David as well," Brandwein said. "Saudi Arabia is a part of the  world that operates according to a very Medieval religious system " that frowns  upon religious toleration and violates the basic principle of Hanukkah -- "the  freedom to worship according to each person's conscience."  </P></p>

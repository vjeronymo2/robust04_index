			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record sales help Cummins to Dollars 61.9m Cummins, the Indiana-based diesel engine maker, yesterday said third-quarter income rose to Dollars 61.9m, or Dollars 1.48 a share, from last year's Dollars 40.7m, or Dollars 1.11. Sales for the quarter were a record Dollars 1.2bn, up from Dollars 988.3m in last year's third quarter. Strong sales in US medium-duty and heavy-duty truck markets lifted results. The company said it expected North American heavy-duty truck production to reach a record 205,000 units in 1994, up 20 per cent over 1993. Cummins has 34 per cent of that market, and 35 per cent of the North American medium-duty truck market. Its power generation group recorded sales of Dollars 249m in the quarter. The company recently acquired Power Group International, based in the UK, whose businesses are less cyclical than those of Cummins' other business segments. For the first nine months earnings rose to Dollars 182.7m, or Dollars 4.43, on sales of Dollars 3.5bn, against Dollars 130.0m, or Dollars 3.54, on sales of Dollars 3.1bn last time.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Politicians play fast and loose with the numbers / Testing the validity of arguments in the current debate on taxes and public spending WHEN politicians begin to argue about the relative merits of lower taxes or higher public spending it is time for the voters to beware. When the debate takes place in the approach to a general election and becomes enmeshed in the detail of supposedly incontrovertible arithmetic the most sensible course for the uncommitted is to suspend belief. The real political - and economic - arguments behind the relative stances of the Tories and Labour party in the past week have been drowned in a sea of irreconcilable and often spurious statistics. At one level there is no fundamental disagreement between the parties that if the economy grows and tax rates remain constant, the government will reap a 'growth dividend'. It can spend it in one of three ways, or in any combination of the three: to reduce borrowing, to increase spending, and to reduce tax rates. The Conservative policy is based on delivering a combination of all three. It says it will continue to provide real increases in resources for the public sector, will move towards a balanced budget, and will find room to cut the basic rate of income tax. Labour has said it will use the dividend to boost spending and it will definitely not cut tax rates. It has been silent on whether it would reduce borrowing or keep it at present levels. Its only costed spending commitments - to increase child benefit and raise state pensions - will be financed separately by abolishing the ceiling on employees National Insurance Contributions and by increasing the top rate of income tax to 50p from 40p. But if that sounds a relatively straightforward choice as between Labour and the Conservatives, a dispassionate observer of the claims and counterclaims flung across the party divide in recent days could draw only one conclusion: our political masters canp. There have been many examples, but one or two give some of the flavour. In the middle of last week Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, declared that on the basis of growth of 2.5 per cent a year his party could expect a 'dividend' of about Pounds 20bn to devote to public services over the lifetime of a parliament. The Conservatives seized on the figure as a 'gaff'. Their own spending plans already included provision for an extra Pounds 26bn in the next three years. If Labour was to spend Pounds 20bn more it would have to raise taxes. It was a credible, if contentious point but the Conservatives then spoilt the case with their own arithmetic. Their charge was that Labour would have to raise the basic rate of income tax by 2p each and every year for the lifetime of a parliament, pushing the basic rate of income tax to 35p. They omitted to mention that this would raise not Pounds 20bn but Pounds 60bn. The message yesterday was that Mr John Major, who first used the 10p figure, had made the 'reasonable' assumption that Mr Kinnock had been talking about Pounds 20bn a year in extra spending by the end of a parliament. Labour meanwhile has been busy making its own assumptions about the Conservatives' plans. The strategy behind its weekend charge that Mr Major had a hidden agenda to raise Value Added Tax from 17.5 per cent to 22 per cent in order to finance cuts in the basic rate of income tax was clear. The government has raised VAT twice since 1979 to finance reductions in income tax and, more recently, to reduce poll tax bills. Since its own figures showed there was no room in the next three years to reduce the basic rate of income tax, Labour felt able to claim that it was obvious VAT would rise again. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, was careful, however, not to mention any of the caveats with which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has circumscribed the income tax commitment. A rise in VAT of 4.5 per cent would raise Pounds 8bn a year, enough to cut 4p off the basic rate of tax in the first budget of a new Conservative government. Mr Lamont has stressed, however, that he plans to move towards his target at an altogether more sedate pace. Even if the politicians did not misinterpret their opponents' intentions, the apparent precision of their figures bestows a spurious accuracy on economic forecasts stretching five years ahead. The Treasury has shown in the past few years that it is dangerous to trust predictions stretching just 12 months ahead. The debate of the last few days does tell the voter that taxes are likely to be lower under the Conservatives and public spending higher under Labour. Beyond that the forecasts are perhaps best regarded with the same confidence as the average horoscope.</p>

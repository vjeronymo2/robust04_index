			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Thitichai Thanadirotkun: "Super 301 -- a Sword </F> That Has Killed No One"]    [Excerpts] President Clinton's executive branch officially  announced on 3 March that it would apply article Super 301 to  redress the trade deficit problem with Japan. Super 301 is a  fearsome weapon as far as the United States is concerned, and  that country hopes that the article will force Japan to open its  market to U.S. products. [passage omitted]    President George Bush used Super 301 in 1989 and 1990. Japan  was the target of the article in 1989 and as a result agreed to  open its supercomputer and satellite markets.    It is worth noting that in the two years that the United  States used Super 301, the ultimate part of the article was  never applied: that is, the United States has never used Super  301 to carry out trade sanctions or retaliation against any  country. It can be said that Super 301 is merely a threat, not  a tool to be implemented.    In the latest development, the United States has declared  that it would apply Super 301 against Japan. However, it is  evident that there are many steps in the process: that is, on 31  March the United States will publish a trade report which will  identify the countries which are considered to be unfair trading  partners. [passage omitted]    The important point is that there is a considerable time lag  before the sword of Super 301 is actually delivered to the  victim. This situation makes Japanese investors feel impervious  to the threat of Super 301. The Tokyo stock market went up  360.14 points on 4 March as if to challenge the U.S.  announcement. The Japanese feel that Japan will open its market  voluntarily before the Super 301's deadline.    Therefore, although U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  announced the use of Super 301, Japanese investors feel that the  United States was merely play acting. Asian stock markets have  also not shown that much concern about the matter. The Thai  stock market went up 18.87 points despite recent weak trading.  The Nikkei soared 360 points, while the Hang Seng increased 116  points.    The story seems to be that Japan itself has not been  frightened by the Super 301 issue, and Thailand would therefore  be overreacting if it became frightened.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Personal View: Tipping the CAP to Gatt A big reason for the European Community's resistance to proposals by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt's director-general, for a compromise on agriculture in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is fear that they might force unacceptable changes in the CAP - in particular that they might require cuts in support both to agriculture and to exports of farm products. The Community is currently discussing internal reform of its agricultural policies on the basis of the plan proposed by its farm commissioner, Mr Ray MacSharry. There are concerns, however, that even these sweeping changes might not be enough to meet the requirements of Mr Dunkel's draft. Whether such fears are justified depends on the precise implications of the Gatt proposals. We have estimated the development of EC prices and markets under the MacSharry Plan, comparing it with the Dunkel proposal. The result of our estimates, based on data used for the schedules the EC submitted to the Gatt in March, is that the MacSharry Plan would easily allow the Community to meet the constraints proposed by Mr Dunkel. For example, EC wheat production would be reduced as a result of the price cuts and the acreage set-asides included in the MacSharry package. At the same time, lower prices would increase EC wheat use, in particular for feed. This would lead to wheat exports well below the volume of subsidised exports allowed under the Dunkel proposal. Equally, export subsidy expenditure would remain safely below that allowed under the prospective Gatt agreement. It may be more surprising that the total level of domestic support, as measured by the so-called Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS), would also remain comfortably within the Dunkel constraint, even if Mr MacSharry's compensation payments to farmers were included. This result is explained by the reduction in EC production under Mr MacSharry's proposal. That reduction would lower aggregate assistance by more than just the cut in prices. The compensation payments would cover only the effects of price reduction. In addition, the EC has reduced its cereals prices significantly since the base period for defining the Gatt constraints (1986-88). Tariffication would also not be any threat, since the tariff allowed under the Dunkel proposal would be more than sufficient to protect the EC wheat price that results from the MacSharry Plan. It is difficult, therefore, to understand why the EC thinks it should not accept the agricultural agreement proposed by Mr Dunkel. Even with a somewhat watered down version of the MacSharry Plan for CAP reform, it would still have enough room for manoeuvre. Indeed, the Community should work constructively towards a Gatt agreement that would be in line with its own attempts to rationalise the CAP. The question of whether MacSharry's compensation payments are included as allowable subsidies - the so-called 'green box' - is far less important than now appears in the negotiations. At the same time, certain amendments could be made to the Dunkel proposal. Since the constraint on domestic support will not bind a reformed CAP, the EC could even take the initiative by proposing a cut in aggregate support larger than the 20 per cent proposed by Mr Dunkel. As US agricultural policies make heavy use of domestic subsidies, a larger cut in domestic support would impose a more binding constraint on the US and so reduce the EC's temptation to argue that US deficiency payments on exported produce should be treated like export subsidies. In addition, to leave a little time for the changes in agricultural policy instruments that are required if they are to be more neutral in their effects on production - and hence eligible for the green box - the latter might be defined somewhat more generously for the first few years. Thereafter, requirements for inclusion in the green box might be tightened. Too tight a constraint on the volume of subsidised exports during the period of adjustment would also be dangerous, since it would push governments towards domestic supply control, this being a move away from, rather than towards, a more market-oriented agriculture. Both the MacSharry Plan and the Dunkel proposal can stand on their own merits. The MacSharry Plan would correct some of the deficiencies of the CAP. Meanwhile, the Dunkel proposal would begin the needed process of integrating world agricultural trade into the global trading system. The combination of the MacSharry Plan with the Dunkel proposal would represent mutually reinforcing policies. The MacSharry Plan allows the Community to accept a successful conclusion of the Gatt round. The EC should welcome the chance now offered, rather than fear the constraints it appears to impose.

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: Queen of Spades - Liceu, Barcelona To Madrid for an important event: the first-ever staging of an English opera, The Duenna, by a Spanish-born, English-exiled composer, Roberto Gerhard, more than four decades after it was written. (More of that to follow.) But first to Barcelona for a marvellous bonus - a much-loved work, Queen of Spades, at a opera house new to me, the Gran Teatro del Liceu. A single visit to the Liceu, a splendid theatre deceptively modest in external aspect, grandly handsome (more seats than La Scala) yet still intimate and acoustically lively in its interior proportions, is sufficient to add it to one's list of favourite theatres. It seemed an ideal location for a 'big-house' work from which most of the big houses still, regrettably, shrink. No less important, it was given with authority by a first-rate team - Mark Ermler the masterly conductor; Jan Blinkhof, Leonie Rysanek and Sergey Leiferkus among the principals of a carefully chosen cast; and the Brussels team of Gilbert Deflo (producer) and William Orlandi (designs) in charge of the staging. Its most rewarding aspect was the evident attempt on all sides to 'add up' place, performers and work - to come to grips with the spectacle as well as the late-Romantic agony of Tchaikovsky's difficult, magnificent masterpiece. In recent years, radical opera-producers have taken the violent passions and spectral visions at its core as grounds for no-holds-barred Queen of Spades psychodramas full of hallucinatory writhings. The material and, of course, the music can be made to answer such ambitions; but the glittering outward trappings of the work, its Sleeping Beauty sumptuousness of texture, loving formal discursiveness and richly rococo decorative details, have tended to get shortchanged in such treatments. The whole of Queen of Spades is a much more peculiar, alarming and enthralling achievement than allowed by the psychodrama-modernists. This was the understanding of Deflo's production, which intelligently filtered 1800s visual elegance - the Act 2 divertissement was both skilfully 'old-fashioned' and gently humorous - through late-20th-century sensibilities. Black front screens were used to partition the large proscenium arch, sometimes dividing the set, sometimes briefly closing out the background to focus on the characters. This was a 'filmic' device, employed with tact and purpose most of the time. The Neva scene hung fire, and the time required for main set-changes was always too long (the antiquated backstage facilities of the theatre will next year undergo a massive programme of improvement). In general, though, it was a modern production which in the best way threw the weight of dramatic expressiveness on the cast - and almost all of them bore it admirably. The veteran Rysanek, still vocally commanding, hinting at a sensual spark still alive beneath white wig and fearsome wrinkles, made a superlative Countess: she was, as she should be, the heart-beat of the drama. The Czech soprano Natalia Romanova, not quite big-voiced enough, proved nonetheless a truthful, fresh, touching Lisa. As Polina there was Claire Powell, spirited and rich-sounding. Indeed, all the wonderful smaller numbers and airs came off particularly well. Leiferkus's 'three cards' narration is, as Londoners remember from the 1987 Kirov visit, one of the most completely compelling operatic feats of our day - it is good to know that both his Tomsky and the Yeletsky of Dmitry Kharitonov (too mild in person but wonderfully beautiful in tone and style) will be in the Glyndebourne Queen of Spades this summer. The only question-mark over the performance concerned the bull-like delivery of Blinkhof's Hermann, sombrely exciting at moments, too often merely raw, morose and approximately tuned. I long to hear and see a Hermann who combines dramatic-tenor vigour and musicianly suppleness, Byronic elan and fine control. Even without that, this Barcelona Queen of Spades afforded a notable Tchaikovsky experience.</p>

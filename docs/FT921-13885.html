			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / The latest salvo from Bordeaux's artillery: Jancis Robinson tries an unusual new white wine from the heart of Bordeaux NOT MANY people would have the winemaking confidence to launch their new dry white immediately after serving Krug 1955 champagne. Come to think of it, not many people nowadays have the financial confidence needed to open even one magnum of Krug, let alone the six or so that preceded the lunchtime launch of Blanc de Lynch-Bages. But then its patron, Jean-Michel Cazes, is in an exceptional position. He is one of the few Bordeaux growers who has been gaining rather than losing control of what he produces and - possibly thanks to his early working life in the US - is one of a handful who seem part of a world larger than Bordeaux. He took over the family properties, notably Chateau Lynch-Bages, the Pauillac fifth growth widely regarded as a second, back in 1973 when he was in his 30s and has made sure that it has more than kept pace with soaring wine quality since then. But nowadays much of his time is taken in directing the strikingly ambitious wine interests of the French insurance group AXA, built up by his old classmate Claude Bebear. Across the road from Chateaux Latour and Pichon-Lalande, the Pauillac second growth Chateau Pichon-Longueville has been rapidly transformed from dangerously derelict to dangerously decadent (the only place where I have climbed a little set of wooden steps into a canopied bath - and was rather surprised not to find a raft of nymphs there offering to scrub my back). The luxurious chateau building is still surrounded by a sea of mud from which bulldozers and cranes are attempting to create the reality of Cazes' decidedly un-Medocain vision of a winery and visitors' centre. The interior decorators have moved down the road to Margaux's Chateau Cantenac-Brown, another property that AXA Millesimes is in the process of restoring to its former glory (although this one was cleverly bought just after its vat room had been entirely modernised). As well as Burgundy's Clos de l'Arlot and a clutch of Bordeaux second wines, AXA controls Chateaux Franc-Mayne in St Emilion, Petit-Village in Pomerol and, scarcely worth mentioning, the 'bourgeois' Pibran in Pauillac, more convenient than most from the point of view of Cazes' own family domain. That this domain exists at all in Bordeaux's keenly stratified society is something of a miracle. Cazes' great-grandfather was a montagnol, an itinerant agricultural worker from one of the poorest parts of the Pyrenees who set up an early sort of youth opportunities programme in Pauillac for the lads back home. His son, Jean-Charles, did well enough to acquire Lynch-Bages in 1933 (although none of today's glamour attached to the wine business then) and he then ran it for 40 years. Jean-Michel's father Andre, still very much a presence at Lynch-Bages, ran the local co-op and was Pauillac's insurance broker. The evening after his new white's debut, Jean-Michel Cazes was particularly relaxed. Playing with a glass of Roederer Cristal this time, he gazed into one of three scented wood fires that had been lit to give the white shell of Chateau Cantenac-Brown that lived-in feeling and reflected: 'I remember my great-grandfather. He wore sheepskin and hardly spoke French. The Medoc has always been colonised by outsiders; it has no history of its own.' But hang on a minute. The wines of the Medoc are supposed to be red, aren't they? Well only up to a point. Some white grapes have always been grown in among the more famous red ones, or more accurately ink-blue ones, of Bordeaux's northern outcrop of the most famous names in the wine world. Historically they were either thrown in with the red and their existence barely recognised or, like those inherited at Lynch-Bages, they were made into white wine for the personal consumption of those who grew them. More recently, however, the odd white wine has been sent forth into the world to make a statement. Those of Chateau Loudenne (GrandMet's isolated wine investment in the outer reaches of the Medoc) and Chateau Talbot (called Caillou Blanc) are designed to demonstrate the white wine making expertise of the international companies that own them. When the Mentzelopoulos family took over Chateau Margaux in the late 1970s it deliberately relaunched the domain's white rarity Pavillon Blanc as an early signal of its honourable intentions for this world-famous red wine property. Blanc de Lynch-Bages is simply the latest salvo from the man who has the most impressive range of artillery in Bordeaux. His increasingly hardworked adjutant is winemaker Daniel Llose. Like Cazes, he has roots in the Pyrenees, having been brought up in Banyuls. He has made some great red wines, apparently the princess who kissed the once frog-like wines of Pichon-Longueville and Cantenac-Brown. At Lynch-Bages the 1989, 1985, 1988 and 1986 were all stunning in a blind vertical tasting for which the Krug 1955 was the reward. But, having once done a stage in white wine country near Bergerac, Llose was keen to show what he could do with white grapes. Eleven acres of vineyard that did not qualify for the Pauillac appellation were accordingly planted in 1987 with equal portions of Sauvignon, Semillon - 'because it ages well'  -and almost 20 per cent of the traditional Bordelais white Muscadelle. The result is 1800 cases of 1990 Blanc de Lynch-Bages, a perfectly competent oak-fermented white that reflects current fashion and the men behind it considerably more than its Medoc roots. A useful, if rather expensive, first course wine for a Medoc dinner. Blanc de Lynch Bages 1990 was allocated to four UK merchants and is still available at Pounds 16.50 from Corney &amp; Barrow of London EC1. Tel: 071-251-4051.</p>

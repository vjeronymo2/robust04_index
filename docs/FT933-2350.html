			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (18): Claim regularly, wherever you may be - Medical insurance / Some policies now cover GP visits, dental treatment and spectacles, as well as childbirth and physiotherapy THE MARKET for private medical insurance has expanded rapidly in recent years. Policies now on offer range from the most basic, which will cover in-patient treatment if the National Health Service waiting list is longer than six weeks, to those covering every aspect of private healthcare. The choice to be made is between cost and convenience. New policies emerging at the top end of the market are aimed at busy people who need to have medical treatment when and where it suits them, rather than at the health system's convenience, or at a shortlist of hospitals where the insurance company has arranged the best deals. They may also want to be covered for more primary medical care in the private sector, and also dental care, as more dentists opt out of treating patients on the NHS. Privacy and punctuality are a consideration for many people, who do not want to spend time in crowded waiting rooms. The most comprehensive insurance policies now cover private GP visits, routine dental treatment, even spectacles and contact lenses in some cases, as well as complementary medicine, physiotherapy and normal childbirth. Unlike traditional medical insurance, these policies are designed to enable you to make regular claims. They are also likely to cover treatment during travel outside the UK. There are still a few exclusions, commonly HIV and Aids, self-inflicted injuries, alcoholism, war injuries and cosmetic surgery. Obviously, policies as comprehensive as these do not come cheap. Jan Lawson, of Private Health Partnership, the specialist intermediary, says top-of-the-range comprehensive policies are likely to cost 60-70 per cent more for any given individual than a standard policy. The Clinicare Carte Blanche plan, from Medical Insurance Agency, has set out to be the most comprehensive policy on the market. It covers the full list of GP consultations, prescriptions, dental treatment, spectacles and contact lenses, maternity and complementary therapy, as well as all the usual hospital benefits and specialist consultations. There are cash limits on some of the benefits, for example Pounds 1,000 for dental treatment. The other big selling point for Carte Blanche is that it can cover some existing conditions, for an extra premium determined by the company's underwriters. Other insurers either refuse cover altogether to people with existing medical problems, or exclude treatment for that condition permanently or for a period of years. Clinicare will provide cover for most conditions from day one. The policy also includes travel insurance for holiday or business trips of up to 30 days, excluding winter sports, but it is not available for anyone living or working outside the UK. Cover for a single person in good health, aged 30, would cost Pounds 68.13 a month, while a married 40-year-old with two or more children under 18 would pay Pounds 221.60 a month. The maximum age at entry is 64, at which a married couple with no problematic medical conditions would pay Pounds 288.06 a month. Annual premiums work out slightly cheaper. Norwich Union's most comprehensive policy is its Premier Care plan. This covers GP consultations, prescriptions, and routine dentistry; pregnancy, psychiatry and rehabilitation are covered after two years, as is limited infertility treatment, which is excluded by the Clinicare policy. Existing conditions are excluded, but there are no upper age limits on joining. There is Pounds 50,000 of cover for emergency medical treatment on overseas trips of up to 90 days. With the Norwich scheme, a married man aged 40 with two children would pay Pounds 285.20 a month. There is a 5 per cent discount if premiums are paid annually by direct debit. WPA's Oak scheme is its most comprehensive, but it does not cover quite the same range of services. It excludes GPs' bills, and private childbirth, and only pays for an annual dental and optical check-up, not for any treatment or spectacles. However, it does cover a limited amount of treatment by chiropodists, osteopaths and chiropractors. Overseas travel is covered for up to 60 days a year. A married 40 year-old with a family, living in London, would pay Pounds 158.60 a month for Oak cover. ate policy covers a similar list of treatments, except that it will pay for childbirth if the mother has been a subscriber to the scheme for 10 months or more. Worldwide cover excluding the USA and Canada for a 40-year-old plus spouse and family would cost Pounds 173.40 a month. Older people have particular problems in finding appropriate medical insurance. Some insurers have quite high age limits at entry, or none at all, but the big problem is the exclusion of existing conditions. The older you are when cover commences, the less likely it is that you will have a completely clean bill of health. For similar reasons, changing insurers late in life can also be problematic. Some insurers have specialist policies for the over-60s. Tax relief is available on private medical insurance for UK residents over 60, but on condition that most of the insured benefits are in the UK. So if you spend part of the year somewhere sunnier, you could lose out. One solution, used by Jan Lawson, is to arrange long term travel insurance with comprehensive medical benefits in addition to a UK medical insurance policy.</p>

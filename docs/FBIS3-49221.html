			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item by Vladimir Elez] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- The peace in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina depends only on the  Moslem side, said General Milan Gvero, assistant commander of  the general staff of the Bosnian Serb Army.    The non-acceptance of peace and agreement on cessation of  clashes and territorial division as well as certain open  encouragement (from the Moslem leadership) for the continuation  of the war are the main characteristics of the Moslem  religious-political activities in recent months, Gvero said in a  statement to TANJUG.    He also pointed at the fickleness of the Moslem negotiators,  the deliberate ambiguity of their stands and their failure to  keep their word and observe signed documents.    The assistant commander of the general staff of the Army of  the Bosnian Serb Republic, however, assessed that "political  realists, which have increasingly more followers, such as Fikret  Abdic and individuals in Tuzla, Zenica, Sarajevo and in other  places have started to appear among the Moslems." He added that  attempts, mainly unsuccessful, have been made to prevent these  people by means of political terror and armed violence.    "Clashes between Moslem formations in different parts of the  Moslem-controlled territory are ever more frequent, fierce and  on a broader-scale," Gen. Gvero recalled and said "the life of  the majority of the Moslems, politically uninterested, is very  difficult and rapidly deteriorating."    Precisely due to this fact the Moslem authorities, as Gen.  Gvero said, have been attempting to conquer Serb and Croat  territories with arms in order to gain political points and calm  the ever broader social rebellion.    Speaking about the Moslem propaganda regarding the losses  inflicted on Bosnian Serbs, Gen. Gvero said it was in fact "an  attempt to prevent the pronounced erosion of the moral of the  Moslem troops and population."    "These propaganda attempts are sufficiently transparent that  no one believes in them," he said and added that the Moslems  should know to demand "responsibility from those who are  plunging them into sure death and further unnecessary suffering  while they themselves are getting richer on account of the war  and have houses and foreign exchange savings abroad."    "The Moslem people and the forcibly mobilized troops should  know that peace could be achieved very quickly," Gen. Gvero said  and underscored that "Moslem leaders, who from warm offices  thunderously speak of war in which they push others, are guilty  if there is no peace."    "It is obviously an attempt to pursue policies and wage war  according to religious canons," Gen. Gvero concluded and added  that the Army and the leadership of the Bosnian Serb republic  were "persistent in the struggle for peace," but that they will  "surely and successfully defend Serb territories and interests  until peace is achieved."</p>

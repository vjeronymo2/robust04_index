			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE KILLS PLAN TO LIMIT OWL PROTECTION  </P> <P> The Senate turned back an attempt Tuesday to bypass the Endangered Species Act  so logging could continue in Pacific Northwest forests regardless of the impact  on the threatened northern spotted owl.  </P> <P> Republican senators in Oregon and Washington pushed the plan to help soften the  economic blow on communities expected to be hit hard by dramatic reductions in  timber harvests as a result of federally mandated protection of the rare bird.  </P> <P> The amendment to the Interior Department appropriations bill failed on a 62-34  vote. Debate on other provisions of the bill will resume today.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis </F> especially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Will the West Open Its  Embrace if Moscow's Position Does Not Suit Vilnius?"]    [Text] "Following the latest round of talks with the  Russian delegation headed by Ambassador at Large Viktor Isakov  on 21-22 March in Moscow, the Russian position has not changed  but has not hardened either," Virgilius Bulovas, ambassador at  large, member of the Seimas, and leader of the working group  holding negotiations with CIS countries under the Lithuanian  Foreign Ministry, stated. He announced that a document has been  prepared and will be sent to Mr. Isakov; this document is, so to  speak, an indirect response to the letter sent just the other  day by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to our head of state  Algirdas Brazauskas.    "We have some doubts as to whether the Russian side has  correctly understood our objectives regarding military transit  from Kaliningrad Oblast via Lithuanian territory. We merely  expounded these orally at the meeting in Moscow without handing  over the text of the appropriate document. In the letter  addressed to Mr. Isakov we have now expounded Lithuania's  official position on this issue," V. Bulovas said.    Explaining the essence of Vilnius' position on the problem  of  military transit, the Lithuanian ambassador said that for the  time being the Seimas has not adopted an appropriate law and the  republic's authorities are certainly not hindering the  transportation of the Russian troops and weapons that are being  withdrawn from the former GDR, thereby acting on the basis of  bilateral agreements. He also announced that at the present  time a statute on the transportation of dangerous military  freight via Lithuania is being prepared for adoption. "We are  not hiding the fact from Russia that in preparing this document  we are consulting with specialists from other countries, and  when the plans are ready we will discuss them with Russian  experts."    The ambassador had difficulty in naming a date for the next  meeting between the Lithuanian and Russian Federation  delegations. Among other things, this will deal with certain  transit conditions and also the coming into force of the  agreement on reciprocal granting of most-favored-nation trading  status signed by the premiers of the Russian Federation and  Lithuania in Vilnius last November.    The agreement is vitally important for the republic because  Russia is Lithuania's principal economic partner, but Moscow is  putting forward more and more conditions, linking its  implementation, for example, with demands for guarantees from  Vilnius that it will ensure the normal economic activity of  Kaliningrad Oblast.    "Lithuania does not intend to take any measures that would  damage the oblast's economy. However, if Russia henceforth  intends to pursue a policy of `time-wasting' in implementing the  treaty, thereby pushing us -- whether deliberately or not --  into the embrace of the West, Lithuania will take appropriate  measures," V. Bulovas said.    "We have invited one of the Russian foreign minister's  deputies to Vilnius, and I hope that Mr. Isakov will accompany  him. It is then entirely possible that a date for the next  round of talks can be set. Even though I believe there is  inadequate `groundwork' for such a meeting. But we will reach  agreement with Russia sooner or later: There is a desire for  agreement on both sides," V. Bulovas stressed in conclusion.</p>

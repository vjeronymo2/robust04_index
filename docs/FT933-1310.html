			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Guinness may be forced to resume pension payments GUINNESS, the brewing conglomerate, said it had been advised by actuaries to its pension scheme that recent tax changes and slower than expected dividend growth will force it to resume contributions a year or two ahead of schedule. As a result, the company will take a charge of roughly Pounds 30m against second half profits to take account of contributions for the 1994 year. Guinness thus joins a number of UK companies which have had to resume pension fund contributions following controversial changes to advance corporation tax announced last March. Earlier this year, British Telecom announced it would have to add some Pounds 800m to its pension fund to compensate for a shortfall caused chiefly by the tax change and by low dividend increases. The tax change means ACT paid on dividends which pension funds can reclaim from the Inland Revenue is reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. The change has in effect cut the income in UK equity investments for pension schemes by 6.25 per cent. Over 60 per cent of Guinness' pension scheme assets are invested in UK equities. In the year to March 1993, dividends shrank in nominal terms by 1.5 per cent while the scheme had projected that in real terms, they would grow by nil to 0.5 per cent. Guinness, like most UK pension funds, uses a method of valuing scheme assets based on the amount of income they are expected to produce over a long period of time. Guinness has been enjoying a contributions holiday since 1986. Its scheme was amalgamated with that of Distillers which it acquired in 1988 and the actuarial surplus in the combined schemes had been expected, as of the last valuation in March 1992, to enable the contributions holiday to continue through 1994 or 1995. Scheme members will continue paying their current rate, which ranges from nil to 5.5 per cent of net pay after deductions for National Insurance contributions, a rate roughly equal to 3 per cent of gross pay. Although the next valuation is not scheduled to be conducted until March 1995, the actuaries, after consultation with the company, have decided it would be prudent to resume contributions next year.</p>

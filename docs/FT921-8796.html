			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Russia remains focus for metals - Week in the Markets THE ATTENTION of London Metal Exchange aluminium and nickel traders remained focused on Russia this week as concern over production problems in the newly-independent republic lifted prices of both metals. The LME cash aluminium price closed yesterday at a seven-month high of Dollars 1,287.50 a tonne, up Dollars 38 on the week, while the cash nickel price recovered from an early fall to end Dollars 135 up on the week at Dollars 8,030 a tonne. Aluminium prices had risen late last week in response to a Moscow diplomat's statement that the flood Russian metal that had been depressing the market was over. And late this week the market was given a fresh boost by a threat to Russian exports because of the impact of new export regulations. The management at Krasnoyarsk, the world's second largest aluminium smelter, warned this week that it would start to shut down the plant's export sector  -accounting for about a third of its 800,000 tonnes annual output - from February 25 unless the government revised regulations increasing export duties and enforcing the conversion into roubles of half the plant's hard-currency earnings. Few LME traders saw much prospect of the threat being carried out, however. In view of the country's hunger for hard currency, most were confident that the regulations would be relaxed. Russia's Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel producer, has also complained about the regulations, but this had nothing to do with a decision, announced yesterday, to cut production and exports, the plant's first deputy chairman said yesterday. 'We decided to reduce the amount of nickel we export because world prices are very low. . . This means we can afford to reduce production levels as well,' said Mr Boris Kazakhov. Norilsk's annual output is estimated by western experts at about 250,000 tonnes a year. LME nickel prices, which had already recovered most of their earlier falls, responded to yesterday's announcement with big rises, the cash and three months positions closing respectively Dollars 180 and Dollars 162.50 a tonne up on the day. The copper market also put in a creditable performance, cash metal ending Pounds 64 higher on the week at Pounds 1,254 a tonne. But traders were not convinced that the advance, which they attributed to technical factors, was sustainable. They suggested that fresh consumer interest would be needed to maintain the rally, which ran into stiff resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 2,230 a tonne for three months metal. Tin prices built on last week's strength as good demand for high quality metal combined with concern over Brazilian and Malaysian shipment delays to push cash metal up Dollars 150 a tonne on Monday and Tuesday. But the resulting six-month high seems to have been the signal for widespread profit-taking, and by yesterday's close the gained had been trimmed to Dollars 70 on the week, at Dollars 5,640 a tonne. Traders noted, however, that sentiment continued to be supported by fears of supply tightness for April delivery. The only LME metal to lose ground was zinc, which continued to suffer from the build-up in LME warehouse stocks. It was confirmed yesterday that there had been no production this year at the lead/zinc plant in Trepca, Yugoslavia, because of production and labour problems. But an official said full production would be resumed in March. The plant has capacity to produce 70,000 tonnes of zinc and 110,000 tonnes of lead annually. In the zinc market the response was a modest Dollars 4.50 price rise for cash metal to Dollars 1,125.50 a tonne, down Dollars 15.50 on the week, while cash lead lost half an earlier technical rise to end Pounds 3 up on the week at Pounds 282 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange sentiment became increasingly bearish as traders suggested the projected 1991-92 production deficit might be smaller than expected and noted that deliveries to ports in the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, continued to be higher than expected. A Pounds 4 rally yesterday lifted the May delivery price from a six-month low but still left it Pounds 10 down on the week, at Pounds 698 a tonne. Coffee prices were steadier until fund selling pushed the London robusta May futures price through a key support area at Dollars 880 a tonne yesterday morning to touch Dollars 876 a tonne. But roaster buying was attracted at that level and the price ended at Dollars 888 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on the week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium  +4,725  to  1,076,875 Copper     -1,750  to    305,950 Lead          +50  to    131,700 Nickel         -6  to     18,744 Zinc       +2,425  to    177,575 Tin          +135  to     13,100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

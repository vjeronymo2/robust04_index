			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL ADOPTS NEW GENERAL PLAN  </P> <P> The Rolling Hills City Council has adopted an updated General Plan, a key step  toward revising zoning to conform with development trends in the exclusive,  gated community.  </P> <P> The new plan replaces one that was adopted in 1973 when the city's population  was about 1,500.  </P> <P> The city's current population is about 2,200.  </P> <P> The revised plan was adopted Monday without a portion addressing affordable  housing. A committee made up of council members Gordana Swanson and Jody  Murdock will report to the council in September on how the city can supply nine  units of affordable housing in a city where the least expensive house costs  more than $1 million.  </P> <P> State law requires cities to find ways of offering affordable housing. Cities  that fail to do this face potential lawsuits for not providing housing for all  income groups.  </P></p>

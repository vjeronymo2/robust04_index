			<p>BFN     [Text] Diplomatic sources in London were quoted today as  saying that north Yemen is massing its troops to launch a major  offensive against Aden.    Reports say fierce fighting is now taking place between the  northern and southern forces to control the oil-rich southern  governorate of Shabwah.    Though Aden denied the fall of Shabwah's capital 'Ataq to  the  northern forces, northern officials said their forces took  control of the 'Ataq military base. They added that Shabwah  Governorate, including all its military installations, is now  under Sanaa's control.    Despite appeals by several Arab leaders to Yemneni leaders  to  stop the fighting, Sanaa asserted that the continuation of war  is now inevitable.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Claims requiring consultation with, or approval by the Department of Justice will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. The Commander will refer such claims to the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Department of Justice in accordance with section 14.7, Attorney General Regulations. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix H.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.82  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reconsideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Original approval or settlement authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Reconsideration. An original approval or settlement authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer on a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Settlement correction. An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct his or her action on a claim that was previously settled in whole or in part (even where a settlement agreement has been executed) when an error contrary to the mutual understanding of the parties is discovered in the original action (e.g., a claim is settled for $15,000 but the settlement agreement was typed to read $1,500 and the error is not discovered until the file is being prepared for payment). If appropriate, a corrected payment will be made. The approval or settlement authority will reopen his or her action on a claim when he or she has reason to believe that a settlement was obtained by means of fraud by the claimant (or claimant's authorized agent or legal representative) and, if substantiated, will correct his or her action. The basis for any correction of an action will be stated in a memorandum which will be included in the file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A successor approval or settlement authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Reconsideration. A successor approval or settlement authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer in a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative, only on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation or mistake (misinterpretation) of law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Settlement correction. A successor approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's action on a claim which was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons as an original authority, as stated above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) All requests for reconsideration of a denial or final offer by a command claims service or area claims office in which full relief is not granted will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS for action, with any additional investigative material and legal analysis generated by the request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A request for reconsideration should indicate fully the legal or factual basis asserted as grounds for relief. Following completion of any investigation or other action deemed necessary for an informed disposition of the request, the approval or settlement authority will reconsider the claim and attempt to settle it by granting such relief as may appear warranted. When further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the entire file with a memorandum of opinion will be referred through claims channels as outlined in &sect;536.31. If a higher claims authority is unable to grant the relief requested, he or she will forward the claim with the recommendation to the Commander, USARCS, and inform the claimant of such reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) A request for reconsideration must be filed prior to the commencement of suit and prior to the expiration of the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Upon timely filing, the appropriate authority will have 6 months from the date of filing in which to make a final disposition of the request, and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the request. The action on the request will be effected as set forth in &sect;536.77(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Action upon a request for reconsideration by the appropriate authority (either affirming the prior action or granting full or partial relief) constitutes final administrative disposition of a claim. No further requests for reconsideration will be allowed except on the basis of fraud. Attempted further requests for reconsideration on other grounds will not toll the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Claims Involving Government Vehicles and Property Not Cognizable Under Other Law <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.83 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory authority for this subpart is contained in the act of 9 October 1962 (76 Stat. 767, 10 U.S.C. 2737).

The doctrine of comparative negligence is not applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is for medical, hospital, and burial expenses furnished or paid by the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is for any element of damage pertaining to personal injuries or death other than provided in &sect;536.85(b).

While the claimant is sitting in the vehicle, which is properly parked, it is struck from the rear by an Army truck operated by a DA civilian who had misappropriated the Government vehicle. The claimant sustains personal injuries requiring hospitalization for 6 weeks during which actual medical and hospital expenses are incurred in the amount of $1,200. He or she has no medical or hospitalization insurance. The damage to the vehicle totals $300. The claimant's insurance carrier reimburses him or her $200 for the vehicle damage and becomes subrogated in that amount under the policy terms. The claimant files a claim in the amount of $1,500, alleging $300 for property damage to the automobile and $1,200 for medical and hospital expenses. The claim is allowable in the total amount of $1,000, consisting of $100, the insurance deductible for property damage, and $900 of the medical and hospital expenses. The amount claimed for medical and hospital expenses and for property damage merely constitutes separable interests in a single claim that may not be allowed in an amount in excess of $1,000 under this subpart. The claimant's insurer is not a proper party claimant, and no payment is allowable for the insurer's subrogated interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claimant has medical and hospitalization insurance that entitles him or her to reimbursement of up to $500 for the reasonable cost of medical and hospital expenses incurred for personal injuries. While visiting at an Army installation the claimant is wounded by the negligent discharge of a Government issue caliber .45 pistol by a soldier who had stolen the weapon. The claimant is hospitalized at a civilian hospital and has incurred medical and hospital expenses of $750. The claimant may be paid $250, the amount allowable for reasonable medical and hospital expenses actually incurred after deduction of $500 legally recoverable by him or her under the insurance policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.87 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> When claim must be presented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim may be settled under this regulation only if it is presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.88 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> So far as not inconsistent with this part, the procedures for the investigation and processing of claims contained in subpart B will be followed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.89 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim may not be paid under this part unless the amount tendered is accepted by the claimant in full satisfaction.

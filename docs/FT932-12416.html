			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Hambros unit joins Chinese trader in broking venture HAMBROS Australia, part of Hambros Bank of London, has formed a joint-venture stockbroking firm with China's principal overseas trading corporation to operate on the emerging Chinese stock exchanges. CITIC Australia, a unit of China International Trust and Investment Corporation Holdings (CITIC), said it initiated the joint venture in the hope of stimulating flagging Australian interest in Chinese stocks. The broking firm, to be called CH China Securities, is the first joint stockbroking venture since Chinese companies began issuing B shares for foreign investors last year. CH China Securities has been granted a licence to operate as an authorised foreign broker on the Shenzhen stock exchange, and is expected to apply soon for a licence for the Shanghai exchange. Mr Jijing Zhang, managing director of CITIC Australia, said there was little Australian interest in Chinese stocks 'because Australians are a conservative people and they do not really know much about the market'. Mr Alan Humphris, a director of Hambros Corporate Advisory, said share trades would be handled by Hambros, but CITIC would supply the joint venture with economic and industrial analysis. 'I think that, with the CITIC entree, we will get a very good handle on the economy, the markets and the companies, and that will give us quite an advantage over the foreign brokers operating out of Hong Kong,' he said. Mr Humphris said Australian financial institutions were monitoring the Chinese markets, but most had 'minimal exposure', partly because of concerns about accounting standards and disclosure rules. The joint venture marks a diversification into financial services for CITIC Australia, which says it has about ADollars 260m (USDollars 187m) invested in Australia, mostly in commodities-related activities. The company's biggest investment is a 10 per cent stake in the Portland aluminium smelter operated by Alcoa of Australia.</p>

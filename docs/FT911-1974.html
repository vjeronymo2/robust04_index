			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (8): Polish-Canadian Walter Mitty - Profile: Stan Tyminski THE graffiti, stencilled on a Poznan wall in Russian reads: 'Warning. Stan Tyminski' and the date, December 9. It was a thinly veiled warning to Polish voters that a vote for the previously unknown Polish-Canadian businessman in the second round of the presidential elections last year was a vote for dark and mysterious forces with secret-service connections. The graffiti reflects the classic conspiracy theory response to Mr Tyminski's shock defeat of former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in the November first round. But most of the Poles, around 23 per cent of the electorate, who voted for him in the first round, stuck by him in the second, while those from the Mazowiecki camp, who earlier bitterly opposed Mr Walesa, were shocked into rallying round to ensure a 77 per cent support for the Walesa presidency. The polarisation of Polish politics around Mr Walesa, the former shipyard electrician who sprang to national and then global fame almost overnight as Solidarity leader during the Gdansk shipyard strike in August 1980, and Mr Tyminski, who turned up, completely unknown, three months before elections and defeated the prime minister, reflects the fluid, and sometimes bizarre side of post-communist Polish politics. Yet it is difficult, on acquaintance, to imagine that Mr Tyminski has a long-term future as a significant player in Polish politics. It is even more difficult to see him as a sinister character, a potential tyrant or populist rabble-rouser if times got really hard again. Perhaps Poland has been lucky in finding such an apparently inoffensive repository for the fears, frustrations and hopes of millions of ordinary Poles. Perhaps, to put it differently, Mr Walesa is right in claiming credit for having flushed out such previously unsuspected depths of resentment in the Polish electorate at such an early stage, before someone more sinister appeared to challenge the basis of Poland's restored but fledgling democracy. Greeting visitors in the small garden of his mother's modest, Swiss-style chalet in the outer suburbs of Warsaw, Mr Tyminski appeared smaller and tubbier than his televised election presence. He smokes and smiles nervously and is not an easy man to pin down on what he believes and what kind of future he foresees for Poland. Like Mr Walesa, he has a touching faith in computers. Unlike Mr Walesa he actually knows something about them, having built up a small but modestly profitable electronics parts factory in Canada. Describing himself as a 'Pole and patriot', Mr Tyminski is now busy building up a new party, called Party X, which will contest the parliamentary elections expected in October. Thus far, he says, it has only 1,000 members and Dollars 1,000 in the bank 'but we'll have from 50,000 to 100,000 members in six months,' he predicts. And the programme? 'It's all here,' he says, profferring a pamphlet containing a Polish translation of the 1773 Declaration of American Independence. All here? 'Yes. Like the Americans we're fighting the red coats. All those who used to be subservient to the communists.' But his enemies are not only the communists, who his opponents believe are actually secretly supporting him, but also individuals such as the US millionaire Mr George Soros, he says. He accuses Mr Soros 'whose influence goes from Russia through Poland to China' of financing the Sachs-Lipton plan, drawn up by economists Jeffrey Sachs and David Lipton, which is the basis of 'the Balcerowicz plan for free market domination'. 'I'd like to see a Polish plan in action, compatible with the needs of the people', he adds in words which to some ears carry the veiled tones of foreign interference, and deeper undertones of old-style Jewish conspiracy theory. He denies any anti-Semitism but proffers an English translation of Hitler's Mein Kampf as an example of the books sent to him by supporters 'but which I don't have time to read'. Much of the 43-year-old Toronto-based businessman's support comes from younger Poles who grew up during martial law and were too young to participate in the euphoric rise of Solidarity a decade ago which gave legitimacy to the present generation of Polish politicians. Often living in small towns and depressed industrial areas they want a quick, painless way out of Poland's deep and painful economic trough. For such people Mr Tyminski offers opposition to the government's wage restraint - 'wage controls are very ugly with 300 per cent inflation', he says. 'The government should have stopped printing money and making unfavourable trade deals with the Russians. They should open the books of state enterprises and publish a profit and loss account for each one.' He promises 'my party will create the conditions for growth. We'll take an inventory of state assets, change the accounting laws, abolish the popiwek wages tax and change the tax system. Everyone will pay 50 per cent of his income in tax, but will earn much more money. Poles think 50-50 is fair,' he says. Few, if any, of his ideas, stand up to conventional economic analysis. But they sound good enough to millions of Poles for whom the rapid transition from rags to riches, personified by Mr Tyminski's own modest fortune and exotic past, is infinitely more appealing than the hard grind promised by the new post-communist establishment. For Stan Tyminski read Walter Mitty.</p>

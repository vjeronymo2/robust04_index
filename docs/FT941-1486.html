			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Brussels launches fraud hotline Organised crime is to blame for a 50 per cent increase to Ecu394m (Pounds 297m) in reported fraud against the European Union budget last year, the Commission said yesterday. Criminals were exploiting the dismantling of internal borders in the single European market to carry out ever more sophisticated fraud, said Mr Peter Schmidhuber, budget commissioner. The German commissioner responded yesterday with a fresh anti-fraud offensive, including a free-phone service aimed at encouraging informers to tip off Brussels. Most cases of fraud occurred in the Ecu35bn a year Common Agricultural Policy budget which offers generous price supports, export subsidies and refunds to Europe's farmers. In one typical instance, French and Italian criminals bought refined sugar in Rotterdam claiming it was bound for Croatia and Slovenia. But the cargo was diverted secretly to Italy, via Belgium, Luxembourg and France, possibly for sweetening wine. The estimated fraud was Ecu1.6m, the net effect of the effort to circumvent the mandatory compensatory levy for placing sugar on the EU market. Mr Schmidhuber said it was impossible to calculate precisely how much money was being lost as a result of fraud because the Commmission relied on cases being reported by member states. But he admitted: 'The amount of fraud is obviously far higher than we have detected.' The Commission's new fraud action plan includes more use of computers, remote sensing to track phantom olive groves, and a plan for a free-phone service in each EU country so that the public can report frauds to the Commission's fraud task force. 'I know we won't only get serious calls. There is the risk of crank calls and pranksters, but we still think it is worthwhile taking that risk,' he said. Mr Schmidhuber said the Commission was also examining whether to set up an informers' fund and a blacklist of companies and individuals caught engaging in fraud. But both were fraught with legal difficulties.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Observer: Golden boys The London gold market, where just five firms fix the price every day, is an incestuous place, even by City standards. Hence a frisson of excitement at the admission of two new boys to the club in the space of a week. The mighty Deutsche Bank is now the proud owner of Sharps Pixley, and Edmond Safra's Republic National Bank of New York swallowed Mase Westpac, the remnants of the old Johnson Matthey Bankers. Both parents are big gold traders in their own right, but had hitherto lacked the cachet of membership of the club which has fixed prices since 1919. New arrivals at exclusive gatherings should know how to behave. No surprise, then, to see Keith Smith, former boss of London's oldest bullion firm, Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, leave retirement to take over as non-executive chairman of Republic's new operation, Republic Mase Bank. Smith caught the gold bug in the 1950's, when he started working for Edward E Mocatta. Republic Mase's managing director, Dick Gazmararian, used to work for him, and Edmond Safra, one of the world's canniest private bankers, has been a friend for over 30 years. Indeed, it was Safra who persuaded Smith to take on the new job.</p>

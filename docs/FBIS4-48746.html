			<p>BFN     [Text] Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha has  told the Southern African Development Community, SADC,  conference in Maseru that southern African countries must  develop a common petroleum policy. He said that increased  economic development in the region would enhance the role of  petroleum in the economies of the region.    An important debate was taking place in South Africa on the  appropriate level of government involvement in the petroleum  industry.    Regarding cooperation between South Africa and SADC  countries, Mr. Botha said that South Africa had much to learn  from these countries, particularly in respect to small-scale  mining. He said small-scale mining was underdeveloped in South  Africa.</p>

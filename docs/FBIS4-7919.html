			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 7 (BTA) -- "Parliament Dooms Free  Speech to Bust" (DEMOKRATSIYA); "MP's Axe Free Speech" (DUMA);  "MP's Butcher Newspapers" (24 CHASA); "Secret Ballot Slaps  Speech in the Face" (STANDART NEWS): These and similar  headlines cap front-page comments in all dailies on yesterday's  vote by which parliament defeated two bills amending the  value-added tax [VAT], effective as of April 1, 1994. The bill  would have granted relief from the 18 percent flat VAT rate to  the Bulgarian press and fiction and popular science literature  except pornographic publications. At the end of March, the  newspapers ceased to publish for four days in protest of what  they dubbed "the killer tax."    "This is the first time that Parliament has taken a  secret-ballot vote on a bill," writes DUMA. The daily  reproduces yesterday's statement of its editor-in-chief, Mr.  Stefan Prodev MP of the ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP), at parliament's sitting, in which he called on his fellow  parliamentarians to spare Bulgarian newspapers and books. "Only  a few newspapers will survive; most, caught in the death grip of  the tax, will perish. What is the use of a diversity of news  and opinions which the diverse press provides to those who  seriously think themselves to be God's chosen lot? They can  anyway wallow in their own sauce which they will secrete  profusely in their own parties' organs. Which, of course, will  be toeing the party line," runs a comment in STANDART NEWS.    KONTINENT is even more acerbic, describing the 240 MP's as  "politicians manque who in four years contrived to make the  Bulgarian people look back with nostalgia to totalitarianism."  "Now they have set out to tax newspapers out of business, those  same newspapers which seem to be the only ones that dare to put  up their dirty linen in plain view of the nation or rather of  what is left of it," reads a signed comment in KONTINENT.  According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, the only argument advanced by  the opponents of tax relief to the Bulgarian press and books  "was that the tax administration would find it difficult to  collect the tax at a differential rate." "In the imminent  election campaign, however, this decision may prove to be one of  parliament's worst self-defeats," comments the financial and  business daily PARI. 24 CHASA writes that "new bills to repeal  the killer tax will start to be tabled even today." The paper  quotes the sponsors of the defeated bills, Mr. Lyubomir Pavlov  MP of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and Mr. Yuri Borisov  MP of the BSP, as saying that "this time separate amendments  will be moved concerning the newspapers, Bulgarian books, the  Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and press advertisements."</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (6): 'It'll pick up in time' - Property LEEDS is not unique among large British towns and cities, but it is a rarity in one respect. Despite the growth of service industries during the 1980s, it did not enter the recession with a surplus of new office space arising from speculative building, writes Stewart Dalby. Mr Robert Firth of Bernard Thorpe, a leading Leeds estate agent, estimates that if purpose-built properties such as the 400,000 sq ft building for the benefits agency of the Department of Social Security and other pre-let properties are left out of the reckoning, there is about 700,000 sq ft of office or light industrial (B1) space on offer out of a total stock of some 10m sq ft. Much of this, however, is old, second-hand stock for which there would not be a great demand even if there were not a recession. Mr Firth says: 'There is around 150,000 sq ft of new B1-type properties ready for moving into. The take-up of such space in 1991 when recession was well and truly with us was around 200,000 sq ft a year. At the height of activity in the late 1980s the take-up of office space was around 400,000 sq ft a year. You can say there is an underlying shortage of this type of property in Leeds city centre.' In industrial properties - such as B2-type premises for manufacturing industry and B8 for warehousing and storage - the situation is only slightly easier. Mr Michael Haigh of Knight, Frank &amp; Rutley estimates 700,000 to 900,000 sq ft is available for B2 and B8 premises. Much of this is older property. There is about 300,000 sq ft of newer buildings. The situation with industrial property was helped by the arrival in 1988 of the Leeds Development Corporation. Many of the developments it facilitated have been industrial buildings. Specifically, the development corporation has helped build three small industrial estates. Lettings for offices and factories are slow because of the recession. But one result of a lack of surplus in both sectors is that prices have held up. Mr Firth reckons the peak for offices was Pounds 19 a sq ft in 1990. 'Clients are looking for special deals and rent holidays. But for prime sites we are asking and getting Pounds 18 to Pounds 19 a sq ft for letting,' he says. Mr Haigh says: 'The market is quiet but for basic B8 warehousing properties, rents are holding at around Pounds 4 a sq ft.' On the retail side, it seems much the same. Rents have dropped from a peak of Pounds 166 a sq ft for prime zone A rents to about Pounds 140 a sq ft. But there seems to be remarkably few shops to let in the prime areas. The lack of surpluses in the three commercial property market segments is due neither to Yorkshire caution nor because the arithmetic did not make speculative building look attractive to developers. Uncertainty about how the city council wanted Leeds to develop is to blame, according to Mr Ian Barraclough, the regional managing partner for Bernard Thorpe in Leeds. He says: 'In the mid-1980s the sums certainly stacked up for developers. Rents were Pounds 8 for prime properties and this was ample for a good profit. But investors were unclear where to develop. 'The inner core - a half square mile of offices - had been largely developed, although renovations and refurbishments continued to come up. The council wanted to keep the area immediately to the east of the inner core for shopping. 'To the immediate north was the university, the hospitals and the administrative area. The council decided new developments should be to the west around the central station. Two large sites, one of 8.5 acres and another of six acres were earmarked.' On one of these, Coopers &amp; Lybrand last year agreed to take 70,000 sq ft of space in a Postel scheme in Wellington Street. This was considered a great coup for Leeds. However, 1987 saw the introduction of what Mr Barraclough calls the Use Classes Order which brought in the business class (B1) property classification. This meant that properties which could once only be used as factories could be employed for a variety of purposes including offices. In 1988, the Leeds Development Corporation was established with a remit to develop a large area to the south of the city centre. The effect of these two events was to switch the emphasis away from the west, around the station, towards the south of the city centre on both banks of the River Aire. There has since been considerable development there, including a new headquarters for KPMG Peat Marwick, Asda's headquarters and computer centre, as well as a new hotel and restaurants. Mr Barraclough says: 'Developers are holding off at the moment, but a lot of land is available. There is probably room for another 1m sq ft of properties along the river banks. The area around the station will pick up in time.' Another project is the proposed development of a large-scale out-of-town business park. Curiously for a big city such as Leeds which has expanded in recent years, it has only two small industrial estates. These are Lawns Wood and the Arlington Business Park. They amount to less than 18 acres between them. A new road linking the A1 with the M1 near the city will pass by a site of about 200 acres which has been earmarked for development. While much will be for housing, there could be 70 acres of commercial development. GMI Rovinian, a local developer, has an option to develop the commercial land. Mr David Pollock, a partner in GMI, says: 'Now that the A1-M1 link is definitely going ahead, the business park will almost certainly happen - within the next 10 years.'</p>

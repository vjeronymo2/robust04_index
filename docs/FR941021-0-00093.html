The intended effect is to protect king and Spanish mackerel from overfishing and continue stock rebuilding programs while still allowing catches by important recreational and commercial fisheries dependent on king and Spanish mackerel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  November 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mark F.

The FMP was prepared jointly by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 642.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the framework procedure of the FMP, the Councils recommended, and NMFS published, a proposed rule to change certain management measures applicable to the Atlantic groups of king and Spanish mackerel and Gulf group king mackerel (59 FR 40509, August 9, 1994). That proposed rule (1) described the FMP framework procedures through which the Councils recommended the changes, (2) specified the recommended changes, and (3) described the need and rationale for the recommended changes. Those descriptions are not repeated here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received on the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Partial Disapproval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, concurs that the Councils' recommendations are necessary to protect the stocks and prevent overfishing and that they are consistent with the objectives of the FMP, the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law, except for one of the recommendations. For the Florida west coast sub-zone, the Councils recommended a reduction in the daily trip limits for king mackerel, applicable to fishing with run-around gillnets, when 90 percent of the quota is reached. The trip limits were to be reduced from 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) to 15,000 lb (6,804 kg). NMFS finds that a reduction of the trip limits at that time would be impractical because the remaining 10 percent of the quota (43,250 lb (19,618 kg)) could be exceeded by the trip-limit landings of three vessels. If a substantial number of the 15 vessels expected to be in the gillnet fishery in that sub-zone were to make one trip under the reduced trip limits, the quota would be significantly exceeded before the fishery could be closed. A measure that increases the likelihood of a quota overrun would be inconsistent with national standard 1, which requires that management measures prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes from the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons described above, the specification of reduced trip limits applicable to king mackerel harvested by run-around gillnets in the Florida west coast sub-zone is removed and references to the removed paragraph are corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

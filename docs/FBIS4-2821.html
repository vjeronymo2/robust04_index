			<p>BFN     [By reporter Zhang Jiaxiang (1728 0502 4382)]    [Text] Hanoi, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- This afternoon, Vietnam's  National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh met here with a  delegation of China's National People's Congress [NPC] Financial  and Economic Committee headed by its vice chairman, Zeng  Xianlin, at the Government Guest House. Both sides held talks  in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.    Nong Duc Manh said that Vietnam and China are joined by  mountains and rivers and that the two peoples enjoy a  long-established traditional friendly relationship. The two  countries have sent many delegations to visit each other since  the normalization of relations between the two parties and two  countries. This helped promote the bilateral relationship and  heralded a new stage in bilateral relations.    Nong Duc Manh said: "My recent goodwill visit to China at  the head of a Vietnam National Assembly delegation was a  success. We saw with our own eyes the Chinese people's great  achievements that were brought by adherence to the policy of  reform and opening up under the CPC's leadership. A rosy  picture of development prospects is now spread before the  Vietnamese and Chinese peoples."    PRC Ambassador to Vietnam Zhang Qing was present at the  meeting.    China's NPC Financial and Economic Committee delegation  arrived in Hanoi on 9 April. The delegation held talks with  Vietnam's National Assembly Economic and Financial Budget  Committee delegation and visited the Vietnamese Finance  Ministry, Trade Ministry, and State Cooperation and Investment  Committee.    The Chinese delegation will also visit Ha Bac, Quang  Tri-Hue,  Quang Nam-Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City. The delegation will  conclude its Vietnam visit on 20 April and depart for home from  Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Slovak currency setback: Czech trade surplus forces effective devaluation The Czech and Slovak republics have re-adjusted their currencies under their Ecu-based clearing agreement, leading to an effective 8 per cent devaluation of the Slovak crown against the Czech currency for trade between the two countries. The adjustment does not affect the value of the two crowns against other currencies but the change is important for domestic and international companies operating in both halves of the now divided former Czechoslovakia. Over the first nine months of the year Czech exports to Slovakia were CzK54.37bn (Pounds 1.2bn) while Slovakia exported goods worth CzK47.54bn to the Czech republic. The change was made necessary by the rise in the Czech Republic's surplus in the clearing balance to Ecu110m (Pounds 83.8m), close to an agreed limit of Ecu130m, Mr Martin Svehla, spokesman for the Czech national bank said yesterday. In practice it means the Slovak crown, which was devalued by 10 per cent against all currencies in July, has lost 18 per cent of its value against the Czech crown since the start of the year. The move is expected to slow Czech exports to Slovakia and boost Slovak exports to the Czech Republic. The Slovak state secretary of privatisation, Mr Ivan Lexa, has been charged with defaming the presidency, a government official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bratislava. Mr Lexa, an ally of the prime minister, Mr Vladimir Meciar, suggested in November that aides close to the president were involved in illicit business, said Mr Jaroslav Ivor, an interior ministry official. Mr Lexa could face two years in prison for the remarks.</p>

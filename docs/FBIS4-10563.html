			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patricio Peralta Zavando] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, with but a few days left to completion of  its term, and after more than a year of processing in Congress,  Patricio Aylwin's government promulgated the Capital Market Law.  It is one of the Aylwin government's most economically important  pieces of legislation and a far-reaching modernization of the  financial system. The law will become effective with its  publication in the DIARIO OFFICIAL on 16 March.    The bill, which has now become a Law of the Republic,  fundamentally modifies the current Securities Market, Pension  Funds, Investment Funds, Mutual Funds, and Insurance Companies  laws. The bill, it will be recalled, gave rise to intense  debates in Congress, and prolonged negotiations between the  government's Congressional supporters and members of the  opposition, which finally culminated in a political agreement  that enabled its enactment.    The new law embodies a number of instruments designed to  diversify investment options, and opens investment possibilities  abroad for pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds.  To balance the greater liberalization, the law introduces  regulations that seek to prevent conflicts of interest and shady  practices in the stock market. It also categorizes crimes and  stipulates sanctions.  <H5>  Foxley </H5>   In the promulgation ceremony held yesterday at the  Government  House, the minister of finance, Alejandro Foxley, said that  "this reform will have a favorable impact on the efficiency of  the savings and investments process, the size and security of  the pensions the workers will receive in the future, and the  openness and strength with which the capital markets will  operate in our country."    According to the minister, this reform represents an overall  effort to revise and update the legislation relative to the  securities market and institutional investors, especially the  pension funds.    With reference to the fundamental objectives of the reform,  Foxley stated that it seeks "to develop mechanisms that enhance  opportunities for financing investments in production,  infrastructure, and housing." He said that this effort can be  expected to have a positive effect on the country's long-term  growth rate, and to reduce the Chilean economy's vulnerability  to external factors, in that, "financing of the productive  investment process will be able to depend to a greater extent on  our national savings resources."    The law is also aimed at enhancing the diversification of  pension fund investments by increasing their returns and  security. And lastly, it seeks to substantially improve the  openness of capital market operations and reduce conflicts of  interest so as to increase confidence in the equitable  functioning of this market.  <H5>  Pension Funds </H5>   Foxley pointed out that the most important feature of  Pension  Fund Law 3.500 is the capability it provides for pension funds  to invest in new instruments, including refunding bonds, project  financing bonds, securitization bonds, low-liquidity stocks, new  foreign equity issues, and funds for the financing of  development.    He added that the modification of investment limits enables  greater diversification in the pension fund's investment  portfolio, expanding the opportunities for investment of funds,  and reducing the pension fund's risk. In this regard, he pointed  out that the easing and greater diversification of pension fund  investments in bonds and other securities is accompanied by a  set of regulations on conflicts of interest that could arise  between the administering entity and the fund itself. Added to  this are the regulations that govern the voting by pension fund  administrators in corporations in which they hold shares. They  stipulate that the administrators must vote for directors who  are independent of the groups controlling the corporation.  <H5>  Securities Market </H5>   The finance minister stated that one of the most important  objectives of Capital Market Law 18.045 is to buttress the  private-sector's rating of risk. "Knowledge alone of the  regulations on the rating of risk, contained in the law on  securities, has generated a rapid consolidation and  internationalization of the industry of risk rating," he said,  adding that for the development of a debt-securities-intensive  market, the development of a solid, independent, highly  respected risk-rating industry is essential.    He emphasized that the establishing of new norms and  mechanisms regulating the use of insider information, including  criminal sanctions and the addressing of conflicts of interest,  especially in the case of administrators of the funds of third  parties, will enhance the openness of the securities market.</p>

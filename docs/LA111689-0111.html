			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH AGONIZES OVER WAY TO SAVE HARRIMAN JONES CLINIC FROM DEMOLITION;  </P> <P> PRESERVATION: MEMBERS OF THE CULTURAL HERITAGE COMMISSION FEAR THAT IF  DEVELOPERS ARE FRIGHTENED OFF, THE STRUCTURE WILL BE DESTROYED ANYWAY.  </P> <P> The old Harriman Jones Clinic, where some say half of Long Beach's residents  were born, remains caught between the developer's wrecking ball and  preservation while city officials search for alternatives to a plan that would  turn the landmark into condominiums.  </P> <P> Amid protests from preservation-minded residents, the Planning Commission last  week delayed efforts to destroy virtually all but the facade of the 1930  Italian Renaissance-style building, including the homey waiting room where  fathers paced by a fireplace while awaiting the birth of their babies.  </P> <P> The proposal is now in the hands of the Cultural Heritage Commission, which  could accept the idea of sacrificing most of the building to save some of it or  insist that it remain intact, according to the city's historic preservation  officer, Ruthann Lehrer.  </P> <P> The 15-member commission is already divided on whether to hold out for total  preservation, a gamble that could scare off developers entirely and ultimately  force demolition of the entire building at 211 Cherry Ave., members warned.  </P> <P> "If you take a hard-nose position, you could risk losing everything," Lehrer  said. "Everyone looks at the fate of the Pacific Coast Club and says,  'Anything, but that.' "  </P> <P> The city learned a hard lesson from the Pacific Coast Club and the Jergins  Trust Building, both of which were razed during attempts to save them. The  sites remain undeveloped holes in the ground to this day.  </P> <P> The city is trying to work with Terry/Nikols Development Co. on a compromise  for the Harriman Jones Clinic, which costs thousands of dollars a month to  maintain while standing empty.  </P> <P> The plan to save the facade emerged as a compromise that seemed to please no  one. It was agreed upon because, in Lehrer's words, "half a loaf is better than  none."  </P> <P> Then residents turned out in ranks at last week's Planning Commission meeting  to protest compromise of any kind, complaining the new building would be too  tall, the architecture too cheap and the attempt to preserve history too  compromising.  </P> <P> "We have grieved over the loss of the Pacific Coast Club and anguished over the  obliteration of the Jergins Trust Building," resident Rae La Force, who led the  effort to save the clinic, told planning commissioners. "As long as the  Harriman Jones building is still standing, a solution is yet possible. . . .  Just say 'No!' to demolition."  </P> <P> The matter is due back before the Planning Commission on Dec. 28.  </P></p>

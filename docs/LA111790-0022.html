			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS : CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE;  </P> <P> LIGHTING UPGRADED FOR SECURITY  </P> <P> In response to concerns about security, lighting in hallways, restrooms and  other areas is being upgraded at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> College officials also have given the California State University chancellor's  office proposals for additional outdoor lighting.  </P> <P> Proposals for better lighting were submitted by CSUN's Commission on the Status  of Women, which has long urged that lighting be improved for safety reasons.  </P> <P> As a result, the chancellor's office appropriated $21,000 to upgrade lighting  in hallways, restrooms and other areas, said Maralyn Parker, a commission staff  chairwoman and senior secretary for the university's School of the Arts.  </P> <P> "Another $88,000 has been requested for the continuation of this project, as  well as another $121,000 to retrofit, or change, existing exterior lighting  fixtures," Parker said.  </P> <P> Bill Chatham, CSUN's director of facilities planning and operations, said the  Cal State University system provides money for minor projects to improve health  and safety on campus.  </P> <P> Campus growth created a need for more lighting at the same time the university  system required reduced consumption of electricity, Chatham said. New lighting  technology made the commission's proposals feasible.  </P> <P> Commission members, accompanied by Dick Hostetler, director of the lighting  project for CSUN's department of physical plant management, walked the campus  Wednesday to identify areas where lighting, access and vegetation might pose  safety risks at night.  </P> <P> "We are very pleased with the improvements that have been made so far," Parker  said.  </P> <P> Hostetler said the lighting project is the fifth "minor capital outlay" program  designed to improve campus security that he has been involved with over the  last five years.

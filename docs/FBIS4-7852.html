			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Perica Vucinic: "The Kosovo Academy of the Deaf"] </F>   [Text] The most recent Serbian-Albanian ambiguity in  Kosovo: On Wednesday, 23 February, the authorities shut down for  good the Kosovo Academy of Sciences and Arts [KANU] and moved in  the association of the deaf. This act was interpreted on the  Albanian side as "yet another repressive act of the authorities,  a smothering of the right to authentic culture," while the  Serbian authorities saw it as a manifestation of the  law-governed state, that is, implementation of the decision  under which the KANU is a branch of the SANU [Serbian Academy of  Sciences and Arts] and under which the title of member of the  academy is obtained by the standards of the parent academy in  Belgrade. If the dispute between the directly opposed sides is  viewed from outside, this creation of an "academy of the deaf"  seems like cynicism.    Life in Kosovo, however, does not take place between those  two signs. It is in them. Albanian life, which is manifested  above all in education, the socialization of one's own life,  sports, and business, and Serbian life--personified in  administrative authority, the police, financial oversight  agencies, and the economy, which is mainly in the socialized  sector and dead. The stories about the "divided corso in  Pristina" are old and pathetic. The Serbs and Albanians  promenade in their own sections of the city--the former in the  center, the latter in Capi (in Serbian--Neck). What they have in  common is garbage, which seems surreal, there is so much of it.  And no one is collecting it.    Operating in parallel, the self-proclaimed Albanian Republic  of Kosovo (recognized only by the state of Albania) and the  Republic of Serbia give the appearance that they are functioning  and are legitimate, and, one would say, they are making an  effort to preserve those illusions. In order to protect their  proclaimed exclusive sovereignty on this territory, the Serbian  authorities have not terminated the fiscal policy of the  republic of Albanians, which requires every Albanian private  operator to pay into the budget 5 to 10 percent of his net  income, but by way of sovereignty it also collects the tax. In  the Sami Fraseri High School, teachers are not sure whether  their work is legal or illegal, and the same dilemma seems to be  bothering the police, who 100 meters away from the school watch  the river of children returning from school.  <H5>  The Law-Governed State </H5>   "The law-governed state is functioning, Kosovo is  increasingly stable, public peace and order are better than at  any time up to now, anarchy has been averted," says Dr. Milos  Simovic, president of Kosovo Okrug. At the same time, he also  says that "the Albanians are boycotting the entire system" and  that "they are internationalizing every problem they have."    "The Albanians have conquered Kosovo and Metohija [Kosmet]  economically. Time is on their side, and we are happy that there  is no shooting here, that we can say that Kosmet is an integral  part of Serbia," says Tomislav Sekulic, people's deputy and one  of the most distinguished Kosovo Serbs, who is dissatisfied.    Typically for Kosovo Serbs, both Dr. Simovic and Sekulic  would say that Kosovo is not lost, but what every Serb shrinks  from is Albanian capital, which, again "typically for their  nationality," they estimate at 95 percent. "We had an economy in  our hands and we gambled it away," Sekulic says. "Trepca is not  operating, it has turned out that it could operate in the hands  of the English before the war, in the hands of the Germans  during the war, in the hands of the Albanians after the war, but  for all practical purposes it was shut down by the Serbs. In  actuality, incompetent Serbs."    Since a state of emergency was declared by the Republic of  Serbia, economic facilities in Kosovo have died. Trepca was  producing 100,000 metric tons of lead in ingots, 40,000 tons of  electrolytic zinc, about 100 tons of silver, 30 tons of bismuth  and cadmium.... Depending on the situation on the London  Exchange, it was earning between $100 and $150 million a year.    The economy and the infrastructure, in which, according to  Sekulic, nearly $10 billion were invested between 1965 and 1990,  are going to ruin. Kosovo abounds in fenced-off lots in which  there are only watchmen for the construction cranes which do not  operate, structures that look like empty stables.... "When what  was needed was intelligence, the profiteering spirit was  operative," says Sekulic, who sees the devastated Serbian  government-owned economy as a victim of private appetites, which  are gnawing it away.    In the process of ownership transformation in more than 100  of the largest Serbian enterprises in Kosovo over the last three  years, the Fund for Development of Serbia, without any  additional investment, has transferred the majority share of  public capital to the fund or related firms in Serbia, and in  all the transformations the fund or firms have become majority  owners. And in a meeting of the fund held in Pristina last  November, it was concluded that "the technological level of  installed capacity in Kosovo exceeds the quality of equipment of  firms in Serbia and exceeds the needs of the Kosovo economy." In  that meeting, there was an initiative to "move" the  technological equipment from Kosovo to a "defined space." Since  control over Kosovo's economy was taken over, more than 100,000  workers of Albanian nationality have been discharged from the  government sector on various grounds, according to Albanian  estimates. Which is why the Albanians are not so careful as  Sekulic in separating the honest from the dishonest Serbian  government- appointed enterprise directors. They are more  inclined to say: "See how the Serbs are running the economy!"    The private sector in Kosovo--about 10,000 firms--is mainly  in the hands of Albanian citizens. According to unofficial, but  competent sources, last year that sector possessed 8.33 percent  of the total capital committed in the Kosovo economy and  produced about 30 percent of the total gross product and  realized about 45 percent of the total earnings of the Kosovo  economy.    In none of these figures do we see the one about 95 percent  of the capital being Albanian; however, workers abroad have been  contributing to overall Albanian wealth. Depending on tactical  political needs, the number of Albanians living and working  abroad varies in political statements between 250,000 and  500,000. According to Naif Zeka, Ibrahim Rugova's adviser for  the economy, with the 3-percent linear tax which these workers  pay the so-called Republic of Kosovo, they are furnishing 35  percent of budget revenues. Aside from the budget, they are  supporting or helping members of their household who have  remained in Kosovo. Naif Zeka says that 22,000 families have  been receiving regular social assistance and 36,000 occasional  assistance. Nevertheless, most of the money is going to the  schools. According to the figures of Dr. Dzavid Ahmeti, Dr.  Rugova's adviser for education, the parallel Albanian-language  educational process involves 274,000 elementary children, 64,000  high school students, and 16,000 university students studying  under about 20,000 teachers.  <H5>  Settlement </H5>   The financial superiority of the Albanians is offered to the  "naked eye" in the form of luxury cars, elegant restaurants,  exclusive shops, and white satellite antennas which irritate the  Serbs as they were once irritated by the traditional white  Albanian skullcap. They say that they were installed to receive  the satellite broadcasting from Albania. And probably that was  the motive for buying the antennas, but aside from two hours of  Albanian programming, the Kosovo Albanian is offered another  dozen West European channels, whose influence is noticeable in  the school, on the street, and probably in the home.    Demographic growth is the other fear of the Kosovo Serbs.  The  estimates of both Serbian and Albanian demographers, which are  that in 50 to 60 years the two nationalities will be numerically  equal in the Republic of Serbia--encourage the one and frighten  the other. That is why the topic "settlement of Kosovo" is the  most frequent one among Serbs.    The Serbian national bloc is seeking a solution by speeding  up settlement and financial incentives for returnees. In the  Statistical Bureau in Pristina, we were not able to get a figure  on migration, because the bureau no longer has jurisdiction over  that. The last figure on the number of those moving in and  moving out was recorded by Jedinstvo of Pristina at the end of  the first quarter of last year. "Incoming" was one (1) greater  than "outgoing."    Dragan Icic, president of the Association for Settlement of  Kosmet, is announcing a rally for collective settlement.  "Immense money has been spent to build 184 housing units for  returnees, but there are neither the housing units nor the  returnees," Icic says angrily, adding that the closest relatives  and friends of "the powers that be in Kosovo" have moved into  those housing units.    The president of the association says that the demonstrators  at their rally will seek accountability for many things. Among  them, who sold to the Albanians the housing units that were  purchased and who does not like the program for settlement of  Kosovo and why?    At the entrance to Pec from the direction of Decani, a lad  has slung a semiautomatic on his back. In his hands are a duffle  bag and boots. He obviously has just been issued that equipment.  From the way in which he wears it--nonchalantly--in the  overflowing suburb, he obviously believes that he has found the  right weapon against the Albanian demographic bomb.    However, Ismailj Redzepi, member of the Presidium of the  Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, does not believe in the  demographic forecast most frequently presented. "The Albanians  are moving in other directions, and the demographic growth is  settling down, but demography is a good thing for short-term  political manipulation," he says.    "The thesis about a demographic intersection of Serbs and  Albanians in Serbia in the near future is mentioned in every  connection, but I would say that false conclusions are being  drawn from false premises, because no one knows for certain how  many Albanians there are in Serbia," is the opinion of Dr.  Dragisa Velickovic, professor of the theory of economic  development in Pristina. On the basis of the drastic difference  between the 1961 Census and the later ones in 1971 and 1981, he  doubts the validity of the latter. He considers it a mistake to  project the growth of the Albanian population at present rates,  because, he says, "the Albanian population is just ending the  transition phase, and in 10 years at the latest that population  will have a growth rate between 1 and 1.5 percent." Velickovic  explains his forecast in terms of the Europeanization of the  former communist oligarchy, which has become an entrepreneurial  oligarchy, and the desire of young Albanians employed abroad to  become entrepreneurs; previously, they invested their capital to  build large houses for communal living, but now they invest in  private business. Dr. Velickovic goes on to say that the space  of Kosovo-Metohija is overpopulated, and more striking than the  demographic figures is his datum that the streams which Kosovo  possesses allow it to "maintain" two and a half million people  at the most.    No one has as yet made public the "frustrations over water  supply." Aside from the Albanian superiority in money and  population, the Serbs are also disturbed by the military power  of the West, which they fear might help the Albanians, and the  Albanians are disturbed by the Serbian military power. Azem  Vlasi, former politician, who is now a lawyer, says that the  logic of force is the only logic of Slobodan Milosevic, and he  is disturbed not so much by that logic as the fact that the  "president who arrested him" is unable to govern without  problems. In the Serbian political bloc, no one believes in war  as a solution.    Dr. Simovic, who heads the okrug, finds the reason for this  in the fact that the Serbs and Albanians have never waged war  directly with one another and the fact that the latter would  never dare to destroy their population and capital. This way of  thinking is typical of the Serbs. "Last year, I issued them 130  permits to open gasoline stations. These are all facilities  worth between 250,000 and several million marks, and when  someone opens one, he certainly is not preparing for war," says  Milan Jocic, director of the Provincial Fund for Water Resources.    The Serbs do not think that they could be the ones to blame  for war, nor do they believe that the Albanians would start it.  The latter, meanwhile, think that after Croatia and Bosnia and  in the international situation, which is not inclined toward  Serbia in the least, it has had enough of war-making  adventurism. However, the two sides have not found a way to  communicate even that little bit to each other officially and  publicly. There is no dialogue, as if this were a curse of the  newly opened "academy for the deaf." In the meantime, two  national councils, both of them closed, are continuing to live  alongside one another, and they cannot agree even to collect the  garbage.</p>

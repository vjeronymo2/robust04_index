			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lords reject random breath tests THE PARLIAMENTARY campaign in favour of random breath testing to help cut down on drink-driving suffered a setback yesterday when the House of Lords rejected an amendment which would have introduced the new arrangements, Alison Smith writes. Instead, in a debate on the first day of the committee stage of the road traffic bill, a majority of peers supported the government and voted against the change by 87 to 41, a margin of 46. The government has consistently said that the problem can be adequately dealt with through the combination of the existing powers of the police both to stop drivers for a wide range of motoring offences, and to administer breath tests where they had reason to believe the driver was under the influence of alcohol. The change was proposed by Lord Clinton-Davis, an opposition transport spokesman, who argued that it would provide an additional, effective deterrent to drink-driving offences.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / TV revenue shows first signs of upturn THE FIRST real growth in television advertising revenue for four years is forecast for this year, with estimates of figures for September showing a particularly healthy in-crease. Growth in television is seen as a leading indicator of a more general recovery in advertising, which in turn reflects increased business confidence. The figures will raise the hopes of newspapers, magazines and other advertising media. September figures for the main commercial channels, ITV and Channel 4, are likely to show net revenue of Pounds 162m, an increase of more than 11 per cent on September 1992, says CIA, the independent advertising media buyer. For 1993 as a whole the group forecasts net revenue of Pounds 1.8bn - up 7 per cent on last year. Mr Graeme Hutton, CIA's planning director, said TV revenue had been 'flat as a pancake' for the past four years when inflation was taken into account. September's figures will be 'much higher than we anticipated', he added. Zenith Media, the largest buyer of television advertising airtime, has increased its forecast of advertising growth in all media for 1993 from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent, and television advertising revenue is expected to rise from 2.9 per cent to 3.4 per cent. Zenith's figures are for real growth, with inflation stripped out. Mr Frank Harrison, Zenith's media research director, said 'there is no doubt we're out of the recession. Revenues have been up consecutively for most of this year.' This growing optimism is shared by advertising agencies. National Economic Research Associates, an economic consultancy, conducts a monthly survey of about 30 top agencies on the prospect of television advertising. In August, for the eighth month in succession, agencies reported to the consultancy that expectations were 'above normal for the time of year'. Register-Meal, a survey organisation, reported that particularly strong areas of television advertising growth for the first half of this year included motoring, cosmetics and toiletries, travel, and financial services. Sectors that declined included drinks and confectionery. Other media lag behind television, explained Mr Hutton, because in uncertain times advertisers like to plan in the short term. It is possible to place an advertisement on television at very short notice, while advertising in monthly magazines requires longer-term planning. Because of the way the market works, television indicates the level of increased interest from advertisers more accurately than other media, he said. Television has 'an almost infinite capacity to soak up revenue', because potential advertisers outbid each other for airtime. In contrast, a newspaper is able to supply only a limited number of extra pages at short notice to satisfy demand, he said.</p>

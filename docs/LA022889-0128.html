			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: LANDRY BIDS DALLAS COWBOYS A TEARFUL FAREWELL  </P> <P> Tom Landry said Monday that saying goodby to the Dallas Cowboys was one of the  most difficult things he has ever had to do.  </P> <P> Landry, who spent 29 years as the Cowboys' coach, choked up and couldn't finish  his speech in a lecture hall.  </P> <P> "It was hard to keep your emotions under control," said a red-eyed Landry. "I  tried to tell (the players) that this crisis will pass, that you have to keep  moving forward."  </P> <P> New owner Jerry Jones removed Landry as coach Saturday, naming University of  Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson as his replacement.  </P> <P> "There wasn't a dry eye in the room," said Dallas linebacker Eugene Lockhart of  Landry's farewell speech. "Coach told us he loves us all and, although he  couldn't be with us in person from now on, he would be with us in spirit."  </P> <P> Quarterback Danny White observed that it was difficult to see Landry in a  situation he couldn't handle, adding, "It's something I'll never forget. It may  have lasted only five minutes but time stood still, believe me."  </P> <P> Landry said he didn't ever want to coach again. Nor does he want to get into  politics. He had one year left on his contract and is owed approximately  $800,000.  </P> <P> "I can't stay inactive, so I will have to do something," Landry said.  </P></p>

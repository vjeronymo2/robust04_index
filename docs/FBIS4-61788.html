			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Second Reading of Citizenship </F> Law Expected in Mid-May"]    [Text] Riga, 22 Apr -- Apparently, the second reading of  the draft law on citizenship will take place on 12 or 19 May,  when the plenary sessions of the Saeima [parliament] are  scheduled. The working group established by Latvia's Way has  prepared the draft, which is to be discussed by the Judicial  Commission next week.    In accordance with the draft, the naturalization of  noncitizens would begin on 1 January 1996. In the case of  noncitizens who are entitled by this law to preferential  treatment, it would be possible for them to apply from the  moment the law becomes effective.    As DIENA was told by Aivars Endzins, chairman of Saeima  Judicial Commission, the naturalization of noncitizens would be  carried out in a set period of time and order of events, which  will state which categories of people and in what order they  will have the right to apply for citizenship. In the draft,  prepared for the second reading, Latvia's Way has abandoned the  primary principle of naturalization quotas, and due to the  recommendations of experts from the European Council, they are  now arranged in a precise order.    Beginning on 1 January 1996, noncitizens, who were born in  Latvia and are between 16 and 23 years of age, would be able to  apply for citizenship. The draft law foresees a five-year  period for obtaining citizenship; at the beginning of 1996, this  period will be completed, so it will be possible to begin  naturalization. After that, beginning on 1 January 1997, the  next group of noncitizens, those who were born in Latvia but are  older than 23, will be addressed. In 1998 -- people who arrived  in Latvia as infants.    According to the draft law, all other people wishing to  obtain Latvian citizenship would be able to apply beginning in  the year 2000.    The draft law foresees preferential treatment for people who  are permanent residents in Latvia, whose relatives are of  second- generation Latvian or Liiv origin, and their spouses, as  well as for people who have legally arrived to Latvia before  1940, people who were brought to Latvia by force during the  German occupation and their descendants, and spouses of Latvian  citizens. As A. Endzins explained, these people can submit  naturalization applications as soon as the law becomes  effective. The naturalization of this category of individuals  could be finished before the next round of Saeima elections,  therefore these people will be eligible to vote by that time.    The draft law on citizenship foresees that Latvian  citizenship can be obtained by so-called Russian Latvians, whose  ancestors were living in Latvia before 1 August 1914, and who  now permanently reside in Latvia.    The draft also states that retired Russian military  personnel  and their family members cannot apply for Latvian citizenship,  except in cases where they have were born or mobilized in  Latvia, but even then the naturalization process takes place in  due course, according to the obligations fixed by the law --  knowledge of the Latvian language, Latvian history, and the  Latvian Constitution, as well as loyalty and the number of years  [of residency] defined by the law.    Regarding military pensioners as well as other foreigners  and  stateless individuals, their status should be defined by the law  on foreigners and stateless people, which should be adopted in  concert with the citizenship law, stated Judicial Commission  Chairman A. Endzins. The Juridical Commission is currently  drafting the said law for its first reading, on the basis of  drafts submitted by Latvia's Way and the Concord for Latvia. In  addition, the Latvian National Independence Movement and  "Fatherland and Freedom" have submitted their own draft laws on  foreigners and stateless people.</p>

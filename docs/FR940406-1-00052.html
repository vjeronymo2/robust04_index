			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) There are future year production requirements for substantial quantities of like items; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The items being acquired have a history of increasing costs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The work is sufficiently defined to permit an effective analysis and major changes are unlikely; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Sufficient time is available to plan and conduct the should-cost review adequately; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Personnel with the required skills are available or can be assigned for the duration of the should-cost review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The contracting officer should decide which elements of the contractor's operation have the greatest potential for cost savings and assign the available personnel resources accordingly. While the particular elements to be analyzed are a function of the contract work task, elements such as manufacturing, pricing and accounting, management and organization, and subcontract and vendor management are normally reviewed in a should-cost review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In acquisitions for which a program should-cost review is conducted, a separate program should-cost review team report, prepared in accordance with agency procedures, is required. Field pricing reports are required only to the extent that they contribute to the combined team position. The contracting officer shall consider the findings and recommendations contained in the program should-cost review team report when negotiating the contract price. After completing the negotiation, the contracting officer shall provide the administrative contracting officer (ACO) a report of any identified uneconomical or inefficient practices, together with a report of correction or disposition agreements reached with the contractor. The contracting officer shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) When a program should-cost review is planned, the contracting officer should state this fact in the acquisition plan (see part 7, subpart 7.1) and in the solicitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 15.810&hyph;3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Overhead should-cost review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An overhead should-cost review is used to evaluate indirect costs, such as fringe benefits, shipping and receiving, facilities and equipment, depreciation, plant maintenance and security, taxes, and general and administrative activities. It is normally used to evaluate and negotiate a forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA) with the contractor. When an overhead should-cost review is conducted, a separate audit report is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The following factors should be considered when selecting contractor sites for overhead should-cost reviews: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Dollar amount of Government business; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Level of Government participation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Level of noncompetitive Government contracts; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Volume of proposal activity; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Major system or program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Mergers, acquisitions, takeovers; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Other conditions, e.g., changes in accounting systems, management, or business activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The objective of the overhead should-cost review is to evaluate significant indirect cost elements in-depth, identify inefficient and uneconomical practices, and recommend corrective action. If it is conducted in conjunction with a program should-cost review, a separate overhead should-cost review report is not required. However, the findings and recommendations of the overhead should-cost team, or any separate overhead should-cost review report, shall be provided to the ACO. The ACO should use this information to form the basis for the Government position in negotiating a FPRA with the contractor. The ACO shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8142 Filed 4&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;34&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

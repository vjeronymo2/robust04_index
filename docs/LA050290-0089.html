			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ATTEMPT MADE TO SAVE FOOT PATROLS;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL: THE EFFORT MAY CONTINUE A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND  POLICE CHIEF OVER THE COSTLY PROGRAM.  </P> <P> Heeding warnings that Police Chief Daryl F. Gates would end a popular foot  patrol program in some areas of the city unless he received additional city  funds, two City Council members Tuesday introduced a motion to provide the  $407,000 Gates says he needs.  </P> <P> The additional money, to come from the city's nearly depleted reserve fund,  would enable the Police Department to continue to deploy 60 officers on  overtime at 13 crime hot spots in selected areas of the city through the end of  June.  </P> <P> Other foot patrols in such areas as downtown, Venice and Westwood, which are  not part of the Secured Area Footbeat Program, are funded by the department's  regular budget and are not in danger of being phased out.  </P> <P> The motion, made by Councilman Nate Holden and seconded by Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores, will likely continue the power struggle between the council and  Gates over funding for the popular, though expensive program. The matter is  expected to be considered by the council Tuesday.  </P> <P> "You can't place a dollar figure on the lives of innocent people," Holden said.  "The program has proven to be effective and the City Council has the money.  Let's spend it on a good cause."  </P> <P> Last Friday, the council received conflicting reports from the city  administrative office and the Police Department about the availability of funds  for the program within the police overtime account, which has $4.8 million  remaining for the rest of the fiscal year that ends June 30.  </P> <P> Administrative office staff said the money was available for foot patrols, but  Gates insisted it was already earmarked to keep officers available in patrol  cars, for homicide investigations and court appearances.  </P> <P> A proposal by Flores to provide $500,000 to police from the reserve fund was  rejected in a 7-5 vote, one short of passage.  </P> <P> The council subsequently unanimously approved a proposal by Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee, to provide $93,000  from the general fund and require police to get the remaining $407,000 from the  overtime account.  </P> <P> Following the vote, Gates angrily berated the council for trying to  "micromanage" his department and announced he would phase out most of the foot  patrols due to the lack of funds.  </P> <P> "I don't have the money. I've said it over and over again," Gates told  reporters. "I will deploy the police in this city, and I will deploy them  according to what I have in the way of funds. Some of the foot beats will come  off. There are some we think are important to keep, but most of them will come  off."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Flores acknowledged that the city is facing a major financial  crunch and possible deficits in the coming years, but she said the foot patrols  should remain.  </P> <P> "There's no question we have a shortage of money right now. But we have to get  our priorities straight, and I believe the citizens of Los Angeles feel this is  a priority and it worked. If something works you don't suddenly withdraw it and  say we can't afford it anymore," Flores said.  </P></p>

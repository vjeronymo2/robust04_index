			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / The lure of oil's final frontier: Prospects for foreign investors in the oilfields of the former Soviet Union From the Caspian Sea to Sakhalin Island in Russia's far east, western oil companies are eyeing hungrily the world's last oil and gas frontier. Home to an estimated 40 per cent of the world's remaining unexploited reserves, the oil and gas fields of the republics of the former Soviet Union, are encouraging a queue of potential foreign investors. 'This is one of the last areas of the world where there are huge quantities of oil and gas to be discovered,' says an executive at one oil company. Foreign industry executives are examining the potential for investment. Mr John Wakeham, the UK energy secretary, today winds up a tour to two former Soviet republics where he led a party of British businessmen eager to pursue deals in the energy sector. Such western visitors have found a receptive audience. For Russia and three smaller republics - Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan - foreign capital and expertise is vital to develop their oil fields and secure a valuable source of hard currency. In a typically Soviet paradox, one of Russia's most lucrative industries and its biggest export earner has been run down by decades of under-investment in equipment and by inefficiencies arising from centralised management from Moscow. The result has been a marked decline in the sector. Crude oil output in Russia, which accounts for 80 per cent of production in the former Soviet Union, is expected to fall to 400m tonnes this year from 450m tonnes in 1991, and 505m tonnes in 1990. Exports projected at 100m tonnes this year will be 50 per cent down on last year's level, and half what they were in 1990. Having rid itself of ideological barriers to capitalism, Moscow is now taking steps to encourage the investment in the oil industry which is badly needed to arrest its decline. But the rush by western oil companies into the republics has so far yielded only a few big deals - and they are still on paper. To date, foreign investment in the oil sector is estimated at Dollars 200m - a relatively small figure by the standards of the international oil industry. There are only 20 relatively small oil joint ventures registered in the Russian republic, of which only 16 are operating. Despite the government's efforts, a host of political and legislative obstacles still stand in the way of large-scale investment. First, there is the intractable problem of the instability gripping Russia and other republics as they endeavour to make the transition to a capitalist economy. The Russian government, which started to implement an ambitious programme of market reforms in January, may yet fall. Any benefits it may grant foreign investors may be removed. 'Before they put vast amounts of money into this country, foreign companies are going to need assurances that the environment is stable enough to justify the investment of billions of dollars,' says Mr Byron Ratliff, a Moscow-based oil expert for Price Waterhouse, the management consultancy.' Until the political system is stabilised, the search for high returns and quick paybacks will take precedence over the long-term investments in development that the industry needs. Opportunities provided by the sheer waste of oil - a third is lost through leaky pipes, wasteful refineries, and inefficient factories - means that most investment in the near future will continue to concentrate on small but highly profitable projects. Such projects include replacing pipes and reopening wells which have been closed for lack of spare parts. Problems of uncertainty extend into the legislative arena. The absence of complete taxation legislation, and of precise rules on production-sharing has contributed to the challenge of doing business in Russia's oil industry. The law on mineral rights passed last month filled many gaps by setting out basic rules on ownership of resources and the share-out of royalties between federal, regional and local authorities. But the interpretation of these rules will be problematic as long as conflicts remain between federal and local government. The confusion over where real power lies is vividly illustrated by the squabbles surrounding the awarding of a feasibility study into the huge reserves off Sakhalin Island in the Far East. After long delays due to arguments between federal and local authorities, the contract was awarded to a US-Japanese consortium composed of McDermott, the engineering company, Marathon Oil Company and Japan's Mitsui. But after a protest by the island's governor, Mr Valentin Fyodoconsortium, the Russian government's choice has been referred to parliament, which is expected to produce its views next Monday. The problems arising from disputes about where authority lies apply in many of Russia's oil-rich areas. While Tatarstan, an oil-rich autonomous republic within Russia, plans to hold a referendum on whether to declare independence on March 21, the largest oil-producing region in Russia, Tyumen, does not even pretend to obey Moscow. Local oil barons who run the state-owned enterprises in Tyumen, have boycotted the Russian government's plans to incorporate all producers into a consortium. But despite the many serious problems, it is already possible for foreign oil companies to clinch substantial deals. Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil group, which last month became the first and only company to sign production-sharing deals - enabling it to develop oil fields without the participation of a local partner - is in many ways a model of success. It appears to have obtained the best of both worlds, as rival companies will privately admit. Elf plans to spend between Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m on exploration costs in each of its two deals - based respectively in Kazakhstan's Aktiubinsk area and the Saratov-Volgograd region in Russia. If exploration at these sites goes well over the next few years, Elf plans to invest heavily in production. 'Either you sit back and wait until everything is perfect, or you start playing. We chose not to wait,' said the Elf executive in Moscow. 'In the absence of legislation, we have been forced to put together a certain number of rules under which we expect to play the game for another 30 years.' It has, for instance, tailored its deals so that the local partners pay all tax bills, whatever they may be in future, from their own share of the profits. But even if Elf's success is followed by dozens of other deals, foreign investment is only part of the solution for the ailing oil industry of the former Soviet Union. Dr Yevgeny Khartukov, an oil industry analyst who heads the World Energy Analysis and Forecasting Group, a research institute in Moscow, says the industry must also be taken out of state control. He says a priority is to give managers the freedom to manage, and to train them to operate in a market environment. 'They do not understand what foreign partners expect of them. They are pure technocrats, not businessmen.' He also says that workers need better pay and conditions. 'After decades of feeling privileged compared to other sectors, the oil workers realise they too are poor. They have no access to the wealth they produce.' To deal with some of the discontent and waste, Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, proposes to unleash market forces upon the industry. Last week he announced plans to free the price of oil for deliveries to the state in mid-April. Faced with a strike threat, the government last month allowed oil enterprises to sell 40 per cent of the oil they produce on the country's fledgling free market. After halting spontaneous privatisation - whereby oil managers simply took over state assets for themselves - the government is now promising orderly, privatisation to create independent oil companies. Reform will take time but is unlikely to be reversed. Even if the current government falls, the incentives for its successors to protect foreign investment will remain strong. As for the internal squabbles over control of resources, these may diminish over time as lines of authority become more clearly defined and as oil industry assets are moved out of state hands.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAPPING INTO OIL RESERVES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Russian Federation          Former Soviet Union Million            1990     1991      1992      1990     1991      1992  tonnes                            forecast                    forecast  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross oil  production       515.3      462    396-412    570.5      516   450-470  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Refinery production  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Furnace    fuel oil        99.2       96      90-94    161.7      163   138-143  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Diesel fuel       75.6       72      70-73    111.5      108     92-97  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Motor    gasoline        39.9       39      35-38     62.3       60     49-53  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Jet fuel          16.4       16      15-16     24.6       25     19-23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Energy Analysis &amp; Forecasting Group (GAPMER)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

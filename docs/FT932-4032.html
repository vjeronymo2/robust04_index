			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Letter 'targets' invalidity benefit INVALIDITY benefits could become an early casualty of the government's spending review, according to a confidential government letter leaked yesterday. The letter, apparently written to the prime minister from Mr Peter Lilley, Social Security Secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the two government ministers spearheading the spending review, proposes a controversial 'three pronged' course of action to cut invalidity benefits. This would make invalidity benefit less generous, limited to a smaller group of long-term sick, and taxable. Noting that 'these changes are bound to be controversial', the letter suggests that the climate of opinion has now shifted sufficiently to allow the measures to gain parliamentary support. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Social Security Secretary, yesterday condemned the letter, and called on Mr Lilley to 'kill a proposal which is totally unacceptable' at the earliest opportunity. According to the letter, the proposed cuts would save Pounds 180m in the 1995-6 financial year, Pounds 495m in the following year, and Pounds 1.3bn by the end of the decade. The bulk of this saving would be made through the introduction of stricter medical controls on claimants, which the letter suggests would save Pounds 240m over the next three years. Savings could also be made, the letter suggests, by phasing out the payment of additional pension, on top of invalidity benefits. The letter says cuts are necessary because of a 'dramatic growth in invalidity benefit', as the number of claimants between 1978 and the present has risen from 600,000 to 1.5m, and total expenditure grown from Pounds 840m to Pounds 6.2bn, with a projected rise to Pounds 8.2bn in 1995.</p>

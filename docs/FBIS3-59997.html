Investigations have revealed that the  22-year-old man from Vienna's 12th district and the 19-year-old  man from Boeheimkirchen in Lower Austria bought the heroin from  a Czech in Bratislava. They paid 300,000 schillings and offered  the Viennese man's BMW 325i as security. The police are still  searching for the organizers of the deal.    About 800 grams of heroin with a street value of 170,000  schillings were smuggled by a Tirolian couple from Zurich to  Vorarlberg since August. On Sunday [26 December], the  25-year-old man and his 32-year-old girlfriend were arrested at  the Lustenau border crossing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Foreign  Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang quipped this afternoon in  reference to the DPRK's nuclear issue: "Lest we have a war on  our lap even before there is an atomic bomb."    Shen stated here at the routine news briefing that in  principle, China is against the involvement of the UN Security  Council in the DPRK's nuclear issue and the means of sanctions.  He held that even now there remain both room and possibilities  for properly solving the DPRK's nuclear issue. As long as the  concerned four corners and three sides give 100 percent of what  they have, they still can promote peace, stability, and  denuclearization on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. Shen  said that it is to this goal that China is directing its efforts.    As quite a number of reporters had asked him about the  possibility of the outbreak of war, Shen Guofang stressed more  than once that right now he hopes that instead of talking about  war, people should talk about how to solve the problem. So far,  there is no evidence indicating that the DPRK has a nuclear  arsenal. "Lest we have a war on our lap even before there is an  atomic bomb." "No side wishes to see the outbreak of war, which  would be highly unfavorable for Northeast Asia."    Shen Guofang said that the channel between the United States  and the DPRK remains open and he hopes for "reopening the  dialogue."    On China's recent nuclear test, Shen Guofang said: China has  always been restrained in nuclear testing and is the country to  conduct the fewest nuclear tests among the nuclear powers.  Equally, China hopes to see a total ban on nuclear testing and  to participate in talks related to the subject. Shen believes  that the first step toward global denuclearization is that  nuclear powers do not threaten to launch preemptive strikes.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Letter: Measures to protect consumers must not be sacrificed Sir, I was dismayed to read ('Burning the house Jacques built', December 8) that the UK government proposes to sacrifice 21 EC consumer protection measures, and various draft directives, on 'the altar of subsidiarity'. Subsidiarity should mean that policy decisions are taken at the most appropriate level - whether European, national, regional or local. Unfair trading practices and dangerous goods do not stop at national borders. Without Community legislation, unscrupulous traders may take advantage of inconsistencies between national laws, and discredit the single market to the detriment of consumers and reputable suppliers. We believe common EC rules governing safety, consumer contracts, advertising, labelling and consumer redress are essential if consumers are to take the opportunities offered by a wider single market.

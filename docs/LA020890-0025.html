			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES' COVERAGE OF MCMARTIN CASE  </P> <P> "All men are created equal," is stated in the Declaration of Independence. In  the McMartin trial, the children were not treated equal to adults. Children are  often known to tell lies, but how could 500 children make up the same story?  Our justice system has come a long way to be more fair and just, but it still  has a way to go.  </P> <P> SIBIL KWOK  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

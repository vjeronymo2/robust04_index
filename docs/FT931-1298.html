			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Filled with delight at the demise of the Taurus system Sir, Am I the only one to be filled with delight at the demise of the computerised Taurus share registration system? For a merchant banker whose idea of a long-term investment is about two weeks, the present system might seem a bit slow, but I cherish my share certificates. They assure me that I really do hold my shares. How would I ever persuade a computer that it had got my holding wrong? And would it ever tell me it had made a mistake? The great British public has good reason to be delighted too. I'm sure it didn't look forward to two-thirds of a penny on income tax, or yet more VAT, to replace the chancellor's lost stamp duty on share transactions. The present stamp duty falls on those who are affluent enough to own shares, but who knows where the tax to replace it would fall? British industry ought to be pleased as well. It stabilises the value of companies by forcing investors to take a long enough view of their holding to recoup the stamp duty. Unit trust managers likewise stabilise their funds by the similar device of unequal bid and offer prices. In both cases the added stability makes for a more considered and longer-term approach to management. I am far from convinced that an 'efficient' stock market works to the good of industry. During Germany and Japan's spectacular post-war growth, traded volumes in their stock markets were too low for them to qualify. From the point of view of industry, the stock market's significance lies in its willingness to absorb new share flotations and rights issues that can provide new capital. Trading, on the other hand, only provides an indication of the terms on which it might be raised. As far as I can see, Taurus would have helped trading but done nothing to help provide new industrial investment. Yet it is that investment that is needed. You may be surprised to hear that this contrary view comes to you from a chartered electronics engineer who works with computers daily.

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> POLL ON TAXES FOR SCHOOL  </P> <P> Searching for ways to solve the school district's financial problems, a  22-member citizens panel this month will conduct a poll of residents about  their attitudes regarding new taxes.  </P> <P> The Financial Strategy Planning Committee will employ the firm of Fairbank,  Bregman &amp; Maullin, with offices in Santa Monica and San Francisco, to  conduct the telephone survey, which will be paid for from private fund-raising  activities, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> The 5-school district, which recently agreed to a 10% raise in teachers'  salaries, was forced to eliminate $750,000 in budget items to close a budget  gap for the school year. Greater budget shortfalls are expected next year. The  panel, which was established last month by the school board, has discussed  asking voters for a special parcel tax to increase the school budget. It has  also reportedly considered a bond issue for capital expenses, which would  require voter approval.  </P></p>

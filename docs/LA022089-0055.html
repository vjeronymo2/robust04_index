			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT: BOEING UNIT MAY HAVE CUT PARTS TESTS  </P> <P> A Boeing subsidiary may have curtailed testing of high-tech nuts and bolts  destined for use in the new Air Force B-2 stealth bomber in order to save  money, according to a published report Sunday.  </P> <P> The supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation, suspected of  supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a fictitious "Inspector 11."  </P> <P> The Seattle Times reported that an internal memo declared that Boeing Advanced  Systems had the testing of incoming fasteners curtailed just as a federal task  force began an investigation into fraud in the aerospace fastener industry.  Only "suspect" parts would be tested, the memo stated.  </P> <P> Among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by Boeing were high-tech  titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a Chatsworth company called Voi-Shan, a  division of Fairchild Industries, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Titanium Fasteners  </P> <P> Boeing Advanced Systems in Seattle uses Voi-Shan nuts and bolts. Boeing is  manufacturing classified parts for the Stealth bomber, made by Northrop Corp.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, 20 federal agents armed with search warrants seized 52 crates of  documents, test equipment and fasteners in a raid on Voi-Shan, the newspaper  said.  </P> <P> The agents were searching for evidence to support allegations made by three  past and present Voi-Shan workers that no testing was done on the fasteners,  but the fasteners were given approved by a fictitious "Inspector 11."  </P> <P> The Times said tests done on high-performance titanium fasteners, used to hold  together everything from engines to airframes, were of particular concern.  </P> <P> The newspaper also obtained Boeing and Voi-Shan shipping documents that stated  in the week before the raid Boeing Advanced Systems received two shipments of  more than 200 Voi-Shan titanium fasteners, with test reports certified by  "Inspector 11."  </P> <P> The Times, quoting an unidentified source, said those parts were only two of  many similar shipments designated for the B-2 project last year.  </P> <P> According to a Feb. 18, 1988, memo obtained by the newspaper, a quality-control  manager at Boeing Advanced Systems ordered the routine testing of incoming  shipments of some fasteners stopped, apparently to save money.  </P> <P> The memo said the company expected to save $53,000 by reducing testing from  March to October last year.  </P> <P> Boeing spokesman Paul Binder confirmed that the memo was legitimate, but  declined further comment on it or the B-2 program.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Guojun (2799 0948 6874)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- China hopes that the  coming century will see neither world war nor cold war, that  relations among nations will be more open and democratic and  that the international community will advance in harmony, said  Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and foreign  minister here today.    The remark was made by Qian Qichen while addressing the  opening of the symposium on the post-Cold War security situation  in the Asia-Pacific region and its prospects here today.    Dozens of scholars and strategic studies experts from the  United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the  Republic of Korea, Russia, India, Singapore, the Philippines,  Indonesia, Vietnam, and China were invited to participate in the  symposium.    Qian Qichen said: The overall international situation has  moved toward relaxation since the Cold War, which had continued  for almost half a century, came to an end. However, there are  still severe turmoil and unceasing military conflicts in some  regions. In contrast, the political situation in the  Asia-Pacific area is rather stable, as the progress there  towards multipolarity started rather early and the Cold War  impact was drastically reduced. Moreover, most countries in the  region have long since given priority to domestic economic  development, which has helped bring about a virtuous circle of  mutual promotion between political stability and economic  development.    Qian Qichen pointed out: The situation of relative political  stability in the region is the result of the close cooperation  and concerted efforts of the relevant countries, who should all  treasure and continue to consolidate and develop the situation  marked by peace, stability, and prosperity.    He said: However, there are indeed some factors of  instability in the Asia-Pacific region. Some of them are  left-overs from the Cold War; others are issues that have come  to the fore over the end of the Cold War; still others have been  caused by failure to adapt to the changes in the post-Cold War  situation in the areas of policies and ideology [zai zheng ce si  xiang shang 0961 2398 4595 1835 1927 0006]. Qian Qichen pointed  out: For peace, security, stability, and development in the  Asia-Pacific region, it is necessary to attach importance to  these issues and find a solution for them.    He said: The Chinese Government holds that all countries in  the region should base their relations with other countries  entirely on the purposes and principles of the United Nations  charter, the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and other  universally recognized norms governing international relations.  Mutual respect and cooperation on an equal footing between  states should replace hegemonism and power politics. Peaceful  negotiation, dialogue and consultation should replace the threat  or use of force. Equality, mutual benefit and complementary  activities should replace protectionism and economic sanctions  in trade. Only in this way can the existing and potential  unstable factors be brought under effective control and be  removed altogether, so as to help maintain and develop the  present situation of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific  region.    Qian Qichen stressed: China is in favor of a variety of  channels and levels of bilateral or multilateral dialogue on  Asia-Pacific security. He said: In addressing the security  issues of the region, it is necessary to proceed from the  realities and particular needs of the Asia-Pacific region and  its sub-regions, and to improve communications and enhance  mutual confidence among various parties. Moreover, to bring  about successful cooperation of the nations of the Asia-Pacific  region on the issue of security, it is necessary to seek common  ground while reserving differences, to seek truth from facts,  and to refrain from imposing one's will on any country or on  others when trying to solve an issue. During the symposium,  which was organized by the China International Issues Research  Center, the China Society of International Strategies, and the  Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the participating  scholars and experts are expected to focus on exchanging views  on the security situation in the region; on the relations among  China, Japan, the United States, and Russia and their security  policies in the region; and on the ways and methods adopted by  countries in the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen political and  security cooperation among them.</p>

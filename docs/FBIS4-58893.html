			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] On the publication of a part of a secret document  entitled "U.S. policy regarding the issue of forming UN  peacekeeping forces," the United States has explicitly regarded  any threats to its own vital interests as threats to  international peace and security. After the scandal resulting  from the presence of American troops in Somalia and their  ignominious withdrawal from that country, the issue of the mode  of American participation in the formation of peacekeeping  forces was put on the agendas of the U.S. Administration and  Congress. After months of debate and enquiry, in a document  that has been published recently, the United States has called  for the clarification of eight points before it makes any  decisions on dispatching of UN forces. [sentence as heard]    According to the U.S. president's national security adviser,  the most important of those eight issues is whether U.S.  interests will be guaranteed by the intervention of UN forces  and whether international peace and security will be violated or  the two will be threatened. Moreover, the United States seeks a  definite table for UN operations on the basis of common  objectives and political-military strategy, and the  determination of the number of forces and a precise assessment  of operation expenses. The United States will participate only  in operations that will achieve total success with a maximum  number of 15 casualties.    The fact that the United States regards any threat to its  own  vital interests as a threat to international peace and security  and then shows interest in participating in the formation of  peacekeeping forces is in reality the most conspicuous aspect of  change in the United Nations after the Cold War era.    The approach of the permanent members of the UN Security  Council toward world issues indicates that not much remains of  the UN Security Council as an international council; and in fact  the Western Members of the Security Council act as a board of  directors, only safeguarding their own interests. During the  Cold War era, those states used to abstain from participating in  UN peacekeeping activities in the form of an implicit agreement.  But at the moment, following changes in international  circumstances, they are considered as the eminent activist in UN  peacekeeping. That presence and cooperation is indicative of  the change in the role of UN peacekeeping forces.    Peacekeeping is a term related to the Cold War era, an era  when the two sides of a conflict would come to an agreement  after a long period of fighting and UN soldiers would take the  responsibility of guarding that agreement as a buffer and  impartial force. During that era, which lasted from 1948 to  1990, most UN soldiers were from north European states, Nepal,  Sri Lanka, as well as some African states. But under present  circumstances, the so-called peacekeeping force intervenes as  one of the warring sides, oversees elections, purges police  forces, armies, and government departments, and trains new  forces; such that in operations in Cambodia the management of  eight ministries was in the hands of those forces. In such a  case peacekeeping is not the issue; the safeguarding of  interests is the objective, and since those operations are  selective, biased countries like America are attracted to them.    Under present world circumstances, because of the serious  popular resistance in other countries in the face of  interference by countries such as America in their internal  affairs and public opinion, Western states that are the  permanent members of the UN Security Council benefit from UN  operations as a cover for their hegemonic objectives.</p>

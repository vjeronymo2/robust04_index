			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The DPRK (North Korea) has accepted international  inspections of its seven nuclear sites and North-South dialogue  as a result of progress in U.S.-North Korea talks on North  Korea's suspected nuclear development. In response, Japan-North  Korea normalization talks, which have been stalled, are expected  to resume some time in February.    Japanese negotiators in charge of the normalization talks  strongly believe that the Japan-North Korea normalization talks  will be resumed before or after the third round of U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks that are expected to be held in February.    Since the eighth round of talks, which were held in Beijing  in November 1992, the Japan-North Korea normalization talks have  not been held for over one year. The Japanese side has already  asked the North Korean side to hold preliminary consultations to  discuss procedures for resuming the normalization talks.    The North Korean side has yet to respond to the request from  the Japanese side because of its position of giving priority to  the U.S.-North Korea talks.    Hajime Fukada, chief of the Youth Bureau of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan (secretary general of the Dietmen's  League for the Promotion of Japan-North Korea Friendship),  visited North Korea earlier in January. The North Korean side  told him that North Korea is willing to hold preliminary  consultations with the Japanese side, giving the impression that  North Korea has begun moving to resume normalization talks with  Japan.    Mr. Fukuda visited North Korea at the invitation of Hwang  Chang-yop, director of the International Department of the  Workers' Party of Korea. During his stay in Pyongyang, he held  talks with Mr. Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yang-kon, deputy director  of the International Department. North Korea's willingness to  resume normalization talks may mean that it is fully prepared  for the talks after overcoming a waver in the recent shakeup of  the Workers' Party of Korea.</p>

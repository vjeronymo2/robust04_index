			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Company bidding to run national lottery 'truly independent' Sir, Lex asks if Ladbroke Group can disinterestedly 'run betting shops, football pools and the lottery' ('National lottery', January 11). Quite simply, the answer is yes. Ladbroke will be only a one-third equity investor in Games for Good Causes, the consortium company established to bid for the main operator's licence of the national lottery. The company is truly independent and free-standing, with no managerial or operational relationship with Ladbroke or Vernons and with strong representation from non-executive directors to emphasise our commitment to Cadbury recommendations on corporate governance. Our approach is wholly consistent with the tone and content of indications given by both government and the regulator with respect to the structure of ownership and control of any prospective operator. The particular contribution of Ladbroke, in terms of the extensive knowledge and experience available within Vernons Pools as a result of successfully running regulated mass market games in the UK, represents a unique and directly relevant attribute which has been incorporated into our bid proposals. Should we be successful in our application, the consortium company will then be obliged, under its licence commitments, to operate effectively and responsibly and, in particular, to compete strongly against a variety of existing forms of consumer spending, of which certain betting and gaming activities form only a part. Christopher Benson chairman, Games for Good Causes, Compass House, Redan Place, London W2 4SA</p>

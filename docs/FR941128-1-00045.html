App. 2160(e)) authorizes the President to establish and train a nucleus Executive Reserve. The President by Executive Order 10660 of February 15, 1956 established the National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER). The Executive Order authorized the heads of departments or agencies designated by the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization (predecessor to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)) to establish units of the Executive Reserve. Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994, superseded Executive Order 11179 which superseded Executive Order 10660 but continued the NDER program. The NDER is part of the national security emergency preparedness program and provides for a standby reserve of highly qualified individuals who are trained as volunteers until they are activated by the President, or the head of a department or agency during periods of emergency. The program facilitates the employment of Reservists in executive positions in government during an emergency requiring such activation. In addition, the Executive Reserve may be used for emergency preparedness activities as defined under Title VI of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;337.2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) lt is the policy of the President that there shall be in the Executive Branch of the Government an NDER composed of persons of recognized expertise from various segments of the private sector and from government (other than fulltime Federal employees) to be trained for employment in the Federal Government in the event of an emergency that requires such employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) As part of the President's national security emergency preparedness policy under Executive Order 12656, Federal departments and agencies shall develop plans and programs to mobilize personnel (including reservist programs) as appropriate within their assigned areas of responsibility and to assess essential emergency requirements and plan for possible use of such resources to meet essential demands during and following national emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;337.3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This part establishes policy and program guidance to assist those Federal departments and agencies authorized to establish Executive Reserve units in the NDER.

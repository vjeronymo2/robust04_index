			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: VISITING THE HOT SPOTS  </P> <P> Soaking up sun on Turkey's Aegean coast, river rafting and riding elephants in  Southeast Asia, snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef, absorbing the cultural  atmosphere of Paris -- they're all hot spots for young adventurers this year.  </P> <P> The image projected in popular Australian movies plus the lack of political and  language problems have contributed to raise the interest of young adventurers  in that area of the South Pacific.  </P> <P> Young Australians and New Zealanders are such avid travelers themselves it's  not surprising that many have returned home and opened independent youth  hostels.  </P> <P> For young visitors it means that even though prices are not cheap, there is a  large network of services and information that you can use to get the most out  of your dollar.  </P> <P> In Australia at the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef you'll find the world's  first youth island. Recently Contiki Travel, the world's largest youth tour  operator, opened the only resort on Long Island and limited it to guests  between the ages of 18 and 35.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exotic and Cheap  </P> <P> Thailand has become very popular with young visitors on the Southeast Asia  route because it's exotic and cheap.  </P> <P> Thousands head out on hiking trips from Chang Mai in the north to visit hill  tribe villages. Riding elephants and rafting on jungle rivers are usually  incorporated into the adventures.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that although many go into those remote areas and experience an  enjoyable adventure, you should check the credibility of local tour guides and  operators with the tourist office and be aware that malaria is a problem in  some areas, even if you have taken anti-malaria medication.  </P> <P> South America can be a major challenge to young novice travelers who haven't  had experience in dealing with foreign cultures. Europe and the South Pacific  offer well-developed youth services that are a good support system to those  that haven't had the opportunity to learn how to be "street-wise."  </P> <P> Now, through international financial support, more youth services are being  developed in South America. For example, in the last several years Brazil has  opened more than 38 youth hostels.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clean, Safe Hostels  </P> <P> That's important because the hostels not only provide clean, safe  accommodations (to get the international funding they must meet international  standards), they also offer good places to network with other young  international travelers, and to get advice on how to travel and what to see in  the area.  </P> <P> Turkey has been attracting young backpacking travelers with inexpensive  domestic bus transportation and beds in pensions, on the Aegean coast, for $3  to $5 a night.  </P> <P> Train travel to Turkey is not covered by the popular Eurail or Interail  transportation passes. The route most choose to reach Turkey is by boat from  Greece.  </P> <P> Greece is still a good bet, with beds in youth hostels averaging $4 or $5 a  night, although some young travelers are discovering that surviving on a tight  budget is easier on the mainland in areas such as the Peloponnesus rather than  competing with the large groups of tourists that head for the islands.  </P> <P> Athens is also still a popular transportation hub. Lots of competition has  added up to some very competitive transportation fares. It's a popular spot for  young travelers to pick up cheap flights to Egypt and Israel.  </P> <P> The Southern European countries have traditionally been the most comfortable  countries for those traveling on tight funds.  </P> <P> "Italy seems expensive compared with other southern countries," one young  traveler commented after being charged $10 to $12 for youth hostel  accommodations. "That's the same price as Switzerland."  </P> <P> "Paris is much easier than London," commented a young traveler who visited  recently. That's not surprising because through the AJF (Accueil des Jeunes en  France, a Paris-based service for youthful travelers) more than 8,000 beds in  youth and budget hotels are available to young visitors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Reservation Fee  </P> <P> The AJF charges no fee to make a reservation. One of its offices is in the new  building at Gare du Nord (the north railway station).  </P> <P> This year certain Eastern Bloc countries will be more attractive to young  visitors because they have been added to the system covered by popular  unlimited rail travel passes. Hungary can now be reached while using the  Eurailpass, and Czechoslovakia has been added to Interail Pass (for sale in  Europe only to those who are residents of a European country for at least six  months). Both tickets sell at special rates to travelers under 26 years of age.  </P></p>

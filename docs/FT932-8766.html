			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Olivetti says threats forced it to pay bribes OFFICIALS in the Italian Posts Ministry allegedly threatened to stop buying from Olivetti, the computer and office equipment manufacturer, unless the group paid bribes. According to evidence provided to Milan magistrates by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the group's chairman, this was just one of several instances of extortion against Olivetti during the 1980s by civil servants and their political masters. The allegation is contained in an 11-page statement to the magistrates by Mr De Benedetti, clarifying the group's role in illicit financing to the tune of nearly L20bn (Pounds 8.5m) of the main political parties - but principally the Christian Democrats and Socialists. Having agreed in 1988 to a 2 per cent 'commission' on purchases by the ministry, payable to the political parties, Olivetti's revenue jumped from L2.1bn in 1987 to L204.3bn that year. Mr De Benedetti told the magistrates he divided dealing with the political parties into two periods: from 1978-82 (when he was chief executive) and 1983 onwards (when he was also chairman). During the first, Olivetti experienced limited, though occasionally 'strong pressures'. The threats could be summed up as: 'If you don't pay you don't work with us', and they came from representatives of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. 'We replied rejecting specific requests. . . . limiting ourselves to generic donations to the party treasurers.' At one stage during this period Olivetti was 'on the black books of the state railways' and excluded even from bids. This made it difficult for the company, which had two thirds of its sales outside Italy, to seek contracts with the Swiss railways or the Dutch postal service who were puzzled that it had no such local contracts. This bribe threat was only dropped, Mr De Benedetti said, after he intervened several times with Posts Ministry, pointing out that Olivetti risked losing jobs if it lost the contract to foreign competition when in France and Germany such sectors were still closed to foreign competition. 'During the second period, the pressure from the parties and their representatives in the state entities reached an impressive crescendo . . . of menaces and extortion to become in the last few years nothing short of racketeering. . . The demands from the representatives of the parties were systematic and unavoidable on everything they controlled without exception.' Olivetti was thus obliged to adopt a case-by-case approach, in particular with the Posts Ministry, handled through the group's Rome representative. 'Thus we arrived at an agreement whereby Olivetti had to pay like the other suppliers to the ministry.' 'The result . . . was dramatic moving from L2.196bn in 1987 to L204.305bn in 1988. At the same time the payments began totalling L10.025bn between 1988 and 91. 'Towards the end of 1991 I decided to object to this system and stopped every type of payment. And since then we have scarcely received a new order, while there began to appear a series of strange news items in the papers about supposed malfunctioning of Olivetti equipment as well, in synthesis, a repetition of the attitude 'if you don't pay no work'.' Mr De Benedetti said the Christian Democrat treasurer was timid compared to the late Mr Vincenzo Balzamo, his Socialist counterpart (who died of a heart attack last autumn while under investigation). 'The Socialists were much more aggressive in that Balzamo told Cherubini (Olivetti's Rome representative) that it was only possible to overcome the great aversion of the Socialist party and its secretary (Mr Bettino Craxi) towards me by handing over money.'</p>

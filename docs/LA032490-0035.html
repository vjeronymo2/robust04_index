			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> MIGRANT WORKER RECOUNT ASSAILED  </P> <P> Census takers on Friday went into the fields of northern San Diego County at  dawn to recount migrant workers, but the effort drew criticism from homeless  advocates, who said they were "suspicious" of the results because the Census  Bureau provided no advance notice. Despite the skepticism, census officials  proclaimed that they now had a "quality count" of the migrants. The Census  Bureau, acknowledging it had botched the count earlier in the week, said it  made procedure changes, using more bilingual census takers and retraining  "enumerators" before embarking on the recount.  </P></p>

Kolykhan, Institute of Energy Problems, </F> Academy of Sciences of Belarus; UDC 621.311.25:621.039.5]    [Abstract] The VVER-92 power plant design, like the APWR,  Konvoi-95, MARS, ABWR, BWR-90, and Candu-3 designs, implements  passive and active safety systems which prevent rupture of the  core and protective hull, prevent leakage of radiation into the  environment, and shut down the supply of energy and maintain  control in emergency situations. These systems reduce the  probability of a serious accident by an order of magnitude while  reducing capital investment and cost price to 15-20%. The  AR-600, SIR, SBWR, and V-600 designs make greater use of passive  systems, which simplifies the design and reduces the number of  components in the first circuit by a factor of 2-6. Construction  based on these designs may begin in 1995-2005. The efforts of  leading machine building and construction firms in the field of  energy are focused on the development of new generation of  plants using light-water reactors (up to 1300 MW). These plants  should be built in the next 10-30 years and meet current  requirements for safety and competitiveness. The VVER-92 design  has an accident probability of about 2.5X10[.sup]-7[/]  reactor-years. Predominantly passive systems are used in this  design. The design conserves materials while providing a double  hull for protection. Figures 3; references 31: 12 Russian, 19  Western.</p>

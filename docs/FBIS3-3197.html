"The President discussed with each leader ways to resume  negotiations as quickly as possible," White House communications  director Mark Gearan said in a statement.    During the talks with Mubarak and Al-Asad by telephone,  Clinton described his conversations Wednesday with visiting  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    Clinton and Rabin Wednesday discussed ways to restart the  peace talks and called on Palestine Liberation Organization  (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to resume the negotiations  immediately.    The Palestinians broke off the peace talks with Israel after  the massacre by an Israeli settler of more than 40 Palestinians  in Hebron two weeks ago.    Gearan characterized Clinton's discussions with Mubarak and  Al-Asad as useful.</p>

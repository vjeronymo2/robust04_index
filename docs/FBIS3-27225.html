			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Cao Zhi (2580 2535)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- The People's  Liberation Army [PLA] -- while implementing readjustment and  reform -- has paid great attention to quality in its logistics  work. It has explored ways to build a new type of logistics  support under the new setting of a socialist market economy,  and, by relying on improved management and technical progress,  brought about significant changes in the supply of basic  necessities, including clothing, food, shelter, and transport.  As of last year, 1.2 million officers and men had moved into  new, modern barracks.    The improvement in the appearance and bearing of the  soldiers  has further enhanced the image of our mighty force. On 1 May,  all the rank-and-file and some officers were issued new  camouflage [mi cai 6617 1752] training suits. Junior officers  have been issued whipcord winter uniforms. Service-wide  issuance of 87-style regular uniforms, training suits, and work  clothes that started in 1988 has been completed; in torrid,  chilly, and coastal defense regions, the officers and soldiers  have also been issued specially-made vests, winter clothes, or  water-proof gear to be worn on patrol missions.    As restrictions on the market are being lifted, living  standards in the barracks have remained, more or less, stable.  Early last year, the Central Military Commission [CMC] spelled  out clearly the principle that in military spending, it is  necessary to guarantee the needs of the soldiers' daily lives.  The standards for a soldier's allowance and board expenses have  been raised. The military also had a good harvest of grain and  nonstaple foodstuffs last year. During the year it produced 660  million kg of grain, 220 million kg of meat and eggs, and 610  million kg of vegetables. Wider use of greenhouses and large  sheds to grow vegetables has enabled troops stationed in  Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hainan to have fresh vegetables in winter.    New barracks have been built at the grassroots in the  military. Last year, the military started, on a scale never seen  in the history of PLA, renovations of barracks. Units in charge  of barracks construction at all levels have sent engineers and  close to 100 task forces to help the grassroots units draw up  plans and designs for barracks construction. Many units also  took it upon themselves to manufacture bricks and tiles and  collect rocks in an effort to reduce production costs. It has  been learned that after the renovation, the pass rate of the  military's barracks is now 100 percent; and 50 percent of them  are rated excellent.    Logistics work has also benefited from the marked increase  in the military's capacity for rapid shipment. Whenever there  are major military operations, the army has been able to  organize mechanical transport to quickly ship personnel and  materials to where they are needed, thereby ensuring successful  accomplishment of assignments such as military exercises,  emergency action needed because of natural disasters, and relief  operations. The various units, which are equipped with driving  crews and other specialized personnel, are capable, by and  large, of getting their truck convoys into action at any time.  Army units and local departments in charge of transportation  and war preparedness have worked together in renovating or  building a number of new national defense and coastal defense  highways. The units are also beginning to get cooking cars,  bakery cars, and refrigerator cars used for logistics support in  field operations.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: The drooping dollar If leading central banks thought they had fixed the dollar problem with their intervention in April, they must be disappointed. The currency is again slipping in foreign exchange markets, reaching new lows for the year last week against the D-mark and other European currencies including sterling. Assuming the absolute level of exchange rates matters to the central banks, that would call for another round of concerted intervention. In the short time since their last effort, though, a number of basic assumptions have changed which may make the central banks less keen to step in. Not only has the Federal Reserve declared a period of hiatus in its monetary tightening but also economic recovery has become established in Germany, which reduces the imperative for rate cuts there. It is thus harder to argue that the dollar is moving against what ought to be its fundamental trend. There is less concern that the dollar's weakness will upset the US Treasury's funding programme, while the continuing overshoot in German money supply must make the Bundesbank reluctant to intervene in currencies. As long as the dollar's fall does not turn disorderly, these arguments may well hold. It helps, perhaps, that there is less talk now of a US desire to drive the dollar down against the yen. The yen itself is probably prevented from showing its true strength by Korean nuclear worries as well as by some discreet intervention from the Bank of Japan. Yet while the broader community of central banks may be unworried for now, Friday night's steep fall suggests they may eventually have to become involved. One cannot imagine the dollar's decline remaining orderly below DM1.60 or Yen100.</p>

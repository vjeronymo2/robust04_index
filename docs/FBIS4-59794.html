			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- A weekly specialising in  Middle East affairs has blamed Saudi Arabia for the ongoing  bloodbath in Yemen which has claimed thousands of lives.    "But in the way of neutrality, stands Saudi Arabia who still  is out to get even with Sanaa for backing Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait. At that time Saudi Arabia retaliated with the expulsion  of hundreds of thousands Yemeni workers, crippling the poorest  Arab state's economy," said the MIDDLE EAST TIMES in its Monday  [16 May] issue in Cairo.    "But now Egyptian observers say that Saudi Arabia seeks to  partition Yemen as compensation for Yemen's attempts to severe  Saudi-led Arab unity.    North Yemen sources also speculate that "Saudi Arabia's  defense minister dashed back home to save the south from Sanaa's  jaws and prolong the prospects of war," said the  English-language weekly in its cover story.    "Both Saudi Arabia and Western powers have backed the south  enclave's call for outside intervention which they deem a  lifeline able to halt the north's march on Aden dead in its  tracks," it noted.    The weekly said that since Saudi Arabia's rapprochement with  the regime of Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian Islamists view the Saudi  Kingdom as a "traitor to their Koranic cause."    "Nor are they surprised that Saudi Arabia has thrown in its  lot with the former socialists of the south, now that Egypt's  Marxists such as Albert Farag and Lutfi Kholi have been reported  hob-nobbing with Saudi princes," said the weekly.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY ADDS TO ITS COLLECTION OF TITLES  </P> <P> For the coach who seems to have it all, and for a team that has come close but  never won it all, the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs beckon.  </P> <P> And, for the fourth time in a row and sixth time this decade, Simi Valley High  will enter the playoffs as the Marmonte League champion. Still, the 1980s have  left Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers wanting -- a banner, a ring, a Southern  Section championship.  </P> <P> After his Pioneers thrashed Thousand Oaks, 14-6, Wednesday at Simi Valley,  Scyphers spoke of the league titles, the playoff berths (nine) and national and  statewide recognition.  </P> <P> "Still," he said, "something's missing -- a CIF championship."  </P> <P> And what of this team, a group that forged a 21-3 record, including 10-2 in  league play, despite modest expectations?  </P> <P> "I don't think we have the league MVP," Scyphers said, "but one thing about  this team, they play as a team with solid defense and good pitching."  </P> <P> In other words, don't count them out.  </P> <P> In their regular-season finale, the Pioneers roughed up four Thousand Oaks  pitchers for 14 hits -- 11 in the fifth and sixth innings when they scored 11  times to bury the third-place Lancers. Thousand Oaks cooperated by committing  seven errors -- three during the 11-run outburst.  </P> <P> "The mistakes were devastating," Thousand Oaks Coach Jim Hansen said. "They're  a good ballclub. You make too many mistakes and they'll just gang up on you."  </P> <P> Kenny Hood led the group effort with three hits and two runs batted in; Mike  Jenkins had two hits, including a two-run home run in the sixth inning; and  Jeff Sommer, Brandon Banaga and Chadd Johnson each added two hits.  </P> <P> Hood was involved in a fifth-inning shoving match with Thousand Oaks third  baseman Brian Higgins that was quickly broken up, but not before both benches  had cleared. Hood and Higgins became entangled after Hood had stolen third base  and attempted to score when the throw bounced down the left-field line.  </P> <P> "I didn't really want to fight," Hood said. "It was just emotions. We both  apologized."  </P> <P> At the time, with one run home in the inning for Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks  trailed, 4-2, courtesy of solo home runs by Chris Grodell in the first and  fourth innings. Simi Valley, however, scored four more times in the fifth --  all unearned -- and six times in a seven-hit sixth inning.  </P> <P> Jenkins (7-0) pitched the first 5 2/3 innings for the win, leaving when Scott  Barkman's three-run home run made the score, 8-5. Thousand Oaks starter John  Bushart (6-3) took the loss.  </P> <P> And Simi Valley, which only three games ago was in danger of letting the  balance of power slip away after losing to Newbury Park, laid claim to the  game, league title and decade. Game, set, match.  </P> <P> "I thought it was lost," Jenkins said of the league championship. "Newbury  Park, they're a strong team. It really kind of surprises me. We're here, and  we're Marmonte League champions again."  </P></p>

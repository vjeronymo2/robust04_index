			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara has announced that on 18  April he will disclose a decision he has made, a decision which  will generate controversy and prompt criticism against him.    The president has warned the statements he is planning to  make on a television network broadcast on 18 April will shock  the Panamanian community. He has said the mere thought of it  makes him ill.    [Begin Endara recording] The only reason I am ill is due to  the worry this decision has caused me. This decision is that  I.... [pauses] I have made a very difficult decision, and it may  be very controversial. I will speak on a national network on 18  April at 1900. At that time you will know why I am ill. You  will have to wait until 18 April to know. [end recording]    The president made the announcement during inauguration of a  bridge that links the so-called old section of the Free Zone  with the France Field warehouses in Colon Province. [The  announcement is] prompting speculation of a possible  resignation, because the president said repeatedly over the past  few days that his feet are itching to leave the Palace of the  Herons.    [Begin recording] [Endara] In reality it has nothing to do  with that other foot disease. It has nothing to do with the  feet. This is a disease of the head and heart.    [Unidentified reporter] Is it a political decision, Mr.  President?    [Endara] It is definitely political, but it is my duty. It  will be very controversial, and I will be widely criticized, but  it is my duty. [end recording]    Despite reporters' persistent questions, Endara declined to  provide any details regarding the statements he will make on 18  April at 1900, and he appealed for patience until then.</p>

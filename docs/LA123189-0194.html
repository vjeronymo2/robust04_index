			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVE BEGINS TO PUT BUILDUP PLAN ON BALLOT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: A SMALL BAND OF HOMEOWNERS GATHERED TO INITIATE A PETITION DRIVE  TO HALT A 7,110-ACRE DEVELOPMENT APPROVED BY ORANGE.  </P> <P> A small but determined band of homeowners gathered at W.O. Hart Park on  Saturday to kick off their three-week campaign to put the Irvine Co.'s  7,110-acre commercial and residential development for east Orange before the  voters.  </P> <P> They were angry enough; the question is do they have enough support to gather  the 7,000 signatures they need to put the issue on the June election ballot.  </P> <P> "We can do it," said Dorothy Hudecek of the Five Coves Conservancy. "People all  over this city are going to be seeing a lot of us the next couple of weeks."  </P> <P> The City Council on Dec. 19 approved the mammoth new planned community by a 5-0  vote, with Mayor Don E. Smith calling it a "historic" development, the largest  the Irvine Co. has ever proposed. Annexed into the city in phases, it would  eventually include more than 12,000 new homes -- increasing the city's  population by about 40% -- plus a commercial and hotel center that would mean  25,000 new jobs.  </P> <P> The opponents have until Jan. 18 to come up with signatures from 10% of the  city's 54,098 registered voters to take the decision away from the City Council  and put it before the voters. The homeowners opposing the development say they  need 7,000 signatures to compensate for duplicate signatures and non-registered  voters or non-city residents who might sign.  </P> <P> The Hart Park meeting Saturday was called so the leaders could pass out the  first batch of petitions and give everyone a pep talk.  </P> <P> "You need some kind of slogan people can identify with," said Harry Huggins, a  supporter from neighboring Tustin.  </P> <P> "How about 'Save Orange'?" someone shouted.  </P> <P> "Great!" Huggins said. "Save Orange from being destroyed by this development."  </P> <P> Sherry Meddick, who lives in a neighboring unincorporated area, is planning to  have petitioners register new voters.  </P> <P> She and others were defensive about any suggestion that they didn't seem to  have enough people at the Saturday gathering to pull off such a massive task.  </P> <P> "You need 70 people to collect 100 signatures each; if you look at it that way,  it isn't so difficult," she said.  </P> <P> The chief organizer was Allan Beek, who wore a hat declaring "No 2nd City."  </P> <P> "We'll all meet back here again next Saturday for more petitions," he said.  </P> <P> Beek is from Newport Beach. He was called on by Orange friends because of his  experience in getting issues on the ballot in his own city.  </P> <P> "I may not live in Orange, but I do live in Orange County," Beek said. "And  everyone in Orange County should be concerned about this development."  </P> <P> The homeowners were united in the reasons for their opposition to the Irvine  Co. plan.  </P> <P> "It's too big," said Bob Seibert of the Santiago Creek Homeowners Assn. "Too  dense, too much traffic."  </P> <P> Irvine Co. officials claim that their plans to upgrade city roads and build new  roads will substantially offset any additional traffic. But the Hart Park  people weren't buying it.  </P> <P> "We don't want New York; we don't want Detroit, we don't even want L.A.," said  Orange resident Sharon Seibert.  </P> <P> "The city doesn't seem to care about what we want," Orange resident Marty  Martini said. "The council's feeling is, if we don't do it, Anaheim will get  it. Well, let Anaheim have it."  </P> <P> But two men who paced gingerly in the background at the gathering predict the  petition drive is doomed, because Orange residents will not support it.  </P> <P> Bob Walters and Ted Botens, who live in the hills overlooking most of the city,  claim the development would benefit the city through more jobs, a better tax  base, and the Irvine Co. agreement to include recreational facilities and 2,700  acres of open space.  </P> <P> "Eleven homeowner groups from the hills have already supported this  development," Walters said. "We mitigated much that we didn't like. Where were  all these people when we were mitigating some of these issues?"  </P> <P> Botens and Walters said the plan should increase the tax base by $2 million a  year.  </P> <P> "That money won't be for us in east Orange; it will go to these people in west  Orange," Walters said.  </P> <P> Others at the park gathering said there was some question whether those 11  homeowner groups from the hills really supported the development. Botens is  president of ROCC, Rural Orange Coordinating Council, which ostensibly is made  up of those 11 groups. ROCC has signed the agreement on the development with  the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> But Terri Sergeant, vice president of ROCC, said the homeowners who are members  of those groups oppose the Irvine Co.'s plans.  </P> <P> "We'll gather a lot more signatures there than Ted Botens realizes," she said.  </P> <P> Despite the high spirit of the petition backers, Meddick admitted the  possibility of failure.  </P> <P> "If we don't make it, it will be because we just didn't have enough time," she  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS IN UKRAINE CALL FOR SECESSION, OUSTER OF PARTY BOSS  </P> <P> Speakers at a founding conference for the country's newest independent  political movement, this one in the Ukraine, called Saturday for separating  from the Soviet Union and for ousting the republic's longtime Communist Party  boss.  </P> <P> At the same time, a leading Kremlin conservative warned that this country's  existence is threatened by its ethnic problems.  </P> <P> Also Saturday, a statement reaching Moscow from Armenians living in the  troubled enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh appealed for help from the United Nations  to fend off attacks from Azerbaijanis and said that the Kremlin is unable to  protect them despite the presence of 4,000 Soviet troops.  </P> <P> These latest developments came amid growing signs that the conflicts among many  of the more than 100 ethnic groups in the Soviet Union is perceived by  officials here to have reached a crisis point during the last month, while  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was vacationing at the Black Sea.  </P> <P> Gorbachev ended his vacation Saturday night with a previously unannounced  address on Soviet television, but he made direct reference only briefly to the  nationalities problem, saying it will be dealt with at a Central Committee  plenum soon. The long-awaited plenum is likely to be held sometime this month,  according to both Soviet and Western sources.  </P> <P> While Gorbachev was away from Moscow, the Central Committee released a tough  statement last month calling for an end to "nationalist hysteria," and the  Communist Party media began a campaign against mass movements that have called  for independence from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But the Kremlin's efforts to deal with the growing unrest have so far been  limited to "just jawboning," a senior Western diplomat observed last week at a  briefing with American journalists.  </P> <P> What steps the Central Committee can take to cool ethnic hostility is very  unclear. Western analysts have speculated that a shake-up is likely of some  local Communist Party officials, who have been widely criticized for failing to  rein in local nationalism.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call for Leader's Ouster  </P> <P> In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, members of the Ukrainian Popular Movement for  Perestroika, meeting on the second of a three-day founding session, called for  dismissing Ukrainian Communist Party chief Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky and  bringing him to trial for his handling of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.  </P> <P> "There can be no talk of perestroika (reform) in the Ukraine when the criminals  responsible for Chernobyl are still in power," said Sergei Konyev, a member of  the Soviet Parliament. He also called for an end to the "reign of political  dinosaurs."  </P> <P> Shcherbitsky, a Ukrainian party official since 1952, was a crony of former  Communist Party boss Leonid I. Brezhnev and has been a full member of the  Politburo since 1971. At 71, he is the oldest Politburo member and is  considered among the most conservative.  </P> <P> Also at Saturday's meeting, Levko Lukyanenko, a former political prisoner,  called for Ukrainian independence.  </P> <P> "Our whole history is a history of occupation, but we have suffered most under  the Russians," he said. "For this reason, the principal goal of our movement  must be to leave the Soviet Union. International law and the Soviet  constitution give us the right to independence."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, speaking in the Central Asian  republic of Kirgizia, "warned of the possibility of the Soviet Union  disintegrating over the nationalities issue," Radio Moscow reported Saturday.  </P> <P> Ligachev, considered the Politburo's leading conservative, said that  strengthening party unity should be the country's top priority. He added that  Communist members should not take part in "meetings with anti-socialist  tendencies," a reference to the popular movements in the Baltic republics of  Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as the Ukraine and several other  republics.  </P> <P> Also Saturday, word reached Moscow of an appeal published four days ago in a  Nagorno-Karabakh newspaper, Sovetakan Karabakh.  </P> <P> The statement by a council of Armenians, who make up the majority in the  Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, said that armed Azerbaijanis were massing in the  region and were believed to be preparing for attacks on Armenians.  </P> <P> More than 100 people have been killed in ethnic clashes in the area in the last  18 months. Armenians are demanding autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh, which  officially is part of Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> The bleakness of the situation in the area was underscored by a report Friday  night on Soviet television that showed buses with bullet holes and broken  windows. The buses had been traveling through Armenian populated areas of  Nagorno-Karabakh when they were attacked by Azerbaijanis, the report said.  </P> <P> The Armenian statement, addressed to the United Nations, said that Moscow had  failed to protect the Armenians and added, "We appeal to you to do everything  possible for the security of the Armenian population of Karabakh, even  including dispatching a contingent of U.N. soldiers, should this become  necessary."  </P></p>

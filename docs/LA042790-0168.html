			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRED PLUMER'S ROLE IN MEASURE N CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> A special thanks to you for the column "Measure N Seemed to Seek Out Fred  Plumer" (Joe Bell, April 12). As one who worked on the Irvine Citizens United  campaign to defeat Measure N (too bad we weren't successful), I can personally  testify to the special role that Fred played throughout the ordeal.  </P> <P> He was always there to calm our frustrations, lift our spirits, and urge us on  to do what we knew in our hearts was right.  </P> <P> Fred is a most unusual person. His infectious personality, genuine openness and  faith in humankind seem to energize his friends and followers and to disarm  even his avowed enemies. Spend a few minutes in his company and you sense  immediately that he really does believe in the worth and dignity of every  individual. What a contrast to the Lou Sheldon's of this world. Sheldon could  learn a lot from Fred Plumer, not the least of which is the true meaning of  faith.  </P> <P> Mr. Bell, thanks, too, for being such a refreshing breath of reason, compassion  and tolerance. Sometimes I think that there must be something wrong with me --  I agree with just about every point you make in every column you write! Just  like the Orange County Register. Right.  </P> <P> Joseph J. Bucuzzo,  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

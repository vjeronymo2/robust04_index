			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Vasilyevich Dovgan, chairman of </F> Peasant Party of Ukraine and candidate for people's deputy of  Ukraine from Velikoaleksandrovskiy (Kherson Oblast) Electoral  District No 400, by G. Dymov; date and place not given: "Sergey  Dovgan: 'We Will Assume the Responsibility'"]    [Text]    [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, it probably would be best to  begin by presenting your "calling card"....    [Dovgan] It is the same as for any country boy. I have had  blisters on my hands since I was small. I went to school and  then to the VUZ, and then I came back to the country, back to  the land. Anyone who wants to know the details of my biography,  or simply wants to talk, can contact me any time at the Kosmos  Sovkhoz in Berislavskiy Rayon. The telephone number is 2-28-93.  That is where I am on display, so to speak. Besides this, I feel  that each of us should be judged by his actions, and not by  academic degrees and professional titles. That is the only way  to climb out of the present crisis.    [Dymov] All right. The farm you head is quite strong, in  spite of the present economic devastation. You deserve your good  reputation. What made you want to climb to the heights of  government?    [Dovgan] Everyone defends the peasants during a campaign,  displaying great pity for them, and then all of this concern  disappears without a trace when the campaign is over. That is  why we know this to be true: Anyone who works on the land is our  candidate. All the rest, the ones who make such lavish promises,  are just trying to "garner votes," occupy a comfortable  position, torment us for 2-5 years, and ultimately evade  responsibility. This was impossible in the past. At that time  the Supreme Soviet was controlled by the Communist Party, which  sent the candidates there and then kept them in line. Today, on  the other hand, if we have independent deputies, policy will be  made in this way: Whoever pays the piper will call the tune. The  Peasant Party promises that if our representative becomes a  deputy, we will be able to put him on the spot, so to speak, at  any time. We will summon him to the district, where he will have  to answer to the people for all of his actions. Furthermore, we  will see to it that other members of the Supreme Council do not  change their minds as easily as a fancy gentleman changes his  gloves. The Peasant Party will assume the responsibility for  this. It will block the efforts of the shape-shifters, the poor  excuses for politicians whose bid for power is motivated by  greed. These convictions are the reason I decided to run for  office.    [Dymov] What is the difference, in your opinion, between the  administrator of a farm and a politician? Have you decided on  the main issues you would put on the new parliamentary agenda?    [Dovgan] We agree with the forces for only one kind of  independence, the kind in which people will live well, the  forces capable of establishing beneficial economic relations  with the rest of the world. I see no difference between  "secluded" autonomy and self-isolation. That is why we have to  begin by establishing friendly and mutually beneficial contacts  with all willing parties.    Our foreign policy is a good example. We have no foreign  policy per se. It has led to one failure after another. We saw  the treatment we got from the American President. He came to  Kiev and summoned our president...as if he were issuing an  order.... This is how we can expect to be treated until we have  strong partners and friends. I think that Russia and Belarus  should be the main ones. We have to form military and political  blocs. After all, the Warsaw bloc broke up, but NATO still  exists, is dictating its own terms, and feels superior to  everyone else. In our solitary state, they will drive us to our  knees. This is my opinion, and I am certain that it is the  opinion of the majority of our people. At this time, however, I  am only the administrator of a farm and cannot expect anyone to  consider my point of view. From the deputy's rostrum, however, I  will have an opportunity to state my views in the most emphatic  terms.    [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, do you want our state to be a  presidency or a parliamentary state?    [Dovgan] A parliamentary state is the only correct choice.  There would be less confusion. We elected a president, and he  does not know what to do.... He let the whole economy collapse.  Furthermore, there is always the danger of dictatorship.    [Dymov] What about the Navy?    [Dovgan] Keeping a navy is as inconvenient from the economic  standpoint as keeping missiles. We have to find a common  language with the Russians right away. Uniting with them in a  single state will not work anymore. Today Russia has as many  problems as we do. The economy there is even more distressed,  and the crisis is even more severe.... There is not even enough  money to pay wages. Nevertheless, we have to work together to  forge a new type of relationship. We have to recover the sales  markets we lost as soon as possible. Furthermore, we lost huge  markets "without a battle"--the Russian, Caucasian, Central  Asian, and Baltic markets. What was the result? All production  stopped.    [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, major policy objectives are  important over the long term. Today people are worried about  vital aspects of life. The main one is land reform. What kind of  advantages will it produce? What kind of adjustments does it  need to work?    [Dovgan] The reform the present members of parliament  dreamed  up will not make the state rich. On the contrary, it will hurt  agriculture. It was forced on us by outside influences. I am  basing this conclusion partly on data cited by the Belarusian  Academy of Sciences back in the beginning of the 1990s.  According to these data, the normal operation of a farm required  50 million karbovantsy for every 50 hectares. This was a  considerable sum of money at that time. It was equivalent to the  gross profits of a farm for five years. In other words, if this  amount had been issued to each kolkhoz--but where would this  money have come from even then?--it would have been possible to  build communism in a single year even without the family farm  movement. For this reason, what they are doing with the land  today is a shaky endeavor.    What kind of solution does our party propose? We feel that  the land being worked by kolkhozes and sovkhozes, along with the  10 percent allocated for family farms, should be divided equally  among all of the inhabitants of each rural community. Title to  this land should be transferred to the people by government  decree. As a rule, the land should be worked collectively. After  all, the tendency toward consolidation even exists abroad.  Leasing or selling the land makes no sense, because 20 percent  of it would have to be used just for boundaries. If our plan is  carried out, each person will be a property owner--not in the  abstract or hypothetical sense, but in the real sense of the  term. In other words, I will earn dividends on my land. If I  should have to move, I will receive proper compensation for my  share of the land and then use it to acquire new land when I  move to another oblast. If there is no available share, I can  get a job and wait for my turn. In any case, a person should  have the right to this kind of "exchange." It should be secured  and protected by law. A parcel would be allocated to each person  only once, to prevent attempts to corner the market and other  abuses. Incidents of this kind have already been reported. For  example, one zealous farmer acquired land simultaneously in  three neighboring oblasts....    [Dymov] Will this violate the principle of private  ownership?    [Dovgan] That is the least of my worries. I am in favor of  collective ownership, which is the basis of private ownership.  This engenders a kind of hybrid of "mine" and "ours," and this  is normal. After all, neither capitalism nor socialism exists in  its pure form.    [Dymov] Each administrator in our country has rights and  obligations, but is it not time to institute personal  responsibility as well?    [Dovgan] Yes, a great deal depends on the personality of the  individual. There is an art to the hiring and placement of  personnel, but now everything is left to run its own course. I  recent visited a farm where the administrator--who is even  younger than I am--had already managed to build a road,  processing shops, and a school. The local malcontents, however,  had made life so miserable for this man that he resigned. We  have to learn to take good care of our personnel. Furthermore,  we have to draft a set of criteria and precise standards of  professional advancement. There is good reason that a person who  wants to run a farm abroad has to have the necessary skills and  a college degree.    As far as responsibility is concerned, I think it should be  required at every level. Today, in my opinion, top-level  officials are the most likely to abuse their power. As long as  they are "inviolable," it will be impossible to restore order.    [Dymov] How do you feel, Sergey Vasilyevich, about the  refusal to let party leaders participate in televised campaign  debates?    [Dovgan] We have no problem with this. I am even happy that  the young men who were monopolizing the screen have now been  pushed out of the way. That is their problem. They are afraid to  talk to the people directly. No one in the labor collectives  hears them or sees them. Incidentally, when I address the  peasants of our district and tell them about our party platform,  they applaud and say they will not vote for the gentlemen who  come here from Kiev. We will give them our bread, meat, and  milk--just let them mind their own business and not keep us, the  people of the land, from being our own masters. Our party was  founded expressly to defend the peasants. The country is our way  of life and our cradle.    [Dymov] Excuse me, Sergey Vasilyevich, but if you become a  deputy, you will have to leave your home and move to the  "asphalt jungle," to an apartment in the capital, and say  goodbye to your collective.    [Dovgan] That does not scare me. After all, I will not be  leaving forever. If everyone stayed home, who would defend our  interests on the highest level? As for the apartment, a law  should be passed right away to give deputies the use of only  official housing. At the end of the deputy's term, he should  return the key, get on the train, and go back home.    [Dymov] What are the immediate concerns of your  constituents?    [Dovgan] The state has not paid the peasants for delivered  products, there is no money in the state accounts, and there is  no money to pay wages. The local buses are not running because  there is no fuel. There is no fuel for the sowing season either.  The whole social sphere in the countryside has been "stifled."  People cannot ride to the hospital, and even if they can get  there, there is no medicine. You can see big problems wherever  you look. Nevertheless, I am certain that the people will come  out to vote, to support us, the representatives of the Peasant  Party, because they believe that we will not lead them astray,  that we are the only ones who can make changes for the better.</p>

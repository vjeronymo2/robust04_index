			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> HEARING ON ELECTRICITY RATES  </P> <P> The Board of Directors on Tuesday scheduled a public hearing on a proposed  electric rate hike that would increase the average household's monthly bill by  $1.96.  </P> <P> The board will listen to public testimony on the matter beginning at 7 p.m.  during its meeting Tuesday.  </P> <P> Under the proposed change, a typical single-family home using 400 kilowatt  hours of electricity monthly would pay $35.42, a $1.96 increase from the  current $33.46 charge. A commercial customer using 2,000 kilowatt hours per  month and now paying $173.90 would pay $187.15.  </P> <P> The increase, slated to take effect May 1, would enable the city-run electric  utility to partially fund a two-year, $39.8-million capital improvement  program. In addition, the increase would help fund the transfer of $6.4 million  from the Power Fund to the General Fund next year.  </P> <P> In a related action, the board tentatively approved an ordinance setting such  yearly transfers at 8% of the gross retail income of the Power Fund.  Previously, the amounts of such transfers have fluctuated based in part on city  operating needs.  </P> <P> However, the city's Utility Advisory Commission asked directors last year to  set a more consistent transfer amount in order to ensure the financial  independence and stability of the city's Water and Power Department.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, the General Fund would receive $6.4 million next year,  $7.7 million in 1992 and up to $9.7 million in 1995. Final approval requires a  second vote of the board.  </P></p>

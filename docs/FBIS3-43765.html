Acting permanent secretary in the Ministry  of Commerce and Industry, Vincent Selato, said Botswana had  completed the formal procedures to join GATT and accepted the  obligations of membership last month.    Mr Selato said Botswana would now receive all benefits of  the  information and analysis of world trade developments prepared by  the GATT secretariat.    Full membership indicated to other trading partners and  investors that Botswana was now prepared to take a full role and  obligations in developing its new trade policy, Mr Selato said.  "This message will be important for foreign investors who may  wish to establish in Botswana to supply foreign markets and  utilise foreign intellectual property and services".    About the possible impact of joining GATT on the local  textile industry, Mr Selato said the formal accession to GATT  would have no impact on the competitive position of the textile  industry, since Botswana was already subject to GATT obligations  through Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and South Africa's  membership in GATT.    He said the conclusion of the current GATT negotiations  might  have some impact on the textile industry in two ways:    -- firstly, many of the clothing exports from Botswana to  non-SACU countries arose because low cost producers in other  countres were limited by quotas from exporting more to European  and North American markets.    "The GATT negotiations initiated a process to phase out  these  quotas and replace them with general tarrifs in the importing  countries", he said. He added that when this happens the low  cost producers "will again be able to ship unlimited amounts to  those countries, and will compete very strongly with Botswana's  exports".    -- Secondly, the new GATT agreement would probably involve  some lowering of tariffs on textile and clothing imports into  the SACU region depending upon the outcome of last minute  negotiations between GATT members and South Africa. "This may  also lead to additional competition within the SACU market for  local producers. In the short term, GATT membership will mean  very little to the small man.    "Over a longer period of time, however, the more secure  access to foreign makets, including those in SACU, should lead  to more investment, more employment, a higher rate of income  growth and a more secure level of income for the small man.    "It will take time for the benefits of Gatt memberhip to  mature". He said local business would continue to have the  protection of SACU tarrif against large foreign companies  outside the SACU. "Although this tarrif will be lowered to some  degree as a result of the current GATT negotiations, it will  still provide very substantial protection.    "Ultimately, the best protection against large foreign  companies is to improve productivity through better training,  more efficient work practices and more modern technology and  management.    "Lower costs and improved quality of output are the only  real  protection for local businesses".    Mr Selato said all Botswana's major trading partners  including those in the SACU were already GATT members.</p>

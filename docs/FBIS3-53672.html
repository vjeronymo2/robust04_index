			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "New Syrian Role"] </F>   [Text] The agreements and understandings reached at the  Geneva summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S.  President Bill Clinton will lay the foundation for a new and  different role for Damascus in the Arab region as a whole. They  will also lay the foundations for a new U.S.-Syrian relationship  as important as Egyptian-U.S. relations, if not more important.    President al-Asad has never opposed a settlement, otherwise  he would not have gone to Madrid under a formula much smaller  than the international conference formula proposed by the late  Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev. But he wanted something much  more than a settlement. He wanted a stronger relationship with  Washington, which is now the sole superpower in the world. He  aspires to a new regional role through this relationship --  which explains his agreement to participate in the bilateral  negotiations arising from the Madrid formula, and his refusal to  participate in multilateral regional negotiations.    What is certain is that President al-Asad must have  encountered satisfactory answers from the U.S. President to many  of his demands in this connection for him to agree to full  normalization with Israel, which means open borders and a  diplomatic and trade exchange in return for an Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the presence of U.S.  observation forces there.    The Geneva meeting -- which lasted five hours, of which 90  minutes were devoted to a closed meeting between the two leaders  without the accompanying delegations -- was the culmination of  the previous agreements reached during U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's tours of the region, the most recent of  which was last month. It is unreasonable to accept the theory  that the understanding was reached in Geneva. Because there was  insufficient time to discuss details of complex regional and  local issues. The time was sufficient to bless the new  agreements and scenarios reached and to tackle what could have  been points of disagreements in previous talks.    It is wrong to rush to make definite judgments based on a  quick reading of some press statements made after the historic  meeting, or to interpret some phrases in different ways.  Patience helps here to determine the truth. The coming days  will reveal many details, whether during the bilateral  negotiations and through the positions of the parties  participating in them, or through the Syrian Government's  positions on numerous matters, especially the opposition to the  Gaza-Jericho agreement and ways of dealing with the PLO and the  factions opposed to it.    Theoretically, after the Geneva meeting all disagreements  between the PLO leadership and the Syrian Government should  disappear. This is because everyone is now rallying under the  banner of the U.S. settlement and has agreed to normalize with  Israel and to deal with its government as an original party in  the region, and no opposition to this new Palestinian-Syrian  orientation has any place in Damascus, at least in the  foreseeable future.    If this theoretical assumption is correct, the "veto"  expressed by the Syrian Government against coordination with the  PLO should be lifted after the Geneva meeting, and contacts  should resume between the two sides at the highest levels in  order to benefit from the new agreements so as to reactivate the  peace process on all fronts, especially on the  Palestinian-Israeli track, which experienced obstacles and  deliberate delays in the run-up to the Geneva summit.    Damascus -- which led the Arabs to the war, disagreed with  those whom it thought were for a settlement, and allied itself  with anyone who opposed it -- finds itself today in a new  position at the head of the camp of peace and normalization with  Israel -- which will give rise to numerous questions about its  old alliances, especially with Iran, and its old hostilities  toward Iraq. Will we see Iraqi-Iranian rapprochement against  the new Syrian role, or Iraqi-Syrian rapprochement against the  clear Iranian hostility toward peace and normalization with  Israel?!    The coming days will be full of surprises, and perhaps full  of the political contradictions for which the region is known.</p>

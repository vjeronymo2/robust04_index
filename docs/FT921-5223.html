			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Meggitt to expand in US with Dollars 53m buy MEGGITT, the Dorset-based specialist engineering group, is to strengthen its aerospace activities by buying Endevco, a US company which makes electronic equipment and pressure sensors, for Dollars 53m (Pounds 30.1m) cash. The vendor is Allied-Signal, a US group which supplies the aerospace and automotive industries. Endevco employs 600 people and has two sites in California, with additional manufacturing operations in the US Virgin Islands and France. It also has sales operations in the UK, France, Germany and China. Last year Endevco made pre-tax profits of Dollars 5.5m on sales of Dollars 55m. Net assets at December 31 were Dollars 25m. Mr Ken Coates, chairman of Meggitt, said Endevco's market position and financial strength made it an ideal acquisition for Meggitt as it developed the group's core activities in aerospace and industrial sensors. Meggitt has net cash after a Pounds 39.6m rights issue in September, and its gearing will remain in single figures after the acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval. Mr Coates said the deal would increase the US balance of Meggitt's business from about 30 to 35 per cent.</p>

"To free the Chinese, the three Yemeni kidnappers want the  government to cancel death sentences pronounced against them in  absentia," early in January, second secretary at the embassy Luo  Xiao Guang told AFP.    The kidnappers are wanted for several murders, Yemeni  sources  said Monday.    "No progress was made by the authorities in their talks with  the kidnappers," he said.    One of the hostages is chief engineer Yang Yi [name as  received], 55, according to the diplomat, who did not name the  two others.    The hostages are held by members of the Khawlan tribe in  Hajana region, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Sanaa, he added.    To win their release, the embassy is in contact with the  Ministries of Interior and Planning, and with influential  Khalwan tribesmen as well, he said.    The engineers were kidnapped Saturday while working on a  road  project financed by China to link Hajana and Ma'rib, 173  kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, in the rugged and  tribal northeast.    The kidnappers also said they wanted the road construction  to  stop but they did not explain why, the Chinese diplomat said.  Almost the third of the road has already been built, he added.    The Chinese were kidnapped the same day that Ahnum tribesmen  in the country's northwest freed three French tourists they had  held for 20 days in a bid to force the government to build a  road through their region.</p>

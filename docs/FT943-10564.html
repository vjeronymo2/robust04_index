			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television This is to be the year of the Lucan. Twenty years ago come November Lord Lucan tried to kill his wife and killed his children's nanny instead. He then disappeared. He is almost certainly dead but the absence of a body, and the fact that Lucan had rich and influential friends, has given gossipmongers a field day. True Stories; Dead Lucky (Channel 4 at 9.30) is the first of an avalanche of speculative programmes. This is a tabloid kind of evening, with another subject more usually found in the popular press. In the late 1970s burly George Roberts became Julia Grant. His sex change operation, and adjustment to his new life, was filmed by a television crew. Now the cameras return to discover how Julia has fared during her time as a woman. A Change of Sex (BBC 2 at 9.30) starts with a repeat of the 1979 programmes. In its early years there was always one night at the Proms devoted to Wagner. To celebrate the 100th year this tradition is revived as the BBC National Orchestra of Wales kicks off with the most performed piece at the Proms, the overture to Tannhauser (BBC 1 at 10.35).</p>

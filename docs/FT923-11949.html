			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: US side holds Prudential back EXCHANGE RATE factors restricted Prudential, the UK life assurance company, to a slight fall in new business during the first six months of this year, according to figures released yesterday. In sterling terms, worldwide annual premium business fell slightly to Pounds 310m (Pounds 315m) while single premiums were static at Pounds 1.84bn. Both figures would have shown an increase in constant exchange rate terms. Interest centred on the figures for Jackson National, the US life insurance company which Prudential bought in 1986, where new business figures fell sharply. In sterling terms, annual premiums fell from Pounds 48m to Pounds 30m, and single premiums from Pounds 851m to Pounds 519m. Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive, said: 'Low US interest rates have made the market for fixed interest annuity products much more difficult. However, the decline also reflects a planned slow-down by Jackson in the sales of term assurance business.' Analysts had been worried that Jackson, a market-driven company, had been expanding too fast, and welcomed these figures, although US business dropped more than had been expected. Jackson concentrates on term assurance because it offers an easy way for its sales representatives to make new contacts. However, the Prudential said that it was unhappy with the low profit margins generated by the business, and with the high initial commissions paid to salesmen. It was therefore glad to see the amount of term business decrease. Annuities also suffered. Annuity rates tend to be closely linked to base rates, which are low in the US. This has prompted investors to buy mutual funds - the US equivalent of unit trusts. The Prudential said 'the rates on offer from the annuity bond were quite attractive. It's just a fashion in the US for mutual funds.' Mr Roman Cizdyn, analyst at Smith New Court, said 'it's quite right and proper that you should get a slow down at Jackson National at some time, and make some profit from it. It's shareholder owned and shareholders expect to get something back.' Jackson's figures concealed strong growth in the UK, where annual premium business increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 172m - following a slight fall over 1991 as a whole - while single premiums increased 56 per cent to Pounds 1.06bn. The figures were in part aided by the recession as consumers made conservative investment decisions. The Prudence Bond, a heavily marketed single premium with profits product, took in Pounds 350m and helped single premiums for life and general annuity products to increase almost fivefold from Pounds 63m to Pounds 361m.</p>

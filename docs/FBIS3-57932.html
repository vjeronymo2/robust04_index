			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] An article by Takis Mikhas in the 14  December Athens left-of-center daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA discusses  the two factions taking shape within the New Democracy (ND)  party in opposition to new party leader Miltiadhis Evert.  According to Mikhas, the factions have been nicknamed the  "weasels" and the "porcupines." Among the "weasels" are  included party officials who disagree with Evert's allegedly  "soft" opposition to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)  government. This group is not homogeneous, and encompasses  extreme rightists such as ND deputy Kammenos, followers of  former Minister of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis such as ND  deputy Fani Palli-Petralia, and even a number of deputies who  usually follow Evert's lead such as deputies Karatzaferis and  Mikhaloliakos. The "weasel" faction's only common thread is  hardline partisanship, defined by Mikhas as "protection of our  own [ND] people."    The "porcupine" faction, which includes ND luminary Andreas  Andrianopoulos, is more dissatisfied with what it perceives to  be a lack of goals and principles in Evert's policy. This  faction criticizes the spirit of the new party leadership and  the "language" it uses, which it views as "passe" and "boring."  According to Mikhas, "porcupines" are above all concerned that  Evert is leading the party to ideological marginalization.    In the 14 December ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Yiannis Politis contends  that ND opposition to Evert stems primarily from ideological  differences. The free-market "liberal" faction headed by  Andrianopoulos and former Minister of Finance Stefanos Manos  openly disapproves of Evert's "popular capitalism" in which  public companies remain in the hands of the state and his  acceptance of "natural monopolies." A number of ND deputies  also dissent from Evert's practice of "consensual politics" and  would prefer a tougher stance against the government. Politis  reports that one of these deputies, former Minister of Interior  Yiannis Kefaloyiannis, never misses an opportunity to criticize  Evert. An important source of intraparty discontent is Evert's  refusal to discuss the reasons for the ND's defeat in the last  parliamentary elections, Politis writes. The strongest internal  attack against Evert, however, was the accusation leveled by  former Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhalis Papakonstandinou  that the ND leader had failed to promote Greek interests on the  Skopje/Macedonia issue during his first European appearance in  Brussels. Evert's reaction to the accusation was swift, Politis  reports. Papakonstandinou was stripped of all party functions  and prerogatives. The move is seen as an attempt to squelch  intraparty opposition and to abort the rise of contesting  factions within the ND.</p>

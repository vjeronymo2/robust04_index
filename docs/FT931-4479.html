			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Tory MPs signal backing for wider VAT in Budget CONSERVATIVE MPs have signalled that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has a free hand to extend value added tax, cut mortgage interest relief and freeze income tax allowances to narrow the yawning gap in the government's finances. But an FT survey reveals that the chancellor is under strong pressure from the government's supporters at Westminster to balance austerity for consumers in next Tuesday's Budget with measures to boost industrial confidence and investment. A large majority of Tory MPs want him to spread the pain of deficit reduction by imposing fresh cuts in Whitehall spending plans. Around half want him to sweeten the pill with a post-Budget cut in interest rates. The survey suggests that while any increase in income tax rates would risk a backbench revolt, the Tory party is ready to accept a wide range of other measures to boost the Treasury's revenues. A favourable reception to the Budget from its own side will be critical if the government is to begin to restore its battered authority after this week's defeat on the Maastricht treaty. The row over Europe has left the government's control over its own supporters weaker than at any time since the 1970s. The FT survey, based on written replies from 85 Tory MPs, representing a third of the government's backbench strength, underlines also the Budget's crucial importance for Mr Lamont's own reputation. Nearly two-thirds judge his performance as chancellor as 'fair' or 'disappointing'. Only 6 per cent say he has done an 'excellent' job. The survey coincides with a hardening of opinion within the cabinet in favour of immediate action to reduce the deficit. Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr John MacGregor are among senior ministers supporting a package of tax increases. Mr Lamont, however, can draw comfort from a widespread recognition among Conservatives at Westminster that next week's Budget will foreshadow tough measures to reduce the public sector deficit. Promoting the recovery, helping industry and tackling unemployment are cited by an overwhelming majority as the main priority for the Budget package. But most judge also that the chancellor must get to grips with the borrowing requirement. Some 56 per cent of Tory MPs favour higher taxes, with more than half of those seeking immediate action. The deficit is deemed sufficiently threatening by 30 per cent for them to call for tax increases both next week and in the November Budget. Among the key results of the survey are: Mortgage interest relief, once sacrosanct, is regarded by 53 per cent as a target for savings. Nearly two-thirds of Tory MPs want a fresh round of public spending cuts. Nine-tenths want special measures to help industry and promote investment.

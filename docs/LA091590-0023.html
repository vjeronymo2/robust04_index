			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAN'T UNDERSTAND USC FOOTBALL PRIORITIES  </P> <P> In August, the Times reported that three USC freshman football players have  been accused of sexually assaulting a female grad student, and that Coach Larry  Smith had suspended the three players.  </P> <P> Yet, in the Sept. 11 Times I read that one of the three players was in the  starting lineup in the season opener against Syracuse, replacing a player who  was late for a team meal.  </P> <P> I am a die-hard Trojan fan, but I can't support a team that would promote a  player who is accused of sexually assaulting a woman because they want to  punish a player who was late for a team meal. Strange priorities at USC.  </P> <P> CHRIS CLARK  </P> <P> San Marino  </P> <P>  Editor's note: The Times reported that the three players were put on  probation, not suspended, pending completion of an investigation by the Los  Angeles City Attorney's office. That investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> </P></p>

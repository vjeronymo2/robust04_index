In no event may the introduction of social need factors decrease such funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A standard procedure is proposed for identifying the PSA's with the highest concentrations of low-income minority older individuals. After the State ranks the PSA's based on the proportion of low-income minority older individuals to all older individuals in the PSA, those PSA's with the highest proportion of low-income minority individuals which, taken together, contain 51 percent of all low-income minority older individuals in the State shall be, for the purposes of this rule, considered the PSA's with the highest concentrations of low-income minority older individuals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4150&hyph;04&hyph;M  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d640 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEP17MR94.000 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4150&hyph;04&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

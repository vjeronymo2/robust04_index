			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: French sweets go to US group A PIECE of French gastronomic tradition yesterday passed into American hands when Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceutical group, acquired Cachou Lajaunie, maker of the famous cachou sweets the French nibble to freshen their breath after garlicky meals. The vendor is Pierre Fabre, the cosmetics group which acquired Cachou Lajaunie in 1989 and subsequently pushed the company through a period of rapid expansion. Cachou Lajaunie expects to sell 12m boxes of sweets this year. Pierre Fabre, best known for its Klorane and Aveze cosmetics brands, has pursued aggressive product development for Cachou Lajaunie, notably by introducing a successful line of mint-flavoured cachous. Cachou Lajaunie's turnover has doubled from FFr17m in 1989 to an estimated FFr35m (Dollars 6.1m) this year. One of the largest remaining family-controlled companies in the French pharmaceuticals industry, Pierre Fabre expects turnover this year to total FFr5bn. Its disposal of Cachou Lajaunie is part of plans to concentrate on mainstream cosmetics and pharmaceutical interests. Pierre Fabre is also keen to raise capital to augment research activities. Warner-Lambert has bought Cachou Lajaunie for an undisclosed sum through Parke-Davis, its confectionery subsidiary. Parke-Davis employs 1,000 people. The US group already has significant confectionery interests in France. It acquired Vichy, the French brand of pastilles, in 1989, and bought Clorets chewing gum in 1991. The takeover of Cahou Lajaunie cements an already close relationship between the two companies.</p>

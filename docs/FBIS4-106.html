The talks lasted about half an hour  and the two ifficials spoke about the possible implementation of  technological relations between Angola and the DPRK. At present  the DPRK is facing a difficult political and military situation  in connection with the dispute with the United States and South  Korea over the dismantling of nuclear arms.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] At present  what is the DPRK's position?    [Pak] Recently the United States sent patriotic missiles to  South Korea, and our position depends on the behavior of the  United States. If they want to hold talks we are ready for  them, but if they choose a drastic measure against our country  we will respond in kind. We do not fear war; we can face the  United States.    [Pinnocky] A joint commission will meet in Pyongyang where  identified projects will be presented as well as others. [end  recording]</p>

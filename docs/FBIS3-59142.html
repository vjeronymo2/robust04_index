Speaking in Bonn on  Wednesday [26 January] at the conclusion of a three-day  conference involving 21 German ambassadors from countries from  the region, Kinkel referred to a 10-point catalogue on  German-Asia policy. This stresses that, in view of low budget  funds, there had to be more efficient use of the available  personnel and organizational resources in German missions abroad  when it came to relations with Asia.    The conference was devoted to the implementation of the Asia  plan adopted by the Federal cabinet in December.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Tuesday [1 March], the  trade unions in the public services have strongly extended their  federal warning strikes. According to the Union of Public  Services, Transport, and Communications Workers (OeTV), in  Berlin alone some 100,000 employees participated in the protest  actions. According to OeTV's headquarters in Stuttgart, some  50,000 employees in the public services participated in the  token strikes on the previous day. The warning strikes are  intended to exert pressure on employers to present an offer in  the next round of talks on 9 March.    In Berlin and the Brandenburg capital Potsdam the warning  strikes widely paralyzed public transport on Monday morning.  [passage omitted]    In Lower Saxony, the trade unions appealed to some 10,000  employees in the public service to down tools. In the metal and  engineering industry of the land, the ballot whether to stage a  regular strike started with the early shift. Almost 50,000  organized metal workers in 230 enterprises will be asked to cast  their vote by Thursday. A possible job action has to be  supported by 75 percent.    Representatives of the IG Metall trade union once more said  that they expected an "overwhelming" majority to vote in favor  of a strike. The employers have meanwhile emphasized their  readiness to return to the negotiating table immediately. Klaus  Murmann, president of the Federal Association of German  Employers' Association, has warned that a strike would destroy  the basis for economic recovery. Those who now go on strike do  not only put their own jobs at risk but make the creation of new  jobs in the new laender more difficult, Murmann said.</p>

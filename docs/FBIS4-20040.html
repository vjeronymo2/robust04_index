			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the North </F> Rhine-Westphalian FDP, by Rolf Kleine; place and date not given:  "Moellemann: `He Who Acts Will Make Mistakes!'"]    [Text] [Kleine] At the Free Democratic Party [FDP] land  congress you were reelected chairman with 59.6 percent of the  vote -- your worst result?    [Moellemann] He who wants to make a mark for himself will  also make mistakes and have critics! This is also true for me.  One has to live with it. Besides, results of 90 percent are  abnormal for democracies. More dangerous than the decrease in  support in the election of a land chairman is the sustained loss  of votes achieved by the FDP in elections. The question is:  How can we surmount this low point?    [Kleine] How can you?    [Moellemann] The FDP must make it clear that we will no  longer put up with the enormous increase in our horrendous  national debts! Moreover, we must stimulate the economy and  create jobs. And the FDP must advocate more strongly the  reduction of bureaucracy: Fewer ministries! Fewer deputies!  Fewer laender!    [Kleine] Is this a coalition offer to the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD]?    [Moellemann] No! The SPD does not really want to reduce  bureaucracy and really cut corporate taxes. Yet, one thing is  true: There are no major differences on central issues between  the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the SPD.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BLACK MORTALITY GAP: CAUSES STILL ELUSIVE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: EQUAL INCOMES AND QUALITY MEDICAL CARE WOULD STILL LEAVE MINORITIES  WITH A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF PREMATURE DEATHS, RESEARCHERS CONCLUDE.  </P> <P> The high rate of premature deaths among black Americans is the result of so  many different causes that even if high quality health care were equally  available to whites and blacks and incomes were equal, 31% of the gap would  remain, according to a study being published today.  </P> <P> In a 13-year survey of some 8,806 black and white adults, researchers at the  federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta found that just under one-third  of the difference in death rates between the races -- which are 149% higher for  blacks between the ages of 35-54 than whites -- can be attributed to the higher  incidence of preventable risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol  level, weight, smoking, alcohol intake and diabetes.  </P> <P> If blacks and whites were equal in all these risk factors but not in income,  the study found, 69% of the difference in mortality rate would remain.  </P> <P> Differences in income, the study found, accounted for 38 of those 69 percentage  points. In other words, if black and white samples were chosen from groups with  equal incomes, that one factor would erase 38% of the mortality difference.  </P> <P> Poverty, which afflicts blacks disproportionately, is known to limit access to  health care and, the researchers noted, may contribute to a disease by imposing  greater stress.  </P> <P> A final 31% of the mortality difference could not be attributed to any known or  measurable cause. Among such factors are presumed to be differences in  environment, heredity and life style.  </P> <P> The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., appears to  complicate the already difficult question of why the health of black Americans  appears to be steadily deteriorating relative to whites.  </P> <P> For example, in 1986 -- the last year for which figures are available -- black  life expectancy declined for the second year in a row, falling to 69.4 years,  5.4 year less than the average white life expectancy.  </P> <P> By giving broad weight to economic factors -- which it says account for 38% of  the difference in black and white death rates -- and other unknown  considerations, the study appears to suggest that only part of the solution to  the mortality gap may lie within the power of the medical community.  </P> <P> "Broader social and health system changes and research targeted at the causes  of the mortality gap, coupled with increased efforts aimed at modifiable risk  factors, may all be needed for egalitarian goals in health to be realized," the  study stated.  </P> <P> The study compared the health profiles and histories of 7,573 whites and 1,233  blacks taken from health surveys conducted from 1971 to 1975 and then again  from 1982 through 1984.  </P></p>

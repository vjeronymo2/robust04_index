			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Power given to the regions THERE ARE two main elements to yesterday's announcement on restructuring regional aid - the pooling of the resources of a number of government departments in a single budget and the creation of a new administrative structure for parcelling out grants to the English regions. Six government departments - the Home Office and the departments of trade and industry, environment, education, employment and transport - will pool their separate regional aid programmes. Transport will not put any resources into the pool, but will draw from it. Some 20 regional development programmes will come under the control of a new cabinet committee from April next year. It will have a budget of about Pounds 1.4bn. But a key element of the reforms will be the creation of 10 regional offices to administer the aid. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said the existing network of government regional offices would be merged and the area offices would administer the new single budget and all other departmental programmes. Each office will be headed by a senior regional director who will be responsible for the expenditure programme in their area, providing 'a more comprehensive and accessible service' to local people. Mr Gummer said the reform would make government 'more accessible and responsive'. It would ensure that priorities were set locally and give local people more influence over spending. The reform met with scepticism from opposition MPs, who feared it may mask big cuts in regional development grants in the unified Budget later this month. 'As the packages get even glossier the money gets ever smaller,' said Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary. Mr Gummer also launched an invitation to civic and business leaders in London, Birmingham and Manchester to define what practical steps they want to take on urban regeneration. Ministers were particularly impressed by the way that Manchester's bid for the Olympics in 2000 created new alliances between business, community groups and the local authorities to improve the city. The Corporation of London yesterday welcomed the initiative.  --------------------------------------------------- POOLING RESOURCES: HOW THE AID WILL BE CHANNELLED  --------------------------------------------------- Department of the Environment  -Estate Action  -Housing Action Trusts  -City Challenge/Urban Programme  -Urban Regeneration Agency  -Urban Development Corporations  -Task forces  -City Action  --------------------------------------------------- Department for Education  -Grants for education support and training (part)  --------------------------------------------------- Home Office  -Safer Cities Section 11 grants (part)  -Ethnic Minority Grant  -Ethnic Minority Business Initiative  --------------------------------------------------- Department of Trade and Industry  -Regional Enterprise Grants  -English Estates to be subsumed into the Urban   Regeneration Agency  --------------------------------------------------- Department of Employment  -Programme Development Fund  -Education Business  -Teacher placement service  -Compacts  -Business Start-up  -Local Initiative Fund  -Tec Challenge  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

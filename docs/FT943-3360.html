			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Claremont 18% ahead at Pounds 5.22m Claremont Garments (Holdings), the clothing manufacturer which took over Magellan Industries in April, lifted pre-tax profits by 18 per cent from Pounds 4.42m in the 26 weeks to June 26 1993 to Pounds 5.22m in the 27 weeks to July 2 this year. The Pounds 43.3m all-paper takeover brought together two of Marks and Spencer's leading suppliers and added lingerie and swimwear to Claremont's other womenswear activities. More than 90 per cent of Claremont's production is derived from the UK, and the group supplies about 11 per cent of M&amp;S' clothing stock. Group turnover grew 34 per cent to Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 47.1m), including Pounds 12m from Magellan and Bellrise Fashions, the Next supplier bought for Pounds 1.9m cash. Operating profits rose to Pounds 5.51m (Pounds 4.6m), including a Pounds 577,000 (nil) contribution from the acquisitions. Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, stressed there was no slippage in margins in the 'old' Claremont, and there would be margin improvement in the second half. Mr David McGarvey, managing director, said that due to problems of production planning at Magellan, there had previously been 25 per cent of capacity lost. But now Claremont management and systems had been introduced - prior to the autumn selling season - production slippage was down to 10 per cent and like-for-like turnover had risen 25 per cent. In 1993, Magellan incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 511,000) on turnover flat at Pounds 36.9m. Mr Wiegand reckoned there would be overhead savings of about Pounds 800,000 in the second half from the integration of Magellan, 'with more to come'. Earnings rose to 7.8p (7.3p) basic and to 7.5p (7.1p) fully diluted. The interim dividend is lifted to 4p (3.6p). The shares closed down 10p at 305p.</p>

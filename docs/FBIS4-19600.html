			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F> Christophe Leri, Radio France Frequenza Mora correspondent, in  Corsica on 18 April -- recorded]    [Text] Let us now listen to Francois Leotard. The French  defense minister was on a visit to Corsica this Monday [18  April]. He spoke about the situation in Bosnia, in particular in  the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which is besieged by the Bosnian  Serbs. The issue of this Muslim enclave -- which was declared a  security zone by the United Nations -- has provoked tension  among the great powers. Francois said to Christophe Leri that  he rejected the idea of a Serb victory:    [Leotard] I do not think we can talk of a Serb victory, in  any case certainly not of a military victory, when this victory  means bombing a hospital and chasing away a civilian population  that is disorientated and distraught because of hunger and war.  Rather than a military victory, I think that we can talk of a  moral defeat, which will have significant consequences in Europe  -- which is based on principles that are totally different from  those prevailing in Bosnia at the moment: The integrity of  borders, the respect of the right of nations to  self-determination, the free circulation of people and goods,  the rejection of the prevalence of force on right, the freedom  of people, the dignity of women and children. All these  principles are now totally ignored in Bosnia, also by the Serb  forces, and it is only right for the international community to  question its means, the efficiency of its action, both judicial  and military, and it is obviously facing a genuine test of  truth. I hope it will be able to overcome it.    [Leri] Mr. Minister of State, what is happening in Gorazde  today is a failure for democratic Europe, for the United  Nations, and for NATO, isn't it?    [Leotard] I did not use all those words, as you know. We  have before us something that is a moral defeat, including for  Serbia and for those who are involved. What has been called  ethnic cleansing, the rejection of others, the will to destroy  any others in a geographic and political space, is a moral  defeat. Europeans would be well advised to recall the principle  that they have used as a basis since 1945, that is to say the  opposite of what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the  moment, partly because of the Serb side. It is up to the  international community to know whether it is still based on the  principles that were the basis of the United Nations, and up to  the Europeans to know whether it is still based on those that  have been at the very root of the construction of the continent,  in the West anyway, since the Treaty of Rome.    We, the French, have the largest contingent of UN soldiers  in  that part of the world, and it is our duty to recall that these  principles are still alive, that they are still relevant, and  our diplomacy, now as well as in the past and in the future, is  striving and will strive to have right prevail, the right of the  human person and the right of the international community. This  is difficult, but we will not give up.    [Leri] However, there has been a diplomatic hitch recently  because the cease-fire was broken just after it was signed by  the Serbs. Isn't that a slap in the face for the United  Nations, as I was saying earlier, and also for NATO?    [Leotard] This is nothing new. There have been at least 20  or 30 cease-fires since the beginning of the crisis. They were  later rejected or held up to ridicule. The truth is that  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] officers and forces on the one  hand and diplomats on the other must resume with extraordinary  patience, negotiations that must lead to peace through  negotiations. As we have said on several occasions, there  cannot be a military victory by one side over the other in that  part of the world.    As for the United Nations, the hypothesis of a war against  anyone is out. The United Nations is based on acts of law voted  through by the Security Council, which is based on permanent  members and other nations. May I remind you that these  permanent members, including Russia, voted for Resolutions 824  and 836 unanimously. These resolutions provide for the setting  up of safe areas. One of these safe areas has just been  invaded. The civilian population was chased away or is being  chased away. This is a challenge to international law and to  the international community. It is up to the latter to question  its means, its perspectives, and its judicial tools, and to know  whether it intends to maintain this situation where it is held  up to ridicule.</p>

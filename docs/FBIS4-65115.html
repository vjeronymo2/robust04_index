			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Balladur Launches `Great Debate' on </F> Social Security"]    [Text] Yesterday, Edouard Balladur announced the launch  "this fall" of a "great national debate" on social security  funding, following the submission of the white paper on health  insurance reform. France is a country "in which protection,  deemed vital by the vast majority of the population, could be  regarded as a constraint for the economy," the prime minister  said, but "this constraint must be fully accepted." He  explained that social security had "a great advantage in  preventing risks of social conflagration, which would be  inevitable if this system did not exist." The prime minister  warned that we "must not expect that France, like other large  countries, can create millions of jobs which are paid scarcely  more than one-fourth of the minimum wage...; that is not our  social and political system." Although it is necessary to make  "efforts" to reduce business costs, we must "think" about means  of funding social security by "other methods." Balladur  wondered whether it would be possible to "partly substitute,  add, or replace" the existing funding "based on salaries" by  "methods of funding based on consumption or revenue." This big  fall debate will probably turn this vast and necessary reform  into one of the themes of the presidential campaign, which  Mitterrand's successor will have to implement.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Opec calls emergency meeting after oil prices fall WORLD OIL prices tumbled yesterday to their lowest level since the Gulf war in 1991 as prospects for an accord between the United Nations and Iraq allowing limited oil sales brightened. But the market recovered ground later in the day after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced it would hold an emergency meeting on July 28. Iraq's acceptance over the weekend of long-term UN monitoring of two missile testing sites led market traders to expect an early outcome to separate talks on the sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) of oil to pay for humanitarian aid. Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN arms envoy, said that Baghdad's agreement to monitoring had helped clear away one of the obstacles preventing the full lifting of economic sanctions. An end to sanctions would herald the return of Iraq to the oil market. Prices for North Sea Brent crude to be delivered in September closed in London at Dollars 16.71 a barrel after touching Dollars 15.98. The market was 5 cents higher than Friday's official close, although prices had fallen further in after-hours trading last week. In New York, the August crude futures contract dropped 46 cents to a three-year low of Dollars 16.75 a barrel before bouncing back to Dollars 17.70 on news of the Opec meeting. Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Boston, said: 'It's the worst of all possible worlds for the oil market because of the lack of clarity over what is happening. That will lead to more price volatility over the coming days.' Opec members were galvanised into calling the emergency meeting in Vienna because they are worried about the fall in oil prices and the possible return of Iraq to the well-supplied export market. Mr Jean Ping, Gabon's oil minister and current president of Opec, will embark on a tour of the Middle East tomorrow to consult members. It will be difficult for Opec to plan any decisive action until the terms of an agreement on Iraqi oil sales - if there is one - become known. Opec nations will strongly resist giving up market share by cutting production. Ms Irene Himona, energy analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, the London securities house, cautioned on the outcome of an inconclusive Opec meeting. 'If the organisation emerges with a lack of credibility for the market, then prices could fall as far as Dollars 10 a barrel,' she said. UN ends deadlock on Iraqi weapon sites, Page 3</p>

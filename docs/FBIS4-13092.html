			<p>BFN     [Text] Sukkur (NNI) -- Federal Minister for Defence Aftab  Shaban Mirani has said that Pakistan does not intend to build  the nuclear bomb but, at the same, we would never disband our  muclear programme.    Talking informally to newsmen at his residence here on  Saturday, he strongly refuted speculations that any deal had  been struck with the US on the issue.    He said Pakistan would never accept outside pressure on a  matter related to our country's national security.    He blamed the Opposition's negative role in playing up the  issue as "childish".    He also categorically ruled out reduction in the national  defence budget and added "We had a traditionally aggressive  enemy on our borders which had exploded a nuclear device as far  back as 20 years ago and was only increasing its defence  budget". "How can we ignore this build up?, he asked. [no end  quotes as published]    He said that Pakistan would continue to strive for declaring  our region as a nuclear-free zone.</p>

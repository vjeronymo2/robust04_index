			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Mexico City calls for a mayor A LARGE majority of voters support moves towards greater democracy, according to a plebiscite carried out in Mexico City. In an attempt to put pressure on the Mexican government to accept an elected mayor of Mexico City, more than 300,000 city residents voted on Sunday in a plebiscite on the capital's political future. Preliminary figures showed that among the 10 per cent of those eligible who voted, 85 per cent favour the election of a mayor of Mexico City, 84 per cent supported a local Congress with legislative power, and 66 per cent approved of turning Mexico City into the country's 32nd state. The poll was organised by a disparate group of democratic activists from all the main political parties and civic organisations. It was intended to highlight discontent with the lack of democracy in Mexico's business, cultural and political capital - and indirectly in all Mexico. Those in favour of plebiscite hoped to counter an argument, supported by many in the Mexican government, that there was limited public interest in democratic reform. The organisational success of the plebiscite, and the overwhelming support for the propositions, lends some credence to the argument of the democratic activists. However, a turnout of 10 per cent was lower than the organisers had hoped for. For the most part the initiative had been frowned upon by Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, and received only lukewarm support from the current, unelected mayor, Mr Manuel Camacho. The Mayor of Mexico City is now picked by the president, while the local assembly has no power to write legislation.</p>

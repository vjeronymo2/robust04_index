			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Little progress made at talks on banana trade LATIN AMERICAN and Caribbean banana producers have made little progress in their effort to resolve differences over their approach to the European market. But theyhave agreed to continue their discussions. At a meeting in Belize at the weekend, government leaders and ministers sought to reconcile the Caribbean desire for a continuation of protected access when the single European market is created in just under a year, and the Latin American position that the market should be totally free to all producers. Caribbean producers have said they cannot compete on an open market because their production costs are about one third higher than those of the Latin producers. The European Community has said Caribbean producers will be 'no worse off' than they are now when the single market is created. Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, told the meeting that the banana industry was important to the small economies of the Caribbean islands, and that they needed continued privileged access to guaranteed markets in Europe. Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's foreign trade minister, and Mr Juan Luis Miron, Guatemala's economy minister, said the banana trade should be deregulated and included in the current Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A statement issued after the meeting said the Latin American and Caribbean countries recognised the social and economic value of the banana industry, and said the discussions would continue.</p>

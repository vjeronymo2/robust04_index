Zhukovskyy: "What </F> Is Vladimir Hrynyov, the Man and Politician, Striving For?"]    [Excerpt]    [Question] The Inter-Regional Reform Bloc mentioned above,  one should assume, is that pre-election pony, saddling which,  you want to win the election?    [Hrynyov] Not only win, but, what is most important, strive  for its implementation in life. The people are tired of promises  which have been coming for many years from state offices. Today,  however, it is quite clear that current state power structures  have proven to be profoundly alien to the Ukrainian people and  can no longer bring them anything but poverty and crises.    [Question] Now, six months after your departure, the causes  of the socioeconomic collapse in Ukraine can probably be seen  with greater clarity.    [Hrynyov] I saw them even then and spoke about them quite  frankly. Whether they were seen at the summit is another matter.  Things have gone too far, but I dare assure my countrymen that  it is still not too late to take control of destiny and halt the  descent into an abyss. After all we foresaw what happened--empty  shelves in stores, cold temperatures in the apartments, swift  devaluation of currency, and impoverishment of low-income  citizens. Without losing a single day, a single hour, it is  necessary to halt the disintegration of society and overcome the  degradation of the state and authority. Through our own  experience we became convinced that there is a lack of concern  for man at the highest levels where narrow agency and clannish  interests predominate killing all rational individual  initiative. Only a group of skilled and responsible individuals,  working in a coordinated manner in parliament, in the  government, and in local administrations will be capable of  moving Ukraine away from the precipice, from the brink on which  it stands.    [Question] Reports have appeared in the mass media on a  merger of efforts in that direction by two political  leaders--Hrynyov and Kuchma, or Kuchma and Hrynyov.    [Hrynyov] The order of the names is of no significance  whatsoever. What is important is that we turned out to be  thinking along the same lines. I left a high post being  dissatisfied with it and the same was done somewhat later by  Leonid Danilovich, seeing how legislative and executive  structures were nullifying his sincere efforts. In that critical  situation we pooled our knowledge and experience with the full  potential of the centrist bloc for the purpose of education and  the exertion of an active influence on the course of events. Why  centrist? Both New Ukraine and the PDVU [Party of the Democratic  Revival of Ukraine] as well as today's reform bloc are based on  liberal-democratic centrist positions which means that we will  not accept either the bankrupt pro-communist structures nor some  adventure-prone, in a number of cases national-radical,  aspirations. Our concepts are shared by the union of  industrialists and entrepreneurs which is headed by former Prime  Minister L. D. Kuchma.    Hrynyov believes that the principle that the state exists  for  the people and not vice versa is the bulwark of a civilized  society. The state and its sovereignty are created by citizens  "from the bottom to the top" for the development and protection  of their rights and opportunities and not for their restriction,  which is still far from being eliminated in sovereign Ukraine.  Therefore the scheme: individual--district--(city)--country must  be systematically realized. It is specifically with the aid of  such a scheme that it is possible to utilize skilled  intellectual forces from the regions and adopt decisions in the  interests of the individual.    Having announced creation of the MBR [Inter-Regional Reform  Bloc] Hrynyov and Kuchma are not planning on utilizing it only  for the conduct of the election campaign. By their conviction it  must be a permanently functioning political force capable of  influencing the course of events in Ukraine, including  influence, if you will, through its own faction in parliament,  which is prepared to assume responsibility before society for  the management of regions and the country.    To that end they are engaging in the formation of  pre-election coalitions, working with candidates from among the  regional leaders, elaborating legislative initiatives of the  bloc, and, of course, earnestly preparing suggestions of the  bloc regarding personnel selection. The logic behind activity of  the bloc during the presidential campaign as well, is being  worked out. Both of the leading candidates will perhaps attempt  to enter into an honest competition in this area as well.    Meantime Vladimir Borisovich is working on his candidacy: in  his own district he held more than 40 meetings with voters.    The first MBR conference took place in Kharkov. Its  participants adopted a declaration on the formation of the bloc  and studied the path of Ukraine toward an economic revival, a  civil society and a civilized state. The confederation cited the  disastrous consequences which were brought about by destruction  of the economic space, the fabricated confrontation primarily  with Russia, the isolationist course of the ruling circles of  Ukraine, the "great power" cult, and the expensive military and  political ambitions accompanied by national-patriotic jingoism  of a portion of the society.    Getting better acquainted with the bloc program adopted at  the conference, we become convinced that much in it has been  tried and tested. In studying the problem of transformation of  the state sector of the economy, for instance, the MBR quite  justifiably gives it a role of the principal producer of goods  and a source of revenue for the population. As the inevitable  generator of inflation and an instrument of the destruction of  the economic potential, however, in the opinion of the author of  the programs, the state sector must first of all be subjected to  some well thought-out reforms, without which it is impossible to  create a full-fledged market environment. That is why Hrynyov  favors privatization of state enterprises, and their transition  to various, including corporate, forms of private ownership.  But, he stresses, inevitably with observance of social justice.    Take any point in MBR programs and you will be convinced  that  concern for the individual is of paramount importance here. The  bloc, and naturally, its leaders justly consider that  suppression of inflation cannot be carried out through  limitation of the income of the population or by confiscatory  monetary reforms. The inclusion of land, real estate, and means  of production in the market turnover is a decisive factor in  strengthening the monetary system. One more thing: the personal  funds of citizens in their privatization accounts may amount to  a substantive share of the growth in credit resources. That  would suit the main strategy of the reforms proposed by the  bloc--stabilization not at the expense of the population, but  against a background and on the condition of a rise in its  welfare.    What can one say? It has been a long time since we have seen  such concrete, clear, and farsighted proposals for economic  recovery and resolution of the prolonged crisis.    At the same time pragmatic Hrynyov repeatedly pointed out  the  factor which is capable of nullifying all of the reforms. It is  the psychology of the increasingly impoverished population.  "Just try to conclude that in order to balance the budget and  lower inflation it is necessary to freeze social subsidies," he  said. "Our people, particularly young people, are not used to  living according to their means. They refuse to understand that  the state redistributes only what is produced by the economy.  Therefore it appears necessary to earn the daily bread not  through speculation from vending stands, but in the shops, the  fields, and on the farms." Creation of new jobs and retraining  centers is proposed in case of unemployment.    Vladimir Borisovich is likewise convinced that the conduct  of  social reorientation of the state and the shifting of priorities  in the direction of the population is possible with its regular  briefing on expenditures--state and local--of taxpayers money  with a well-adjusted mechanism of social evaluation of the  quality of work by organs of power at all levels.    The intention of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc to eliminate  political censorship along with social and national prejudice,  and grant citizens the right for recognition of their native  languages and everyday languages, are among the priorities aimed  at the individual, at the protection of his honor and dignity.    Speaking at the first MBR conference V. B. Hrynyov also  presented the main organizational principles underlying the  activity of the bloc. They include such positions as the  creation of an electoral coalition, and a data system for the  communication of central MBR organs with the coalition at the  local levels, work with candidates from the block, elaboration  of a detailed program of economic action, and formation of a  package of priority laws (before entering parliament Brazauskas'  party in Lithuania published 20 drafts and the MBR plans to  utilize that experience).    Hrynyov attaches considerable significance to the decisions  of the second MBR conference which ended yesterday at  Dnepropetrovsk. It was preceded by a sociological monitoring of  the situation in more than 20 districts in eastern and southern  Ukraine. In general participants of the conference coordinated a  platform for the candidates.    Two more points, which allow an understanding of the  prospects should also be noted. It concerns the formation of a  faction at the third bloc conference, but only after the  election, and elaboration of parliamentary tactics. That,  however, will depend on the number of deputies in the bloc. "We  must realize," Hrynyov stressed, "that the influence of  representatives from the regions will be like it is in a  joint-stock company: the number of shares in this faction will  equal the number of deputies elected." And finally, the  structure of the future party. "But more about that later,"  Hrynyov noted, after the faction is formed. Without a party  structure it is impossible to manage the economy and policy. The  bloc understands that very well.    No one is casting doubt on the fact that the activity of the  Inter-Regional Reform Bloc to a large extent has been initiated  by Vladimir Borisovich Hrynyov. Taking into account his personal  qualities--such as constant search for answers to complicated  questions of political and economic life, strict realism, the  desire to work and absence of fear of responsibility, one can  hope that Hrynyov, the man and politician, is preparing to play  his principal role in life in the nearest future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Ministry of Defense in Sanaa; date </F> not given]    [Text] With the help of almighty God, with the bravery of  the heroes of the Armed Forces, and with the cohesion of all the  sons of the people with them, the forces protecting unity and  Constitutional legitimacy are continuing to carry out their  combat duties against the gangs of the forces of renegade,  rebellion, and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party. Their  wrong actions surround them and, therefore, they must be  defeated and must bow to the people's will and their strike  force on all axes and sectors.    On the Abyan-Aden axis, fighting is continuing in several  directions, and the forces of renegade and secession are trying  to send innocent people to certain death to merely gain time,  show empty arrogance, and entertain themselves with destruction,  after the units of the Armed Forces--the forces of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy--tightened the siege and closed all  outlets, and continue to pursue their targets with patience and  accuracy, taking into account the circumstances in the fields of  confrontation on this axis. All the feverish air and naval  attacks have failed. The forces of apostasy and secession  sustained heavy losses as a result of the lack of control of the  collapsing and domineering forces that can think only of their  dark and ominous fate. The brave men in the air defenses  confronted the aircraft of the forces of apostasy and secession,  downing two aircraft. The hostile air attacks did not cause any  losses.    On the Shabwah axis, the heroes in the units of the Armed  Forces are continuing to carry out the duties assigned to them,  and they made great progress in carrying out their missions  after they managed to control the Nisab District as a result of  the great cooperation by the brother citizens, who rushed to  shoulder their responsibility along with their forces--the  forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces  have warmly welcomed a complete battalion of the Hunayshan  Brigade, as well as the members of the police force in the Nisab  District, with all their weapons and military hardware. They  declared they were joining the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimnacy, rejected the conspiracy of secession  and the plan of renegade and rebellion, and condemned the sinful  secessionist elements for what they did to the people, the  homeland, and the Armed Forces and security.    On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the heroes in our Armed  Forces are continuing their progress to carry out the remaining  combat duties on that axis. In this sector, 22 Katyusha bases  were seized. The brave heroes in the brave Air Force continued  to carry out the duties assigned to them with success and  effectiveness. All aircraft returned safely to their bases.    With the continued progress of the forces of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy to confront the remaining forces of  apostasy and secession, out of concern about people's lives, and  to avoid the continuation of the fighting, whose result is  considered as decided in advance in favor of the forces of the  people, unity, and democracy, we renew our call to all officers,  noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers who are still under  the control of the sinful secessionist forces to leave the  positions of hostility to join unity, the people, and the forces  of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. This is the place for  every officer, noncommissioned officer, and soldier in the Armed  Forces. They will find complete understanding of their  situation and the circumstances that forced them to be in  secessionist rebel ranks. They will get all the attention,  care, and status they deserve under the banner of the glorious  Republic of Yemen.    As for the forces of error and darkness, the forces of  secession, fragmentation, and destruction, their fate is known  because the wrath of justice will inevitably reach them. As God  has said: And say: `Truth has now arrived, and falsehood  perished: for falsehood is by its nature bound to perish.  [Koranic verse]    [Signed] The Defense Ministry, Sanaa</p>

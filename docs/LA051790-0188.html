			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER CLEANUP PLAN UNVEILED FOR SAN GABRIEL  </P> <P> With color-coded charts, sophisticated maps, slide shows and exhibits  resembling a school science project, federal and state environmental officials  Tuesday unveiled their $106-million water pollution cleanup plan to a skeptical  San Gabriel Valley audience.  </P> <P> "San Gabriel is a top priority," said Tom Kremer, an official with the  Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco. He spoke to 60 people at the  first of two workshops in El Monte to explain the proposed cleanup of  underground water pollution that has spread across much of the San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> But despite the federal and state officials' lengthy presentations and  assurances of concern, some in the audience were not persuaded. "I feel like  the carpetbaggers are here," said Geoff Nunn, president of the Whittier-based  California Domestic Water Co. "They're just tickling the public fancy.  Promises, promises, promises and nothing delivered."  </P> <P> "This meeting is an exercise in futility," said Don Mauri, a Hacienda Heights  resident and South El Monte business owner.  </P> <P> "We really want to know what you think," said David Cohen of the state Water  Resources Control Board. He urged those in the audience who had strong feelings  to make their comments in writing by the July 20 deadline, when state and  federal officials will assess public reaction to the short-term cleanup  announced last month.  </P> <P> Kremer acknowledged that the problem with toxic pollution in the San Gabriel  Valley, as well throughout America, "is bigger than people realized" a decade  ago.  </P> <P> EPA officials consider the San Gabriel Valley situation to be one of the worst  in the West. So far, the 45 valley water suppliers have continued providing  their 1 million customers with water that meets all state and federal quality  standards. To do so, though, becomes increasingly expensive.  </P> <P> "This problem took 40 to 50 years to get to this stage, and it's going to take  a long time to solve it," said Neil Ziemba, the EPA's project manager for the  San Gabriel Valley, which six years ago was placed on the federal Superfund  list of the nation's 1,200 worst pollution problems.  </P></p>

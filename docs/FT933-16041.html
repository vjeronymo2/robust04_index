			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Japan the key to world economic stability Sir, A change of agenda for the Tokyo G7 meeting is essential if we are to move the world out of unemployment stalemate and public purse insolvency. Once again the political reality of trade liberalisation against the background of world recession will ensure that the requisite domestic restructuring and consequent economic dislocation are neither affordable for the public purse nor politically acceptable at the ballot box. A change in agenda which enhances the international status of the Japanese, the only nation currently able to pump-prime world economic activity, is more likely to succeed than US pressure for managed trade and European pressure for immediate reductions in the Japanese trade surplus. Japanese industrial hegemony and the resultant Dollars 150bn forecast trade surplus may be a destabilising factor in world trade. The Japanese, however, are rightfully proud of their success post Hiroshima. They should not be publicly castigated, but rather shown a new agenda by the G7 leaders which requires Japan to shoulder its share of the cost of global security. Such an initiative would have the Japanese being applauded by the international community for their global statesmanship rather than hounded by our elected representatives because of Japanese industrial superiority. The end of the cold war and the defeat of the heavy hand of communism have brought a greater threat to world security than at any time since President Kennedy faced off the Soviets in the 1960s Cuban missile crisis. The cold war is over but Ukraine is sabre rattling, the nuclear missiles are still in place, the Black Sea fleet has yet to get clear direction and there are more than 20 nuclear reactors in Russia alone, which should be shut down immediately if more Chernobyls are to be averted. Surely this threat to global security is an agenda item which, in our own self-interests, should be the major focus of the G7; an item which national electorates can more readily understand than the dismantling of protective bilateral tariffs on spirits, rice, corn and textiles. The G7 nations have the capacity and the technology to assist the Commonwealth of Independent States in its basic needs and to underwrite global nuclear security, but not through World Bank strait-jackets and trade wars with the Japanese. By allocating geographical areas within the CIS to each G7 member we can move with the speed required to meet the immediacy of CIS needs. Such a programme needs a financial catalyst and the Japanese are in the position to shoulder the costs of materials and technology transfer. To succeed we need to create the agenda and ameliorate the mutual distrust of the Russians and the Japanese which is so manifest in such issues as the ownership of the Kurile Islands north of Japan. What should our elected leaders be pursuing - managed trade and Japanese humiliation or managed security and Japanese willing statesmanship in pump-priming world security and, through it, economic stability? For me, at least, and more importantly for the future of my children, I will vote for the latter. This is the necessary and legitimate contribution of our generation to securing world peace with the added dividend of stimulating world economic activity.

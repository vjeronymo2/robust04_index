The 35-year-old man, who works for a Japanese company, made  this announcement last week on a special program aired by  Beijing television aimed at helping Chinese bachelors studying  or working abroad and returned students who are still single to  find mates.    The hostess, Yang Guang, said that she found out that many  young people studying or working abroad are looking for partners  from within China. However, their dreams often cannot become  true because they live abroad.    "I am waiting for my luck, but it's really not easy," said  29- year-old Lu Qing, who studied law in New Zealand and has  opened a law office in Beijing. "Life abroad is dull. We missed  China and our hometowns every day. After returning to China, I  find my life is colorful and happy."    The 80-minute program presented nine such bachelors, some of  whom were introduced by their family members or friends in  China. Most of them, with master's or doctor's degrees in hand,  have passed their 30th birthday.    In recent years, China has made a series of preferential  policies including the freedom to return and leave again to  encourage students studying abroad to return to China. More and  more students have begun to come back.</p>

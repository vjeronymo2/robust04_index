			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / CBI says steelmakers must be even more competitive Productivity in the UK steel industry is more than 10 per cent above the European average, but steelmakers must become even more competitive, says a report today by the Confederation of British Industry. The industry is performing as well as any in the world, and its success in improving competitiveness should be applauded, says Mr Duncan McKenzie, senior economist with the CBI's National Manufacturing Council. New markets in the AsiaPacific region, China, the Indian sub-continent and Latin America mean the outlook for an increasingly efficient UK steel industry is positive. But the combination of sluggish, recession-hit European markets, which account for nearly two-thirds of UK exports, and the threat of increased competition from eastern Europe and the US meant that the UK industry 'can take nothing for granted'. The CBI report, produced in consultation with the British Iron and Steel Producers Association, highlights how the steel industry has turned itself round in the past 10 years. Mr McKenzie says exports have risen from Pounds 992m in 1981 to Pounds 2.77bn in 1992, with the trade surplus rising from Pounds 412m to Pounds 1.76bn. Continuous casting, widely seen as an indicator of world-class performance, provided 87 per cent of total UK steel production in 1990, compared with only 32 per cent in 1981, and well ahead of the world average of 70 per cent.</p>

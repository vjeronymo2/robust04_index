			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Relief for roads lobby as spending holds up - Transport THE ROADS programme has been saved: so, theoretically, has the Jubilee line to London's Docklands. But public transport users in central London will pay a price for these triumphs in the Department of Transport's settlement. Road spending will not actually rise. But to the relief of the roads lobby and the construction industry - and contrary to speculation - the road spending programme has emerged unscathed at more than Pounds 2bn a year for the next three years. Even that level of spending, however, will not be enough to carry out the transport department's programme of road building to the end of the century. The government therefore intends to produce a green paper early in the new year setting out proposals for involving the private sector. Probably the most interesting - and certainly the most controversial - of these proposals will be the introduction of electronic tolling for trunk roads and motorways. This would eradicate one of the biggest obstacles to private sector toll roads: their inability to compete with public sector roads which are free at the point of use. Other proposals will explore ways in which the government and private sector might work together on projects. One early candidate could be the Birmingham western orbital motorway, a planned private sector toll road at present stymied because the private sector regards it as unviable. Rail projects, too, could benefit from the new approach. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, was yesterday citing the London CrossRail scheme and the planned Channel Tunnel Rail Link as two projects where public and private sectors could get together, though there are at present no indications of how this might be achieved. The relaxation of spending controls on local authority capital receipts could boost local spending on transport - perhaps on one or two of the many light rail schemes presently awaiting funding. Ministers also hope the relaxation will encourage councils to sell off the remaining municipally-owned bus companies and airports. But there was little good news elsewhere on the public transport front. British Rail welcomed a move to allow it to embark on experimental leasing deals involving rolling stock worth Pounds 150m over the next three years; but the tiny increase in its overall budget - from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds 1.49bn next year - is no more than enough to allow it fulfil existing contractual obligations. Much worse hit is London Transport. Having only last year won a big increase in its budget following a monopolies commission report urging more funds to pay for desperately needed investment in the underground, the increase has been almost wholly taken away again. With next year's budget slumping from Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 1.01m, many projects will have to be postponed - among them the long-overdue modernisation of the decrepit Northern line, dubbed the misery line. On a brighter note, part of London Transport's budget is intended to pay for the extension of the Jubilee line to Docklands. But as the government confirmed yesterday, it has still not been able to reach a deal with the administrators of Canary Wharf over their planned contribution of Pounds 400m towards the project's cost, so there is no guarantee that it will go ahead. And if it folds, the money provided for it will revert to the Treasury - not to London Transport. The outlook for CrossRail is also clouded by uncertainty. This east-west London subterranean line linking Paddington and Liverpool stations was supposed to start construction in 1995 and open in 2000. But with the government now talking about getting the private sector involved in the funding of it, fresh doubts about the government's commitment have arisen. Significantly, Mr MacGregor said yesterday: 'It isn't possible to be specific about timing at present.'</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAXICARE TO DISCUSS BUYOUT PROPOSAL WITH PACIFICARE  </P> <P> Managers of Maxicare Health Plans have agreed to meet today with officials of  PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. to hear more about PacifiCare's plan to make a  bid for the Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization, which is  currently operating under federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  </P> <P> The meeting is to "explore their intentions," Maxicare attorney Peter J.  Wolfson said Monday during a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing in Santa Ana on  Maxicare's disclosure statement and plan of reorganization to emerge from  Chapter 11. Although the company agreed to talk to PacifiCare, it doesn't  intend to let that delay Maxicare's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 as soon as  possible, he said.  </P> <P> Maxicare believes that it is essential that the bankruptcy proceedings be  concluded at least by June 25, Wolfson said. Maxicare, which has lost  substantial membership since its March, 1989, bankruptcy court filing, is  seeking to be out of bankruptcy court before the next period when major  employers choose the health plans they will offer to employees.  </P> <P> In a surprise move last week, Cypress-based PacifiCare said it would make a bid  to acquire Maxicare -- a move that would boost PacifiCare's membership by about  50% -- but disclosed no details of a proposed buyout. Maxicare officials said  the company is not for sale and the announcement came just days before a  critical phase of the bankruptcy proceedings was to begin.  </P> <P> In a packed courtroom Monday, U.S. District Court Judge John J. Wilson began to  hear objections to Maxicare's amended plan filed with the court. The hearing  will continue on May 7.  </P> <P> On an issue that has plagued Maxicare since its bankruptcy filing, Wolfson said  the company has agreed to settle with providers who are successful in getting  relief from the court injunction that currently prevents the providers from  directly billing Maxicare members for services provided.  </P></p>

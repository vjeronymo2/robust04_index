			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- The 29th meeting of  the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG] opened here today  after a half-year suspension. The two sides agreed to hold an  airport committee meeting this week.    Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the Chinese side, said  prior to the meeting: There are only a little over three years  left between now and 1997, and there are a lot of problems for  the JLG to discuss. The JLG should speed up its work; however,  that requires efforts from both sides. He said the Chinese side  would bring up some subjects for discussion by the JLG at this  meeting, and the objective is to ensure Hong Kong's smooth  transition.    Today's meeting lasted more than four hours. After it was  over, the two sides announced they had agreed to hold an Airport  Committee meeting of the Sino-British JLG on 24 June.    It has been reported that the current meeting will last  three  days, and the two sides will discuss such subjects as the  military land issue, localization of laws, public servants'  retirement pensions, and the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region] passport issue. The previous JLG  meeting was held in London from 7 to 9 December last year.</p>

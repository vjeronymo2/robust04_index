Additionally, the City of Commerce will house animals at the shelter  under a limited contract with the county. All other animal control  responsibilities will continue to be handled by the City of Commerce.  </P> <P> The Downey Animal Care Center is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and from  8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends.

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors show doubt over Berlusconi - Capital and Credit Mr Silvio Berlusconi may have wowed the Italian public with his slick election campaign but he will have to come up with something more substantial to win over the investors on whom Italy relies to bankroll its budget deficit. 'Is he the right person to lead Italy out of its current crisis?' asks Mr Darren Williams, European economist at Merrill Lynch in London. 'To my mind, Fininvest, his high-growth, highly-indebted company, is a microcosm of Italy and where it has gone wrong over the last 20 years.' The volatile performance of the Italian government bond market last week suggests that investors harbour similar doubts about the media magnate who is poised to take over as Italy's prime minister. On Monday, before the election results were published, the market rallied by nearly three points on rumours that Mr Berlusconi's right-wing alliance would win an absolute majority in the lower house. The market then fell back on fears that he would have difficulty in forming a strong government because of the policy differences between his two coalition partners, the Northern League and the MSI/National Alliance. Bond prices also eased on worries that the new government would sacrifice fiscal restraint for economic growth. Then on Thursday, the market jumped by more than 1 1/2 points on signs of progress in forming a government. Analysts believe Mr Berlusconi will succeed in bringing his partners together but that this achievement will not be enough to protect the market against further volatility. Mr Jose Luis Alzola, southern European economist at Salomon Brothers, says that the risks of investing in Italian bonds are still substantial and will only be reduced if the new government takes tough measures. The most pressing task will be to redress the slippage in Italy's budget deficit which has already overshot its 1994 target of L145,000bn (Dollars 88.71bn) by L15,000bn. 'Part of the shortfall will have to be addressed through a mini-budget . . . the new government will have to reassure financial markets that it will not let the deficit grow again,' says Mr Alzola. Measures to reduce the deficit, either by raising indirect taxes or cutting expenditure, would appear to contradict Mr Berlusconi's electoral promises to cut taxes. 'The market will have to take the tax-cutting talk with a pinch of salt, just as the UK should have done when the Conservatives said they wouldn't raise taxes,' says Mr Williams. Analysts say that if investors are prepared to put up with the volatility which goes hand-in-hand with political uncertainty, Italy's improving economic fundamentals should enable them to make significant gains in Italian government bonds this year. A widespread view that the lira will strengthen against the D-Mark should attract foreign investors in particular. Mr Alzola estimates the lira's purchasing power parity against the D-Mark to be around L875 to the D-Mark, though he believes that the lira will stabilise around L925, up from a current level of L965. 'If the currency approaches L900 to the D-Mark the Bank of Italy will accelerate the pace of its rate cuts to revive domestic demand,' says Mr Alzola. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, says that the downward trend in Italian inflation will enable the Bank of Italy to match the pace of easing by the Bundesbank. He forecasts a fall in the Italian discount rate from 7.5 per cent to 6 per cent by the turn of the year. Mr Williams says that lower interest rates should help Italy to reduce its budget deficit to around 7 per cent of its gross domestic product next year from around 9 1/2 per cent this year. 'That will mean that Italy will come close to the European average of 5 1/2 per cent of GDP for the first time in years,' he says. This is all good news for Italian government bond yields, which Mr Williams expects to fall to 7 1/2 per cent gross by the end of the year from 9 1/4 per cent currently. Mr Alzola forecasts that the yield differential between Italian and German government bonds will narrow to 250 basis points from a current 276 basis points. However, he points out that the risks associated with investing in Italy will prevent the differential from going as low as inflation differentials would suggest.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      INTEREST RATES AT A GLANCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  USA    Japan   Germany   France   Italy      UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Discount        3.00     1.75    5.25     7.00*     7.50    5.25** Overnight       3.44     2.25    5.75     6.00      8.06    5.19 Three month     3.57     2.25    5.56     6.00      8.00    5.25 One year        4.52     2.25    5.31     5.81      8.00    5.62 Five year       6.21     3.27    5.60     5.92      8.80    7.09 Ten year        6.74     3.97    6.32     6.47      9.01    7.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (*)  France-Repo rate.

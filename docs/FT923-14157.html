			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report London's COCOA market forged ahead to close at two-month highs as dealers cited positive technicals and the continued absence of origin sales. Concern about dry weather in the Ivory Coast also prompted some covering of short positions. Bullishness spread after the near September contract broke through resistance at Pounds 603 a tonne, a level that had twice before capped upward moves. 'We're comfortably into money-making levels for origins, but they're still holding back,' one dealer said. Most dealers expected prices to continue their upward path before any concerted origin selling. On the LME ZINC closed off its highs, although the market continued to attract support on price dips, following three-month metal's break above Dollars 1,300 a tonne late on Tuesday. ALUMINIUM continued to be restrained by bearish fundamentals in fully matching the bull trend of other metals. In Chicago MAIZE futures were lower at midday based on beliefs that heavy rains were about to hit Illinois yesterday afternoon. Showers and thunder storms had been forecast yesterday and later in the week, which should provide adequate moisture during the peak growing period.</p>

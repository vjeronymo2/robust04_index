			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: COMPUTERS;  </P> <P> ON-LINE OSCARS  </P> <P> "AWARD-WINNING Films of the Silver Screen" is a program for film buffs, Trivial  Pursuit fans and students of popular culture. It lists movie titles  alphabetically -- by year and by Academy Awards won in 31 categories.  </P> <P> It displays a profile of each film and shows which movies won the most awards  (there have only been four films since 1927 to win more than eight Oscars:  "Gigi" in 1958, "Ben-Hur" in 1959, "West Side Story" in 1961 and "The Last  Emperor" in 1987.)  </P> <P> If you ask it for all Oscar-winning films beginning with the letter "P" from  1927 to 1988 (the last year currently in the data base), it gives you a list  that includes "The Paper Chase," "Paper Moon," "A Passage to India," "Patton,"  "Phantom of the Opera," "Pillow Talk" and "Platoon." If you ask it for the last  10 winners for Best Picture, it gives you "Kramer vs. Kramer," "Ordinary  People," "Chariots of Fire," "Gandhi," "Terms of Endearment," "Amadeus," "Out  of Africa," "Platoon," "The Last Emperor" and "Rainman."  </P> <P> There's nothing fancy here, just lots of information and lots of ways to look  at it. With every film, the program tells you who were the stars, what awards  it won and what movies it beat to win the awards. (If you look up "Midnight  Express," for example, you'll see that it won the Best Music and Best Writing  categories for 1978. Principal cast members were Brad Davis, Randy Quaid and  John Hurt. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay, beating out Neil Simon for  "California Suite" and Warren Beatty and Elaine May for "Heaven Can Wait.")  </P> <P> Award-Winning Films of the Silver Screen, CWI Information Services, P.O.

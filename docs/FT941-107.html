			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Shanks &amp; McEwan Shanks &amp; McEwan used to describe itself as the Rolls-Royce of the waste management sector. The wheels have now come off. Its market capitalisation languishes below the Pounds 170m paid for the Rechem hazardous waste disposal business in January 1991. Yesterday's provisions are the latest in a string of disappointments since that acquisition. Further provisions on the contracting side and property write-downs mean that 1993 profits will be drowned in red ink. The question is whether Shanks can deliver much by way of growth from here. Assuming that contracting is sold, Shanks would be left with around Pounds 100m turnover in waste management. While municipal waste has proved to be anything but the recession-proof business once supposed, Shanks might now push through price increases in Scotland, where it enjoys a hefty market share. Yet in England Shanks commands only a fraction of a fragmented market. That operation might flourish more as part of a larger group. The chance of this logic eliciting a bid probably turns on the prospects for Rechem. Half of Rechem's sales come from burning imported waste, so any government ban on hazardous imports would undermine profits. While that threat remains, Shanks has a poison pill. Should the worst happen to Rechem, though, the risks would be easier for a predator to judge. Shareholders have been given little incentive in recent years to defend Shanks's independence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (CNS) -- The chief of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Mr. Peter Sutherland made  clear today that the world's multilateral trade system needed  participation by China. He was convinced that a satisfactory  settlement for restoration of China's status as a signatory to  GATT would be eventually made. The GATT chief said that he  hoped this day would not be too far away.    Mr. Sutherland made the remarks in a joint press conference  with the Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  and head of the negotiation group on restoration of China to  GATT Mr. Gu Yongjiang.    Earlier, the GATT chief when delivering a speech in an  international seminar held here expressed his support for  resumption of China's status in the world trade organization.  He made the commitment in his capacity as the head of GATT and  said that the secretariat of the world trade body would try its  best to achieve this end.    Following the final accord on the Uruguay round talk was  signed, talks on China's restoration to GATT and its status in  the world's multilateral trade system entered into a crucial  stage. Should China have to complete the process for its  restoration to GATT by the end of this year, a substantive  accord would have to be reached by this summer. [paragraph as  received]    Mr. Sutherland was convinced that the progress was quite  positive for China to move toward the resumption of its status  in GATT. He stressed, however, that it was rather difficult to  complete the process within a limited period of time which  needed much more flexibility for a solution to existing  problems. [sentence as received]    The GATT official pointed out that he was impressed by the  positive attitude shown by China in its determination to return  to the world trade body. He went further, saying that China's  foreign trade law approved at home was considered a positive  factor for resumption of China's place in GATT.    He stressed that the world trade system had to be one that  has rules to be abided by. He appealed to developed countries  for the overcoming of a trend for trade protectionism and to  developing countries for quick opening to the outside world for  trade.</p>

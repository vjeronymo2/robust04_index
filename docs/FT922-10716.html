			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COFFEE and COCOA prices fell to the lowest levels since the early 1970s at the London Futures and Options Exchange in early trading, but both rallied towards the close to end with relatively moderate losses on the day. The July position on the cocoa market slipped to a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 587 a tonne as selling by the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, found buying interest extremely thin. But buyers emerged eventually, although one trader described this as 'just a bit of bargain-hunting', and the July price recovered to Pounds 598 a tonne, down Pounds 5 on the day. The coffee market fared even worse early on, the July contract dipping to a 20-year low of Dollars 760 a tonne. Dealers suggested that extra pressure was being put on coffee prices by producers being forced to sell quickly to pay off debts: 'No one can afford to hold coffee at origin so everything is coming straight out,' analyst Mr Peter Kettle of ED and F. Man (Coffee) explained. The late rally started after the New York market opened firmer than expected and by the close the July price had moved up to Dollars 765 a tonne, down Dollars 4 on the day.

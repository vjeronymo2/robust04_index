			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Second day of court questioning for Kevin Maxwell MR KEVIN Maxwell yesterday emerged from his second day in court, where he had been responding to questions about the raiding of the Maxwell companies' pension funds, to be greeted by 70 similar questions from the parliamentary pensions committee. Mr Maxwell, who last week lost his appeal that he had a right to remain silent, spent nearly five hours in a private court examination under intense questioning from the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the manager of most of the pension funds. Mr Neil Cooper, the provisional liquidator, from the accountancy firm Robson Rhodes, is trying to trace Pounds 300m that has disappeared from the Maxwell pension funds, which has left 30,000 employees and pensioners acutely worried about their future. Mr Cooper declined to comment on the success of the questioning, but it is understood that he may have more questions to put to Mr Maxwell next week. He is also likely to interview soon - outside court - Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a director of one of the private Maxwell companies that handled some of the pension money, and Mr Robert Bunn, finance director of many of the private Maxwell companies. Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother, Ian, together with all other Maxwell pension trustees, were also asked yesterday to reply within two weeks to 70 questions from the parliamentary social security committee which is trying to prevent future abuse of company pension funds. 'Maxwell always went around with a gang of people and one of the things I want to know is if any of that posse went into trust meetings,' Mr Frank Field, MP, chairman of the committee, said yesterday. Although the Maxwell brothers, who were trustees of the pension funds, refused to answer questions when they appeared before the committee on January 13, they indicated that they might answer written questions. The questionnaire asks how much is missing from each pension funds, when the trustees became aware it had gone, and how it disappeared. It asks them to comment on their knowledge of secretive offshore trusts connected with the web of private Maxwell companies with reference to a diagram of the empire published by the Financial Times on November 6, the day after Mr Robert Maxwell died. The MPs ask: 'Were you ever a party to signing any transfer of funds, to whom, and did you ever feel the need to seek professional advice'. They also want to know why increases in benefits were not awarded in many years despite the existence of a large surplus in the pension fund, and ask directly: 'In whose interests did you believe you were acting as a trustee', and 'did you ever vote against Mr Robert Maxwell'. JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is about to be appointed by Price Waterhouse, the administrators of MCC, to advise on the sale of the US businesses Macmillan and Official Airline Guides. The US companies' pension funds were run separately and are intact, making the sale possible. Price Waterhouse yesterday moved the last two dozen employees of the MCC central management out of the Holborn Circus headquarters into Price Waterhouse accommodation.</p>

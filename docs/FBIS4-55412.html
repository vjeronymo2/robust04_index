			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Bileca, May 15 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem Army continues  on Sunday to violate the cease-fire in the area of the eastern  town of Gorazde, opening fire on the adjacent Serb villages.  Bosnian Serb Army sources inform that the Moslems on the left  bank of the Drina [River] have shelled the villages on the right  bank, where the Serb population has returned after their  liberation in a Serb counter-offensive which checked a Moslem  offensive launched from Gorazde earlier this Spring.    The Moslem infantry on Sunday attacked the village of Bijela  in the Konjic municipality in northern Herzegovina, and engaged  in sporadic provocations along the entire front between  Nevesinje and Mostar, the local Bosnian Serb Army command  informs. Moslems have also been opening fire from a 20-mm gun  and a heavy machinegun on Serb positions in Sarajevo's suburb of  Ilidza.    Three Moslem snipers have been firing from the city's  Dobrinja locality at the Serb residential area near Sarajevo  airport. Moslems have been opening fire also from small-arms and  hand-held rocket launchers in the area of the Vrbanja bridge.    Movements of Moslem troops and mechanisation have been  reported from the direction of Mt Igman towards the suburb of  Hrasnica, and from Butmir airport to Donji Kotorac, all in  Sarajevo.</p>

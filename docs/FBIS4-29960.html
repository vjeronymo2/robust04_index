			<p>CSO     [Text] Nissan Motor is moving to install lean-burning  engines in almost all passenger car classes with 2,000-cc and  under displacement by 2000. Following the "Sunny 1500 CX"  recently put on sale, it is scheduled to be carried on some  "Pulsars" that will have a full model change next year.  Thereafter, it plans to carry it on a total of eight car classes  along with full model changes. Nissan is promoting cost  reductions by sharing parts with existing engines and considers  it a product where low price and low fuel consumption coexist.    Favored as targets for carrying the lean-burning engine are  the eight car classes of Pulsar, "Bluebird," "Primera,"  "Presea," "March," "Avenir," and "AD wagon," in addition to the  Sunny which already has been set. There also are the  "Cedric/Gloria," "Laurel," and "Sefillo" 2000-cc types, but it  seems that it will be narrowed to classes below 1800-cc to  2000-cc middle displacement.    For the engine, existing engines will be made lean burning  like the "GA" engine of the Sunny. In the future, Nissan will  change to lean-burning car classes carrying the "SR" engines  such as the Bluebird and Primera and the "CG" engine for the  March along with full model changes. In particular, the policy  is to cultivate cars carrying lean-burning engines as the  central type for the Sunny and Bluebird which are the highest  volume sales classes.    The lean-burning engine is a mechanism where fuel  consumption  is reduced by increasing the volume of air for burning gasoline.  Toyota Motor and Honda Motor were forerunners in this field, but  Nissan has perfected a low-price engine by greatly improving the  fuel consumption of the GA engine itself along with full model  change of the Sunny, and adopting the lean-burning method in  addition to that.    Viewed by body price, the lean-burning cars of other  companies are about 100,000 yen higher than the regular type.  Nissan is proceeding in part sharing with regular engines that  have rather low fuel consumption and has held the increase to  about 30,000 yen. It estimates that if it increases the car  classes carrying it and further raises productivity, it can  lower prices further. The strategy is to cultivate the low fuel  consumption, lean-burning engine as the mainstream while  avoiding an increase in body prices.</p>

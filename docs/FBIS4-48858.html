			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, May 29 (AFP) -- A Nepalese peacekeeper  abducted two weeks ago in an ambush that left five colleagues  dead was freed Sunday [29 May], the United Nations said.    The peacekeeper was wounded during the clash but appears to  be in satisfactory health, said a spokesman for the UN mission  here, George Bennet.    Bennet said he had no details on the soldier's release, but  that he believed the kidnappers received nothing in exchange.    The soldier was abducted from a Mogadishu hospital after the  assault by Somali gunmen on May 16.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Surprise at new RHM bid THE SURPRISE Pounds 935m bid by Tomkins for Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM) sent shares in the two groups in wildly opposite directions and, together with RHM's other bidder, Hanson, produced the three heaviest traded stocks in a London market almost wholly negative in its view of the agreed offer. Tomkins shares tumbled 49 to 212p in turnover of 29m as the industrial conglomerate revealed the terms of the takeover, which included a 2-for-1 rights issue. Turnover in RHM reached 38m, the shares soaring 21 1/2 to 273p, 6p ahead of the Tomkins offer price. Analysts described the price, which dwarfed Hanson's Pounds 790m hostile offer, as 'very full' and many expressed misgivings at Tomkins' intentions to keep RHM together. Mr Tim Potter of Smith New Court said: 'It's a tall order to fulfil. Tomkins has no expertise in running a food business and the problem areas, such as baking, will be difficult ones to address.' Many observers believe Tomkins is over-optimistic in its belief and that, should the bid be successful, some disposals from RHM will be inevitable. Most analysts were advising RHM shareholders either to take the cash alternative or to sit tight and wait for Hanson's response. Initial market reaction was that Hanson would walk away from the deal. However, Lord Hanson, chairman, ignited some excitement telling RHM shareholders in a statement to 'take no action for the time being'. County NatWest was among several houses yesterday to issue sell notes on Tomkins. Analyst Mr Geoff Allum argued that the rights issue would put too many shares into the market and that the bid price was too high. 'Tomkins say they have plans for RHM but they will not say what they are,' he said. 'I cannot see anything in this bid which will not weaken the shares further. They should be sold.' Disappointment over the arrival of a rival bidder and large selling from the US prompted Hanson shares to fall 5 1/2 to 226 1/2 p. Analysts said a takeover of RHM would enhance Hanson's earnings by 3 per cent before tax benefits were factored in. The shares have performed well since the bid was announced. There are also worries that the US might introduce protectionist tax charges. These would hit Hanson, which has very high exposure to the US. Dealers said one US investor was trying to unload a very large line of stock yesterday and that the weight of it was pushing down the share price. ICI upset Long-awaited third quarter results from ICI turned out to be even worse than the bears had anticipated. The announcement of the headline figures, hot on the heels of disappearing rate cut hopes, sent the shares and the FT-SE 100 Index sharply down. ICI shares had been wallowing around 20 lower, but when the profit figure of Pounds 93m for the quarter and Pounds 513m for the year to date appeared, marketmakers chopped quotations and ICI was down 46 at worst. Analysts returned from the company meeting with the view that ICI was determined to maintain the dividend. This, coupled with continued commitment to the planned demerger, helped the shares to recover and close only 14 off at 1036p with 4.2m traded. However, Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said the dividend would be uncovered for the first time and the demerger might have to be postponed. He cut his 1992 estimate by Pounds 50m to Pounds 550m and his 1993 figure by Pounds 775m to Pounds 700m. Broker Hoare Govett, which surprised the market with hefty cuts a month ago maintains its caution. Hoare's Mr Martin Evans has cut back to Pounds 580m for this year and taken a particularly gloomy view of 1993 prospects, slicing his estimate by Pounds 155m to Pounds 720m. Hotels hint A dull leisure sector was enlivened by talk surrounding Queens Moat Houses. Shares in the hotel group have been buoyant all week and there were hints that a deal with Bass was in the offing. Speculation that the brewery group is looking to dispose of some of its Holiday Inn chain is not new, but renewed talk yesterday had Bass considering taking a stake in Queens Moat in return for management of some of its hotels. Analysts were mostly sceptical. Shares in Queens Moat, held back by a downgrade from Smith New Court, fell a penny to 40p. Bass fell 7 to 544p. There were many trading features in a busy oil and gas sector. Shell was by far the biggest traded stock, easing to 531p and subsequently closing a net penny off at 534p after exceptionally heavy trade of 11m shares. The bulk of the trade was made up by the purchase at 528p and and resale at 531p of a block of 2.2m Shell shares, apparently by one of the leading UK securities houses. Later in the session another block of 2m Shell traded at 528p. The reasoning behind the recent exceptionally heavy trading in BP traded options, apparently on behalf of one of the big US investment banks, became evident as BP and the Colombian authorities announced new reserves estimates for the Cusiana oilfield located in Colombia. BP and Triton Energy, of the US, are participants in Cusiana, along with the Colombian state-owned oil company. After some confusion, when BP estimated reserves at 1.5bn barrels of crude and condensate, against Colombian official estimates of 1.3bn barrels, dealers adopted a bearish stance on the figures, chopping BP shares from around 236p to an eventual closing level of 231p, a net loss of 3 1/2 , after turnover of 8.7m. Specialists were also said to have been disappointed at prospective levels of production from the field. There was similar disappointment in the US, which now speaks for well over 20 per cent of BP shares. Triton stock came under heavy selling pressure and were down some six per cent in early trading. One UK oil sector analyst said the Cusiana numbers were 'the best the realists could have expected'. Royal Insurance was the pick of the composite insurance sector, the shares improving 6 to 213p on higher than usual activity of 4.3m shares. Dealers said speculators had revived long-running stories that Allianz, the German insurance group, was about to pounce with a 300p a share bid for the company. Sun Alliance moved up 3 to 320p and Commercial Union (CU) eased 2 to 571p; the bought deal in which Sun Alliance disposed of a block of 60m shares in CU on September 18 was executed jointly by Smith New Court and Cazenove. Pharmaceutical stocks moved against the market on strengthening conviction that President Bush might retain the presidency. Glaxo was the strongest performer. The shares rose 10 to 809p on turnover of 4.2m. A downgrade and reiterated sell stance by Smith New Court hurt Cadbury-Schweppes, the shares slipping 14 to 451p. Similar treatment was meted out by James Capel on MFI, the shares losing 6 to 112p. Automated Security Holdings ran up 9 to 137p with dealers noting persistent US support for the stock ahead of a visit next week to the company's US operations by UK analysts. It was also suggested that recent steady selling of the shares by several UK institutions had dried up and that domestic funds are now keen supporters of the shares. Reuters fell 20 tp 1178p on worries over a threatened overhang of stock after shareholder United Newspapers (off 2 at 453p) announced it was exchanging preference shares for Reuters shares.

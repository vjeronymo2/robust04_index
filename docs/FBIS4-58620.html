			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir Issue -- American Politicians' Tilt </F> Toward India"]    [Text] Lee Hamilton, U.S. House of Representatives Foreign  Affairs Committee chairman, has said that the UN Resolution on  holding plebiscite in Kashmir has become obsolete and is a part  of history now. At present, the chances for its implementation  are remote, and one cannot even think about it. A practical  solution to the Kashmir dispute would be to recognize the Line  of Control as the international border. Addressing a seminar at  the Asia Society on Indo-U.S. ties and ways to improve them, Lee  Hamilton, who is regarded as an influential and powerful  personality in Washington, made the above statement. Although  the latest salvo fired by Lee Hamilton is totally against and in  contrast to the American government's stance on Kashmir, it is  not difficult to assess the policies of the most powerful group  of American legislators, which they want to adopt in the  subcontinent in future. The Indian lobby has been exerting  pressure on this group for a long time. Lee Hamilton's  statement on the plebiscite in Kashmir endorses Indian policy.  In politics, the so-called elections, that made the late Shaykh  Abdullah the puppet chief minister of the occupied valley, are  described as a plebiscite. First, these elections were not held  under the supervision of the United Nations but under the Indian  Government. Secondly, Shaykh Abdullah also realized his follies  later for which he had to undergo an imprisonment of 14 years.  Lee Hamilton's point of view that the United Nations adopted  the resolution on Kashmir at a time when India itself took the  issue to the Security Council and pleaded for intervention does  not hold good here. At that time also, the freedom fighters  were continuing their struggle for independence, and there is no  change in the situation now even after almost 50 years. Despite  the stepped up Indian atrocities, the Kashmir freedom fighters  are continuing their movement. There is no change in India's  inclination, either. Therefore, terming those resolutions  obsolete now is totally outrageous.    In South Africa, the minority whites ruled the local black  population for three and half years [sentence as published]. In  spite of that, the nations of the world did not accept it as a  rightful government. As a result, not only the racist policies  came to an end, but the African National Congress led by Nelson  Mandela has also won a clear majority in the recently held free  and fair elections there. If this principle of rejecting UN  resolutions as obsolete is accepted, every aggressor country  will try to keep the UN Resolutions under suspension until they  become obsolete and become a thing of the past.    As far as the matter of recognizing the Line of Control as a  permanent border is concerned, if the people of Kashmir were  willing to endorse it, what was the need for them to continue  the freedom struggle for such a long time, endure the Indian  atrocities, and sacrifice their lives and property as well as  dignity and honor? They did not tolerate the injustice for 45  years to let India occupy Kashmir after reckoning the existing  Line of Control as the international border.    The pleas made in favor of the laws of jungle by the  distinguished politicians and scholars of the greatest human  rights champion, the United States, in this era of liberty may  only mean that wherever they want, they impose their ideology  for personal gains. If the United States has decided not to  grant the right of self-determination to the Kashmiri people, it  should not resort to lousy arguments and should overtly state  that India is right and all other countries are liars.    The authorities and the politicians in the United States  have  made India the regional don of South Asia and are bent upon  denying the right of self-determination to the Kashmiris and  making all the countries of the region, including Pakistan, the  scion states of India. Therefore, this matter warrants a moment  of thought from our government, politicians, and Kashmiri  leaders. It is not only imperative on their part to intensify  their campaign at global level, but the government also should  make its lobby strong and effective in the United States.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Fury Spreads Over Japanese Minister"] </F>   [Text] China is demanding the Japanese Government treat  with "all seriousness" the remarks made by Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano about the Japanese atrocities during their  invasion of Nanjing.    The Foreign Ministry contacted the Japanese yesterday to  express their concern over the remarks and open talks over the  issue, spokesman Wu Jianmin said.    Wu said the Chinese were shocked and incensed by Nagano's  distorted historical view of Japanese aggression.    Nagano told Tokyo reporters that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre,  which killed 300,000 civilians in the city that was then the  Chinese capital, was a "fabrication."    Wu described the massacre as one of the most notorious  atrocities committed by the Japanese military during their  invasion from 1937 to 1945.    The international community has already reached consensus on  the nature of the war and the massacre itself.    Nagano was trying to whitewash the militarism, Wu noted.    He said China has noted Japanese Prime Minister Hata's  attitude toward this episode of history when he spoke in Paris  yesterday.    Hata reiterated Japan's view on the history and said  Nagano's  remarks were "inappropriate."    Wu said it is in the Japanese people's interests and for  peace and stability in Asia for Japan to adopt a correct  attitude about its history of aggression. China always stands  for a forward-looking approach to history and hopes Japan draw  lessons from history, the spokesman said.    Meanwhile, President Jiang Zemin said in Shanghai yesterday  that Chinese and Japanese should live in friendship from  generation to generation.    "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the  future," Jiang told Bunhei Hara, President of the House of  Councillors of the Japanese Diet, the parliament.    He called the Japanese invasion the "unfortunate historical  period" between the two countries.</p>

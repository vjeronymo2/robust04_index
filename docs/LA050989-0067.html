			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> ABC will pick up two awards today when Action for Children's Television hands  out its 17th annual Achievement in Children's Television honors in Cambridge,  Mass. "Daddy Can't Read," an "ABC Afterschool Special" about adult illiteracy,  and "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," part of the network's Saturday  morning children's lineup, are among the 20 winners from broadcast TV, cable  and home video. ACT president Peggy Charen notes that the winners "demonstrate  a concern for the TV needs of young audiences," but adds that "creative  excellence in children's TV is still the exception to the rule of mediocrity."

When Secretary Wang, who was  grinning from ear to ear, entered the meeting hall, the people's  deputies burst into warm applause. Smiling, Wang Maolin told  them: Today, I am going to listen to your opinions on Governor  Chen Bangzhu's government work report, and discuss with you the  reform in Zhuzhou.    Immediately after Comrade Wang Maolin finished speaking,  (Wang Qingming), mayor of Zhuzhou city, said: The development  strategy for the whole province formulated by Governor Chen's  government work report conforms with practical reality. We will  build Zhuzhou into a hi-tech industrial base, a goods collection  and distribution base, and a transport, information and  telecommunications center in the southeastern part of Hunan.  This is a fairly strenuous task. [passage omitted]    During the discussion, enterprise reform and the  establishment of the system for modern enterprises was an issue  much discussed by people's deputies. They showed very great  interest in this topic for discussion. People's Deputies Wu  Zhenduo, Cui Xinchen, and Ding Aiguo pointed out: It is  extremely difficult to carry out enterprise reform, and we are  encountering numerous difficulties. However, it does not work to  give it up. Wu Zhenduo, chairman of the board of directors of  the Nanfang Power Machinery Group, expressed his views in light  of practical reality; after deep consideration, he stressed that  the three measures taken by us for structural reform are  comparatively successful as a whole. However, our reform is not  yet in full swing. [words indistinct] We must push various  trades and service toward the market.    Secretary Wang Maolin, who worked in enterprises for many  years and has rich management experience, emphasized: The  method adopted by the Nanfang Corporation is worth popularizing.  This method for reforming the enterprise system actually means  socialization of enterprises. State-owned enterprises in  Zhuzhou's industrial circles must take the lead in this regard,  and must set an example for the whole province. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy [as heard] Podkolzin,  commander of the Russian airborne troops, has spoken in  extremely negative terms about NATO's decision to carry out air  raids in Bosnia.    The general said that the Russian servicemen see their task  in this conflict as bringing peace to people, rather than  resorting to such extreme measures, which are capable of causing  a military conflagration in the entire Balkan region.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Czech phone group ousts chairman The chairman of SPT Telecom, the Czech Republic's national telephone operator, has been deposed in a row over a contract for telephone cards, as international buyers compete for a 27 per cent stake in the company. Mr Jiri Makovec was ousted as chairman and from his executive board seat after he lost a company supervisory board confidence vote instigated by the privatisation ministry. The board passed the motion after it considered newspaper allegations that he awarded the lucrative telephone card contract to Augustus, a company in which Mr Pavel Lintymer, described as a close friend of his, is a big investor. As general director, Mr Makovec combined the roles of SPT chairman and chief executive. It is understood that, stripped of his other offices, he will remain chief executive until a board meeting early in the new year considers the matter further. No replacement as chairman was immediately announced. International telecommunications groups bidding for the stake in SPT, worth up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), said yesterday the controversy was unlikely to affect the timetable for the tender. An executive at one bidder said Mr Makovec had had little or no role in developing the strategy for the sale, which is being supervised by the economy ministry and J P Morgan, the US investment bank. The government has said it will announce the winner of the tender in March. Ten international companies from Europe and the US are vying for the stake in what is expected to be eastern Europe's biggest telecommunications deal so far. They include AT&amp;T and Ameritech of the US, Deutsche Telekom, PTT Nederland, Italy's Stet, TeleDanmark, and a consortium grouping France Telecom and Bell Atlantic. The remaining 26 per cent of SPT's shares have been sold to Czech citizens and investment funds and will be distributed soon. The move to oust Mr Makovec must be approved at a shareholders' meeting within two weeks. This is thought to be a formality, as the state currently owns 74 per cent of SPT. Ten of the supervisory board's 15 members are state-appointed, and the no-confidence motion is understood to have been approved by a substantial majority.</p>

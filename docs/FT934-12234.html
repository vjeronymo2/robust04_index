			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thames Water drops The shock Pounds 25m provision announced by Thames Water with its figures yesterday was the signal for hefty profit-taking throughout the water sector. Shares in Thames were inevitably the worst hit, closing 13 down at 561p in high turnover of 5.6m. Elsewhere, Severn Trent slipped 8 to 555p, South West 10 to 602p, Southern 11 to 600p and Yorkshire 12 to 578p. Yield considerations have sent the water sector soaring in the past two months, the sector index jumping nearly 15 per cent since the beginning of August. Mr Bill Dale at SG Warburg said: 'The sector has risen so far so fast and was vulnerable to a short-term setback, which the Thames provision duly provided. However, we believe Thames remains a core holding in the sector reflecting the strength of its efficient underlying business.' The Thames provision, which was taken against two overseas contracts, also reignited worries over diversification by water companies away from their core business areas. These concerns added to impending regulatory anxieties in the UK and led to some limited switching into the electricity stocks. There was also further heavy business in the generators. Among the steepest rises, Yorkshire advanced 8 to 641p, Eastern 7 to 614p and Manweb 8 to 658p. Turnover in Scottish Power hit 8.4m as it added 3 at 416p. Salomon Brothers chose a basket of Recs (regional electricity companies) yesterday to launch a covered warrant in the equity market. The warrant allows investors to buy an option - in this case at Pounds 1.50 - which they can then exercise at any time over the next 49 weeks and buy the underlying shares of the Recs at the price at the date of the warrant's purchase. Yesterday the strike price was Pounds 26. The issue coincides with Salomon reiterating its positive stance on the Recs. The fall in the oil price hampered most stocks in the sector. BP lost 2 1/2 to 337p in moderate turnover. Enterprise Oil gave up 5 to 476p. Against this trend was Shell, which firmed a penny to 709p, with one analyst pinning some reason to good results by Exxon. A variety of factors conspired to bruise a recently bouncy drugs sector. SmithKline Beecham 'A' fell back 11 to 429p in volume of 2.4m as confirmation came that Mylan Laboratories, of the US, had won approval to market the generic form of SmithKline's Tagamet. US patents on Tagamet expire in May. Some downgradings were expected on the back of the move. Panmure Gordon added to the stock's problems by switching its position from sell to hold, and saying that others in the sector appeared better value. Glaxo, which fell 23 to 691p. was hit by Morgan Stanley moving from a hold to a sell. Some drugs analysts feel that Glaxo has risen too high in the recent pharmaceuticals rally and that past Pounds 7 the shares seem overvalued. Nervousness ahead of results - due tomorrow - again hounded Wellcome and it gave up 22 to 812p. In the slight backlash in the drugs sector, Cantab was said by one analyst to have made a somewhat lacklustre debut on the market. It began trading at 465p, after being placed at 460p, rose to a high of 473p and trailed off to close at 468p. US support, particularly in the ADRs, was said to have lifted Cable and Wireless, up 15 at 958p, and Vodafone, ahead 7 at 561p. Among financials, yield buyers were seen early in the day for Lloyds Bank, though having risen to 574p the shares followed the market down to end unchanged at 568p. Vague bid talk was once again heard in TSB, the shares edging forward a half-penny to 220p. Abbey National eased 4 to 413p with the market, with active dealing in the traded options reported. SG Warburg was reported to be a buyer of Prudential Corp, up a penny at 371p. Food manufacturing stocks witnessed a mixed session as the recent directionless trading continued to defy broker recommendations. Ahead of the impending results season, Kleinwort Benson was one house believing the sector's recent underperformance overdone and advising clients to go 'overweight'. Turnover in motors group BBA rose to 15.3m, making it one of the day's most actively traded stocks, as the company continued to bask in the glow of Monday's appointment of a former BTR director as its new chief executive. BBA shares jumped 12 to 179p, with sentiment further boosted by a strong recommendation from NatWest Securities. BTR followed the poor market trend, ending 5 off at 369p after volume of 4.8m. Rolls-Royce shed 2 1/2 to 153p after Panmure Gordon advised investors to sell the stock. In its 46-page Engineering Quarterly review on the engineering and aerospace sector, the broker said of Rolls-Royce: 'There is no recovery in sight.' Agency broker James Capel was said to have moved from a hold to a sell on Allied-Lyons, which retreated 7 to 591p.</p>

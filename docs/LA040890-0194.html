			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RACE FOR CARSON TREASURER STIRS UP POLITICAL WATERS  </P> <P> The election of a treasurer in Carson, which once offered a respite from the  city's political wars, this year is a pitched battle.  </P> <P> Two-term incumbent Mary Custer has attracted the enmity of Mayor Michael Mitoma  and Councilman John Anderson, who have backed her opponent Jaime (Jim)  Punsalan. Custer has the endorsement of Councilwomen Kay Calas and Vera Robles  DeWitt, who make up a two-member minority faction on the council.  </P> <P> Punsalan, 52, a deputy Los Angeles County assessor who is seeking office for  the first time, said last week that Custer has bungled the investment of the  city's cash and that it is time for the city to have a professional in the  treasurer's job.  </P> <P> Custer, 59, has questioned Punsalan's standing as a certified public accountant  and his long-term commitment to the city.  </P> <P> Custer said last week that she should be elected to another four-year-term on  Tuesday because she has invested the city's $70-million portfolio wisely. She  said Mitoma is trying to put into the treasurer's office "a rubber stamp . . .  so he can funnel the city's investment to his favorite banks."  </P> <P> Mitoma denied that he wants a treasurer who will do his bidding.  </P> <P> "If Mary (Custer) said that, she doesn't deserve to be in office because she is  lying," he said. Anderson, who lashed out at Custer during a council meeting  March 20, has said he is endorsing Punsalan as the more qualified candidate.  </P> <P> Punsalan said in an interview that he agreed to assist Anderson's reelection  campaign in return for an endorsement by Mitoma and Anderson, but Mitoma denied  that he or Anderson sought anything in exchange.  </P> <P> He said he did ask Punsalan to provide the list of applicants for absentee  ballots that Punsalan's campaign had gathered, but Punsalan "was not able to  provide that list. He needs us. We don't need him."  </P> <P> One of Punsalan's chief arguments against Custer is that he is a CPA and she is  not. "We need a professional, not a politician," he said in an interview.  </P> <P> In a full-page ad in a recent issue of the Carson News, Punsalan said Custer  had invested city funds in a bank at 9% interest on Dec. 19, when another bank  was willing to pay a higher rate. The ad did not identify the bank or the rate  it was offering.  </P> <P> Custer said the claim is false. She said she made a number of investments that  day at rates ranging from 8.0% to 8.5% and that no bank was offering rates of  9% or higher on that date. She added that her investment policy is designed for  safety, liquidity and yield, with priorities in that order. In the last fiscal  year, she said the city earned $6 million on its $70-million investment  portfolio.  </P> <P> "It is an excellent rate." she said. "Other cities have lost money -- we are  talking of millions of dollars -- making unwise investments. Carson has not  lost one dollar since I have been treasurer."  </P> <P> In criticizing Punsalan's status as a professional accountant, she pointed out  that he had let his status as a certified public accountant lapse in 1988.  </P> <P> Punsalan conceded that he had not paid his state fee in 1988 and that his  license had been revoked for delinquency from Feb. 1, 1988, until May, 1989,  when he belatedly paid. "I did not receive the billing until 1989," he said.  </P> <P> This year, state officials mailed back his check and renewal form because it  arrived incomplete, and the state Board of Accountancy listed him as delinquent  as of Feb. 1, according to a state official. He mailed back the form properly  filled out, and on March 12 state officials returned his license to active  status, the official said.  </P> <P> Custer, a 26-year resident of Carson, has questioned Punsalan's long-term  commitment to the city.  </P> <P> In 1988, Punsalan said, he moved from a house he owns in Rancho Palos Verdes to  a room in his in-laws' house in Carson, in order to get involved in Carson  politics. His wife stays with him from time to time in Carson, he said.  </P> <P> Punsalan said he lived in Carson for several years beginning in 1976, moved to  Long Beach for several years, then moved back to Carson in the early 1980s. He  bought the Rancho Palos Verdes house in the mid-1980s, he said.  </P> <P> Punsalan said he is campaigning with $20,000 of his own money and has not  raised funds from any other sources. Custer has raised about $8,000.  </P> <P> The position of treasurer, which pays $53,640 a year, has a lower salary than  any of the city's appointed department heads, who make at least $13,000 a year  more.  </P></p>

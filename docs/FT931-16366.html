			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Letter: Kenyan elections a significant move towards genuine, multi-party politics (1) Sir, Your leader of December 31 ('Flawed elections') cannot go unchallenged. You say 'democracy has lost in Kenya's first multi-party poll in 26 years'. You are too quick to judge. Virtually no one claims that the Kenyan general election was perfect and most observers concede that, at the margins, some disadvantage was probably experienced by the main opposition parties. As a move towards multi-party politics, however, the election was a remarkable achievement. Kenya can now hope for an era of much more 'transparency, accountability and good governance' in its politics. With regards to the election results, the following facts need to be recognised: Mr Daniel arap Moi won the presidency by a wide margin of more than 530,000 votes; this was 40 per cent more votes than his closest rival and equivalent to more than 10 per cent of the votes cast. His share of the national vote was 37 per cent, not far short of the level achieved in 1992 by Mr Major in Britain or Mr Clinton in the US, except that Moi faced three serious opponents, of whom the weakest, Odinga, still managed to get 17.3 per cent of the vote. Moi was the only presidential candidate to achieve the required 25 per cent in five of the eight provinces. Consequently, Moi's claim that he is the only truly national leader as opposed to a tribal leader is not just secure; it is enhanced. In parliamentary terms, the simplest way of understanding the Kanu victory is to note that, of the seven largest ethnic groups in Kenya, Kanu had a convincing victory in four - the Kisii, Kalenjin, Mijikenda and Kamba - and a narrow victory in a fifth, the Luhya. This achievement gave Kanu 60 seats in parliament, and outweighed the combined seats of the Kikuyu and Luo communities, which totalled 55. Kanu also did well among many of the smaller ethnic groups. Indeed the only groups Kanu lost outright were the Luos, Kikuyus and the latter's traditional allies, the Embus. These are the hard psephological facts. The frustrations of the Kikuyu and Luo communities in Kenya are largely those related to two previously privileged ethnic groups who have discovered that they are not the only 'kids on the block'. The Kenyan election tells us that the vast majority of Kenya's ethnic groups have the good sense to want to avoid getting caught in the crossfire between the selfish ethnic ambitions of the Aideeds and Milosevics of this world. The west should now restore Kenya to its good books and allow it to resume its claim as the country in Africa which 'works' and which is determined to lead by example the Dark Continent towards a brighter future.

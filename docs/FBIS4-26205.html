			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 1627): </F> "Central Authorities Decide To Allocate 7 Billion Yuan To Carry  Out Enterprise Bankruptcy Pilot Schemes in 18 Cities"]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- According to an  authoritative source here, the central leading body recently  decided that, beginning in late June, bankruptcy experiments  should be carried out in two or three selected large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises in 18 cities. The state  will allocate 7 billion yuan to help those workers employed by  the enterprises that go bankrupt. The central authorities hold  that allowing state-owned enterprises which cannot halt business  losses to go bankrupt is the key to the establishment of a  modern enterprise system.    The source said: A central leader recently talked about this  issue and said that a major task laid down by the central  leading body for this year is to promote a modern enterprise  system, while the key to the establishment of a modern  enterprise system lay in the establishment of a perfect  enterprise bankruptcy mechanism. Enterprises which can no longer  stop business losses and repay their debts should go bankrupt,  and enterprise mergers can be regarded as a solution within the  category of bankruptcy. At present, the difficulty about  exercising bankruptcy lies in placing workers. Thus, the state  will allocate 7 billion yuan to make proper arrangements for the  placement of workers and to set up special funds for writing off  bad debts owed by bankrupt enterprises to the banks.  Reportedly, according to conditions in difficult localities,  each worker will receive about 20,000 yuan of compensation if  the enterprise goes bankrupt and will then be separated from the  enterprise for ever. At present, such dying enterprises still  have to rely on bank loans to pay workers' wages.    The source said: The central authorities are firmly  determined to let loss-incurring enterprises go bankrupt,  because the Bankruptcy Law, which was formulated on the basis of  consideration over a long time, will officially take effect in  July. Since the law has been enacted, practice should be  brought into line with the requirements of the law. Moreover,  the central authorities held that there would be an opportunity  next year to solve the problems in large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises. If experience can be acquired on such  key issues as handling enterprise bankruptcy this year, this  will be conducive to the thorough settlement of problems in  large state-owned enterprises next year.</p>

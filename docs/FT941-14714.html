			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: Roll fulfills early promise - Concert In 1963, at the tender age of 17, Michael Roll won the first Leeds piano competition. After that his career developed erratically - there is a revealing examination of this, and the progress of subsequent Leeds winners, in Wendy Thompson's riveting 1990 history of the competition (published by Faber) - and in recent years he seems to have cut a low profile on the London musical scene. The full house for Sunday's Queen Elizabeth Hall recital showed, however, that Roll has not lost contact with the London piano-loving public. Not having heard him play for some years, I must confess to being entirely unprepared for the authority he demonstrated throughout the concert. Mea culpa] In a programme of Classical masterworks - Beethoven's Op. 26 Sonata and 'Eroica' Variations in the first half, the mighty Schubert B flat Sonata in the second - Roll established from the first note his genuine, concentrated and absolutely distinctive command of instrument and music. This stamp of personal authority could be recognised in the sound-world the pianist creates, with its crystalline pianissimos, forcefully delineated attack leading to sharp-edged yet not brutal climaxes and incisive articulation. Every note is scanned to justify its place in the larger musical scheme, every figuration-pattern to provide more than mere textural underlay. In the variation-structures of both Beethoven works, this produced a sense of unfolding adventure that carried with it an exhilaration, a feeling of 'going somewhere' by no means commonly achieved. Occasionally it also resulted, I felt, in an over-insistent quality to Roll's phrase-shapes: the middle episodes of the 'Eroica' Variations seemed too self-conscious in their punctuation to disgorge the full measure of pawky good humour. But this response should be understood as a matter of personal preference rather than criticism; on its own terms the authority of Roll's Beethoven brooks no argument. His Schubert likewise: the tremor of unease filtering out from under the melodies was sustained and built upon in a manner that allowed the last movement to attain its place as a genuine, and utterly invigorating, completion to the whole edifice. It was not a consoling Schubert reading. Questions were left thought-provokingly open at the end. This alone provided an impressive token of Mr Roll's mature mastery.</p>

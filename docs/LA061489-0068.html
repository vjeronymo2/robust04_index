			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rewards of up to $5 million would be offered for the capture of big-time drug  dealers under a plan offered by U.S. Customs Commissioner William Von Rabb.  Known as Operation Paladin for the gun-slinger in the television show "Have Gun  Will Travel," the reward fund would tap money from the Customs Service's asset  forfeiture fund. A congressional source familiar with the plan said Customs was  drawing up a most wanted list, and that it starts with Panamanian Gen. Manuel  Antonio Noriega. Also being considered for the list are leaders of the ruthless  Medellin and Cali cartels of Colombia, and an alleged drug dealer from Mexico,  the sources said.  </P></p>

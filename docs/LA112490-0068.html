			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMPHITHEATER NOISE  </P> <P> We bought our house in 1978, long before our State Fair Board decided to put an  outdoor amphitheater in the midst of our residential neighborhood. During the  season, there are usually two concerts a week that rock our house -- even with  all the doors and windows closed.  </P> <P> And we live 2 miles away, as the crow flies.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, we had an out-of-town guest, and we had to leave for hours  because of the concert. We could probably reap a nice penny renting seats on  the front lawn, because you can hear the lyrics.  </P> <P> We have been plagued with the noise, the congestion and the rubbish (thrown by)  people going to and from (the amphitheater), to say nothing of the lawns they  trample.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Ned West, who runs these concerts, is glad to pay the fines for  exceeding the noise limits because he is making so much money on the concerts.  </P> <P> The state board has foisted this on us, and we, the citizens of Costa Mesa, are  powerless. Agencies concerned with noise pollution have singled out this  amphitheater as an example of what should not be allowed.  </P> <P> LYNN SPEAR MERLES  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

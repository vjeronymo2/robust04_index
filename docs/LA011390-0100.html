			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FORMER BENGAL WILSON ARRESTED NEAR GARDENA  </P> <P> Stanley Wilson, banned from the NFL for life for using cocaine the night before  the 1989 Super Bowl, was arrested Friday for scuffling with officers and  possessing drug paraphernalia. Wilson, the former Banning High and Cincinnati  Bengal running back, was arrested only days after Penthouse magazine published  a story in which Wilson accused two teammates of joining him in a Super Bowl  drug party.  </P> <P> At a news conference in New York on Tuesday, Wilson had said he was drug free.  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said there was no  evidence Wilson was under the influence of drugs or alcohol when he was  arrested.  </P> <P> Deputies patrolling an unincorporated area near Gardena about 1:30 a.m. Friday  found Wilson in his car in an intersection.  </P> <P> Deputies saw a pipe between the two front seats, Ducoulombier said. The pipe  apparently was used to smoke marijuana, he said.  </P> <P> Wilson was arrested, booked and held in lieu of $1,000 bail.  </P></p>

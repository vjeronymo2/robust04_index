South African whites have been used to a high standard of healthcare since 1967 when Dr Christiaan Barnard performed the world's first heart transplant in Cape Town. The plan will further exacerbate concerns about the ANC's plans for state intervention in the post-apartheid economy, ahead of a big economic policy conference due to be held by the organisation from tomorrow to Sunday. 'We must drastically review how we use our resources,' Ms Cheryl Carolus, ANC national working committee member in charge of health told reporters in Johannesburg, saying the state was the most efficient provider of healthcare.

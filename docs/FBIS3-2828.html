			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by XINHUA correspondents Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 </F> 2639) and Gao Shuhua (7559 3219 5478): "The Leaders and Rank  and File Are of One Mind and Struggle in a Common  Effort--Sidelights on Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's Discussion With  Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC)" -- XINHUA  deadline]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 13  March Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier  of the State Council, went to where the Guizhou and Jiangxi  delegations are staying. He cordially visited NPC deputies from  the two delegations, held discussions with them, and seriously  heard their opinions and suggestions. The NPC deputies spoke  one after another on various subjects from seizing opportunity  to deepening reform and opening up wider, and from accelerating  development to maintaining stability. The deputies of the  Guizhou delegation centered their discussions on how to  revitalize Guizhou's economy, and jointly talked about  achievements and satisfactory changes in Guizhou over the past  years.    When the deputies expressed their hope that the party  Central  Committee and State Council would further support tobacco and  wine production in Guizhou, Zhu Rongji said: "You must not  further develop tobacco and wine production on a large scale.  The issue you should consider now is not whether to receive  support. You should change your concept and study how to  maintain the existing production capacity and scale. You should  proceed from the reality in Guizhou and take advantage of local  resources to vigorously develop other industries."    Zhu Rongji added with a smile: "You all know that the number  of Chinese smokers ranks first in the world, and no other  country can exceed us in this respect. You cannot say it is not  related to the large number of tobacco plants and their  excessive output. Up until now, there was a large overstock of  tobacco products. If we continue to vigorously develop tobacco  and produce more cigarettes, must we even ask small children to  smoke?"    "This is the tobacco issue. Now let us talk about wine."  Zhu Rongji stated: "Guizhou's Maotai wine is the best in the  country and is well known throughout the world. However, there  must be a limit on wine production. The problem now is too much  Maotai wine in too many places, and there are many fake  products. People don't know what is the matter." He then asked  Deputy Zou Kailiang, secretary of the party committee of the  Maotai Winery: "Don't you think the situation is so?"    Deputy Zou Kailiang nodded his head and replied: "There are  indeed too many fake Maotai products in the market. We hope  concerned departments will take effective measures to solve this  problem." Other deputies grinned at his words.    Zhu Rongji said: "Fake and shoddy products are market  behaviors. This problem is quite serious, and we must rely on  the efforts of all of society to solve the problem and  strengthen people's concept of the legal system." He added:  "You should also adopt measures to tackle the problem. For  instance, you can improve the trademark on your wine bottle to  prevent imitation."    Deputy Zou Kailiang replied: "We are doing precisely this,  and we have undertaken research on integrating wine bottles and  covers."    Zhu Rongji said: Guizhou's economy has two pillar  industries, namely tobacco and wine. However, we must not  produce tobacco and wine in a blind manner, and must have a new  understanding and thinking. You should change your concept in  tobacco and wine production. The key lies in how to strengthen  management, raise quality, and suit the need of the market  instead of expanding the scale of production. The bankruptcy of  some tobacco plants in Guizhou can explain this. He added:  "Guizhou does not lack resources like some have said. Guizhou  has its own advantages. It has strong military industrial  technologies and many natural resources. So long as you proceed  from reality, adjust the production structure of the entire  province according to market needs, attach importance to  developing communications and transportation, and work hard in a  solid manner, Guizhou's economic development has great hopes!"    His words received warm applause. Zhu Rongji smilingly said  to the deputies: "You must all remember--the development of  Guizhou's economy must not merely rely on tobacco and wine. We  must not fix our eyes only on these products."    In holding discussions with NPC deputies from the Jiangxi  delegation, Zhu Rongji repeatedly stressed the importance of  agriculture and grain production. He asked cadres and masses in  Jiangxi to strengthen agriculture and rural work as well as  promote economic and social stability.    During the meeting, Zhu Rongji answered questions raised by  the deputies. He also introduced to the deputies the current  economic conditions at home and the situation of reform and  opening up. Zhu Rongji successively told NPC deputies from  Guizhou and Jiangxi: Guizhou and Jiangxi have both made great  developments in various fields, and have achieved major progress  and achievements in various undertakings. The party Central  Committee and State Council have fully affirmed their progress  and achievements. He hoped people in Guizhou and Jiangxi would  work together with people of the entire country, unite as one,  work with concerted efforts, continue their efforts, and further  improve their work in a solid manner in order to promote the  national economy.    Zhu Rongji encouraged comrades of the two provinces:  Presently the situation in our country is excellent. We must  seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, and maintain  stability. We should correctly handle relations between reform,  development, and stability in order to promote a sustained,  rapid, and sound development of the national economy so as to  further push forward the great cause of socialist modernization  in our country.</p>

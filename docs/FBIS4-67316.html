			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/5/1994 -- [passage  omitted] At a press conference held on 16 May, General Ion  Pitulescu, head of the General Police Inspectorate [IGP], named  a number of points scored against crime syndicates by the  Romanian police. Listed among them are the capture of 112  kilograms of pure heroin, seen as a new blow given to the Balkan  drug connection, for the head of which, now in Spain, the  Romanian police will demand extradition. Another success was the  seizure on 23 April, jointly with the German police, of 55  kilograms of heroin and the apprehension of two persons in  Turkey, one in Germany, and two in Romania. On 11 May the  Syrian citizen Muhammad Khalal was caught while selling one  kilogram of pure heroin worth $30,000. The cooperation with the  German and Dutch police forces made possible the dismantling of  another connection that used to operate on the route Constanta-  Bucuresti-Arad-Netherlands, which trafficked 6,000 kilograms of  hashish. In collaboration with the Chinese police, 10 criminals  were caught, all involved in two sadistic assassinations and  assaults. The same gang is suspected of having killed a fellow  citizen and of having then disposed of his body by chopping it  in a concrete-mixer, which they subsequently dismantled and had  its parts dispersed. Another case regards four groups of  racketeers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  reported to have committed several robberies against tourist  groups. The latest remarkable feat is the capturing of a  12-person gang involved in the stealing and trafficking of 30  million lei worth of electrolytic copper from Zlatna, and of 20  million lei worth of gold-bearing mud. Implicated in this  affair is, as General Pitulescu said, the "Emperor of Gypsies  Everywhere, Iulian I." [passage omitted]</p>

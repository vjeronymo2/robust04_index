One of China's major agricultural centers, Anhui reported a  record output of grain, edible oil, meat, eggs and milk last  year, and an increase in farmers' incomes.    A provincial official in charge of agriculture said farmers  expanded the acreage under quality rice to 666,700 ha last year,  up 200,000 ha over the previous year, while introducing improved  cotton and noted tea varieties.    As a result, they turned out five million kg of tea last  year, worth 130 million yuan.    Last year also saw Anhui produce 260 million kg of cotton,  15.66 million kg of oil-bearing seeds (up 12 percent over the  previous year) and 1.61 million kg of silkworm cocoons (up 13.3  percent).    Now urban residents have more choices of vegetables grown  and  sold by local farmers who pay close attention to the market  needs.    Anhui produced 1.37 million tons of meat last year, an  increase of 6.4 percent over the previous year, 370,000 tons of  eggs, up 2.2 percent, and 340,000 tons of aquatic products, up  11.86 percent.    Following the development of rural industries over the past  two years, farmers' incomes last year reached 670 yuan per  capita, up 100 yuan over 1992.</p>

Figueroa] </F>   [Text] Narcotics Division Chief Ramiro Yarvis of the  Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) has said "clandestine ports" all  across the country are being used by drug traffickers to smuggle  drugs.    Yarvis indicated that Darien Province, currently the site of  an operation to destroy coca plantations, is just one of the  areas in which drug traffickers harvest the drug. He added that  Colombian guerrillas protect the coca plantations in Darien,  where hostile and remote terrain makes entering the jungle  difficult. He admitted that other drug laboratories in Darien  may not have been destroyed. Yarvis said the technical and  personnel resources available to state security agencies, the  PTJ, National Air Service, and the National Maritime Service are  virtually incapable of combating this problem.    "There is a huge number of clandestine ports being used to  smuggle drugs," he noted.    Former National Customs Director Rodrigo Arosemena told  reporters that a bill to authorize the destruction of drugs 24  hours after they are seized is necessary to stop drug  traffickers who are flooding the country with drugs.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Competition attack on councils Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, said yesterday that legal action would be taken against councils if they were found to have taken part in anti-competitive behaviour. He was speaking on the publication of the environment department's first quarterly bulletin of action taken against councils for anti-competitive behaviour or financial failure. Many contractors are complaining that local authorities are using the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations of 1981 to behave anti-competitively when allocating contracts under compulsory competitive tendering, Mr Baldry said. Five councils - Adur, Leeds, Oswestry, Bradford and Langbaurgh - have been served notices relating to anti-competitive behaviour.</p>

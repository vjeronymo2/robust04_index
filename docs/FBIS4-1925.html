			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Han Shaojun (7281 4801 0689): "Use </F> Reform To Promote Science, Technology, and Education"]    [Excerpts] On the morning of 14 March, accelerating the  transformation of scientific and technological achievements and  the technological progress of enterprises to ensure education's  priority position was the major subject of the discussion of  Hebei Province's deputation to the National People's Congress  session.    Entrusted by the State Council, Song Jian, state councillor  and minister of the State Scientific and Technological  Commission, discussed the "government work report" together with  Hebei deputies and listened to their opinions.    Deputy Liu Zongyao said: "As indicated by Premier Li Peng in  his government work report, we should closely combine scientific  and technological progress with the economy and should translate  scientific and technological achievements into practical  productive forces. These remarks have inspired us greatly."  Liu Zongyao said: At present, the construction of synthetic  materials is developing very quickly in the world. To  facilitate exchange and cooperation between China and the world,  we are required to establish a nationwide association with  regard to this discipline as quickly as possible. However, this  is a cross-professional discipline, and thus its establishment  has not yet been decided.    After hearing this, Song Jian said: "Give me one copy of the  data, and I will help you in this work."    Deputy Liu Zongyao revealed that at present a product must  undergo too many reckless technological appraisals, and that  quality control is not strict. On hearing this, Deputy Ye  Liansong said: "The more the market economy develops, the more  quality control should be strengthened. We should rapidly  develop some authoritative intermediate organizations to  strictly conduct appraisals in order to prevent fake and  inferior products from passing the inspections."    Deputy Zhou Deman revealed that some large and medium-sized  enterprises are overloaded with burdens and thus are having  difficulties in operation. Deputies Cheng Weigao and Ye  Liansong said: We should invigorate large and medium-sized  enterprises. If we refuse to increase investment in science and  technology and refuse to develop readily marketable products  through technological progress, invigoration will be an empty  talk. Enterprises should not depend on the state to increase  the investment in science and technology, but should be willing  to release a portion of their funds for research and development  of new products. All products have an infancy period, growth  period, mature period, and old period. We should produce a  generation of products, research a generation of products, and  store a generation of products from a long-term point of view.  By saying that some enterprises bear heavy burdens, it means,  in the final analysis, that they lag behind in products and  efficiency. Refusing to exert great efforts in technological  progress, an enterprise will witness a down cycle and its  situation will become difficult increasingly.    In her speech, Deputy Chen Bingzhen expressed with deep  feeling: Several years ago, some hot issues concerning education  began to cool down. Conducting a series of major reform  measures among institutions of higher learning for this, the  state has provided a two-way choice for distribution of college  graduates and encouraged college graduates to study abroad and  return freely. The state has also popularized the credit  system. These measures have encouraged students to make  positive progress and has stabilized campuses. She added:  Reform has forced the research achievements of colleges to go  beyond the laboratory. [passage omitted]    Song Jian said: Both the promotion of technological progress  of enterprises and the operation of education, science, and  technology requires funds and requires economic strength as  their backing. This year, the state has again increased the  input in science, technology, and education, thus manifesting  its high attention to them. He said: For a long time in the  past, we were accustomed to conservative, backward, and narrow  traditional concepts and to outmoded production forms so our  productive forces were very low. With the start of reform and  opening up, however, we have effected great change and  enhancement. We should further seize the opportunity, deepen  reform, expand opening up, maintain stability, and enhance labor  productivity on a large scale.    Song Jian said: Achieving success in reform, opening up, and  socialist modernization, we should fully depend on and exploit  the creativity of the people and pay attention to the pioneering  spirit of the people. We should dare to make innovations, try  everything, and conduct reform. So long as we unite as one  under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, we will be able to  overcome difficulties and press forward reform, opening up, and  modernization.</p>

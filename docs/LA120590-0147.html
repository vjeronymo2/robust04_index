			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRAQ ACCEPTS BUSH'S OFFER TO HOLD TALKS  </P> <P> Iraq has accepted President Bush's offer to hold talks on the Persian Gulf  crisis, the State Department said today.  </P> <P> "The Iraqi government has accepted President Bush's Dec. 1 proposal to hold  meetings between the U.S. government and the Iraqi government," State  Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in a statement.  </P> <P> "We are engaged with them on dates and arrangements for the two meetings," she  said.  </P> <P> Bush had proposed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein send his foreign  minister, Tarik Aziz, to Washington. Then, Bush said, Secretary of State James  A. Baker III would go to Baghdad.  </P> <P> In the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires today, Bush said any talks would be  mandated by U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been adopted since the  crisis began.  </P> <P> "That means no concession of territory. That means freedom of innocent people  that are held against their will. . . . And that means the eventual security  and stability of the gulf, although that's not specified by the resolution,"  Bush said.  </P> <P> His comments came before the State Department announced that Iraq had accepted  the offer to hold talks.  </P> <P> Joe Wilson, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, was called in by the Iraqi Foreign  Ministry to be told of Iraq's acceptance of the offer, the announcement said.  </P> <P> Bush's unexpected overture followed mounting complaints in Congress that the  Administration was rushing into war with Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait  without giving diplomacy enough time for the pursuit of a peaceful settlement.  </P> <P> Even so, Bush pledged that the Administration would not waver from the  resolution approved last Thursday by the U.N. Security Council threatening a  forceful eviction of Iraqi troops if they did not withdraw by Jan. 15.  </P> <P> Bush, in making the offer to swap envoys, said Baker would not waver from the  three demands.  </P> <P> "The best way to get that across is one-on-one, Baker looking him in the eye,"  Bush said.  </P> <P> The President and Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem held talks today on  economic and political issues two days after a bloody Argentine army uprising  that killed 13 soldiers and civilians.  </P> <P> Bush, on the third leg of a weeklong Latin American goodwill tour that began in  Brazil on Monday, planned to use the daylong visit to promote his scheme to  create a vast free trade zone throughout the Western Hemisphere.  </P></p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Pressure builds for Europol to replace Interpol AN unlikely alliance of US law enforcers, Flemish politicians and police officials, is pressing for Europol, the proposed EC criminal intelligence agency, to replace Interpol as a credible international crime-fighting network. In Brussels yesterday, Mr Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the US National Association of Chiefs of Police, and Mr Quinlan Shea, a former advisor to the US department of justice, said leaks of information on terrorism and drug trafficking had discredited Interpol. Several top Interpol officials have been convicted of drug-trafficking over the last five years. 'They say you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear: well, we need a silk purse international criminal intelligence agency, and Interpol is always going to be at least partly pig,' said Mr Shea. Mr Willy Kuijpers, a member of the Belgian parliament's upper chamber, said Europol should be subject to democratic control and data protection principles. A Strasbourg-based team of EC police officials is in the early stages of setting up Europol, which is supposed to start work by the beginning of next year. But there is still much debate among EC member states as to what it should do. Participants in yesterday's debate admitted that it was a long way from becoming a full alternative to Interpol. 'We have hopes for Europol as a start, mainly because we have no hopes for Interpol,' said Mr Shea.</p>

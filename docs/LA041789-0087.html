			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A NEW START;  </P> <P> BARRETT REBUILDS LIFE WITH SOFTBALL AFTER CAR ACCIDENT SHORTENS SWIMMING CAREER  </P> <P> Swimming saved the life of Toni Barrett; softball slowly pieced it back  together.  </P> <P> For Barrett, 26, a promising swimming career came to screeching halt more than  six years ago when the car she was driving was broadsided at a Huntington Beach  intersection, crushing her left side and destroying her dreams of swimming at a  major university.  </P> <P> Three others in the car suffered only scrapes and cuts, but Barrett survived  mainly because of her swimming background, doctors said.  </P> <P> "My lungs were very developed from swimming," said Barrett, who swam and played  softball at Marina High School before continuing with a successful swimming  career at Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> "Doctors told me that anyone else would not have been able to live through it."  </P> <P> Six ribs and half a lung were taken out of Barrett's body in 10 1/2 hours of  emergency surgery on that New Year's Day in 1983, the day before her 20th  birthday.  </P> <P> But perhaps even more painfully, her dreams of a swimming scholarship at a  major university were snatched from her grasp.  </P> <P> She spent the next 17 days in a hospital as her chances of earning a  scholarship slowly sank along with her second and final swimming season at  Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> In 1986, she attempted to swim competitively again at OCC, but her lungs didn't  have the capacity to keep her going.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't do it," Barrett said. "That was a big letdown."  </P> <P> Such a big letdown that she decided to end her athletic career.  </P> <P> "I was really determined to not do anything," Barrett said. "I was always  whining. I was in a slump, I guess you could say."  </P> <P> That continued about two years until a friend talked to her about playing  softball again, which eventually turned around her life.  </P> <P> "I finally overcame the fact that I was in an accident," Barrett said. "I just  decided to try to play it."  </P> <P> So she took her fragile body out to the Golden West College softball diamond,  where Coach Betsy Ward, Barrett's coach at Marina High School, welcomed her  aboard.  </P> <P> During the 1988 season, she batted .348 and had a .980 fielding percentage at  first base en route to becoming an All-Orange Empire Conference selection.  </P> <P> This season, her hitting has dropped off. She's batting .215 as the Rustlers  (15-12 overall, 5-7 in conference play) are vying for the third and final  playoff spot.  </P> <P> She's not complaining, however.  </P> <P> "She never complains," Ward said. "She never says that she's sore or hurt. You  can see the pain in her face when she swings hard, but she doesn't say  anything.  </P> <P> "The girls new to the team didn't know she had been in an accident and had been  left with half a body. When they found out, they said, 'God, look at how hard  she works.' "  </P> <P> She doesn't have trouble running the bases and playing the field, but her  reduced lung capacity limits her endurance running in practice.  </P> <P> Despite her slump at the plate, Barrett's work habits and fielding have not  suffered.  </P> <P> "We get a lot of lead outs because she comes up and fields bunts so well," Ward  said.  </P> <P> "She could play anywhere. She's even tried third base and she's a super  outfielder, but first base is where she has her experience."  </P> <P> She probably could play other sports, but is content with softball.  </P> <P> "I still swim for fun," Barrett said. "I like to play all sports, but softball  is for me right now."  </P> <P> Barrett still has to be careful, though.  </P> <P> Doctors pulled out fragments of what amounted to six ribs during the emergency  surgery the day of the accident. The rest of the ribs were wired together as a  makeshift rib cage.  </P> <P> Four years ago, she fell off a skateboard and fractured a few ribs. Two years  ago, she fractured ribs while swinging the bat and surgery followed to remove a  piece of rib growing the wrong way.  </P> <P> But, for the most part, her return to softball has been smooth.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, it was really hard," Barrett said. "But I'm in better shape  now. It doesn't bother me.  </P> <P> "I was always very athletic. I don't think I would have been able to accept not  playing anymore."  </P> <P> Playing softball seems to have been her best cure.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want anyone to pity me," Barrett said. "There's nothing really to  pity me about. Maybe they can say it's great that I'm playing. But it's over. I  don't really feel like hearing that there's anything wrong with me.  </P> <P> "I feel I could play any sport I wanted to, but softball is a sport I've played  all my life."  </P> <P> And first base is where she wants to stay at least for the rest of this season.  </P> <P> After that, who knows?  </P> <P> Barrett might go on to a four-year college to continue with softball or she  might attend nursing school.  </P> <P> "You see how some nurses treat you and you want to be able to help out,"  Barrett said. "I've been through so much, maybe I could help the patients a  little."  </P></p>

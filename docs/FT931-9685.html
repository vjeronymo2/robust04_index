			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Treasury rules on a tax bill fit for a Queen: John Authers and Scheherazade Daneshkhu examine the taxable status of the royal holdings AGREEING the Queen's tax bill has not been easy, the Treasury and Buckingham Palace admitted yesterday. Two decisions had to be made when setting the amount that the Queen will have to pay - how much of her wealth would be liable to tax, and which taxes would be levied on them. The Queen will only pay tax on her personal income - the palace has gone to some lengths to separate this fund from income received in her capacity as sovereign. For example, the royal art collection will from April 1 be owned by a charity to be called the Royal Collection Trust. All income from the civil list, set by parliament and paid by the Treasury, and all grant-in-aid for the royal palaces, paid annually to the Royal Household by the Department of National Heritage, will not be liable to tax. This division is regarded as fair by Mr Richard Lees-Pulley, partner at accountants Ernst &amp; Young. 'After all, employees get deductions for money expended for business purposes.' Another source of income, apart from the Queen's personal wealth, is the privy purse, which derives most of its revenue from the Duchy of Lancaster. Its surplus in the year to September 1992 was Pounds 3.6m. Its main purpose is to meet official expenditure not covered by the civil list, but part of it is used for private expenditure. Finally, there is the Queen's personal portfolio of investments. The palace refused to give any indication of its value, beyond saying that an estimate of Pounds 100m was 'grossly overstated'. Income and capital gains tax will be paid in the normal way, subject to a deduction to cover the official expenditure made by the privy purse. In both cases this is likely to mean payments at the top rate of 40 per cent. 'I'm surprised that the Queen has put herself into the position of many of our wealthy clients,' said John Andrews of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'She has thrown herself into the main tax net.' However, others argue that since much of the Queen's wealth does not produce income, the amount she will pay may not be substantial, particularly if she avoids realising capital gains. There are many ways in which she could reduce the amount of income on which she would be taxed. Lees-Pulley suggests going into partnership with Prince Philip to run her farms and borrowing a large amount to inject into the partnership. Interest on the loan would be deductible against general income. The Queen presumably has no pension and she could make take the tax-efficient step of making pension contributions, subject to an earnings cap. She will also be able to use the unique inheritance tax exemption given to her as sovereign, in a significant concession made by the Treasury. This allows her to leave an unlimted amount to her successor - including the private palaces and entire investment portfolio. But the Queen and all the royal family are liable to council tax and VAT in the usual way. One accountant from a large City firm said the inheritance tax concession was not startling. Under current rules, business and agricultural property are effectively exempt from inheritance tax. If being sovereign is regarded as a business, the inheritance tax exception is similar to the current rules. This particular inheritance tax rule however applies only to sovereigns. Thus, if the Prince of Wales were to die without ascending to the throne, his estate would be liable to full inheritance tax. If he does become king, he will be able to make bequests to the next sovereign free of inheritance tax. The reasoning behind this concession shows the difficulty in separating the monarch's official and private lives. According to a report by the royal trustees, the inheritance tax concession was allowed because, 'the monarchy as an institution needs sufficient private resources to enable it to continue to perform its traditional role in national life, and to have a degree of financial independence from the government of the day.' Antony Thorncroft writes: the Royal Collection Trust, which is to be set up to conserve and exhibit the Queens's pictures, will take possession of the finest family art collection in the world. It contains 7,000 oil paintings, 30,000 drawings and watercolours, and 1,000 miniatures. Most of the great names among the Old Masters are in the collection, which was mainly assembled by King George III, King George IV and Queen Victoria. The Queen has been generous with loans from the collection, and part of it is always on view at the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace.                              *      *      * THE Queen's income tax return will almost certainly be scrutinised by Inland Revenue officials housed in a drab post-war building in south Wales, Andrew Jack writes. Until last week, when it was acknowledged in a Commons written answer, the Revenue had refused to admit the existence of the Public Departments building at Tyglas Road in Llanishen, a suburb of Cardiff. About a dozen so-called Public Departments are based in different parts of the complex, which deal with the taxes of civil servants, members of the armed forces and other public employees. A VIP unit in Public Department 1 deals with the tax affairs of politicians, members of the security services and other prominent officials, including members of the royal family who pay tax. Revenue officials and members of the Royal Household refused to give details about how much tax the Queen and the Prince of Wales might pay, arguing that they will be entitled to the same privacy as other taxpayers. But the memorandum of understanding for royal taxation released yesterday shows that they will be subject to interest on any late payments of tax - as well as refunds if they overpay. Final details of what financial information the Queen sends to the Revenue have yet to be determined. The compilation of the figures will be conducted by the finance and property services division of the Royal Household. This is headed by Mr Michael Peat, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, who was made auditor of the privy purse in 1990, a post held by his family for four generations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 21 (YONHAP) -- The government is pushing  to hold the proposed inter-Korean summit by mid-July after  completing preliminary contacts between the two sides' deputy  premiers by early next month.    Responding to the offer of an unconditional summit made by  North Korean leader Kim Il-song, a government official said  Tuesday that the two sides will meet beforehand to schedule the  summit for July in Seoul or Pyongyang, or a third place named by  North Korea. He added, however, that contacts with Pyongyang  will follow Seoul's judgement that North Korea is sincere about  the summit.    The summit's success or failure is totally up to the North  Koreans despite varying internal and international conditions,  he stressed, forecasting the meeting would be held in July if  North Korea showed sincerity.    Meanwhile, the government plans to accept any change of date  for the preliminary contacts if North Korea counterproposes a  date that is within one week of June 28, the date proposed by  Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok.    If North Korea launches another political offensive, such as  the 10-point program adopted by its Supreme People's Council on  April 7 last year, the government will stop seeking a summit and  instead intensify its efforts to secure a UN resolution imposing  sanctions on the North.    Earlier Tuesday, Deputy Premier and National Unification  Minister Yi Hong-ku met with senior presidential secretary for  foreign and national security affairs Chong Jong-uk to discuss  preparations for the preliminary contacts.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Peace is on everyone's lips in optimistic Belfast It was as if Christmas had arrived early in central Belfast yesterday. 'Peace at last' proclaimed the billboard outside the Belfast Telegraph on the city's main thoroughfare in Royal Avenue. For a community inured to 25 years of death and destruction and living apart it was almost too good to be true. While MPs and councillors assessed the political climate in the wake of the ceasefire, shoppers, students and the business community were less concerned with affairs of state. One elderly woman summed up the general feeling. 'If they have all stopped shooting for ever, that's good enough for me. I could not care less what they do with their guns. They can hang them up at their fireplaces if they like.' The centre of Belfast has been a neutral zone where people have been able to mingle freely without worrying about each other's religions. Yesterday, talk of hopes for the future was on everyone's lips. No-one had any time for the sceptics. Yes, there was a long hard road of reconciliation ahead but for now the silencing of gunfire was all that mattered. At the Rock Bar in the Falls Road less than three weeks ago, loyalists left a bomb outside the front door. Yesterday barman Patrick McCabe said: 'Maybe we can get a bit of peace now.' But the guard is not being dropped just yet. 'We will keep the security on and see how it goes for a while.' On the lower Shankill, a hardline Loyalist area which has endured its fair share of heartache, one shopkeeper said: 'I hope it's over but I don't want to get carried away. It will not be easy to forgive and forget but we must start somewhere.' At Castle Street, which leads into the staunchly republican Lower Falls area, a young police officer was sharing a joke with a couple of youths. It was hardly an earth shattering event but a significant gesture given Ulster's grim past. But for one woman October 13 will not be remembered as the day the peace began but the day her husband died - while walking in the street. Mrs Pauline Hegney cried when she heard when the ceasefire would start. Three years ago last night her husband Karl, 33, was shot dead by the UVF in Ormeau Road in south Belfast. 'He was just an innocent victim of sectarian murder,' she said.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Second threat to Glaxo's Zantac GLAXO'S victory on Friday over Novopharm, the Canadian manufacturer of generics drugs, about the US patents of Zantac, the world's best-selling medicine, increases the British group's chances of winning a second patent case next year. Genpharm, a Canadian generics company smaller than Novopharm, is due to challenge Glaxo's patents next May. Lawyers representing Genpharm attended the Novopharm case, which was heard in North Carolina, near Glaxo's US headquarters. Both Canadian groups claim an unstable liquid form of the drug, for which Glaxo's patent expires in December 1995, is insufficiently different from the marketed form to justify different patents. The stable form's patents expire in 2002. If Novopharm had won, it would have been able to market a generic version of Zantac in the US from January 1996. Glaxo's victory was crucial to the company's future. In the last financial year, Zantac, an ulcer treatment, generated sales of Pounds 2.17bn, equivalent to 44 per cent of group turnover. Sales of drugs whose US patents have recently expired have halved in a year. About half Zantac's sales are in the US. Some analysts believe the case depressed the shares by up to 100p. The shares closed at 644p on Friday. At Glaxo's full-year results earlier this month, Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive, warned there were additional threats to Zantac other than the patent challenges. They remain: The expiry next year of the US patents of Zantac's main competitor, SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Zantac will have to compete with cheap generic versions of that drug. The eradication of helicobacter pylori, a bacterium which has recently been discovered to be implicated in ulcers. If doctors decided to eradicate the bug rather than prescribe Zantac-type drugs, the market could collapse. Over-the-counter non-prescription versions of best-selling anti-ulcer drugs such as Tagamet and Merck's Pepcid. The immediacy of this threat receded last week because of the refusal of US Food and Drug Administration advisory committees to recommend an OTC version of Tagamet. New-generation drugs, such as Astra's Losec. Generic versions of unstable liquid form of Zantac after its patents expire at the end of 1995. Dr Sykes played down this threat, arguing there were doubts about the quality of generic manufacturing.</p>

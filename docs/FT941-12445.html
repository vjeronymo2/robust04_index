			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Books: Flawed visions - Bryan Appleyard's first novel THE FIRST CHURCH OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM by Bryan Appleyard Doubleday Pounds 14.99, 272 pages Those familiar with the journalism and other non-fiction writings of Bryan Appleyard will expect his first novel to be daring in theme and flawed in execution. They will not be disappointed. Appleyard's last book, Understanding the present: science and the soul of modern man was a sweeping polemic against 'spiritually corrosive' scientists. Before that came Culture Club: Crisis in the arts and then Art and imagination in post-war Britain. In between he gave us what must be judged a bonsai in landscapes of such scale, a biography of the architect, Richard Rogers. The intellectual terrain of this novel is also ambitious. Stephen Rix is an architect in mid-life crisis, using a stupidly fast car to zip between mediocre projects, a family he has ceased to notice and a mistress who arouses everything but his curiosity. Then one day, in a field outside his country house, he experiences, with all the impressiveness of virtual reality, a vision of a gothic cathedral. When he allows this hopeful inspiration to be captured by a property developer for whom spirits are found only in bottles, he is propelled to the edge of doom. A final, anarchic act of intellectual freedom does not alter the essential bleakness of this post-modern fable. Appleyard is an impetuous writer and thus not always master of the novel's tone. This shifts between dense and heaving passages of gothic imagination, comic juxtaposition, irony and even brief parody of the pulp romance. It is presumably meant to be funny that a sculptor Rix meets in the pub spouts metaphysics and immediately acquires the significance of John the Baptist. Yet the serious side of the story requires this pre-Messianic intensity to have some credibility and power to engage. The church building becomes an occasion for mystical knee-trembling, for examining the nature of reality, as well as for lectures on the mathematical perfections of gothic style - 'the precariousness and the disturbing energy were the point.' But Rix's neglected and over-efficient wife surely scores a hit when she accuses her husband of 'elevating your own wants and needs to some great system' or, as his partner puts it, of working in 'adulterer's gothic.' Although the book's characters are incompletely established, there is some shrewd description of life around the architectural practice, whose members inhabit a millennial society which glumly echoes the style pages of today's Sunday Times. The author has a talent for arresting images, as when Rix's two main tormentors park their elaborate cars at his front door in a T-formation 'as if signalling to passing aircraft that this was the right house to bomb.' With Appleyard, however, it is the boldness of the canvas which demands attention. Some of the ideas stimulate, even thrill, just as others collapse through rotten rafters of cliche or superficiality. We are led pleasurably enough into speculation about the origins of religion and the problem of modernity. But when Rix tells us that at their first meeting his wife saw straight through his 'vacuous, supposedly intriguing generalisations,' some readers may encounter alarming gothic visions of Mr Appleyard. It is no doubt too crude to see the early-40s Appleyard in the early-40s Rix. Yet I could not help thinking that the advice Rix receives from his florid partner, Orlando, for dealing with the perils of one's 42nd year come uncomfortably close to circumscribing the limits of this novel's achievement. 'The important thing,' says Orlando, 'is not to say or do anything boring.' This is a clever novel; some will think too clever for its own good. And it is certainly less boring than watching Middlemarch on TV.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Curb on banks' holdings urged The Social Democratic party (SPD), the main opposition party, has proposed a law forbidding banks and insurance companies from holding stakes of more than 5 per cent in other companies. This follows charges that the present network of large, overlapping stakes does not allow enough transparency and keeps out foreign investors. The new law would also try to make supervisory boards more effective by preventing any one person from sitting on more than five boards, instead of the present limit of 15. It would also be forbidden to sit on the boards of companies competing with each other. While there is almost no chance that the law will be enacted before the October general elections, the SPD said the measures would be a priority during its first year in office if it won the October elections. German banks, most notably Deutsche Bank, which is the largest and best known, have become extremely sensitive to charges that they operate a 'closed shop' with their shareholdings. Criticism of the banks has gathered pace following the recent collapse of Jurgen Schneider AG, the construction group which had been lent DM1.3bn by Deutsche Bank. Frantic efforts earlier this year to save Metallgesellschaft, the metals and industrial group, after it lost DM2.3bn in oil futures trading, also drew criticism of the supervisory board system which in this case had failed to spot the risks. 'A gentleman's club of management board members mutually approves each others' activities at annual general meetings,' the SPD said in a statement. The SPD legislation, called an 'Amendment of the Economic Law for More Transparency and Competition', also requires that salaries paid to members of management and supervisory boards be declared and that shareholders have more extensive rights to challenge decisions made by the two boards.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate hopes stay alive THE lack of movement from the German Bundesbank on key interest rates yesterday prompted some analysts and strategists to look for a cut at the next council meeting on December 10, the last one this year, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ended higher on hopes of an early round of interest rate cuts led by the Bundesbank, in spite of its decision to do nothing yesterday. Dealers said that the market also believed if the Bundesbank failed to cut rates, the resulting pressure on the franc would lead to a devaluation and consequently lower domestic rates. The CAC-40 index ended 18.71 higher at 1,739.68, its third successive rise, but turnover was thin at FFr1.74bn. Pleasing third-quarter US growth figures, which raised hopes of a speedier recovery in the US economy, lifted stocks with transatlantic exposure. Pechiney CIs put on FFr12 or 4.8 per cent to FFr260 and Lafarge added FFr6.50 FFr305.80. Hopes that Opec would agree to keep oil output at less than 25m barrels per day lifted oil stocks, as Elf added FFr9.10 to FFr330.90 and Total put on FFr2.50 to FFr234.50. MADRID registered a sizeable rise for the first time in a week, the general index closing 2.83 higher at 214.77. In a firm banking sector Banesto, relatively weak recently, rose Pta115 or 5.8 per cent to Pta2,090 on takeover rumours. Mr Stephen Hughes of Nikko Europe said that the latest macro-economic figures from Spain have been better than expected, indicating a light at the end of the tunnel and tempting foreign investors to return to the market. Furthermore, the peseta was holding fairly firm after the weekend devaluation. FRANKFURT mounted a minor technical recovery and responded to some better-than-expected company news. The DAX index closed 5.46 higher at 1,523.18 as turnover rose from DM4.5bn to DM6.1bn. Some demand came from futures trading, where the December DAX contract touched a high of 1,543 before dropping back to trade at 1,535 in the early afternoon. Company news came most noticeably from Thyssen, BHF Bank and Asko. Thyssen net profits fell to DM350m and the dividend from DM10 to DM6, but this was generally better than analysts had feared. Mr Michael Geiger at County NatWest said that he had been looking for DM220m and DM5 respectively as the shares rose DM3.10 to DM158. BHF Bank outperformed the banking sector, putting on DM4 to DM408 after it reported a 20.5 per cent increase in group partial operating profits for the first ten months of 1992. In retailing, Asko rose DM33 to DM533 after the German cartel office approved a planned merger of the company with the Metro retail group, provided that the two divested themselves of some stores. This reversed an earlier decision blocking the merger. STOCKHOLM paused again, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 3.5 lower at 862.5 after a 2.9 per cent gain on Wednesday. The decline was led by the blue chips which spearheaded the recent rally, and turnover stayed heavy although it fell from SKr1.37bn to SKr1.12bn. Banks continued to outperform as the sector index put on 12.9 per cent. Handelsbanken B rose SKr4.5 to SKr34.5 and S-E-Banken by SKr2 to SKr17. The krona devaluation is expected to lead to lower loan losses and an upswing in real estate values. OSLO extended its upswing on speculation that Norway may be forced to devalue, but this time the all-share index ended only 2.63 higher at 357.35 in active turnover of NKr342m. Industrial shares, which would benefit from devaluation, were in the forefront again with Norsk Hydro NKr3 higher at NKr142.5. MILAN ended lower in slow trading and the Comit index fell 4.17 to 442.63 in turnover estimated at slightly more than Wednesday's relatively low L181bn. Shares in the Ferruzzi group were in the limelight following newspaper reports of management reshuffles and asset disposals. Montedison was fixed L5 lower at L1,151, but then surged to L1,200 later on. Fondiaria, the insurer in which Ferruzzi has an interest, rose L750 or 2.8 per cent to L27,900. Ferruzzi Finanziaria added L71 to L1,253 in volume of 3.79m shares, the third most heavily dealt screen stock. The state-controlled food group SME rose another L87 to L5,620. AMSTERDAM saw Nedlloyd lose Fl 1.50 to Fl 29.60 as the company warned that it would once again announce a net loss at the end of the year but that it would not be as severe as last year's. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 103.2 in thin trading. ISTANBUL jumped by 2.7 per cent on active buying, triggered by renewed hopes that a long-awaited tax decree designed to encourage institutional investment in equities would be agreed. The 75-share index closed 97.91 higher at 3,749.76.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 26                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes               Open       10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1047.30    1048.94     1049.23    1049.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1114.90    1115.01     1116.49    1118.99  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Nov 25      Nov 24     Nov 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100              1042.55     1038.83    1038.38 FT-SE Eurotrack 200              1111.41     1110.69    1110.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1048.67    1049.50    1048.96    1048.05 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1118.78    1118.21    1118.51    1118.56  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Nov 20                Nov 19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100              1051.29               1047.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200              1117.40               1110.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1050.53 ; 200 -  1119.13 Low/day: 100 -  1047.16  200 -  1113.83  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

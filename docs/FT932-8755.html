			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Perez waits for court to settle his future: Impeachment looms for Venezuela's leader VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez, who survived two attempted coups last year, could be forced out of office by legal proceedings before his five-year term expires in February 1994. The Venezuelan supreme court is expected to decide this week whether there is sufficient cause to impeach the president for alleged mishandling of Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) in government funds appropriated for security and defence purposes in 1989. The charges - the first to be lodged against a sitting president in Venezuela's 35 years of democracy - were filed with the court in March this year by Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, the attorney-general. The case, and the president's erratic reactions to the threat of impeachment, have caused a political crisis, confusing domestic and international capital markets and sparking fears of a new coup. Venezuelan authorities have increased police and national guard patrols throughout the capital in anticipation of anti-government protests this week. Officials are particularly concerned that if the supreme court should decide in favour of the beleaguered president, the ruling could unleash violent demonstrations. If the court decides that there is sufficient cause to proceed against Mr Perez, the Venezuelan constitution says the Senate must then decide, by a majority vote, whether to confirm the decision. If the senate does decide that the president should be tried - and Mr Perez lacks a majority in the upper house - he will be suspended from office and then tried by the supreme court. During the suspension, the chairman of the senate, Mr Octavio Lepage of the ruling Democratic Action (AD) party, is supposed to take over as acting president. However, there is confusion over the legal situation. While the constitution stipulates a succession procedure, it does not clearly cover all eventualities. Mr Perez, for example, earlier this month said he would resign if the supreme court voted to impeach him or if it delayed a decision. Now, however, he says he will appoint an acting president from his cabinet and devote up to 90 days to his legal defence; he denies all wrongdoing. The president originally told friends and associates on May 5 that he would resign, after the Venezuelan media revealed that the chief justice of the supreme court had issued a supposedly secret opinion favouring impeachment. The president's apparent decision to hold on to office has occasioned intense legal and political debates over whether he legally can, or morally should, appoint a substitute in an attempt to avoid suspension by the senate. Such a move could lead to a direct confrontation between the executive and legislative branches at a time when the country's political stability is very much in doubt. Currently, a majority in congress favours the president's resignation, or at least his acceptance of a suspension from duties during the course of a possible trial. Lawyers say that if the president is found guilty by the supreme court, he would be removed from office and could go to jail. If he is found innocent, he would be reinstated for the remainder of his term. Over the last few days, pressure has become more intense on Mr Perez to quit. The chairman of his own political party called for his resignation and warned that a refusal to step down could cause violence, or leave Venzuela with two presidents - one appointed by Mr Perez and the other by congress. Other important political figures, including Mr Lepage (who stands to take over as acting president), and three presidential candidates from the opposition, also said Mr Perez should leave office. Supporters of the president say the charges do not prove any criminal activity and only indicate a series of administrative irregularities in handling money from a 'secret account' in the Interior Ministry. They say that the attacks on Mr Perez have turned into a political witch-hunt and that the president may be forced to resign because of ill-founded allegations. Ironically, Mr Perez has added to his own difficulties with the supreme court. In the past, members of the court were closely linked to the ruling party and could be expected to rule favourably on any case where the government was involved. However, last year Mr Perez tried to depoliticise the supreme court, which now has five new members who are politically independent.</p>

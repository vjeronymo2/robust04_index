			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khadidja Zeghloul: "Schools: Lessons in </F> Terrorism"; first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] Four school principals in Tlemcen have just  been remanded in custody on charges of "distributing tracts of a  nature to harm the national interest."    What the accused had done was read to their students  Islamist  tracts threatening reprisals against women not wearing the veil.  What is it that immediately strikes one upon hearing that report  by the APS? Only one thing: the fact that those principals are  being prosecuted. Because except for that act of public  salubrity, what could be more banal in today's schools than the  daily passing on of Islamist ideology?    The constant hammering by a good many teachers, backed by  the  reactionary and archaic content of school curricula and the  collusion, complicity, or abdication of public authorities,  parents, and teachers not part of the Islamist movement, has  become a basic given in Algerian schools. Not a day passes  without every child in Algeria being held hostage by that  fascism, which has, with impunity, taken over the national  education sector as a squatter. The fact that four school  principals are now being taken to court for disseminating  subversive tracts is the thing that is surprising. It also sets  a precedent for which the credit should probably go to parents  who have complained. But should it make us forget that the  schools in this republic are working relentlessly on behalf of  obscurantist ideology and its reactionary plan for society?  Should it make us forget that schools have become a formidable,  powerful, and public tool of Islamist extremism, whether  dissolved or legal? Should it make us forget that thousands upon  thousands of teachers are devoting all their class time to  hateful, vehement, and antipatriotic speeches of a nature to  harm the national interest without being disturbed in any way,  thus benefiting from the power of the fait accompli? The fact is  that bringing the four "teachers" from Tlemcen before the  correctional court alerts us once again to a truism: Algerian  public schools are no longer anything but a big national  "zawiyah" creating an "anti-November" and "antifatherland"  spirit. As such, they are in imperative need of an urgent  top-to-bottom overhaul. To realize the urgency of that need, one  must first become aware that, in the words of the late President  Boudiaf, "the schools are a disaster area."    After he made that remark, Algerians, or at least the most  vigilant of them, learned that of the 7,428 prisoners in the  security centers, 1,224 were teachers. That shows the extent of  the moral violations being committed against defenseless  schoolchildren. We can bet that those figures, alarming as they  are, are only the tip of the iceberg. The veil is gradually  being lifted from a disaster whose extent is advancing  inexorably, like a nightmare. At the start of 1993, 315  terrorist teachers had been counted, 250 of them had been  arrested, and 52 others were still being sought.    The Algerian school system is corrupt from the elementary to  the university level. But there is no limit to the horrors. We  thought it had been reached, for example, with the terrorist  academic and computer scientist in Constantine whose leader was  an amir involved in the black market. But now the security  services are giving us a glimpse of the incredible depth of the  disaster: lycee students in their junior and senior years were  recently arrested in the governorate of Alger.    They were involved in terrorist acts and belonged to armed  groups. The teachers are being emulated. Any pupil, any parent,  and any teacher hostile to fascism can bear interminable witness  to all the acts of violence and the violations being encouraged  or tolerated in cowardly fashion, as the case may be, in the  schools. Intimidation and threats are used to force women and  girls to wear the veil, grades are used as blackmail to ensure  compliance with a dress code and an ostentatious display of  bigotry, the youngest pupils in particular are being subjected  to psychological trauma, parents' associations and the FNTE  [expansion not given] are being infiltrated, and so on. Every  kind of charlatanism goes unpunished. So why should we be  surprised when lycee students in Constantine try to kill their  teacher? Considering all the abysses facing us today, surprise  is reserved for other things.    Redha Malek, unwittingly and unwillingly, may have provided  us with proof of that when he congratulated lycee students in  Rouiba for rescuing their teacher from a kidnapping attempt.    In an escalation of the horror, and in accordance with  predictable and infernal logic, the schools, after first  producing fundamentalism and directly encouraging violence, are  now becoming the hostages of terrorism. About 30 teachers have  been murdered and about 60 schools set on fire. More than ever,  the schools are being held hostage by that terrorism and by the  pusillanimity of the authorities, who are hemming and hawing and  letting things slide.    But how can anyone believe that on this crucial and basic  issue, the national school system will ever be straightened out  by a Ministry of Education which, when it was considering a  reform in 1993, planned to include the very people responsible  for the disaster in the discussions? Civil society has certainly  realized its responsibility for this disaster and its duty to  act. Operation "Schoolbag" is set to take place on 16 April.    That date has been proclaimed the Day of Knowledge. Will it  be reappropriated in the interest of progress?</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: View from on high Like Mr Major, the UK equity market has survived this week's Maastricht vote. Like him again, this does not necessarily mean it has much to look forward to. With the FT-SE over 2,700, equities are looking dear in terms of an historic multiple over 16. There is not much economic growth in the offing, after all. Nor has Wall Street rebounded in salute to Mr Bill Clinton. Instead Europe faces the grim prospect of a trade war which, if it happens, will depress activity generally as well as inflicting hardship on individual companies such as Guinness, Grand Metropolitan and Allied-Lyons. What may be sustaining equities is the relative calm in the gilts market. The yield gap is still just below 2. Although this measure is no longer such a reliable indicator of value, it still puts equities in relatively comfortable territory. The question for the coming week is whether that comfort will be disturbed by the chancellor's Autumn Statement. This could happen in one of two ways. An interest rate cut could undermine sterling and hence gilts. As long as any cut is no more than 1 point, though, that seems unlikely. The money markets are discounting such a move and sterling is holding up. But equities have almost certainly factored in a one-point cut. How much they are assuming on public spending is another matter. Mr Lamont might fail to stick to the Pounds 244.5bn target. Or it might be achieved only by sleight of hand with heavy reliance on privatisation receipts, release of council house sale proceeds or unworkable targets for public sector pay. If that were the case, gilts - and therefore equities - would lose their lustre sooner rather than later.</p>

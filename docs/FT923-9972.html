			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Monopoly probe into British Gas: Company adopts high-risk strategy by seeking inquiry after series of rows with regulator THE SIMMERING row between British Gas and the industry regulator Ofgas erupted into the open yesterday as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, agreed to a comprehensive review of the UK gas market by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The surprise move, requested by British Gas, was triggered by disagreements between Ofgas and British Gas over rates of return on the privatised utility's pipeline and storage business. But it is the culmination of several years of strained relations between British Gas and both Ofgas and the Office of Fair Trading. The utility said a series of regulatory changes imposed by the regulators had 'made medium and long-term planning extremely difficult'. They had also brought demands from customers and independent suppliers for more consultation time on the effects of the changes. Mr Cedric Brown asked Mr Heseltine for the referral yesterday morning - only hours before he was due to take over as chief executive of British Gas following the decision by Mr Robert Evans, chairman and chief executive, to split the two roles. It is the first time a privatised utility has opted to subject itself to an MMC investigation. British Gas is not the only utility to have had a turbulent relationship with its regulator since the start of the privatisation process in the early 1980s. British Telecom, for example, has been to the brink of an MMC referral but always drawn back. For British Gas, it is a high-risk strategy which analysts suggested might result in the break-up of the company. The government's decision to agree to British Gas's request to be privatised as a single unit in 1986 is bound to be questioned. An MMC inquiry will mean nine months of intense scrutiny of all aspects of British Gas's UK supply business and a period of prolonged uncertainty for shareholders. It was clear from the wording of the announcement that the government may use the MMC report to change the terms of the Gas Act which privatised British Gas in 1986. The Department of Trade and Industry said Mr Heseltine would have powers to make changes 'in relation to conveyance and storage and more widely'. British Gas agreed to demands from the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year to hive off its transportation and storage business into an arms-length subsidiary by 1994, and to publish new pricing schedules for independent shippers using British Gas pipelines by this September. But it has insisted that tariffs should allow the company to earn a fair rate of return on its pipeline assets  - which it says is 6.7 per cent on existing assets, and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Otherwise, investment in the pipeline by British Gas and its competitors could be threatened. Mr Brown accused Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, of 'ducking the issue' and refusing even to consider raising the rate of return above the current level of 4.5 per cent  - a move which might mean higher prices for gas consumers. 'I have held three meetings with Sir James McKinnon during which we did not even begin talking about the rate of return issue. He suggested this was something that should be handled by the MMC.' Mr Brown said that without agreement on the pipeline issue, it was impossible to implement other agreements reached with the OFT and Ofgas in a 'piecemeal fashion'. He had therefore concluded the MMC should review the whole gas market. Mr John Dorken, deputy director-general of Ofgas, last night denied what he called British Gas's 'misrepresentation'. 'It was quite clear that British Gas's proposals were unacceptable to us. Our view was that rather than have a long, long debate about this, it was better to have them debated by the MMC.' Ofgas itself asked the MMC yesterday to investigate the transportation and storage business, but its request was overtaken by Mr Heseltine's decision to widen the inquiry. British Gas agreed earlier this year to OFT demands to surrender 50 per cent of its share of the industrial gas market to competitors by 1995, and to hive off its pipeline business into a separate subsidiary. It was angered by Ofgas's subsequent insistence that it should submit to a tough formula limiting price rises for domestic customers to 5 per cent less than the rate of inflation  - a formula which Sir James enforced in May by threatening legal action against British Gas if it did not cut its prices.

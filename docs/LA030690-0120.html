			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORMERS RUN STRONGLY IN SOVIET VOTE;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: EARLY RESULTS OF REGIONAL AND LOCAL RACES CONFIRM THE GROWING POWER  OF NEW POLITICAL MOVEMENTS. POPULIST YELTSIN WINS EASILY.  </P> <P> Pro-reform candidates, including radical populist Boris N. Yeltsin and several  former political prisoners, won strong backing from voters in the Soviet  Union's regional and local elections, according to preliminary results released  Monday.  </P> <P> Reformers, both within and outside the Communist Party, appeared to have  captured a significant number of seats in voting Sunday for the parliaments of  Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine, three of the Soviet Union's constituent  republics, and on their local government councils.  </P> <P> Although a second round of voting will be required in hundreds of contests,  candidates wanting to accelerate the pace of reform and broaden its scope  appeared to have secured a significant political victory in the Slavic  heartland of the Soviet Union, both official reports and accounts from local  sources indicated.  </P> <P> The inclusion of a large number of reformers in the republic parliaments, as  well as in many city and regional councils, should bring President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev the support that he says perestroika, his program of political and  economic restructuring, has needed at lower levels to overcome bureaucratic  resistance.  </P> <P> But some of the reformers' politics are well to the left of Gorbachev, and  candidates nominated by nationalists have autonomy, if not independence, as  their first priority.  </P> <P> Early reports indicated that party officials generally managed to avoid the  embarrassing first-round defeats that many had suffered in last year's national  elections. Still, many have been forced into runoff elections this time. Under  Gorbachev, party leaders who lose popular elections are expected to resign  their positions.  </P> <P> The elections confirmed the rapid ascendancy of new political movements -- such  as Democratic Russia and, in the Ukraine, Rukh. They campaigned hard on behalf  of the reformers, often against strong Communist Party machines, and brought  the republics a step closer to multi-party politics.  </P> <P> Although more than 80% of the candidates were members of the Communist Party,  the elections had quickly become contests between conservatives who ran with  party backing and liberals who made bolder reform the basis of their pitch to  voters. These were the first elections in which voters in the three republics  could choose from among candidates of different political movements.  </P> <P> After the recent ouster of nearly 20 regional party leaderships because of  mounting popular discontent, particularly over shortages of food and consumer  goods as well as the abuse of power, party officials may have done well simply  in avoiding defeat.  </P> <P> The large number of candidates, an average of nearly seven for each seat in  most constituencies and with more than 20 in some, complicated the election  process considerably. As many as 85% of the contests appeared to be  inconclusive Monday, according to state television, with no candidate winning  more than half the votes cast. These require a runoff between the top two  candidates in two weeks.  </P> <P> But activists in many areas took the runoffs as a partial but significant  victory and said that the strong showing of opposition candidates in the first  round of voting virtually guaranteed many of them victories in the second.  </P> <P> More than 150 million people were registered to vote, and the turnouts Sunday  ranged from 64% in Moscow and Leningrad to nearly 90% in some other cities,  according to election officials.  </P> <P> Altogether, there were more than 11,000 candidates for 1,800 seats in the three  republics' parliaments, and tens of thousands more candidates sought election  to local governing councils. Official results will not be announced until March  14.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who has become one of Gorbachev's sharpest and most vocal critics in  recent months, won more than 72% of the vote, defeating 11 other candidates, in  Sverdlovsk, an industrial center in the Ural Mountains that remains his  political base.  </P> <P> "The vote gives the possibility to strengthen reforms and allow new measures to  be taken," Yeltsin said in Amsterdam, where he is promoting his recently  published autobiography. "I have been urging Gorbachev to take a whole other  tactic for perestroika. The results show I was right. I will advise him to go  forward faster, with more strength."  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who remains a member of the Communist Party's policy-making Central  Committee, had declared before the election that he would seek the presidency  of the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union's largest republic, if elected,  challenging Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, a member of the party's ruling Politburo, who  now holds the post.  </P> <P> But Yeltsin told a news conference in Amsterdam on Monday that he would need to  assess the number of other reformers elected to the Russian Congress of  People's Deputies and the strength of their support before committing himself.  </P> <P> He warned, however, that if the various blocs, including radicals and  conservatives, are not given proportional representation in the leadership of  the Russian Parliament, he would quit the Communist Party and perhaps start a  rival organization.  </P> <P> Dozens of candidates allied with Yeltsin in the Democratic Russia movement, a  coalition of reform groups, also won first-round victories.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Sergei Kovalyov, a human rights campaigner and former political  prisoner who had worked for years with the late Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel  Peace laureate, appeared to have won election to the Russian Parliament. Lev  Ponomaryov, another human rights activist, appeared to have won a place in a  runoff vote.  </P> <P> Two other prominent winners were Vyacheslav Starkov, editor of the liberal  weekly newspaper Argumenty i Facty, and Alexander Politkovsky, a journalist on  the avant-garde television program Vzglyad.  </P> <P> Sergei Stankevich, a political scientist who has gained considerable popularity  as a member of the national parliament, won election to the Moscow city  council. Gavriil Popov, a liberal economist and Parliament member, secured a  place in a runoff election for the council. Stankevich, Popov and others want  to turn the council into a "liberated zone" and a high-profile base for reform.  </P> <P> Moscow Mayor Valery Saikin and Yuri Prokofiev, the city's Communist Party  leader, were both forced into runoff elections when they failed to get more  than half of the votes cast.  </P> <P> In Leningrad, the group Democratic Elections '90 said its candidates were ahead  in 30 of 34 constituencies and were likely to win three-quarters of the seats  on local and district councils after campaigns that focused on discontent over  living standards in Leningrad.  </P> <P> In the Ukraine, the grass-roots national movement Rukh won most of the seats in  the republic's Parliament from the west but only succeeded in forcing party  candidates into runoff elections in the east. Many of the winners received more  than 80% of the votes cast.  </P> <P> Ivan Drach, a leading Ukrainian poet and Rukh's president, won more than 80% of  the vote in his constituency in Lvov. Other Rukh winners included Vyacheslav  Chornovil, a former dissident journalist, and Mikhail Horyn, the movement's  secretary, who both served lengthy prison terms for their political activities.  </P> <P> All but one of the 22 constituencies in Kiev will go to a second round of  voting because of the tight contests between party candidates and Rukh members.  </P> <P> In the Ukrainian coal mining center of Donetsk, several local Communist Party  officials lost their races to candidates put up by the strike committees formed  by miners last summer that now function as independent trade unions, according  to the Radio Moscow news bulletin Interfax.  </P> <P> In Byelorussia, a small republic northwest of the Ukraine on the Soviet border  with Poland, Zenon Poznyka, the leader of the Byelorussian Popular Front, won  59% of the vote in his district in the capital of Minsk, and other movement  members reportedly did well in urban areas.  </P> <P> In Lithuania, candidates for the nationalist Sajudis movement won additional  seats in runoff elections, bringing to 90 the number of seats they now hold out  of the 141 that have been filled.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Charles P. Wallace, in Lvov, contributed to this report.  </P></p>

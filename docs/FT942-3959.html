			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / EU backers shrug off Haider: Opponent's scare campaign fails in membership referendum battle Whatever the meaning of other messages that arrived in Brussels yesterday from around Europe, those coming from Austria were unequivocally positive. Even the most optimistic pro-European Austrians never dreamed that 66.4 per cent of voters participating in yesterday's referendum would put their support behind joining the EU. An examination of the final days of the referendum campaign suggests that the vote reflected a solid vote of confidence in the EU as an institution. A week ago, opinion polls indicated a very close result, and a scare campaign mounted by the anti-EU camp appeared to be eroding pro-EU sentiment. But by the end of the week, the tide was running heavily in the EU's favour. What happened in between was that the anti-EU forces went too far, and the government was able to undermine their credibility. On Wednesday, Mr Jorg Haider, the populist right-wing leader, held up a container of Spanish yoghurt during a television debate, claiming that it contained a dangerous colouring agent and that Austrians would be obliged to eat it. Mr Haider also intensified his complaints about the intensity of the government's pro-EU campaign, urging resentful voters to use the referendum to teach it a lesson. On Friday, Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister who has campaigned tirelessly for the EU cause in spite of a severe illness, struck back angrily. 'Anyone who thinks this vote is about teaching the government a lesson is behaving on the very edge of what is democratically acceptable,' he said. Then in a moving nationwide address on Friday night, Mr Thomas Klestil, the Austrian president, emphasised what he thought the vote was about. The EU, he said, was an organisation which, for all its faults, had already proved itself as the best and only hope for preventing war again in western Europe. At a time when Austria has watched war ravage much of its southern neighbour, the former Yugoslavia, this message had real meaning. Even in Tyrol, where the problem of lorry transit traffic has made the EU very unpopular, a convincing 58.5 per cent voted in favour of joining. The result should have immediate consequences both inside and outside Austria. Mr Wolfgang Wolte, head of EU affairs in the foreign ministry, said yesterday he was convinced that it would have a positive influence on voters in Norway, Sweden and Finland. They face EU entry referendums in the autumn. In Austria itself, the main impact will be on the political scene, possibly contributing to a realignment among parties after national elections which are due in October. Mr Haider appears to be the big loser from the referendum outcome. Heading into the campaign, his popularity was already at a low ebb following unimpressive showings in provincial elections, the rejection last year of his petition to outlaw immigration and defections of leading parliamentary colleagues. A sometime supporter of EU membership, he decided halfway through the campaign to oppose it, initially claiming that the entry terms that the government had negotiated were unsatisfactory. But he gradually took up any argument he could find. Austria would be overwhelmed by immigrants, unemployment would soar and unsafe food would be allowed in the country, he claimed. Now he could again face calls for his resignation and further defections from among his party's parliamentarians. The ruling socialist-conservative coalition, which presented a unified pro-EU stand throughout the campaign, emerges with its credibility enhanced. It came together in 1986 with the main aim of taking Austria into the EU. Now that goal has been achieved, however, it may well need to redefine itself.</p>

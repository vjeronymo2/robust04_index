			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead likely for Canadian diamond mine BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner have given the clearest indications yet that they are set to go ahead with construction of North America's first diamond mine in the Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories. Announcing another round of encouraging drilling results, BHP and Dia-Met Minerals said that they planned to expand the airstrip at the remote site 300km north-east of Yellow-knife. About 170 people are already working at the site. BHP is also assembling data for environmental impact studies, and holding talks with local communities to address their concerns about mining development. The partners are not scheduled to make a final decision on a mine until the end of this year. But Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, predicted that, based on the latest results, BHP and Dia-Met will initially develop two high-grade kimberlite pipes, known as Koala and Panda. The latest sample from Koala, weighing 1,193 tonnes, yielded 6,600 diamonds with a total weight of 893 carats. The average grade was 0.75 carats a tonne. The Panda pipe, which is almost adjacent to Koala, yielded a total of 270 carats from 230 tonnes of ore, giving an average grade of 1.18 carats a tonne. BHP and Dia-Met also announced the first results from two other pipes, Misery and Falcon. The Misery deposit, which is 44km from Koala, produced a grade of 0.75 carats a tonne from a sample of 132 tonnes. These results included one 4.2 carat stone 'of very significant value'. The partners were expected to disclose further details of their plans at Dia-Met's annual meeting yesterday at its head office in Kelowna, British Columbia.</p>

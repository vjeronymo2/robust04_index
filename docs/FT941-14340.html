			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (1): Roche sets the pace for the FT500 - Peter Martin examines some of the unique qualities of the annual rankings and finds that they are essentially forward looking, reflecting the markets' best guess about the future performance of companies There is a striking change near the top of this year's FT500: the rise of Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, from sixth to third place. The number of places risen is not so remarkable; what stands out is the sheer size of Roche's market capitalisation. At Dollars 35.7bn, it is only Dollars 5bn behind that of British Telecommunications, the UK's dominant phone company. Investors value Roche at four times its total revenues, but they are prepared to offer BT only a multiple of two. And you could in theory buy all the shares of the Netherlands and British companies that make up Unilever, fifth in the FT500, for less than a single year of the consumer product group's revenues. Behind the Roche story lie some of the FT500's unique aspects. Because the annual ranking is based on market capitalisation, it offers a way of comparing companies from different countries and different industries, regardless of the gaps between their accounting conventions. Because it takes the value that investors place upon a company, the ranking changes from year to year as profit outlooks and investment attitudes change. And because that value depends in large part on investors' expectations about companies' profits growth, the FT500 is essentially forward looking, reflecting the markets' best guess about the future performance of companies, their industries, and the domestic economies to which they are exposed. Roche illustrates the way these factors change from year to year. Pharmaceuticals companies in general have had a rough time: Glaxo Holdings, last year the third-ranked company in the FT500, has fallen to seventh place; SmithKline Beecham has dropped from 11 to 23, Wellcome from 29 to 59. These are British companies, but outside the UK, there are similar stories. Elf Sanofi, controlled by France's state-owned Elf-Aquitaine oil giant, has fallen from 112 to 152; Novo Nordisk, Denmark's world leader in synthetic insulin, from 165 to 203. Though the profits of the industry have held up well throughout the recession - among FT500 sectors with more than a handful of companies, drugs is by far the most profitable in terms of return on capital employed - the stock markets have decided that the writing is on the wall. Downward pressure on prices, through formal government controls or a growing reluctance of insurers to meet ever-rising prescription bills, is seen as inevitable around the world. The past year has brought not merely the Clinton health proposals in the US, which aim to hold down healthcare costs by strengthening the market power of purchasers against that of providers, but also a government-induced squeeze on the German drugs market and, in the past months, tighter controls on Italian prescriptions. This growing doubt about future profits growth has dragged down pharmaceuticals companies' share prices around the world. But Roche has remained immune. In its favour are not only a sparkling operating performance - profits are up 31 per cent - but also a number of other factors that run throughout this year's FT500. First, since Roche is a Swiss company, the relative value of its shares has benefited from last year's European devaluations. Though these have been smaller than those of 1992, they have nonetheless raised the value of shares denominated in hard currencies, such as the D-Mark and the Swiss franc, against those in weaker varieties. Second, one factor behind the rise in Roche's market capitalisation over the past few years was a big rights issue in 1991. The willingness of continental companies to tap the international capital markets for new equity has greatly increased in recent years, a trend accelerated by Germany's shift from net exporter of capital to net importer. Third, in order to tap those markets continental companies have had to offer international investors Anglo-Saxon standards of accounting disclosure. The rush towards frankness has been most noticeable in Switzerland, but last year also saw a big step forward in Germany, when Daimler-Benz (number 14 in the FT500) had to agree to report its accounts under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles before the Securities and Exchange Commission would allow it to list on the New York Stock Exchange. Swiss analysts believe that the greater transparency of accounting principles among big companies there is enhancing the value of their shares. Both Roche's ascent to third place and the rise of Union Bank of Switzerland from 25 to 15 (making it Europe's third most valuable bank) owe something to these two companies' more transparent accounts as well as to the skills of their respective researchers and financial experts. For Europe as a whole, 1993 was a year of healthy stock market performance, with most leading markets reporting rises of around a quarter, and German shares leaping by nearly half. Because of the FT500's cut-off date of September 30, however, the headiest months of the year, in the final quarter, do not show up in the rankings. The outperformance of the German stock market was heavily concentrated in the closing months of the year, which partly, though not entirely, explains why the biggest German companies turned in a lacklustre performance in this year's FT500. Siemens slipped from 8th to 10th; Deutsche Bank from 10th to 12th. The big German chemicals companies did not sparkle: Bayer's ranking was unchanged, Hoechst and BASF both fell. With a couple of exceptions, British companies also had an unremarkable year. The best-performing big British company was HSBC Holdings, the parent of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Britain's Midland Bank, which moved from 19th to 8th, making it Europe's most valuable bank. This was the year that HSBC became a true-blue British company, as it brought itself fully within the UK tax net. But Hongkong still accounts for the lion's share of the group's profits. BTR overtook Hanson and now, at number 16, it is rubbing shoulders with Daimler-Benz (14) a company four times larger in terms of sales and employees. French companies have always been under-represented at the top levels of the FT500, because so many big French businesses are state-owned. Last year's election of a centre-right government committed to large-scale privatisation will shortly make that cliche obsolete, and the first signs are evident in this year's rankings. In at number 79 comes Rhone Poulenc, which took a stock exchange listing for its ordinary shares in January 1993. Next year's list will count several more, including Banque Nationale de Paris. A similar pattern can be expected elsewhere in Europe. Italy's coming wave of privatisations has not yet made an impact on the FT500, but Spain's Argentaria, a merger of state-owned banks, obtained a stock market listing in May, entering the rankings at number 107. Among this year's casualties are several takeover victims. Freia Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate maker, succumbed to a bid from Philip Morris of the US, and Germany's Hoesch steel firm surrendered its independence to Fried. Krupp (joining the FT500 at 340). Au Printemps, the Paris department store, was taken over by the Pinault investment group (303); and Ranks Hovis McDougall of the UK succumbed to Tomkins, the conglomerate (139). Two friendly mergers united companies already well-placed in the rankings. In publishing, the UK's Reed (63 last year) got together with the Netherlands' Elsevier (100 last year) to form a new group ranked 41st. In France, Matra's merger with Hachette created a curious hybrid of media group and defence contractor, ranked 235. Finally, the year was marked by the welcome return to something like their previous stature of fallen angels such as Italy's Olivetti, back in the list at 363, and Sweden's big two banks. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken returned at number 199 after its shares slid so badly during Sweden's banking crisis that it disappeared from last year's list altogether. Svenska Handelsbanken, which stayed in the rankings by the skin of its teeth last year, recorded the biggest rise of any European company, up 242 places to 223. And British Aerospace, another near victim last year, jumped 167 places to 272.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollars Exchange rates*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Currency                       1993        1992    % chge  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austrian Schilling          11.3880     10.4540     -8.93 Belgian Franc               34.8100     30.6000    -13.76 Danish Kroner                6.6304      5.7323    -15.67 Finnish Markka               5.7780      4.7137    -22.58 French Franc                 5.6684      5.0408    -12.45 German Mark                  1.6204       1.486     -9.04 Irish Punt                  0.69578     0.56527    -23.09 Italian Lira              1568.9300   1310.7300    -19.70 Japanese Yen               105.4600           0      0.00 Luxembourg Franc            34.8100     30.6000    -13.76 Netherlands Guilder          1.8198      1.6727     -8.79 Norwegian Kroner             7.0736      6.0597    -16.73 Portuguese Escudo          166.1400    132.2100    -25.66 Spanish Peseta             130.5500    105.8500    -23.33 Swedish Kronor               8.0069      5.6028    -42.91 Swiss Franc                  1.4162      1.3192     -7.35 UK Sterling                  0.6556      0.6051     -8.35  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * October 1992 and September 1993 monthly averages  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

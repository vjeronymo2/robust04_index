			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Portillo may change law following rail dispute Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, may introduce industrial relations legislation to deal with problems arising from the signal workers' dispute once it is over, it emerged yesterday. He said: 'I will reflect upon all the lessons of this strike when it comes to an end.' He did not dismiss the suggestion made by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, that 'refresher' strike ballots ought to be held after a specified period of industrial disruption to test whether those striking were still supporting such action. It is not thought that the employment secretary is keen to try to ban strikes in essential services, something that Mr Davies said employers did not want to see. During yesterday's strike a passenger train was given the wrong signal by a Railtrack manager acting as a trainee signaller, the RMT transport union said. The RMT said that the 8.03am Glasgow to Kilmarnock train was given a green light and shown the incorrect route indicator near Busby. The driver followed procedure and challenged the signal. He received an apology from Glasgow Signalling Centre, which said: 'The trainee was a bit too fast.' The derailment of a commuter train at Bickley in Kent during the signal workers' strike last Thursday was due to driver error, a joint internal inquiry by Railtrack and British Rail's southern train operating unit has found.</p>

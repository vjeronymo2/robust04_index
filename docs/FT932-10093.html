			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Lack of finance feared A shortage of expansion finance threatens to prevent businesses from taking full advantage of the European single market. This emerges from a survey* of more than 4,700 companies in all 12 European Community countries carried out by accountants Grant Thornton. Many companies in Europe have badly eroded balance sheets; face problems in persuading customers to pay up on time; and have difficulty in raising long-term debt and equity at affordable rates, according to the survey to be published today in Brussels. 'European companies will be shackled in achieving the benefits of the single market because the banks have got into difficulties,' said Patrick Brooke, partner in charge of the firm's single market unit. The survey, one of the most extensive of its kind in recent years, covered businesses, most of them privately owned, with turnover of between Ecu1m-Ecu100m (Pounds 833,000-Pounds 83.3m) and between 10 and 700 employees. These account for more than 90 per cent of all businesses in the Community. The cost of finance emerged as the most common short-term constraint on growth, mentioned by 40 per cent of companies questioned, while a lack of working capital was mentioned by 21 per cent. Customers have become more reluctant to settle their bills promptly, putting further pressure on company cash flows. Sixty one per cent said it had taken longer to collect their money over the previous year. A quarter of companies waited 90 days or longer to be paid, with slow payment most prevalent in Portugal, Italy and Spain. Chasing up slow-payers by letter was the most common response but no fewer than 33 per cent had taken legal proceedings. UK companies were most likely to have taken this route with half initiating legal action. Despite problems in raising finance, businesses were moderately optimistic about their prospects. On balance - that is those saying better, minus those saying worse - nearly a quarter expect to increase their turnover in the coming year and nearly 20 per cent plan to increase exports. But they also expect profits to remain flat in the year ahead and job numbers will be cut. Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark were the most optimistic overall, while France, Germany and the UK were most pessimistic about output, jobs and profitability. Germany was less optimistic about exports than most other countries. The most expansion-minded companies - those considering making acquisitions, diversifying and entering new markets - were in France, Spain and Greece. Two thirds of French companies had produced market development plans. Significant increases in spending on training and research and development are expected but there will be only a modest rise in investment in plant and equipment. On balance 22 per cent of companies planned to increase spending on training while 15 per cent planned more R&amp;D. The UK came the bottom of the league table in both areas, however. Despite government efforts to promote the single market recently, very few companies were aware of EC programmes. Only one in five companies knew of one or more of the main schemes and only 3 per cent of firms had used one of the programmes though Greece, with a 20 per cent uptake of programmes, was an enthusiastic exception to the EC norm. *European Business Survey, Ricky Lawrence, Grant Thornton House, Melton Street, London NW1 2EP.

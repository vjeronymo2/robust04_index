			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 14 (BTA) -- There was a sharp debate  in the National Assembly today, provoked by the request of UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the Bulgarian  Government give its consent for the transit of UN equipment  across Bulgarian territory. The equipment is provided by the  U.S. Administration and intended for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] contingent in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM]. It consists of 14 armoured vehicles and  supplementary equipment.    This morning a Government Press Office official announced  that at its regular meeting the Bulgarian Government decided to  give its consent for the transit passage of the UN equipment  from Romania to Macedonia across Bulgaria. Later on the press  centre of the Foreign Ministry reported that the ministry had  instructed the Bulgarian permanent representation in New York to  inform the United Nations about the Council of Ministers'  decision, stressing that Bulgaria considers this to be a  one-time act which cannot be seen as creating a precedent for  future actions. "Besides, Bulgaria informs the United Nations  that it reserves its right to refuse the transit passage of UN  property, equipment and peacekeeping troops provided by the  countries in this region, which is in harmony with the position  Bulgaria has stated many times," the Foreign Ministry's press  release says.    In the afternoon the MP's included in the agenda of their  regular parliamentary meeting an older proposal for the adoption  of a resolution under which Bulgaria's territory, its  territorial waters and its air space should not be used for the  passage of foreign military forces involved in the armed  conflict in the former Yugoslavia. At the end of 1993 the  Bulgarian Parliament adopted a declaration which states that  Bulgaria will not interfere neither directly nor indirectly in  the Yugoslav conflict even if such operations are launched under  the aegis of the United Nations. The MP's who took the floor  today accused the government of exceeding its rights and  violating the Constitution. Under the Constitution, it is  parliament's prerogative to approve the passage of foreign  troops across Bulgaria's territory.    Minister of Transport Kiril Ermenkov, Deputy Defence  Minister  Boyko Noev and General Staff Chief Army Gen. Lyuben Petrov were  invited to attend the plenary meeting.    Addressing the MP's, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov  pointed out that in the view of the government the transit of  military equipment should not be interpreted as crossing by  foreign troops, therefore the Council of Ministers' decision  does not contradict Bulgaria's official position. "If  Parliament reverses the government's decision, this may be taken  to mean that Bulgaria is not willing to render assistance in  preventing the possible spread of the conflict to Macedonia,"  Mr. Daskalov told a BTA reporter in the lobbies of Parliament.    Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, acting as prime  minister during Prof. Lyuben Berov's absence for reasons of  health, denied that the government had adopted such a decision.  According to Mr. Matinchev, Foreign Minister Daskalov had just  suggested "some views of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry" to the  government for consideration.    The other deputy prime minister, Valentin Karabashev,  confirmed that the cabinet had decided to approve the UN  equipment transit passage.    The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) proposed a  draft resolution which says that the cabinet headed by Prof.  Lyuben Berov, who is in hospital now, exceeded its rights and  that this act could give rise to mistrust between Bulgaria and  the United Nations. The SDS moved for presenting the transcript  of today's cabinet meeting to see if it had decided to allow the  UN equipment passage or not. Both motions were defeated.    The formerly Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party moved for  an  extraordinary parliamentary meeting at night, so that parliament  could pronounce itself on Mr. Butrus-Ghali's request. The  motion was not put to the vote and though extended by two hours,  parliament's working time expired.    Deputy Prime Minister Karabashev announced that the cabinet  will hold an extraordinary meeting opening at 2300 hours tonight.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: RICE PUDDING IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BREAKFAST  </P> <P> The windows were what sold me on my tiny cabin in the hills, and if cold winds  keep coming, those windows just might drive me out. It's gotten to where I'm  wondering if trading in some major household appliances would cover the bill  for the heat that's seeping away through the seams of my skylights and glass  doors.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, I'm preparing hearty dishes that require hovering over a hot stove,  such as this ricotta-rice concoction with fresh applesauce. Sweet enough to  serve as dessert, there's ample nourishment from fiber-rich wehani rice, milk  and cheese to pass this pudding off as breakfast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RICOTTA-RICE PUDDING  </P> <P> 1 cup low-fat ricotta cheese  </P> <P> 1 cup milk  </P> <P> 1/4 cup raw sugar  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons grated lemon or orange peel  </P> <P> 1 cup cooked wehani rice or medium-grain brown rice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup currants or raisins  </P> <P> 1 extra large egg  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 cup Fresh Applesauce  </P> <P> Beat ricotta cheese with hand mixer until smooth. Place in medium saucepan and  stir in milk, sugar, lemon peel, rice and currants. Stir constantly over medium  heat until mixture becomes creamy, about 20 minutes. Do not boil. Remove from  heat.  </P> <P> Beat egg in bowl. Add 1/4 cup rice mixture and stir well. Pour egg into  pudding. Stir over medium heat until mixture sets, about 2 minutes. Remove from  heat and stir in vanilla. Let stand at least 30 minutes before serving. Top  with warm Fresh Applesauce. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Wehani rice is nutty, slightly smoky-flavored brown rice hybrid,  medium-grain, dense and chewy, and available in gourmet and health food stores.  </P> <P> Fresh Applesauce  </P> <P> 2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced  </P> <P> 1/4 cup apple juice (preferably thick kind, not from concentrate)  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons maple syrup  </P> <P> Dash cinnamon  </P> <P> Steam apple slices in apple juice in small covered skillet until mushy.  Transfer to blender or food processor. Add maple syrup and cinnamon. Process  until smooth. Serve warm over rice pudding. Makes about 1 cup.  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Amdahl enters rapid-process technology Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, plans to offer high-performance database systems based on massively-parallel processor (MPP) supercomputers. Its announcement yesterday pre-empts the expected introduction of similar products by IBM. Amdahl has formed an alliance with nCube, a US manufacturer of MPP computers; Oracle, the leading database software company; and Information Builders, a software company that specialises in linking different types of computers on networks. Amdahl, which has been struggling to keep pace with rapidly falling prices for its mainframe computers, sees the alliance as an opportunity to broaden its market. MPPs achieve very high processing speeds at low cost by linking thousands of microprocessor chips, similar to those used in personal computers, to work together in parallel. Most MPPs have been used in scientific and technical applications. However, IBM is expected next week to announce an MPP system aimed at the commercial market. Amdahl and its new partners said they too would enter this field within the next few months. Applications include systems requiring quick access to a lot of information.</p>

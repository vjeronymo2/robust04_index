			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Struggling on regardless The classic response to even the fiercest storm is to put up a 'business as usual' sign. Mr John Major has little option but to follow this rule. The UK prime minister has been buffeted by events since sterling was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major has made a series of efforts to regain the confidence of his party, but has been tripped up after every few steps forward. This is, perhaps, the inevitable fate of any leader of a divided party with a small and dwindling overall majority. Over the past few days the trip-ups have become serious. To discipline his backbenchers the prime minister declared last week's vote on funds for the European Union a matter of confidence. When a handful of Conservatives defied the subsequent three-line whip, they were in effect expelled from the parliamentary group. On Tuesday night all but one of the now semi-detached Tory rebels failed to support the party under whose banner they had been elected. In consequence, the chancellor of the exchequer was obliged to rescind the proposed increase in VAT on domestic fuel. Today he will announce the measures necessary to replace it; yesterday interest rates were increased. The government's determination to hold down inflation is laudable. Yet there is no justice in politics. The economic news is excellent, but the prime minister is the most unpopular since polling began. Nevertheless, Mr Major has to soldier on. The alternative is Tory suicide. No potential successor would be better able to unite the party. The prime minister might offer the Eurosceptics a referendum on a single currency in return for more obedient voting in future. Even that could fail. The most convinced doubters would settle for nothing less than a referendum on the outcome of the 1996 inter-governmental conference; some might demand a plebiscite in advance of negotiations. Beneficial effect Mr Major may reasonably hope that the beneficial effect of his economic policies will eventually be felt. There is little he can do to hasten the day. Meanwhile, it would be absurd to step down half-way through the term for which his administration was elected in April 1992. The government can only get its head down, and carry on as best as unfavourable circumstances allow. Mr Michael Heseltine's decision to refer both the GEC and British Aerospace bids for shipbuilder VSEL to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission looks like an example of soldiering on in poor circumstances. The Office of Fair Trading had argued for the referral of the GEC bid, but there were no obvious competition policy grounds for referring BAe's, too. Not to do so would, however, have probably decided the contest. Now that decision is at least postponed. Unfortunately, there are also questions about the appropriate structure of the UK defence industry that the MMC is hardly the right body to resolve. More satisfactory This looks like the action of a weak government. Yesterday's interest rate rise was more satisfactory. The Bank of England's November inflation report admitted 'the outlook for inflation was favourable'. But it also forecast inflation two years hence 'at the top of the lower half of the target range' of 1-4 per cent. While this was the most likely outcome, the risks were judged higher on the upside than the downside. The most important information since that date has been the upward revision to GDP, which means that the economy is now estimated to have grown by 4.2 per cent in the 12 months to the third quarter of 1993. That is certainly unsustainable. More important, it is undesirable. Because the level of full capacity is unknowable, there has to be concern over how fast the economy is growing. It is no surprise that the governor of the Bank of England pushed for an interest rate increase at yesterday morning's meeting with the chancellor. In accepting that advice, the latter may have been influenced by Tuesday's political events and, in particular, by concern over the markets' reaction. But there was a good enough argument, in any case. The costs of action were rightly judged smaller than those of inaction. At this stage in the recovery - particularly given the poor credibility of British monetary policy - it would be far more damaging for inflation to jump above the target range than for the reverse to happen. That is the governor's judgment, the chancellor's judgment and also the right judgment. The chancellor is also obliged to replace the Pounds 1bn or so in net fiscal revenue he lost on Tuesday night. He must do so, not because the economic arguments for doing so are overwhelming. The sum is not large enough for that. What matters is the government's ability to stick to any fiscal strategy. A government unable to tax and spend as it judges fit - at least in terms of the overall balance - can no longer govern. Its new proposals have to succeed. Should it be rebuffed another time, it will probably be swept away by the storm.</p>

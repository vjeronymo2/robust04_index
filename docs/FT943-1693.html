			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / French battle to win third telecom licence The French industry ministry is finalising its recommendations concerning a fiercely contested battle for the country's third mobile telecommunications licence and is awaiting a decision from Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. Officials said that a decision could come this weekend. But they indicated that the sensitivity of the licence award, which pits three of France's largest industrial groups in competition, may prompt a delay. Alcatel Alsthom, the telecoms and engineering group, Lyonnaise des Eaux, the utilities and communications group, and Bouygues, the construction and communications company, are all bidding for the right to operate the third digital network. They are seeking either to diversify into a new business sector or, in the case of Alcatel, to extend telecommunications equipment activities into the provision of mobile services. Bouygues, considered by many industry observers to have edged ahead in the contest, estimates that an investment of between FFr3bn (Pounds 360m) and FFr4bn is necessary to establish the new network. The winner of the licence will compete with existing networks operated by subsidiaries of France Telecom, the state telecoms group, and Generale des Eaux, the utilities and communications company. The cost of the investment will be shared by partners in the various consortia. Alcatel Alsthom has linked up with Stet of Italy in preparing its offer. Bouygues' partners include Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and US West, while Lyonnaise des Eaux counts Thyssen of Germany and Bell South of the US amongst its consortium. The sensitivity of the award stems from the influence of the companies involved and the method employed to decide the winner. Bouygues operates TF1, France's television channel, while Mr Jerome Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise des Eaux, is a former senior official in Mr Balladur's Gaullist RPR party. With the unofficial contest for next year's presidential elections gathering intensity, Mr Balladur is anxious to avoid controversy over the award or to alienate the contenders. Rather than selecting the winner through an auction process, as in recent US telecoms licence awards, the French government is to decide on technical proposals and investment plans. 'The project which is the most viable on these criteria will be the one selected,' said one official. Despite the sensitivity of the award, the industry ministry is seeking a rapid decision to prevent the French mobile telephone sector lagging further behind its neighbours. According to Idate, the communications research institute, France had only 725,000 mobile telephone subscribers at the end of August, compared with more than 2.2m in Germany and about 2.7m in the UK. Part of the explanation lies in the lack of competition. 'The two incumbents have tended to behave like a cosy duopoly, keeping prices high and limiting demand,' says one industry analyst. He adds, however, that competition has intensified since 1992 with the introduction of rival GSM digital networks by France Telecom and SFR, the mobile telecoms subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux. The new licence will be to operate the digital system, DCS 1800. 'It is a cheaper system to develop than the traditional GSM network, because the infrastructure is lighter,' says Mr Didier Pouillot at Idate.</p>

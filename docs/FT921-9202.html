			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer expects big changes in reform plan THE EVENTUAL reforms to the EC Common Agricultural Policy will differ fundamentally from the commission's original proposals, Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister said yesterday. The EC council of farm ministers, which met earlier this week, was becoming 'more and more aware of the flaws in the commission's thinking', he told the National Farmers' Union AGM in London. The proposals from Mr Ray MacSharry, the agriculture commissioner, are designed to decouple income support for farmers from price support for farm output. Assuring delegates that he would not agree to a reform package that discriminated against British farming, Mr Gummer said: 'We are being asked to bear the burdens of a problem we did not create'. He cited a 9,000 hectare Scottish sheep farm running 1,080 ewes; net profit on the sheep in 1990 was Pounds 1,087. Under current proposals it would have support cut by 30 per cent and could not be expected to survive. Mr Gummer said the Gatt negotiations were trying to create a more liberal world market for agriculture. If the EC were to compete in that market, the EC needed to encourage the efficient farmer. Instead, the EC had brought forward proposals that would 'weaken those farmers throughout the Community who have modernised their structures and adopted commercial methods to become modern and up to date'. He said it was those producers that were vital to the Community if it was to retain a competitive agricultural industry in the future. 'Does it really make sense to penalise them for the efforts they have made? Suddenly to reward inefficiency instead?'</p>

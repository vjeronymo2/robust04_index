			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Springtime in Paris: David Buchan examines signs of a thaw in the traditionally uneasy Anglo-French relationship It would perhaps be going too far to say that in the two months since the new French government came to power, Britain's relations with its cross-Channel neighbour have become better than at any point in the past two decades. But there was no mistaking the reciprocated warmth in Mr John Major's second meeting with his new French counterpart, Mr Edouard Balladur, in Paris yesterday. Speaking in general terms about their two-hour chat, the UK prime minister said he could not recall a time when Anglo-French relations were 'in better shape'. Mr Balladur was more concrete in citing the Gatt trade negotiations as an example of where the two leaders had decided to make a fresh effort to bridge their countries' real differences. The French prime minister even volunteered his 'gratitude' for the 'help' of Mr John Gummer, then the UK agriculture minister, in reaching an EC farm agreement this week. (Mr Gummer was given the environment portfolio in Thursday's cabinet reshuffle.) In fact, Britain was not trying particularly to advance French interests this wek in Brussels, though it and others among France's partners clearly hope that Paris has now been sufficiently buttered up to accept the politically awkward oilseeds deal with the US in the next two weeks. But the very fact that he exaggerated the extent of British help shows Mr Balladur's desire to put the best face on his relationship with the UK. The Gatt endeavour is, in a sense, the key to understanding the new cross-Channel link. It is weaker than Paris's relationship with Bonn, where 30 years of formalised co-operation virtually commit the two partners reach agreement on divisive issues. Paris and London have only committed themselves to try to reach agreement. Nonetheless, this could lead to a vast improvement in a relationship whose uneasiness dates back, as Mr Major quipped yesterday, to 'William the Conqueror's coming over to Britain with a certain degree of malice aforethought and Henry II's coming to France to conquer half the country and marry the rest'. Why the sudden springtime in Anglo-French relations? It must first be said that there was never a permafrost over Britain's relations with the previous Socialist government. The two countries, for instance, have continued practical military co-operation, despite the abstract arguments about the future of European defence and Nato which were part of the Maastricht treaty negotiations. But for nearly five years France had focused on reaching agreement with Germany on an agenda - including economic and monetary union (Emu) and social policy - which was largely inimical to Britain's ruling Conservatives. The change in the ideology governing France has helped, but not radically. This is because conservatism differs on either side of the Channel. Under Mr Balladur, France is no longer accusing Britain of social dumping, but that is because UK or UK-based companies (such as Hoover Europe) are no longer the only foreign firms laying off workers in France. Mr Major reiterated his view in Paris yesterday that the EC's social charter was a recipe for 'job destruction' - a stance which no French government could publicly support, even though Mr Balladur clearly shares much of Mr Major's concern about Europe's growing lack of competitiveness. France is now pursuing privatisation - aping techniques used in British state sell-offs - such as 'le partly paid' equity and 'le golden share' from Britain - but stopping short of selling state-owned utilities as the UK government has done. But the question of who owns French industry is of less relevance to the UK than its desire for the government to reduce aid to French companies. But the nature of the French government is important in another way. Within the Gaullist RPR party, Mr Balladur himself comes from the stable of Georges Pompidou, the man who let Britain into the EC as a kind of counterweight to Germany. Within today's RPR party, too, are some deputies - nearly half its parliamentary strength - who voted against Maastricht in last September's referendum. Mr Balladur, who as finance minister in late 1987 was the first to propose to his EC colleagues a European central bank, therefore has Euro-sceptics whom he cannot ignore, just as Mr Major has. And the French prime minister cannot wholly rely on his pro-European coalition partner, the UDF, because its leader, ex-President Giscard d'Estaing, still harbours ambitions for a return to the Elysee. This has pushed the RPR towards Mr Major's views on the need within the EC for subsidiarity, decentralised decision-making and a closer check on the European Commission. Separately, too, the RPR's right-wing pressure for a crackdown on crime and illegal immigration has led the Balladur government to delay abolition of frontier controls, as forseen in the Schengen free-travel convention shunned by Britain. But it is foreign policy, and above all their diplomatic and military involvement in the Bosnian crisis, which has brought the two governments into constant contact. This was true last year, too. But the Balladur government's arrival coincided with Washington's first initiatives. And both London and Paris have reacted allergically to US ideas of bombing Serbs or arming the Moslems. France and Britain are both solidly behind a patient strategy of sanctions. The lengthy nature of such a strategy will only serve to ingrain the growing habit of Anglo-French diplomatic co-ordination, underlined once again by yesterday's announcement that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, will be in Paris for another Bosnian session with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart. The latter has said he sees Britain, as France's fellow United Nations Security Council member and holder of nuclear weapons, playing a key security role in the post-Maastricht EC. Any such Anglo-French rapprochement on external policy can, however, easily founder on the two governments' fundamental disagreement on economic policy. Not so much on Gatt where Paris may now be able to finesse the agricultural issue with some help from its EC partners. Mr Major yesterday expressed 'understanding' for France's farm problems, but stressed 'we must find a way through the Gatt tangle this year'. The future flashpoint lies more in monetary policy, where almost no one in France, for all the country's current doldrums, wants to follow Britain out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But Paris is reconciled to Mr Major taking a longish time to return sterling to the ERM. Luckily, too, for Mr Major, Mr Balladur shows absolutely no sign of traditional Gallic impatience with the long Maastricht timetable for Emu. The French prime minister scoffs at any post-Maastricht ratification bid to accelerate this timetable, by pointing to the budgetary problems of France and others. After his lunch with President Mitterrand yesterday, Mr Major paid tribute 'to France's longest-serving president for more than a century, who is listened to with great respect', knowing full well that much of the real authority in Paris now lies with Mr Balladur. But the likelihood of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, winning the 1995 presidential election will return undivided power to the Elysee, and perhaps rock the new-found relationship with Mr Balladur. If it does not, then Britain stands a chance of having a real say in the 1996 revision of the Maastricht treaty. Instead of shouting from the sidelines, as it did in much of the run-up to Maastricht, it might even join France, and perforce Germany, in setting the agenda. That, Mr Major knows, could put Britain at the centre of Europe.</p>

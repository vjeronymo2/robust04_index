			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Canadian Government Bonds: Buyers are undeterred by uncertainties THE Canadian bond market suffered its nastiest jolt for some time last week. Long-term bond yields jumped more than one-third of a percentage point in a single day after being hit first by unexpectedly mild spending cuts in the federal budget, then by a domestic rating agency's downgrade of federal government debt. The question now is whether this setback to a market often seen as a high-yielding surrogate for US Treasuries was a storm in a teacup, or the precursor of a bumpy - and mostly downward - ride for the rest of the year. Several forthcoming events could again unsettle Canadian bonds. All eyes are on the Ontario provincial budget, due to be tabled in mid-May. The provincial government has pledged a bracing combination of spending cuts and higher taxes to contain a runaway budget deficit. But the market remains unsure whether the social-democrat government will deliver. A shortfall of more than CDollars 10bn-CDollars 12bn in the fiscal year to March 31 1994 (last year's deficit was CDollars 11bn) could again knock the wind out of all Canadian bonds. Other uncertainties centre on the ruling Progressive Conservative party's vote on June 13 for a successor to prime minister Brian Mulroney, and the outcome of the general election which the new leader will call before the end of autumn. For the time being, however, evidence abounds that the market has put the April 26 budget surprise behind it. Since the budget, 'all we've seen have been buyers,' says one London-based securities dealer. The gap between US and Canadian bonds, which widened sharply on the day after the budget, is almost back to pre-budget levels. According to Royal Bank of Canada, the five-year spread had narrowed to 182 basis points by last Friday from a peak during the week of 226 points. The market is rewarding those provinces which have brought down belt-tightening budgets. The gap between 10-year provincial and government of Canada yields has narrowed by 10-15 basis points over the past month. Criticism of the federal budget is centred less on its contents than on the expectations of deep spending cuts built up by finance minister Don Mazankowski ahead of budget day. Ms Anita Lauria, who covers Canada for Salomon Brothers in New York, says projected annual spending increases of 1.7 per cent over the next five years make the budget 'quite austere'. She notes that, despite this being an election year, Mr Mazankowski neither lowered taxes nor pumped up government outlays. Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Ottawa's debt from Triple A to Double A plus the day after the budget speech, but no other agency has so far joined it or even put Canada on rating alert. Mr Daniel Kelly, vice-president for fixed-income research at Wood Gundy in Toronto, says that much will depend in coming weeks on the course of the Canadian dollar. One positive sign was last Friday's report that Canada's GDP grew by a seasonally-adjusted 0.4 per cent in February, equal to an annual growth rate of about 4 per cent. But few investors are likely to take a strong view on the direction of either the dollar or bond prices until the Ontario budget is out of the way.</p>

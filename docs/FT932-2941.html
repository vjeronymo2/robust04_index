			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo falls back 1.7% as the yen continues to rise A STALEMATE over the government's political reform policy, compounded with a further rise in the yen, dis-couraged investors, and the Nikkei average fell 1.7 per cent on selling by margin traders and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average ended 351.47 off at the day's low of 20,045.88, having registered a high for the session of 20,393.23 in the morning. Volume was 350m shares, against Monday's 261m. Sales were spread across the board, with declines overwhelming advances by 1,037 to 73, with 61 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 39.58 to 1,619.88, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.45 to 1,216.32. The dollar closed at a new low of Y105.03, down Y0.17, after briefly falling below Y105. Active buying by the Bank of Japan, however, supported the dollar. Traders said a fall of the Nikkei through 20,000, due to a further rise in the yen, would heighten calls for a cut in the official discount rate. Investors turned sellers as uncertainty over the passage of the political reform bill intensified, prompting fears that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who vowed political reform, would be forced to resign. Concern that such developments might affect the economic planning ability of the government unnerved investors. Exporters continued to face selling. Toshiba lost Y24 to Y690, NEC Y15 to Y985 and Toyota Motor Y70 to Y1,570. Banks, which had been recent gainers on speculation of an imminent interest rate cut, retreated on profit-taking: Industrial Bank of Japan declined Y100 to Y2,940, while Sumitomo Bank receded Y70 to Y2,280. Other interest rate-sensitive issues were also down, with Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, losing Y13 at Y392 and NKK slipping Y10 to Y323. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y13,000 to Y946,000 on margin selling. Daiei, the country's largest supermarket chain, which announced plans to absorb three retailing affiliates, dropped Y90 to Y1,060. Securities companies lost ground, with the sector, the top loser of the day, down 3.9 per cent. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 558.13 to 22,376.46 in volume of 18.5m shares. Roundup AMONG THE region's markets profit-taking was much in evidence. HONG KONG closed slightly higher as afternoon profit-taking trimmed early gains, with the market awaiting news from Sino-British talks in Beijing on the colony's political future. The Hang Seng index finished 16.72 firmer at 7,283.46 after climbing 81 points early in the day. Turnover was moderate at HKDollars 4.3bn. SEOUL slipped back for the fifth consecutive session, the composite index losing 1.63 to 757.84, off the day's high of 761.63. Turnover contracted to Won539.6bn.

MANILA fell back as many investors awaited imminent new public listings. The composite index lost 12.85 to 1,568.42 in turnover of 202.6m pesos.

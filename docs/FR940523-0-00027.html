			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is now possible for JTPA title IV&hyph;C programs to be created to better enhance and complement other JTPA programs that do not focus on veterans' services, while continuing efforts to improve the targeting of employment and training services to eligible veterans who face serious barriers to employment. Larger multi-year grants allow for enhancement of the quality of services provided and the outcomes attained by strengthening program activity through increased efficiency in program scope and grant management, improving the linkages between services provided and local labor market needs, and ensuring the provision of a coherent system of outcome-oriented human resource services through changes in the direction and focus of the Veteran's Employment Programs to eligible veterans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Immediate results will manifest themselves in the form of: eliminated regulations; fewer, but larger grants; establishment of a system of awards through SGA's that can be renewed, modified or changed as deemed necessary. In addition, these SGA's can be drawn to incorporate by reference the essential parts and requirements of the JTPA and the Departmental JTPA regulations. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20 CFR parts 627 and 636; and 29 CFR parts 96&hyph;98. For further information regarding the SGA or for copies, please contact Mr. Jeffrey C. Crandall at the number provided above. A copy of the SGA will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the immediate future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rulemaking supersedes that portion of the rulemaking announced at 56 FR 5124 (February 7, 1991) that related to JTPA title IV&hyph;C programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Few comments were received in response to the publication of the proposed rule at 59 FR 10769 (March 8, 1994). One commenter expressed total support for the action. Five commenters expressed concern that the action would have an adverse affect upon small states, especially those small states with effective programs and proven track records although they operated with the minimal amount of $55,000 under the formula-based funding process. In response, the competitive process is to be structured to ensure that emphasis will be on the technical merits of the proposal and cost efficiency. Thus, small states with effective programs should not be adversely affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expressed support for efforts to lower the program's administrative costs through larger grant amounts and longer grant periods, but believed that a competitive bidding process is not as effective as an allocation formula in ensuring that the dollars serve the intended clientele. He believed that an allocation component must be kept in place that ensures that the bulk of the funding continues to go to those states in which the majority of veterans needing service reside. In response, as stated above, due to funding limitations, the change from formula-based state allocated funds to a nationwide competition was instituted to maximize service delivery and to target veterans most in need. Other factors such as the technical merit of the proposal and cost efficiency will also be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publication in Final <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons described above, and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), this rule is effective on the publication date of this document. In light of the agency's desire to have an effective and efficient program, and in keeping with mandates of the President to remove unnecessary and restrictive rules, it is in the public interest to eliminate those regulations and establish a new system of grant administration for the title IV&hyph;C program. Given the impending start of the program year, it is unnecessary and impracticable to delay the effective date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

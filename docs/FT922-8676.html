			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Atlas Copco raises profits to SKr292m ATLAS COPCO, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, has reported a 16 per cent improvement in profits after financial items to SKr292m (Dollars 49.2m) for the first three months of the year. Sales rose by 8 per cent to SKr3.83bn. Operating profits after depreciation increased 33 per cent against the same period of 1991 to SKr334m. Restructuring costs in the company's construction and mining technique area totalling SKr65m were set against profits. The company's recovery in the first quarter follows a 28 per cent drop in profits last year to SKr910m. Atlas Copco said it expected an improvement of earnings this year so long as there was no further decline in business conditions. However, the company warned that its order bookings remained weak during the first quarter, although the order trend had levelled out. The most successful area of activity was in the construction and mining technique division with an operating profit after depreciation of SKr72m, compared with a SKr25m loss in the first three months of last year. However, there was a slide in operating profits after depreciation in the industrial technique division to SKr46m from SKr70m. In compressors the company's operating profits after depreciation fell slightly to SKr261m from SKr266m.</p>

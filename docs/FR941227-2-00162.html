On January 11&hyph;13, 1995 the meeting is closed during which the Board will be reviewing research and development applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This review involves oral comments, discussion of site visits, staff, and consultant critiques of proposed research protocols, and similar analytical documents that necessitate the consideration of the personal qualifications, performance and competence of individual research investigators. Disclosure of such information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Disclosure would also reveal research proposals and research underway which could lead to the loss of these projects to third parties and thereby frustrate future agency research efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the closing is in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522b(c)(6), and (c)(9)(B) and the determination of the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs under Sections 10(d) of Pub. L. 92&hyph;463 as amended by Section 5(c) of Pub. L. 94&hyph;409. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the limited seating capacity of the room, those who plan to attend the open session should write to Ms. Victoria Mongiardo, Program Analyst, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, 103 South Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202 (Phone: 410&hyph;962&hyph;2563) at least five days before the meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Heyward Bannister, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Committee Management Officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31671 Filed 12&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 8320&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (5): Sales provide a breakthrough - Privatisation The sale of two substantial state enterprises - Chilanga Cement and Zambia Breweries - is a breakthrough for the slow-moving privatisation programme. The two sales provide a model for future privatisation of medium and large companies: both divestitures involved complex pre-emptive rights negotiations with the previous owners and both plan to offer some of their equity on the Lusaka Stock Exchange to Zambian investors. An independent trust fund has been set up whose chief task will be to 'warehouse' equity in state enterprises, selling the shares to Zambian investors, both institutional and individual. The Privatisation Trust Fund has been offered 30 per cent of the equity in Chilanga Cement for on-selling to the public, not necessarily in a single transaction. The Fund is looking closely at the technique used by Ashanti Goldfields to sell equity to Ghanaian investors as a possible model for Chilanga and the others that will be sold in the next three years. Until these two deals went through, the Zambia Privatisation Agency's track record was unimpressive. Some 158 companies are to be sold in seven tranches, with the first three tranches dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises. By the end of August, only 12 sales had been completed, while a handful of others required approval from the Commissioner of Lands or were awaiting legal rulings. All but Chilanga (Dollars 21m) and Zambia Breweries (Dollars 19.5m) were minor sell-offs. Privatisation is always tricky politically, especially where political support is as problematic as was the case in Zambia until Mr Dipak Patel, minister of commerce, and a privatisation enthusiast, took up office this year. His commitment to the programme is beginning to pay dividends in the form of accelerating progress. Other obstacles included punishingly high interest rates, making it much more attractive to hold Treasury Bills than invest in real assets; the absence of a capital market capable of mobilising resources for takeovers; and the complexities of the process itself. The bulk of the potentially-attractive properties involve pre-emptive right negotiations with the original owners. The agreements under which these enterprises were nationalised favoured buyers with pre-emptive rights because, far from envisaging the return of such assets to private ownership, the government of the day saw itself as the eventual purchaser. These agreements have come back to haunt the ZPA. While it is encouraging that virtually all the former owners with pre-emptive rights are anxious to exercise their options and regain control of the businesses, there is often wide disagreement on prices. The ZPA says that in both the Chilanga and Breweries cases, the buyers eventually accepted ZPA's valuation. A deadline of November 25 has been set for bids for several companies being offered for sale - including Northern Breweries at Ndola, some hotels including the five-star Pamodzi Hotel in Lusaka, two state-owned edible oils companies, and trading companies with chains of retail outlets around the country. The agency says it will have broken the back of privatisation, disposing of 113 (the first three tranches) of the 158 parastatals, by mid-1995. Many of these are small operations - stores and dry cleaners  - which can be processed speedily. Large operations, most of which involve negotiations over pre- emptive rights, will take longer to resolve, while the requirement to offer 30 per cent of the equity to Zambian investors in most, although not all cases, is also a potential constraint. The final four tranches include some significant operations in the financial sector (Zambia National Building Society, the State Insurance Corporation), transport (Contract Haulage), and manufacturing (Dunlop, and Nitrogen Chemicals). Still to be tackled are leading utilities - Posts and Telecommunications, the oil refinery and the railways, although even these pale into relative insignificance alongside the crunch issue of ZCCM. The commitment to offer 30 per cent to Zambian investors where feasible and the predominance of pre-emptive right investors, outside the utilities sector, implies only a limited role for new foreign investors, including emerging market funds. Since its launch early this year, the Lusaka Stock Exchange's activities have been largely confined to trading existing shares in a handful of foreign-owned companies and parastatals - Standard Chartered bank, the most active, Bata Shoe, Rothmans, ZCCM, Zambia Sugar and Chilanga Cement. Turnover is very low, although this has been boosted by trading in closed-end property funds. The exchange has two broking firms as members while another four or five have applied to become licensed dealers in anticipation of more active market conditions once the Privatisation Trust fund starts offering shares to local investors. Dealers say that investors have been 'warmed up' by attractive opportunities in Treasury Bills. With yields falling dramatically in recent weeks, institutions and individuals are looking for new investment vehicles. The trick now is to get companies to seek a listing and sell shares through the exchange. The best short-term bet is privatisation, with Chilanga - expected to issue shares via the Trust fund - likely to be the first formal listing next April. To speed up the process, the government would be well advised to take a leaf from the Mauritian book, offering fiscal incentives to companies and investors alike to participate on the exchange. With no equity on offer, there will be little to interest emerging market funds in the near term. Mining aside, the same has been broadly true of direct investment, where the main participants are Zambian, and not foreign, companies. After a slow start in 1992, the Zambian Investment Centre licensed 376 projects worth Dollars 314m last year, and a further 166 valued at Dollars 110m in the first half of 1994. Ironically, given the volume of complaints from industrialists, manufacturing has been the lead sector accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the total, with agriculture (Dollars 115m) responsible for just over a quarter. However, Mr Kevin Moore, director-general, says that the investment climate is 'a lot better than a year ago'. The main incentives are corporate tax rates of only 15 per cent on farm profits and on earnings from non-traditional (non-mining) exports. Investors do not have to go through the centre but the advantage is that the licence guarantees property and employment rights.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CYPRESS COUNCIL SCHEDULES ELECTION AFTER SEARCH FAILS  </P> <P> After 30 days of sorting through applications and holding interviews, the  Cypress City Council remained deadlocked in selecting a new council member and  instead set a special election for Sept. 12.  </P> <P> The four council members had interviewed 14 applicants for the council seat  vacated Feb. 28 by Bill Davis, who was moving out of the city.  </P> <P> The council narrowed the field to two, Roger Geyer and Walter Bowman, but  deadlocked in a vote at the council meeting Monday night. The deadlock stemmed  from another issue: the proposed Cypress Downs.  </P> <P> On Feb. 14, Cypress residents defeated by a 2-to-1 ratio a measure that would  have allowed that major development on 167 acres surrounding the Los Alamitos  Race Course.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry, who opposed the measure, said she and Councilman  John Kanel supported Geyer because he is a strong opponent of the development  plan. Council members Cecilia L. Age and Margaret M. Arnold voted for Bowman  because he supports the development, Kerry said.  </P> <P> When Davis resigned, the council had 30 days to select someone to serve the  last year of his term. Because the council could not decide in that time, it  had to schedule a special election.  </P> <P> Kerry said that although the council made an effort to fill the post, she was  not surprised that a special election was called.  </P> <P> "I feel bad because the citizens suffer," Kerry said.  </P> <P> Geyer, an accountant, said he will run in the September election but does not  want to see it become an expensive campaign because it is only for a 1-year  term.  </P> <P> Bowman, a real estate broker, could not be reached for comment, but Kerry said  she understood that he also would run for the seat.  </P> <P> Candidates may file to run from June 15 to July 7. The city estimates that the  special election will cost at least $25,000.  </P></p>

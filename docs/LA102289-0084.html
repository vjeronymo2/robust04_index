			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NOT ALL DARKNESS FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT THEY HAVE TO STOP BEING REPUBLICANS  </P> <P> October talk about the Democratic Party having one foot -- its presidential  foot -- in the grave is hitting levels unmatched since the late 1920s,  exceeding even the morbidity following Walter F. Mondale's 1984 defeat. And the  odor of embalming fluid is all the stronger because so much of it is coming  from Democrats themselves.  </P> <P> But do they really understand their current circumstances? Part of the national  Democratic malaise is a familiar myopia displayed by previous Democrats during  similar Republican economic boom years of the Roaring '20s and the Gilded Age  of the late-19th Century.  </P> <P> The current Democratic case of the tactical and philosophic shakes has to do  with the cumulative loss of skills and confidence over the last two decades of  national politics. Unlike the famous Confederate general, Bedford Forrest, who  got there "fustest with the mostest," latter-day Democrats have gotten there  latest with the leastest.  </P> <P> These disadvantages, then, suggest that perhaps we should pay less attention to  Democrats' own self-analysis and more to where they stand amid the evolution of  the GOP issues and stratagems that, save for Watergate, have been the winning  national dynamic for almost a quarter-century. In some ways Democrats are  probably worse off than they think, but other aspects of their predicament have  a chronological silver lining of sorts.  </P> <P> The Democrats' central problem is that their national tide went out 21 years  ago in a 1968 presidential election that now stacks up alongside America's  prior national political watersheds. The enormous scope of the collapse was  decisive -- the Democrats' share of the presidential vote dropped from 61% in  1964 to 43% in 1968 (and then to 39% in 1972 as party fortunes soured further  and George Wallace's 1968 third-party support lined up with Richard M. Nixon  and the GOP). Then there is the subsequent Republican domination of the White  House, which by January, 1993, will have run 24 years with only a four-year  interruption. Such lopsided White House control has occurred after each past  watershed, and has come no other way. What made the partisan upheaval confusing  at first, of course, was the temporary 1970s dislocation of Watergate.  </P> <P> But for Democratic strategists, confronting this reality is still only the  beginning of comprehension. Their decline has, in fact, happened in stages.  </P> <P> The disastrous national losses of 1968-72 were largely rooted in racial, social  and patriotic issues -- the sort of Democratic thematic vulnerabilities  Republicans still enjoy resurrecting with campaigns against flag-desecration  and TV commercials about furloughed murderers. More than anything else, these  GOP themes and Democratic failures destroyed the old New Deal coalition on the  national level.  </P> <P> Stage two came in the late 1970s, when inflation, fanned by Lyndon B. Johnson's  1960s "borrow, don't tax" Vietnam War buildup, began to roar. All three of  20th-Century America's big inflation waves -- during and after World Wars I, II  and Vietnam -- originated under Democratic regimes. Worse still, they rode in  tandem with excessive growth of government and bureaucracy, increased taxes and  bracket creep. Attacks on the inflationary state scored heavily for  conservatives in the 1980 elections, stoking tax-revolt fires and piling more  wood on the funeral pyre of New Deal ideology.  </P> <P> Big government's embarrassment was the private sector's opportunity under  Ronald Reagan; tax reduction and market economics went into overdrive. Within a  few years, converging deregulation, Horatio Alger entrepreneurialism,  disinflation, tax cuts and soaring stock markets brought stage three, more or  less replicating the go-go spirit and success of the two previous Republican  capitalist heydays -- the late-19th Century and the 1920s. This threw the final  kerosene on fires burning away the old economic and ideological self-confidence  among Democrats.  </P> <P> The result hasn't been impressive. Despite conservatives' glum assessments of  periods like Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Johnson's half-baked "Great  Society," the Democratic Party -- certainly no left or socialist party -- is  not even a reliably liberal party. On the contrary, it is middle-class and  capitalist enough that in times of great Republican prosperity, the Democrats  become conformist, even me-tooish, in their intermittent courtship of business  and finance.  </P> <P> Because this is such a far cry from the Democrats' activist role under the  Andrew Jacksons, William Jennings Bryans and Franklin D. Roosevelts, the party  seems at these moments to have lost its soul, wandering aimlessly (and not  quite acceptably) in the waiting rooms of Rotary clubs and stock exchanges.  </P> <P> During the late 19th Century, the sole Democratic President, Grover Cleveland,  was as conservative as his GOP predecessors, and the pattern held nearly as  well in the 1920s. No Democratic Presidents sat in the Oval Office, but  congressional Democrats -- just as in the 1980s -- often tried to outdo  Republicans in proposing tax cuts for business and finance, causing cynical  chuckles in GOP circles.  </P> <P> To review these 1920s episodes after watching 1980s Democrats is to experience  deja vu. Last year, Michael S. Dukakis proclaimed to the Democratic Convention  that the election was about "competence, not ideology," in part because his  chief fund-raiser, a former Republican, was collecting record sums of money in  business and financial circles.  </P> <P> That fund-raiser, Robert A. Farmer, now Democratic Party treasurer, recently  supported giving ambassadorships to campaign contributors because, he said, a  U.S. ambassador's secondary job is to promote U.S. business interests. And  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) was quoted in  one 1988 bestseller as saying, "What atmosphere do I ever expect to live in  when I leave Congress? I want to mingle in this community of business  activities."  </P> <P> This attitude may have promoted the economy at times, and as a Democratic  survival posture it has also displayed elements of realism. Historically,  however, such periods have been Democratic low points, eras of lost  philosophical moorings when even sympathizers begin to wonder if the party  still has a future.  </P> <P> In many ways, that is where the Democrats are today -- enmeshed in much of the  same me-tooism they often displayed during the 1920s. If anything, the party's  continuing control of Congress has only strengthened its general conformity to  the mood of the decade. The better news for the Democrats is that me-tooism has  often characterized the darkness before the dawn. Calvin Coolidge-era  Democrats, as well as Republicans during their own beaten, me-tooist Nelson  Rockefeller progressive period in the mid-1960s, were actually on the threshold  of major event-driven revivals. The mea culpas and funeral notices turned out,  in later hindsight, to be auspicious contrarian indicators.  </P> <P> The further irony is that today's national Democratic disarray may not be  critical. If Democrats truly had to deserve national power to win it, they'd be  in trouble; but that isn't the American way. The great watershed changes of  U.S. national politics have been largely event-driven. After a generation or  so, the existing presidential majority runs out of cohesion, and events -- from  Civil War to a stock market crash and a depression -- serve to unravel the old  coalition and force the creation of a new one.  </P> <P> For Republicans, economic weakness has been the historic Achilles' heel. A  strong Democrat might have won by tapping national nervousness in 1988 -- even  Dukakis carried four dozen Midwestern counties that hadn't voted Democratic  since 1964 -- and the volatile stock markets of the last 10 days serve to  remind that 1992 or 1996 could be an opportunity in the historic Democratic  tradition.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Democrats who remember better and prouder days won't want to  look in the mirror too often. It's not a flattering sight.  </P></p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases on renewed political problems Renewed political uncertainty weighed on share prices, and the Nikkei index fell on arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average fell 80.21 to 19,628.93 while the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 6.51 to 1,597.92. The Nikkei opened at a high of 19,718.04 before falling to a low of 19,512.40 later in the morning. The overnight announcement that the Social Democratic party was pulling out of the coalition, leaving Mr Tsutomu Hata, the newly selected prime minister, to lead a minority government discouraged investors. Volume was flat at 240m shares as most market participants remained sidelined. The Nikkei 300 fell 1.19 to 292.13. Advances led declines by 707 to 258 with 217 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.09 to 1,307,36. Some analysts said that they were becoming cautious over short-term prospects because of the increase in long arbitrage positions, higher bond yields and the strength of the yen against the dollar. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said the Nikkei would hover around the low end of the 19,000 to 21,000 range, possibly testing the downside. The absence of foreign buying, which supported share prices during the first quarter, also worried investors. However, some traders believed that overseas investors would remain inactive while long bond yields failed to ease. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y2,000 to Y886,000 while East Japan Railway declined Y3,000 to Y480,000. Multi-media theme stocks lost ground, Hitachi falling Y10 to Y956 and NEC declining Y20 to Y1,130. Speculative shares declined on selling by investors looking for profits: Sumitomo Coal Mining fell Y10 to Y955. Furukawa Electric rose Y15 to Y690 on its patent approval to manufacture shape memory alloys of nickel and titanium. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 116.96 to 21,912.54 in volume of 17.2m shares. Roundup New York's overnight improvement brought gains to several markets in the region. HONG KONG moved on Wall Street and on fading concern about government attempts to cool down the residential property market. The Hang Seng index rose 192.53, or 2.1 per cent to 9,328.64 as turnover climbed from HKDollars 2.95bn to HKDollars 4.06bn. The property sub-index closed 443.04, or 2.8 per cent higher at 16,109.58. Cheung Kong was up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 37.75, Henderson Land added HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 40 and SHK Properties HKDollars 2.00 to HKDollars 49. Brokers said that investors no longer feared drastic measures in any government bid to halt the rise in property prices. AUSTRALIA added a rise in the domestic bond market and buying, mostly from local institutions, took the All Ordinaries index up 26.9 to 2,069.4. Turnover, however, was light at ADollars 370.84m. Industrials were generally strong, and oil stocks performed well after oil prices hit five month highs on short-term supply worries. Ampolex and Santos both rose 18 cents, to ADollars 4.38 and ADollars 4.08, and Woodside put on 12 at ADollars 4.30. NEW ZEALAND gained 1.8 per cent although here, too, professionals pointed to light volume as the NZSE-40 capital index closed up 36.91 at 2,130.18. Turnover was NZDollars 33.5m. Brokers also said that and a lacklustre debt market inhibited the buyers, and pointed out that recent similar rises on Wall Street had invariably been quickly snuffed out the next day by large falls. MANILA offered higher than expected first quarter profits from Meralco, the electric utility, coupled with PLDT's rise in New York as the composite index rose 29.19 to 2,867.59. Meralco A rose 12.50 pesos to 447.50 pesos after the company announced a 129 per cent increase in first quarter net profits, and PLDT closed 15 pesos higher at 1,780 pesos. TAIWAN saw its highest volume since February 4 as heavy profit-taking took the weighted index down 67.39 to 5,851.16 after a 57-point rise at the opening. Turnover rose from TDollars 73.22bn to TDollars 89.91bn. Heavy profit-taking in plastics triggered across-the-board selling. Petrochemical stocks were especially weak, with China Petrochemical down 7 per cent at TDollars 26.60. BANGKOK lost 1.1 per cent, the SET index closing 14.08 lower at 1,263.79 on rising interest rates and political uncertainty. KARACHI opened its new account with the KSE 100 index down 17.42 at 2,408.62. BOMBAY ended lower in spite of a late recovery on buying by Indian mutual funds. The BSE 30-share index fell 32.75 to 3,780.52.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Cable connections The strength of the dollar against sterling heavily flattered Cable &amp; Wireless's profits in the first half. It also reinforced the importance of Hong Kong Telecom, which is driving not only the company's p&amp;l, but also its stock market valuation. The market value of C&amp;W's properties outside Hong Kong is now at its lowest level for five years. That is a reflection not of the poor prospects for Mercury and the Caribbean but of the overheated level of the Hang Seng index. C&amp;W is making efforts to diversify, the One-2-One cellular service in London being the latest example. Yet effort over the past two years has been directed at tidying up the balance sheet and staunching cash leakages. Now that C&amp;W is more watertight, and has earned some credibility with the market, it is well placed to take advantage of the opportunities in global telecoms. Since it seems to have a hit with One-2-One, an accelerated roll out might demonstrate that the company is not only capable of housekeeping, but also of putting its full weight behind winners. Perhaps C&amp;W has been circumspect because the options are so broad. Basic telephony concessions will open up in developing countries, as will opportunities to provide sophisticated services as a second force in western Europe. China remains a great prize on the horizon. In technology, the possibilities range from the expansion of radio services to multi-media. Faced with such a range, a little caution may be in order. C&amp;W is only a medium-sized player. The time is approaching when its management will have to prove it can apply the company's limited muscle where it counts.</p>

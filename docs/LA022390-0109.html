			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION'S FIRST ELECTED BLACK GOVERNOR HAS THEM GUESSING: WILL HE BE A  BIG-SPENDING LIBERAL OR A BRIDGE-BUILDING 'GOOD OLD BOY'?;  </P> <P> THE NEW VIRGINIAN  </P> <P> Making history is a roll of the dice and Virginia's new governor, Lawrence  Douglas Wilder, knows it. This elemental lesson rises like vapor from the  swampy, treacherous waters of the Old Dominion's politics, where the bones of  losers are picked clean and dumped in the murky depths of oblivion.  </P> <P> Of course, obscurity is the least of Democrat Wilder's worries at the moment.  As the nation's first elected black governor -- chosen in a state that once was  the heart and brain of the Confederacy -- he has the bright aura of an  electoral magician. By virtue of this uniqueness, Wilder, whose cachet includes  being the grandson of slaves, has achieved overnight national prominence while  many of his rivals and peers continue to splash fitfully in the gloom of media  anonymity.  </P> <P> This day, for instance, Wilder -- dressed in an immaculate blue pinstripe suit  and recently minus his mustache -- seems immensely telegenic, more than  handsome enough to get a running start in public opinion polls. Moreover, he  looks much younger than his 59 years and when he smiles or laughs -- as he does  often -- another decade fades away, giving him the priceless political gift of  youthfulness.  </P> <P> But -- and there's always a but, isn't there? -- from the perspective of the  state capital, Wilder claims that his seemingly unbounded future is about as  clear as the James River that roils muddily through this city of 220,000.  </P> <P> Yes, he says, slouching back in his chair, relaxed and cheerful in the small  office of the Capitol that Thomas Jefferson built, people are pressing him to  start a "Wilder national movement." The subject came up in a meeting this very  morning, he says, chuckling. Even so, the friend and political ally who  broached the topic agreed that it's a "trivial" matter, he says.  </P> <P> He has only been in office since Jan. 13, Wilder notes, and his four-year term  stretches before him like unmapped territory.  </P> <P> Who can tell whether he'll be on a mountain or a molehill by 1994?  </P> <P> "It's just a question of where you are, what have you done, where is your  impetus, what's the stride, what's the step, what is your motivation, what is  available, and what's possible," he explains in the cadences of a veteran stump  speaker. "I've always believed in the art of the possible. I believe there's a  difference between brave-heartedness and foolishness and I believe in whatever  I'm going to do, if I don't see success somewhere through the tunnel of that  vision, I don't even bother with it."  </P> <P> These cautious words come from a politician who learned in 20 years of climbing  to the top that personal metamorphosis and public perception are key to  political survival -- especially in Virginia, where the faintest whisper of  radicalism or unorthodoxy can sound like a Guns N' Roses concert. (A magazine  writer observed during last year's campaign that Virginia's most liberal  Democrats would be moderate Republicans anyplace else.)  </P> <P> Once seen as a black activist and outsider, Wilder, a flamboyant former  criminal defense lawyer, state senator and lieutenant governor, transformed  himself into, as one local attorney put it, "a good old boy" who built bridges  to white colleagues instead of burning them. Throughout the campaign last fall,  Wilder appealed to "the new Virginia mainstream . . . that group which looks  forward rather than behind, that builds rather than destroys and brings people  together, rather than to divide them."  </P> <P> Much of his strategy, he says, was to combat the assumption that "any Democrat  would be a big spender. And certainly, if you are a minority, as in my case,  that I'd be more than just a big spender and that I'd be turning the keys of  the jails over to the prisoners and things like that."  </P> <P> Wilder's most liberal position during the campaign was his pro-choice stand on  abortion, an issue believed crucial in the close race. On the other hand,  Wilder years ago reversed his opposition to the death penalty to project a  tough-on-crime image.  </P> <P> Former Richmond Mayor Henry L. Marsh III, who roomed with Wilder at Howard  University law school, believes that Wilder's successful balancing act in a  conservative state with a more than 80% white electorate will bring both  symbolic and substantial rewards to blacks.  </P> <P> "Being governor of Virginia is like being emperor of the world," says Marsh,  who continues to serve on the City Council. "Doug's service as governor is a  way of overcoming a lot of historical resistance to blackness. If Doug does an  outstanding job for all people, it breaks down a lot of barriers."  </P> <P> Marsh concedes, however, "There are apprehensions among some blacks that we may  not get much out of this except the symbolism."  </P> <P> Perhaps Wilder's most vociferous and longtime critic in the local black  community is Sa'ad El-Amin, a radical lawyer. El-Amin -- who concedes he is  practically a minority of one in criticizing the governor -- charges that  Wilder, with his links to conservative Democrats such as Virginia's U.S. Sen.  Charles Robb, will be used to "sell" a rightward-shifting party to blacks on a  national level. "The good old boys will have their cake and eat it too," he  says.  </P> <P> In general, though, the prevailing moods in the state range between euphoria  and pleased surprise, Marsh says. "Some people feel sort of amazed that it's  working out and maybe this guy isn't too bad after all."  </P> <P> Everyone agrees that Wilder has never been afraid of taking a stand or applying  pressure. Two oft-cited examples are his campaign to change the state song,  "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny," because of the lyric "this ol' darkie's  heart," and his ultimately successful battle to make the Rev. Martin Luther  King Jr.'s birthday a state holiday. To win the holiday fight, Wilder agreed to  a compromise that shared the King holiday with Confederate Generals Robert E.  Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Nonetheless, insiders paint Wilder as an adroit  behind-the-scenes worker with a stubborn streak that can drive opponents to  distraction.  </P> <P> But now that he has won the governor's chair -- and by the narrow margin of  fewer than 7,000 votes at that -- Wilder believes that he must be doubly  careful not to let the elation of victory lead him into the temptations of  foolish pride.  </P> <P> "If I fail or say things that people could say, 'Well, I told you so,' it would  set a lot of things back and that would be more detrimental to me in terms of  what I had in mind than anything I know," he says.  </P> <P> This attitude finds favor in an office not far from Wilder's, that of A.L.  Philpott, 33 years a member of the House of Delegates and Speaker of the House  for 12. A white-haired, pipe-smoking former segregationist who drew the line at  closing the state's public schools during "massive resistance" to integration  in the 1950s, Philpott gives Wilder grudging but sincere credit for being a  smart politician.  </P> <P> The new governor is "a highly intelligent person who is unlikely to make any  foolish mistakes," Philpott says. In some quarters, Wilder was "expected to  fall flat on his face" almost as soon as he was sworn in, Philpott continues,  noting that Wilder has "disappointed" these expectations.  </P> <P> Philpott readily acknowledges that "Doug and I haven't always been the best of  friends."  </P> <P> This turns out to be something of an understatement. Wilder and Philpott were  once political enemies, so much so that Wilder threatened to work for  Philpott's defeat.  </P> <P> But it was Philpott, who has a record of getting himself in hot water for  racial gaffes, who threw a 1985 breakfast to introduce Wilder, then running for  lieutenant governor, to politicos on his home turf.  </P> <P> Five years later, Philpott is optimistic about what Wilder will do for the  state. "I think it's going to have a very positive effect on the political and  social life of Virginia," he says of Wilder's governorship. He finally puts a  match to the pipe he has been toying with. "Perhaps we can get rid of some of  that image that we're rednecks stuck in the 1820s."  </P> <P> And yet Philpott apparently still can't quite believe that Wilder outmatched  everyone to become governor, an office more coveted and revered in Virginia  than the Presidency of the United States.  </P> <P> He expected Marshall Coleman, Wilder's Republican opponent, to win the  election, he says, noting that many Democrats told him they were sitting out  the election because they would not vote for a black man.  </P> <P> Consequently, Philpott says he did not give credence to widely publicized polls  that showed Wilder winning by several percentage points, when, in fact, he  squeaked into office. The polls were the subject of a post-election controversy  over whether and why voters lie in opinion surveys about race.  </P> <P> "I didn't believe it when we nominated him for lieutenant governor," Philpott  says. "I didn't even believe it when we nominated him for governor."  </P> <P> Philpott's comment accents the tension between change and tradition -- both  good and bad -- in this state of 6 million. The capital city itself seems to  symbolize that tension.  </P> <P> While Virginians talk proudly of the state's rapid growth and its attendant  rush into modern times, to a Los Angeles resident, Richmond seems a city  steeped in the past, a town of red brick buildings where the 19th and 18th  centuries are enshrined and made palpable.  </P> <P> It's almost impossible to walk down the street without rubbing against a plaque  commemorating a historic house or skirting around a statue honoring a native  son for greatness in battle or statesmanship.  </P> <P> In fact, this is a city of statues. One major street, Monument Avenue, is  devoted to the display of sculpted likenesses of major Confederates. The only  one not on a horse is Jefferson Davis, the luckless president of the  secessionist states. Generals Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and J. E. B.  Stuart tower over the politician in bronze meldings of men and horse flesh.  </P> <P> Not far away, there's another telling measure of the veneration of the past.  One of the city's most expensive restaurants proudly occupies a former stable  that supposedly sheltered Lee's faithful mount, Traveller.  </P> <P> City Councilman Marsh says that the celebrations of Confederate heroes are  generally accepted by local blacks, noting that the council recently  appropriated money to refurbish the statues on Monument Avenue. Marsh is quick  to point out, too, that Richmond contains its share of landmarks that are  important to black people.  </P> <P> "There's so much history in the air," he says, gesturing outside his law  offices to the surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> Though much less visible, these shards of black history were part of the  consciousness he and Wilder shared as they grew up in a totally segregated  city, Marsh says.  </P> <P> Chief among them is Richmond's Jackson Ward area, a neighborhood that was a  center of black "intellectual thought and innovation from Reconstruction to the  1920s," he explains. The area contains the "oldest black insurance company in  the country and the oldest black bank in the country," he adds.  </P> <P> Jackson Ward also has at least one statue, a tribute to Bill (Bojangles)  Robinson, the famed tap dancer who was born in the neighborhood in 1878.  </P> <P> But Richmond's chief shrine is the state Capitol itself, a 1785 building  designed by Jefferson along the lines of a classical temple. Here, under the  rotunda, stands Houdon's famous statue of George Washington, object of a  thousand school group tours. Here, too, is the home of the Virginia General  Assembly, "the oldest legislative body in the Western hemisphere," a local  guidebook informs.  </P> <P> And it is with the living politicians of the Legislature that Wilder will have  to work his magic if he is to move beyond the boundaries of the state.  </P> <P> In town for a 60-day session, legislators can usually be identified by the lack  of attention they pay to the Capitol building's artistic tributes to  politicians of yore. Preoccupied by the business of the present, Virginia's  representatives hurry by the paintings and sculptures as if to say, "Those guys  will never have to run for reelection again."  </P> <P> The governor and Speaker Philpott claim that the session has gone well --  despite the budget crunch that led Wilder to call for establishing a  $200-million reserve against revenue shortfalls. Indeed, Wilder drew bipartisan  praise last month for his fiscally tough State of the Commonwealth Address that  promised no tax increases. One legislator told the Richmond News Leader, "The  people in this state that were worried about a liberal governor have had their  fears allayed." (The 1990-92 $26-billion state budget is largely the work of  Wilder's predecessor. Virginia's governors get only one crack at a budget they  fully can call their own, the spending plan they concoct for their final two  years in office.)  </P> <P> But Wilder and Philpott are fuming over a Feb. 1 News Leader article, based  largely on anonymous sources, that characterized Wilder as getting a grade of  "D . . . for disinvolvement" with the Legislature.  </P> <P> Wilder says he told one legislator quoted in the story, "If everything I'm  going to say to you is going to be in the press, then let me write it out and  give it to you and put it in the press." He adds that in a speech to the local  press he told reporters, "I always know exactly who that anonymous source is  and I know exactly why they're anonymous."  </P> <P> Last week, Wilder -- and his calls for fiscal austerity -- again took jabs from  the press with reports that his new Lincoln limousine costs well above the  price of his predecessor's official transportation, a Cadillac -- $37,923 vs.  $19,949. Wilder's office blamed the difference on the rise in car prices and a  drop in trade values. But, traditionally, Virginia's governors get new cars.  </P> <P> The governor's sensitivity to some publicity may stem from earlier media  exposure of his warts. Since entering public life in 1969, Wilder has weathered  a number of personal controversies. These include his apparently stormy 1978  divorce, late payment of property taxes, his former ownership of a run-down  vacant house that neighbors contended was a public nuisance and a reprimand  from the Virginia Supreme Court for procrastinating in a personal injury suit.  </P> <P> None of these matters, including a $52,000 property settlement won by his  ex-wife, ever seriously damaged Wilder.  </P> <P> Marsh says his friend seems to share a "Teflon" political trait with another  politician. "I think he possesses a Reagan-like quality of being able to  overcome these kinds of obstacles."  </P> <P> Moreover, Wilder demonstrated a capacity for candor in revealing interviews  with biographer Donald P. Baker, chief of the Washington Post's Richmond  bureau. Among other things, in numerous long sessions with Baker, Korean war  veteran Wilder recounted that one of 20 North Korean prisoners he had helped  capture was killed by a fellow American soldier as the two escorted their  charges into captivity. Wilder was awarded a bronze star in the action at Pork  Chop Hill, which included throwing grenades into bunkers to drive the enemy  out.  </P> <P> Baker says he still doesn't know if the governor has read all of "Wilder: Hold  Fast to Dreams," published last fall. But Baker says Wilder had gotten an early  copy to peruse "the bad chapters."  </P> <P> The biography also paints a charming picture of Wilder growing up in modest but  adequate circumstances in Richmond's Church Hill neighborhood. Wilder is the  next to youngest of eight children, and as a youngster, his favorite chore was  chopping heads off chickens bound for the family table. Since then, he has come  a long way financially. He is thought to be a millionaire, thanks to his legal  skill and a sharp eye for real estate investments.  </P> <P> Wilder himself maintains that that all the skeletons in his closet have been  exterminated. "I told the press the other day . . . that the only reason that  anything hasn't been printed about me is that people just didn't know it," he  says.  </P> <P> Despite the embarrassments of the past and the current troubles of black  politicians Marion Barry and Tom Bradley, Wilder says he willingly accepts the  goldfish-bowl aspect of public life.  </P> <P> "It is in a bowl and I don't think you should complain about it because you can  get out of that bowl any time you want. . . . If you're going to lead, you do  what the tautology demands -- you set forth, you move out," he says. "You can't  afford to fall down to the extent that you say, 'Well, why don't you treat me  like everybody else?' I don't think it's a double standard and I don't think  its an invidious standard."  </P> <P> On a less lofty level, Wilder says that his unmarried state makes him a target  for social joshing. "I get chided about that every evening at some reception,"  he says. "Someone will say, 'Well who's going to be the First Lady or hostess  at the mansion?' " The social fate of Virginia is not in the balance, he adds,  because "we have a mansion staff."  </P> <P> His marital state could change, too, he suggests. "I'm not a confirmed  bachelor. I just happen to be one," he says.  </P> <P> Looking back from the vantage point of the governor's office, Wilder takes  pride in his life, all of it spent in Richmond except for stints of higher  education and military service.  </P> <P> "You see some people who say, 'I know him, he used to shine my shoes,' " he  says, laughing again. "You see the next guy and he says, 'Yeah, we were raised  together and we're very pleased.' I think it means more to me to show what  could happen in Richmond by being here. . . . I always believed that many of  the greatest gains people would achieve would be right in their own back yard."  </P> <P> Wilder's son, Lawrence Douglas Wilder Jr., a lawyer in his father's firm, says  that as a parent the governor was "definitely stern but not unfair." For  himself and his two sisters, Wilder always insisted that schoolwork and chores  took precedence over play. "He doesn't tolerate fools lightly," Wilder Jr.  says.  </P> <P> Assessing his father, the son says: "He is his own man, period. It's a constant  about him. He is himself. He is very direct. He will say what's on his mind, I  don't care who it is. . . . What you see is what you get."  </P> <P> Back in the governor's office, Wilder admits that his career has left him  vulnerable in one area -- guiding his son's future. His remarks may also say  something about the personal price of political life.  </P> <P> "I think he (Lawrence Jr.) has this latent desire to get involved in politics,"  Wilder says. "I don't know whether he should or not. I mean, if I were to run  it for him, I think I would want him to just do well in terms of his law  practice and live a more comfortable life."  </P> <P> Wilder chuckles briefly. "I would never tell him that because I think he's  already got his mind set on something like that. How could I tell him: Don't do  it?"  </P></p>

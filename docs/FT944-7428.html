			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Indian Shaving Products ahead at Rs341.1m midway Indian Shaving Products, a joint venture between Gillette of the US and the Calcutta-based Poddar group, yesterday announced a 150 per cent rise in net profit for the half-year to September 1994 on the back of a 20 per cent increase in sales. The company said net sales for the first half of the financial year rose to Rs341.4m (Dollars 10.9m) from Rs285.5m a year ago, with strength in both the domestic and export markets. While domestic sales grew 18 per cent to Rs301.2m, export sales were up 35 per cent to Rs40.2m. Gross profits increased to Rs54.8m from Rs43.3m, a rise of 27 per cent. This was achieved after investing Rs42.1m in advertising and other marketing activities. Net profits increased 150 per cent to Rs28.5m, after providing for a depreciation of Rs14.8m and interest of Rs11.5m. In 1993-94, the company wrote off the difference in exchange on a long-term advance received from Gillette, resulting in a loss of Rs17.6m, and therefore there was no exchange loss in this period. This contributed to sharply higher net profits this year.</p>

Wednesday's strike of airline  pilots, involving three per cent of all the crews, has been  suspended. On Thursday, a delegation of the union of pilots is  to meet officials from the Labour Ministry at the ministry's  headquarters. The meeting is expected to consider the pilots'  demands.    "We have postponed the action until June 2 to make another  attempt to find a common language with the ministries and  departments which can solve our problems", Alfred Malinovsky,  leader of the union, told ITAR-TASS. "The negotiations will  focus on safety of pilots and pensions for the airline staffs.  Now the pension benefit of an airline veteran comes to only 65  thousand roubles. By the way, we do not demand extra funds from  the state budget - we are ready to contribute the bulk to the  pension fund", Malinovsky said.    The pilots believe the problems of job cuts are not of less  importance. The current state of affairs does not rule out  dismissal of some eight thousand best-skilled pilots aged from  27 to 37 years. This may lead to a sharp growth in crashes.  The pilots propose to creat a foundation of airline personnel  employment which will care for provision of jobs for the most  experienced personnel.    On Thursday, the Moscow municipal court is to consider the  action brought by the office of the Russian prosecutor-general  against the union of pilots. According to the action, the  strike must be declared illegal. The case was to be heard on  Wednesday, but the hearing was postponed because the union's  representatives did not turn up.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Jobs go as 3i shuts five offices 3i GROUP, the venture capital company which is preparing for a stock market flotation next year, is to close nearly a quarter of its regional offices and make 100 staff redundant. It will shut five of its 22 offices outside London - Brighton, Guildford, Milton Keynes, Hull and Sheffield - in response to changing economic patterns and improved motorway communications, Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive said. 3i has nearly completed installing a computerised accounting and information system that will lead to the loss of 60 jobs in London. A further 40 jobs, including 30 executives, will go as a result of the regional closures, reducing 3i's total staff to 560. The cuts, Mr Macpherson said, were related not to 3i's planned flotation but to the tougher economic climate. .3i is taking on 100 new cases a month, compared with 150 a month two to three years ago. The office closures will still leave 3i with the most extensive branch network of any UK venture capital company, although there has been speculation about 3i's ability to maintain such a network after flotation. Mr Macpherson said the cuts did not signal any change in the types of investment 3i was prepared to back. The new computer system would allow for a more automated handling of small and relatively costly investments.</p>

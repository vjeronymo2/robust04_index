			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW RULES FOR STUDENT LOANS  </P> <P> The federal Education Department is taking a more responsible approach to  curbing student loan defaults now than it did last year. Not only that, its new  approach could save the federal government $5.4 billion over the next decade.  However, the department and Congress still need to change eligibility formulas  to increase the number of students who qualify for aid.  </P> <P> New rules issued a few weeks ago by the new education secretary, Lauro F.  Cavazos, still penalize colleges with any number of students who fail to pay  back federally guaranteed loans. But the proposals also offer to help schools  manage their loan programs.  </P> <P> Last year, the department threatened to cut off not just loans but all federal  student aid to schools with default rates above 20%. Community colleges and  colleges with traditionally black enrollments had the most to lose because  their low-income students had more trouble than most paying off their loans.  Black colleges worry that even the newer rules may hurt their students.  </P> <P> Under Cavazos' new plan, federal loans could be cut off or curtailed in 1991 at  some 200 institutions where more than 60% of past loans were in default.  Another 450 schools with default rates between 40% and 60% would have to reduce  defaults by 5% a year or lose some or all their loan money. Schools with  default rates of more than 20% would have to develop a plan for reducing  defaults. All schools would provide guidance to first-time borrowers. The  department would try to reduce discrimination against low-income or minority  students by making allowances for schools it felt had taken the proper steps  but still had a default rate of more than 20%.  </P> <P> Still at issue is the formula for calculating default rates. One method is to  compare the number of borrowers who left school in 1986, for example, with  those who had not started to repay their loans by the end of 1987. Many state  agencies allow students more time than that to begin repaying loans, usually  leading to lower default rates.  </P> <P> One target of the Education Department's campaign is unscrupulous trade schools  that fail to provide sound training but still leave students in debt. The  department proposes that all such schools, regardless of default rate, be  required to tell prospective students how many prior students finished their  courses and landed jobs.  </P> <P> The department's regulations head off legislation that started moving through  Congress after Cavazos' predecessor, William Bennett, proposed more arbitrary  cutoffs last year. But the law-makers rightly still want to see the government  change the calculations that determine loan eligibility. They feel, for  example, that family homes or farms should not be counted as assets for  families with incomes below $30,000. That change would make more students  eligible for loans. It could help reduce loan defaults, too, because more  middle-class students would be in the loan pool.  </P> <P> The government, colleges and trade schools must do a better job of helping  students avoid burdensome debt and costly defaults while making sure those who  are needy are not deterred from higher education. The new rules, prudently  applied, should move toward those goals.  </P></p>

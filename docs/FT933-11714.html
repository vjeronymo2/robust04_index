			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Observer: Open up, John Poor old John Patten. As if it is not enough that Britain's over-worked and much maligned education secretary has been laid low by a nasty bug, he also looks like being one of the first casualties of the government's new drive for greater openness. On June 18, his department refused a request from Tony Wright MP to publish an opinion poll on the Parent's Charter. No doubt this was because most parents were pretty unimpressed with the collapse of the testing which is at the heart of the charter. The department said that it was not Patten's practice 'to publish either officials' advice or the research underlying it'. So how will he respond next April when Citizen's Charter minister William Waldegrave brings in his code of practice on the provision of government information? While it does exclude officials' advice from disclosure, there is no exclusion for research which underlies officials' advice.</p>

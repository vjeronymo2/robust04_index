			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Outdoors: Fagin and his raiders - Beekeeping This is the time of year when I start to feel like Fagin, sending my young apprentices on raids all over town, and rubbing my hands as they return to the den with their spoils. The hives are filling up with honey as my thousands upon thousands of little Artful Dodgers and Olivia Twists fly back and forth across a three-mile radius sucking nectar from flowers and race back to share it (if unwittingly) with me. The speed with which they work is breathtaking. Three weeks ago, before the main nectar flow, I added a lightweight cedar box to the top storey of each hive, filled with empty frames to hold the honeycomb. Today, I find it a struggle to lift, weighed down as it is with the dense pale honies from various flowers which have been crammed into it. They are fairly well mixed, but you can find pockets of particular flavours, the best of them, to my taste, being the delicate nutty sweetness of the hawthorn. The making of honeycomb is as fascinating as the filling of it and is proving particularly poignant to watch this year against the backdrop of a nine-acre building site which we now overlook from our garden. Huge stores of stone, wood and tile have been trucked on to the former school grounds, while inside the hives, with no fuss, no materials and no machinery, the bees are building too. Beginning with the empty wooden frames, the apian workers first find a true vertical by making a plumb-line of their own bodies. They have had an instinct for doing this in holes and hollow trees for millions of years. Twenty or so of them hang in a chain holding leg to leg while the wax-makers and labourers move in to begin construction. Cell by cell the hexagonal structure is created in symmetry, on either side like a mirror-image until it perfectly fills the frame, each cell smoothed and polished just a fraction longer than a worker bee and built sloping upwards at a few degrees to the horizontal to keep the honey from dripping out. For added strength, the pattern of cells is offset so that the centres of the hexagons on one side key the corners on the other. Using nothing but their own secretions, the workers build enough comb in a week to hold 35lbs of honey - many times their total body weight. As a collective display of skill, it must rival building Manhattan out of your own eyelashes. The bees approach this project with such dedication that it is usually safe to lift the roof to watch them at work and wonder how each tiny brain can possibly hold so much instinct. They do not disturb easily, since time is short in the weeks of the honey-flow and the colony's survival in the coming year will depend on building sufficient stores. The mood of their energetic buzzing is now diligent rather than aggressive. If they do seem tetchy on first opening the hive, it may mean that they are agitated about running short of space to build yet more honeycomb, which they recognise as a dangerous condition. The wise apiarist will take care to recognise this too, before rioting breaks out. Once filled, each hexagonal cell is capped with a thin air-tight lid of wax to preserve the honey for the winter. But it is at this moment that Fagin robs his own apprentices of their bounty. There are reports of sealed honey lasting for years - even centuries - in perfect condition. I rely on printed wisdom for that, since in our house we are lucky if a piece of honeycomb lasts a week before it is perfectly gone.</p>

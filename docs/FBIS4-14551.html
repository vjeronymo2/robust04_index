			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow 31 March, TASS -- "The main goal of the  agreement on civil accord is to preserve the existing elements  of civil peace," Russian presidential spokesman Vyacheslav  Kostikov said.    Speaking at a press briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Kostikov  said that President Boris Yeltsin is studying the text of the  agreement and has already had talks with the chairmen of both  houses of the Russian parliament on this matter.    "The text of the agreement has no form of a finished formula  yet and is open to discussion," Kostikov said. He did not rule  out the possibility of publishing the draft agreement.    The spokesman drew the journalists' attention to the  importance of the mechanism of the implementation of the  agreement. To this end, a conciliatory commission will be set  up to act as an arbitrator in disputes between various political  parties or organisations. "This will be an open commission which  will work also openly," Kostikov continued. The commission will  seek to "resolve the disagreements on early stages" and  "introduce and mold the culture of political compromise in  society."    Speaking about the content of the agreement on civil peace  and accord, Kostikov noted that it consists of 7.5 pages and is  divided into several sections -- preamble of a declarative  character and chapters about the ethnic and regional policies,  spiritual and moral responsibility and terms of the  implementation of the agreement.    Yeltsin hopes to set the process of signing the agreement in  motion at the end of April. The number of possible participants  is about 25, but the agreement will be open to anyone wishing to  sign it afterwards as well, he said.</p>

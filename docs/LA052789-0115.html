			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT WHO WAS SHOT BY POLICE IS IDENTIFIED  </P> <P> A man shot dead by a Santa Ana motorcycle officer as he reportedly tried to  evade arrest was identified by a police spokesman Friday as Paul Castro, 20, of  Santa Ana. Police had been seeking Castro as a suspect in at least two armed  robberies.  </P> <P> The spokesman said police "had been looking for him pretty heavily" for at  least 2 weeks when officers received a tip early Thursday evening that Castro  was at an address in the 2000 block of West Civic Center Drive. Four uniformed  officers were sent to the address, the spokesman said, and when Castro saw them  pull up, he began to run and reach toward his waist. One officer fired twice,  hitting Castro once in the back, police said. A knife was found on the body,  police said.  </P> <P> During the search for Castro, police were advised that "he was armed and  dangerous," Lt. Robert Chavez said, because tipsters had told officers that he  carried weapons and that he would resist arrest.  </P> <P> Chavez said that the robberies Castro was believed to have committed involved  threats with knives, small-caliber handguns and sawed-off shotguns. A warrant  issued for Castro stated that he was suspected of armed robbery, assault with a  deadly weapon, resisting arrest, auto theft, receiving stolen property and  hit-and-run driving.  </P> <P> Chavez said that, as is usual in the Police Department when an officer is  involved in a shooting, the officer who shot Castro is on a 3-day paid leave  during which he will be offered psychological counseling.  </P> <P> Chavez declined to identify the officer or to say whether that officer has been  involved in other shootings.  </P> <P> An investigation into the shooting is continuing.  </P></p>

In contrast to Interior  Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union), Justice  Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic  Party of Germany) rejects a speedy deportation of the people  concerned to Turkey. The minister also expressed doubts about  the sense of a German-Turkish agreement, which Kanther demands.  By this agreement Ankara is supposed to commit itself once  again to not torturing deported Kurdish criminals or sentencing  them to death.    Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said on Monday [28 March] that  Turkey has long joined several agreements "that say torture is  not permitted. This shows that Turkey has obligations arising  from these agreements." Therefore, a Justice Ministry spokesman  expressed skepticism about a talk, which is to be held by the  Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry, as well as the Foreign  Ministry on the agreement today, Tuesday.    In an interview, the justice minister called for putting  Kurdish criminals on trial in Germany. No one must be deported  to a country where he is "really threatened" with torture and  the death penalty. The Justice Ministry spokesman explained that  this is "the ultimate limit" for Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.  Hans Gottfried Bernrath, Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD], chairman of the Bundestag Internal Affairs Committee,  also called for trying the Kurdish criminals in Germany. Only  afterwards should a deportation be decided on.    The Interior Ministry played down reports that, on the  weekend, it considered flying Federal Border Police units to the  Kurdish demonstrations in Bundeswehr helicopters. Such  considerations are only made in general and apply to really  exceptional situations within the framework of administrative  assistance. In no case does this mean the use of soldiers, but  only the provision of Air Force transport planes, the Interior  Ministry said.    Several SPD politicians once again came out in favor of the  immediate cessation of German arms exports to Turkey. There are  indications that Ankara does use the weapons against Kurds, in  contrast to its reassurances. A Foreign Ministry spokesman  stressed that German diplomats have not learned about the use of  weapons from Germany against Kurds so far. However, it was said  in the Defense Ministry that Bonn does "not have any possibility  of checking this in Turkey itself."</p>

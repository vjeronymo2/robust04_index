			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Marking Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Different types of permanent marking would be acceptable. Industry members would be able to choose the type that is most suitable for the product, and least expensive, so long as the appropriate information is communicated and will remain on the product permanently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The retail packaging of consumer products already contains a great deal of information and the amount of required information has been kept to a minimum. The name and location of a manufacturing, importing or private labeling firm located in the United States are the most important pieces of identifying information to help the Commission trace a product. (As discussed in section 2(a) below, a code on file with the Commission may be sufficient.) If there is a recall, it is also important to have products identified according to their model and their production run, or according to similar categories that will help pinpoint the particular products that are unsafe. (As discussed in section 2(b) below, this information could also be in code.) This helps limit recalls to just the products that are unsafe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The size and conspicuousness of the marking are less significant in this type of proposal than they would be in one designed to provide information to consumers at the time of purchase. Here, it would be sufficient if the information can be read without disassembly of the product or magnification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Exceptions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal could include various exceptions to minimize its economic impact: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Firms might prefer to mark products with a code such as a registered trademark or a corporate symbol or logo in place of its name and address. The proposal could permit this if the firm notifies the Commission and waits ten working days after receipt of the notification for the Commission to object. An objection would be made, for example, if some other firm was already using the same or a too similar code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The model and date of production information could be provided in code, as well. If the Commission needed to know that information, it would obtain the code or the information from the firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Because consumer products vary greatly in size and material, the Commission recognizes that it may be impracticable to permanently mark some limited number of products. The proposal would therefore give firms some leeway in complying. As examples, it is impracticable to mark modeling clay because of its texture, and it is probably impracticable to mark small glass marbles. However, the containers of any products that qualify for an exception might have to be permanently marked or printed with the same identifying information. While containers may be discarded or lost, this provision is intended to afford a reasonable alternative for products which cannot practicably be permanently marked. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Products consisting of more than one piece, such as a set or collection, may not have to be permanently marked on every piece. The largest piece might have to be so marked_as well as any container that comes with the product. For example, the board in a board game (assuming it is the largest piece) and the box would be marked, but not the dice, markers or other pieces in the game. If all pieces in a set or collection are essentially the same size, they might all have to be permanently marked. In addition, if many pieces would fall into the category of ``the largest,'' all of those pieces might have to be marked. While requiring every piece in a set or collection to be permanently marked would be preferable from a safety standpoint, such a broad provision might be unduly burdensome. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission solicits all available relevant information on an appropriate effective date, including industry cycling schedules for replacing capital equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Text of Possible Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To obtain specific public comments and specific information, the Commission is providing the text of the possible product identification provisions that it is considering. Again, the Commission emphasizes its willingness to consider alternative approaches for accomplishing its objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The Militant Clergy Association of Tehran in a  statement has congratulated the followers of the path of the  founder of the Islamic Republic and the noble people of Iran on  the advent of the 16th anniversary of the brilliant life of the  Islamic revolution.    The statement says that 15 years ago Khomeyni made a firm  determination to establish a strong foundation, which has  continued to grow stronger and more beautiful with our progress.    In reference to this point that we are proud of the  leadership of a people whose imam was considered as the  brilliant sun of the Islamic Revolution, the statement adds:  Today no one has any doubt that the beloved Khamene'i is the  same great Khomeyni, the light of leadership and supremacy, who  has enlightened the most remote parts of the world thirsting for  justice, humanism and divinity.    The Militant Clergy Association believes that, following the  painful death of Imam Khomeyni, the secret of the proud  victories of the people is preserved by the resourceful  leadership of the revolution, and that the perpetuation of the  revolution and the successes of the system will remain with the  group that sincerely obeys Ayatollah Khamene'i, the spiritual  leader, and understands his guidance and utilizes it in carrying  out the policies of the system.    The Militant Clergy Association of Tehran in its statement  has emphasized the preservation of the valued gifts of the  revolution, the perpetuation of combats against oppression, and  support for popular liberationist struggles. It has said that  the recognition of the enemy's different moves and the necessary  preparedness against them will ensure the perpetual movement of  the revolution.    The Militant Clergy Association, indicating that the nations  of the world are burning with the desire to enjoy living in the  free atmosphere of the Islamic Republic, has described the  people of Iran to be the freest people in the world and the  Islamic Republic as the most independent state.    In another part of the statement, the propaganda of  foreigners about human rights in Iran is condemned. The best  evidence of the enemy's baseless propaganda is about human  rights violations in Iran. Combating oppression and injustice  has been the prime purpose of our nation.    The Militant Clergy Association, in another part of its  statement, after having proclaimed its support for the  government's economic programs, says that it is unfair to accuse  the government of having followed a Westernized economic policy.  It believes that the revolution in terms of the economy has been  on a logical and desirable course    Warning against excessive spending, the statement says that  a  life of opulence and luxury is a major plague to a revolutionary  movement--particularly the Islamic revolution. The public and  officials must know that an aristocratic and excessive style of  life cannot be included in the dictionary of the revolution and  it is not compatible with the divine values of the revolution.    The Militant Clergy Association adds that careful control  and  supervision of the government's organizations by the  revolutionary institutions is a most important necessity that  will reduce at minimum any possible wrongdoing and trespassing  upon the commonwealth of Muslims (state treasury).    At the end, the statement urges the evermore increasingly  glorious celebration of the Islamic Revolution anniversary on  this holy day of Bahman 22 [11 February] with the wide  participation of the devout people of Iran to make America and  the usurper Zionist regime tremble with fear.</p>

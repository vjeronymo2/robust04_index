			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Books: Write first, live later - Stephen Crane's work pre-empted his life THE DOUBLE LIFE OF STEPHEN CRANE: A BIOGRAPHY by Christopher Benfey Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 294 pages WHILE A great many novels and plays derive from episodes in their authors' past lives, the reverse is not uncommon. There are some authors' lives whose future course seems to have been plotted in advance in their imaginative work. Who, for instance, knowing the end of Oscar Wilde, can listen without inwardly shuddering to the fate of Jack's imaginary brother Ernest in The Importance? JACK: He died abroad; in Paris in fact. I had a telegram last night from the manager of the Grand Hotel . . . MISS PRISM: As a man sows, so he shall reap. Wilde was riding high when he wrote that. Not a cloud on his horizon. Yet within five or six years he had been disgraced, imprisoned and had died in a hotel in Paris, his friends informed by telegram. As Christopher Benfey points out in The Double Life of Stephen Crane, no author's imaginative work has ever provided a more accurate forecast of the events of his future life than Crane's. This American writer was a contemporary of Wilde's, and also had a meteoric career. He died aged only 28 in 1900, the year of Wilde's death. The young Wallace Stevens was sent to cover Crane's funeral service at the Central Metropolitan Temple, New York. 'Most of the people' he wrote 'were of the lower classes and had dropped in apparently to pass the time . . . The whole thing was frightful'. Yet Crane's place in American literature was already secure ; nowadays no course on the American novel is complete without him. But he still tends to be regarded, especially by us in Britain, as merely the author of that Civil War classic, The Red Badge of Courage, a one-book man. By any standards The Red Badge is a fine book, a memorable study of initiation into manhood, into life - but there is a great deal more, equally good (see the 1984 Library of America omnibus volume of Crane's work). He produced several fine stories and novellas not directly involving war - outstanding among them are The Monster, The Open Boat, The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky, The Blue Hotel - all of which turn nonetheless on violent action. A black servant is horribly disfigured in a fire saving his master's child and is thereafter socially ostracised. Four men including a war correspondent fight to survive in a lifeboat off the Florida coast. A sheriff returns home with his new young wife and has at once to participate in a shoot-out. A poker-game ends in a brawl and one of the players, a Swede, is killed. Crane is the earliest of the fly-on-the wall school of fiction-writers, making the reader feel that he is totally enclosed in the world of these events. We seem to experience them physically in our guts, just as we experience the emotions of the fledgling recruit John Fleming under fire, culminating in his flight from danger in The Red Badge. Crane was far too young to have fought in the Civil War and had had no direct experience of battle when he wrote that book, yet when it was published to great praise in 1895 such was its air of authenticity there were those who claimed to have served in the same regiment with him. It was afterwards that Crane had real experience of war, and came under fire, as a Hearst journalist covering the fighting between Greece and Turkey and the gun-running during the Cuban insurrection. It was when Crane was trying to reach Cuba that he experienced the shipwreck described in The Open Boat. While he was convalescing from the ordeal he began his liaison with Cora Taylor, the madam of the brothel in Florida - the aptly named Hotel de Dream  -where he was staying. Benfey has little difficulty in finding intimations of shipwreck as well as battle in Crane's earlier work. And he points to the fact that Crane's first book, the novella Maggie, had a prostitute for a heroine - though Benfey has to admit that the pathetic waif Maggie is poles apart from the ebullient, dominant, Mae West-like Cora who, after Crane had recovered, came to England with him. As man and wife they took over a rambling, decaying Tudor manor, Brede Place in Sussex, where they entertained the local literati including Conrad, Wells and Henry James. There is a famous photograph of a garden party they gave where James is seen with Cora. This English fling of Crane's as a munificent lord of the manor (while heavily in debt) is pretty well documented; but as Benfey shows there are huge gaps in the earlier years that no amount of research has been able to fill. The first biography of Crane, by one Thomas Beer, has been exposed recently as highly fraudulent. Beer quotes letters allegedly by Crane now revealed as clever fakes. Unfortunately the later book by the poet John Berryman, containing some interesting observations about Crane's extraordinary style, was heavily based on it. The standard later life of Crane by RW Stallman does remain more or less intact. Benfey re-interprets the ascertainable facts. Crane's father was a Methodist Minister in New Jersey who resigned from a fashionable living to become an itinerant preacher. The cause of his fall from grace remains obscure, as does that of the mental illness suffered by Crane's mother. His father's death when he was nine and his mother's subsequent madness devastated the future novelist's childhood. Benfey, a poet who teaches American literature at Mount Holyoake College, freely admits to many crucial biographical gaps. He makes up for them by scrutinising the work with exceptional care. He focuses on one or two hitherto neglected aspects, pointing to some very short stories about babies by Crane which de-sentimentalised the notion of infancy and anticipated the findings of psychology, and he gives some welcome attention to Crane's almost totally forgotten poems, Black Riders, relating their curious mode of presentation, entirely in upper case, to newspaper headlines and, more distantly, to the arts and crafts movement. This is fascinating stuff - even if it does not render Crane's cryptic poems any easier to read or understand. Indeed Benfey calls upon a diverse number of disciplines and different authorities to illuminate Crane's texts, from Gericault, the painter of shipwreck, to Winnicott, the child psychologist. Let us hope his lively book will win for Crane some of that wider readership he so richly deserves.</p>

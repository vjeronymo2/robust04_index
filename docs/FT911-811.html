			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Economic outlook bleak for Caribbean CARIBBEAN economies which were depressed in 1990 are unlikely to fare any better this year, according to the Caribbean Development Bank's review of the region, which has just been published. The bank said the prospects of the region were not encouraged by expectations of continued weak performance in the economies of the Caribbean's major trading partners. The CDB, which is based in Barbados, said the economies of its borrowing members last year 'continued to slow down  .. affected primarily by the deepening world recession.' It said that of its 17 borrowing members, only Anguilla, Belize, Dominica, Montserrat and Trinidad and Tobago recorded economic growth. The bank, which has total resources of Dollars 712m - contributed mainly by the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany and Italy - provides programme loans to its members. Resort countries in the region suffered last year from a downturn in international tourism, caused by recession in the major markets and the Gulf crisis. The CDB said the region's tourism was also affected last year by increasing competition from other resorts. Tightened liquidity caused a contraction in the construction sector as commercial bank lending declined. This coincided with an end to reconstruction activity following damage caused by a hurricane in the eastern Caribbean 20 months ago. The CDB reported better news for the Caribbean's banana industry, with exports increasing by 13 per cent last year. There were increases in production in Dominica, Jamaica, St Vincent and St Lucia, while exports fell in Belize and Grenada.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating has encouraged his  British counterpart, John Major, to use Australia as a trade and  investment springboard into Asia. Mr. Keating has also raised  Australia's ongoing trade concerns with Canada in a separate  meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien. Linda  Mottram reports that Mr. Keating met the British and Canadian  leaders in London where they are gathering for the commemoration  of the World War II D-day landing of Normandy 50 years ago.    [Begin Mottram recording] Ahead of the D-day ceremony, Mr.  Keating met with Mr. Major in London with trade and investment  are key agenda items in what the two leaders have described as a  strong relationship. Officials say Mr. Keating assured Mr.  Major that Australia's push for closer economic links with Asia  did not exclude the Australia-Britain relationship. The  Australian Government is keen for Britain to use its very high  level of investment in Australia as a window into Asia. The two  leaders also discussed the forthcoming APEC [Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation] leaders' summit in Jakarta and ways of  advancing the Asia Pacific Economic Grouping.    Mr. Keating talked with Canada's Jean Chretien who described  by officials as equally warm although Mr. Keating noted the  bilateral relationship had languished somewhat in particular  over trade tension. Officials described Mr. Keating as putting  a strong argument for Canada to particularly review its decision  to impose tariff quotas on the imports of Australian boneless  beef. [end recording]</p>

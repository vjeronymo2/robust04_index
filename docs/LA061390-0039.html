			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW HOPE IN THE LAND OF THE INCAS  </P> <P> More than 500 years ago the Inca Empire stretched from the Amazon to the Andes,  ruled by one chief, the Inca, from a stronghold in Peru. The Inca ruled  because, with a sundial carved of stone, he was wise and powerful enough to  control the waxing and waning of the seasons. After winter's scarce, thin  sunlight, the Inca would call the sun, the Inti, to return and bless the  empire.  </P> <P> If only such a mystical device existed today. For Peru's new president-elect,  Alberto Fujimori, may need a touch of shamanism to bring prosperity back to  Peru.  </P> <P> When Fujimori is inaugurated July 28, he will inherit an awesome list of  problems: An inflation rate of more than 2,000%. Bitter racial and class  differences that divide Peruvians of Indian and Hispanic descent. A war against  a tough guerrilla army with an ideology of indiscriminate violence that so far  claims 20,000 lives and shows no signs of abating. And fertile acres dedicated  to the Andean region's only paying cash crop -- coca leaves, the source of  America's cocaine plague. Compounding his financial problems, Fujimori will  also have to renew ties with international bankers who cut off credit to  outgoing President Alan Garcia.  </P> <P> The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori appeared on Peru's political scene  just a few months ago. A dark horse with no political experience, he trounced  conservative Mario Vargas Llosa, the world famous novelist.  </P> <P> Exit polls indicate Fujimori's victory was due to his popularity among rural  and lower-class Peruvians who found the traditional political structure unable  to offer any promise that a way out of Peru's political morass can be found.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration plans to send $35 million in military aid and U.S.  military advisers to Peru's most conflict-ridden region to train the military  to fight both drug trafficking and the guerrillas, battles the Peruvians have  in the past been loath to fight and which Fujimori says militarization has only  worsened.  </P> <P> Fujimori's election sparked music and dancing among the descendants of the  Incas. They are hoping that he will garner enough international support to  break Peru's cycle of destitution and violence. They are clamoring for crop  subsidies to diminish the attractions of growing coca. They are clamoring for  employment and health care in the hope the guerrillas will fade away.  </P> <P> The United States should work cooperatively with Fujimori, who wants input and  help in formulating new economic policy. Washington should also support the  necessary, if difficult, route of economic development. This is certainly as  critical a juncture in Peruvian history as the rise and fall of the Inca: No  talisman will be as effective as truly well-targeted international aid.  </P></p>

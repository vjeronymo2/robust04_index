			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / LDP aims at big stimulus to economy JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party has proposed a spending package of more than Y13,000bn (Pounds 76bn) to stimulate the economy, but has yet to agree the amount with the Ministry of Finance, which is pushing for a lower figure. The Y13,000bn figure, decided at the weekend, is essentially an LDP 'wish list' in response to a promise by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that the package will be 'the biggest ever' and certainly larger than the Y10,700bn emergency package of last year. Mr Miyazawa wants to take an impressively large figure with him to Washington later this month, as the US has been pressing Japan to revive its economy, but doubts remain about the quality, if not the quantity, of the new measures. The LDP list includes Y9,000bn in public spending, Y2,000bn in 'social infrastructure' and Y2,000bn in additional lending to home buyers and small businesses by government-linked financial institutions. 'Social infrastructure' spending is designed to improve the quality of life in line with a past suggestion by Mr Miyazawa that Japan will become a 'lifestyle superpower'. But it is unclear how much of this investment is the front-loading of already planned spending schemes. For example, at least Y1,000bn on the public spending list is for early purchasing of land for public works schemes. A surge in stock prices and the assertion by some prominent Japanese economists that the economy has turned around have complicated the negotiations for the spending package. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, heading the LDP's package committee, had earlier suggested that support for the stock market and assistance for ailing banks would be included. But both these measures are unpopular among ordinary Japanese, as is the proposal to buy land to support property prices; these ideas are seen as the LDP responding to demands by corporate supporters. Most Japanese would prefer that the package contained income tax cuts, which Mr Mitsuzuka said 'may be considered at a later date'. There is also public anger that one of the biggest beneficiaries will be the construction industry, now at the centre of a scandal over illegal donations to the LDP. Prosecutors allege that contractors routinely rig bids for public works projects and give a share of their earnings to LDP officials.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Parliament rebellion starts to fade THE RUSSIAN parliament's struggle against its abolition by President Boris Yeltsin appeared last night to be waning, after a weekend of cold, dark and increasingly hungry isolation behind cordons of riot troops and police. Mr Yeltsin and his government have kept up a momentum of decrees and orders designed to bring rebels in the provinces into line, and to tackle economic problems previously frozen by the gridlock between the presidential and parliamentary powers. The official Tass news agency reported last night that talks had begun between the rebel parliament and representatives of the Interior Ministry and the procurator's office on the handing over of the weapons still held by guards and supporters in the parliament's 'White House'. Tass said General Alexander Rutskoi, former vice president designated acting president by the parliamentary deputies, agreed to the handover on condition that the usual military protocols on handing over weapons were observed. However, last night Gen Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliamentary speaker, remained in the White House, which has had its light and heat shut off, and both continued to express a determination to fight to the end. A forage party of some 500 deputies and supporters left the building early in the evening, saying they were 'looking for food' - amid some speculation from the police who let them out on their intentions to return. Early this morning armed guards patrolling the White House began strengthening barricades amid rumours of an imminent attack. Mr Khasbulatov said he had information that a raid was being prepared, although there was no sign of this among government troops ringing the building. Meanwhile, Mr Valery Zorkin, head of the constitutional court, is shuttling between Gen Rutskoi and Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, a close Yeltsin aide, in an attempt to get a compromise on which the siege could end. Mr Zorkin said he had proposed a 'zero option' - of a return to the status quo before parliament was abolished coupled with early and simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections - and claimed Gen Rutskoi 'is inclined to accept one of these options'. But the weekend saw a blaze of confidence by the president's side, the apex of which was a concert yesterday, attended by Mr Yeltsin and his senior aides, at which the emigre cellist Mr Mstislav Rostropovich conducted a performance of the 1812 Overture in a packed Red Square. The cannons and bells which are part of the overture - rejoicing at Napoleon's retreat from Moscow - were provided by the Kremlin. Mr Yeltsin admits the regional councils are evenly split on support for him. Those few regional administrators who had 'reacted badly' would be fired - Mr Yuri Lodkin, the governor of Bryansk region, already has been. Mr Yeltsin has also adopted a decree holding all officials and serving officers responsible for the carrying out of his decree on constitutional reform, signed last Tuesday - though the decree also forbids the arrest of those demonstrating against him. The government has passed a decree stipulating that the central bank must stop advancing low-interest credits, limiting its lending to loans at the new, 180 per cent per annum interest rate - a rate which is even higher than it appears, because the bank divides the annual rate by 12 to set a monthly rate, then compounds up the monthly rate. A constitutional assembly bringing together representatives of parties, associations, enterprises and unions has started work on a draft constitution and on an election law for a new federal assembly, which Mr Yeltsin has decreed will be elected on December 12. But sentiment is growing for simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections, instead of the six-month gap he has decreed between the federal assembly elections and the June 12 presidential elections. Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, said at the weekend the gap was needed to give stability, especially important in a nuclear state. However, simultaneous elections have centrist and liberal support from a range of prominent figures including Mr Grigor Yavlinsky, the main declared challenger for the presidency, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, Mr Nikolai Fyodorov, the former Russian justice minister, and Mr Nikolai Ryzhkov, the former Soviet prime minister.</p>

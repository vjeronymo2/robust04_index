			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Congress election cash cap proposed PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday proposed limits on congressional election spending and donations from lobbyists, in a reform intended to meet popular disgruntlement over the US campaign financing system. The proposals are a delicate compromise between the requirements of angry reformers keen to curb the influence of lobbyists, and Democratic fundraisers worried about cutting their party's own throat. Mr Clinton is hemmed in by the need to win support from moderate Republicans and the Supreme Court's ruling that political donations are a form of free speech protected by the constitution. The president has fudged some changes sought by the more ardent campaign finance reformers, but his proposals include some significant restrictions on lobbyists, who would be banned from giving money to any legislator they have lobbied in the past year, and on political action committees, which channel money to candidates from companies and interest groups. Mr Clinton's plan would cap spending on elections to the House of Representatives at Dollars 600,000 (Pounds 389,610) with a sliding cap between Dollars 1.25m and Dollars 5.5m, according to population, for Senate campaigns. At least 80 House candidates exceeded these limits last year, topped by Mr Michael Huffington, a California Republican who won his seat by spending a record Dollars 5.4m, mostly from his personal fortune. To entice candidates to abide by these caps, which can only be voluntary if they are to comply with the Supreme Court ruling, they will be offered vouchers to pay for advertising and mailings. Mr Clinton proposes to pay for the public financing by ending the tax deduction for corporate lobbying expenses and by asking taxpayers to earmark part of their tax payment to campaign funds.</p>

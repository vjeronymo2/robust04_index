			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caution urged on Indian cotton exports after harvest setback The Indian textile ministry has urged the federal government not to make any further release of cotton for export because of a setback to this season's crop in the three north Indian states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The resulting fall in expected supplies has triggered a surge in prices. At the beginning of the 1993-94 (September-August) cotton season, when the forecast for the crop was 13.5m bales of 170kg each, the government released an export quota of 500,000 bales. But the Cotton Corporation of India, a government procurement agency, which recently surveyed the crop, now says that total production in the current year is not likely to be more than 13m bales. A pest attack has reduced the standing crop in the north Indian states by an estimated 450,000 bales, according to Mr RK Khattar, president of the Eastern India Textile Mills Association. There has also been some loss in Madhya Pradesh, where the harvest is now expected to yield only 1.15m bales, compared with an earlier projection of 1.2m bales. Mr Khattar said he would not be surprised if India ended up with a crop as low as 12.7m bales. Last year, India produced 13.5m bales and its exports amounted to nearly 1.5m. According to industry officials, the current prices of Punjab J-34, Maharashtra H-4 and Shankar-4, the three benchmark grades of Indian cotton, are 34 per cent to 41 per cent higher compared with the corresponding period of the previous season. While there has been panic buying by the textile mills, EITMA complains that 'merchants have cornered nearly 25 per cent of the crop that has come to market'. It has told the government that 'except for the actual users no one should be allowed to hold stocks of cotton'. As cotton prices are running 35 to 90 per cent higher than the official support prices set for the current season, depending on the grades, the government has advised the CCI to go slow with its purchasing operation. The Indian textile industry which boasts the world's second largest number of operating spindles, at 28m, is expected to consume some 12.5m bales of cotton in the current season, compared with about 12m last year. After making provision for non-mill consumption and the exports that have already been sanctioned, the next cotton season is likely to open with stocks of less than 3m bales, down from 3.3m at the start of this season, according to the textile ministry. The 1994-95 opening stocks will be just about enough to take care of the industry's fibre requirement for the first three months. Though the Indian cotton season begins in September, the crop arrivals do not start gaining momentum until the middle of October. With a firm estimate of the 1993-94 crop not be available till March, any further setbacks will force India to import cotton, industry officials warn.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Pensions can and should be insured Sir, Mr Nunneley, chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers' Association (Letters, April 16) has stated that it is neither sensible nor practicable to insure against the loss of funds in his members' care. Having invested pension fund monies one ought to be able to expect that they are repaid on demand plus or minus investment returns. But this is not the case with all association members. They do not admit liability to return monies lost other than through their own negligence. If Mr Nunneley's members are incapable of guaranteeing the return of funds in their care, then they should insure the risk. With the will it can be arranged; catastrophe insurance provides cover for large sums and the loss of pension monies is no different. He cannot have it both ways; either his members do the job for which they are paid and look after funds entrusted to them, or they obtain insurance cover. But whichever, he should get on with it and stop evading the issue. C H Armitage, 46 Burlington Avenue, Kew, Surrey TW9 4DH</p>

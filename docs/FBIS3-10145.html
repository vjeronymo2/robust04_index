He explained that at a  social gathering high-ranking military officers had uttered  "offensive remarks" about the president of the nation. Saguier  added that according to the information he has, the whole thing  is nothing but a rumor. He made it clear, however, that should  the rumors come true the members of the Legislative Branch will  be prepared to defend the nation's institutional order even if  they do not agree with President Wasmosy.    Deputy Saguier told the journalists that the rumors about a  coup d'etat began after a high-ranking military officer in the  course of a social gathering threatened to arrest President Juan  Carlos Wasmosy.    "At a ceremony to launch a new brand of beer, a drunken  division general apparently said that he could arrest Wasmosy  any time he wanted. The general even threatened to prevent the  president from addressing Congress. A colonel who also attended  the party uttered similar remarks. He stated specifically that  they would take the president by the ear and put him in a cell,"  Saguier explained.    The deputy said that according to his sources, several  businessmen were present on the occasion and they heard what the  military officers said. "The officers did not restrict  themselves to the above remarks but went on commenting  offensively about the president of the nation," Saguier stated.    "Rambo" Sanguier explained that the conflict between the  abovementioned division general and President Wasmosy apparently  cropped up because the two support different candidates to chair  the Colorado Party Executive Board.    In the morning on 28 February Saguier and Chamber of  Deputies  Speaker Francisco Jose de Vargas went on a fact-finding  expedition to see whether the rumors could be confirmed.    Saguier said that they talked with several military officers  and diplomats to find out whether a coup d'etat was actually in  the making.    Saguier added: "We talked to several key embassies and they  told us that they had heard the rumors but had no information  that gave them a clear idea of the situation. The embassies  also told us that they had checked the main military units which  did not appear to be getting ready for action."    Later on the deputy stated that all congressmen are prepared  to defend the nation's institutional order.    "I deeply disagree with the president on several matters but  I will defend the country's institutional order all the same.  You may rest assured of this because yet another rumor  indicated that Congress would surrender to the coupists. We are  totally committed to the Constitution and we will defend it in  spite of General Lino Oviedo or even Wasmosy himself," Saguier  said.</p>

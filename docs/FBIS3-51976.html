Reporter Jose Luis Rumbao  discussed this topic with CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross.    [Begin recording] [Ross] At the moment, the efforts being  made by Cuban workers are the highest expression of patriotism.  We are in the trenches, where we should be, and without  expecting immediate material benefits. To those workers,  especially the women, who get up early in the morning to take  their children to the infant circle by bicycle, then go to work,  to return home later and employ magic in preparing the family's  food -- to those workers we express our deepest recognition.    [Rumbao] The 55th anniversary of the CTC will be marked by  the labor union assemblies known as the workers parliaments: an  example of what the workers democracy can do when united to save  the achievements of the Revolution.    [Ross] This is a great process. In fact, I can say that I am  very satisfied with the assemblies I have attended. So far I  have participated in ten assemblies since the process began. I  believe they have all been the quintessence of what we expected.    [Rumbao] Ross pointed out that more than 3 million workers  and 1 million retired workers have been invited for February and  half of March to participate, with their ideas and actions, in  the solution our parliament will establish during its next  session.</p>

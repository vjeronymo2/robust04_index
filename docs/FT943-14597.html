			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Brussels tries to force the pace on visas The European Commission yesterday produced its proposed format for a European Union visa for non-EU citizens which would come into force from the beginning of 1996. The proposal was discussed at a meeting where the Commission was highly critical of member states' failure to reach agreements on justice and immigration affairs, the 'third pillar' of the Maastricht treaty. Brussels' attempt to introduce a common visa is part of an initiative to allow free movement of people, including third country nationals, in Europe. If its plans are implemented, non-EU citizens will ultimately be able to apply for one visa granting them entry to all countries of the Union. However, this idea has met with considerable opposition from some member states. In particular, the UK government was concerned that citizens from Commonwealth countries who did not require a visa to enter Britain would have their movement restricted under a common EU visa. The introduction of the new European format, a preliminary step in the Commission's initiative, will constitute a change in design only for national visas and will not be effective as a European-wide visa until member states have agreed unanimously on a proposed list of 129 countries whose citizens will require one for entry. When the list was published in November it prompted much controversy. 'An agreement is going to be very hard to achieve,' one British official said. 'The Maastricht treaty demands a common (visa) format. The British will accept the format. It is accepting the common list that will be a problem,' he said. The visa, and the list of nationalities requiring one, follow closely work done by the nine members of the intergovernmental Schengen free travel agreement, which covers all the EU members except Britain, Denmark and Ireland. Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, who led yesterday's debate, is understood to have told his colleagues that 'it is not possible to detect any sign of movement towards seeking, let alone finding, compromise solutions' on a range of initiatives the EU has set itself. These include the Europol organisation to combat organised crime and drugs trafficking within the single market; the external frontiers convention, meant to permit freer movement within Europe by tightening up controls on non-EU nationals at port of entry; and a common customs information system. Last December's EU summit in Brussels gave justice and interior ministers a deadline of this October to finalise the Europol convention.</p>

The policemen "beat and fired high-caliber weapons" at the  Indian leaders, who are members of the Directorate of the  Chinanteco, Mazateco, and Cuicateco Regional Council, a branch  of FIPI, the report added.    The communique continued that two Indians "were injured" by  policemen Ramon Coria, Domingo Vasquez, and Enrique Lara, who is  the commander of the municipal police in Temascal.

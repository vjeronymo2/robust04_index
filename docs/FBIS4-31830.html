			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by LUZ: "Insufficiently Controlled Army"] </F>   [Text]"The system of control over the Polish Army is  far from perfect," admits Piotr Kolodziejczyk, chief of the  National Defense Ministry [MON]. "A civilian minister is just  not enough to be able to say that civilians are in charge of the  Army," adds Jerzy Szmajdzinski, chairman of the Sejm Defense  Commission.    "The system of control over the Armed Forces is far from  perfect and it continues to be at the stage of being  established. This, among others, is what work on the new  constitution is about. We want the system to be established in  accordance with well known examples of armies of Western  countries that have stood the test of time," Defense Minister  Piotr Kolodziejczyk said at the opening in Warsaw of an  international conference devoted to "Civilian and Democratic  Control Over Armed Forces."    According to the MON chief, the basic roles in the system,  are performed -- in the following order of importance -- by: The  president, the prime minister, the government (and a civilian  defense minister within the government), and the Sejm which  adopts the budget and other laws.    Michael Quinlan, former undersecretary of state in the  British Defense Ministry, told the conference participants about  how civilians control the British Army: "The law is the most  important issue," the British guest said. "A soldier is not  allowed to execute an illegal order because he would be brought  to justice. This prevents abuses."    Quinlan added that it is inconceivable in a democratic state  that the Army should want to influence for instance the shape of  the constitution.    General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the Polish Army General  Staff, attended the conference: "We have already done some  things, although it can be concluded from the foreign guests'  papers presented here, that we are still at the beginning of the  road. The important point is, we are heading in the right  direction," Wilecki said.    Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance, chairman  of the Sejm Defense Commission, was more skeptical: "A civilian  minister is just not enough to be able to speak about civilian  control over the Army. First, we must change the awareness of  the officer cadre. The military must be aware that the law is  their supreme boss. And it is not the military, but civilians  that should make basic decisions regarding the Armed Forces,"  Szmajdzinski said.    Conference participants will deliberate through Wednesday,  among others, whether it is better to employ civilian employees  or professional military in MON, and also the issue of "when can  we be sure that the Armed Forces are directed appropriately."</p>

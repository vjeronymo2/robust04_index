			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY  </P> <P> Stephen Walton's views are correct ("Social Security Costs to Workers," letter,  June 6).  </P> <P> I am self-employed, and this year will be 58. My wife will be 60. The lobbyists  for us do a disservice to other working people and taxpayers in petitioning for  more and more benefits for all the elderly, regardless of need.  </P> <P> During retirement I believe we are entitled to repayment of the Social Security  contributions we made and which were made on our behalf plus earnings. No more.  No less. In the event of our deaths prior to becoming eligible, these funds  belong in our estate.  </P> <P> We feel obliged to pay taxes to help less fortunate people who lack individual  Social Security account funds, personal resources, and family support.  </P> <P> Like Walton, I object to paying taxes to help comfortable people be more  comfortable.  </P> <P> Congress should restore and enhance the IRA deduction. Further -- we should not  vote for congressmen and senators who boast: "I never voted against an increase  in Social Security benefits."  </P> <P> GEORGE YOUNKHEERE  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

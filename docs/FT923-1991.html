			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Euro Disney packages to improve group visits EURO DISNEY, which has been clouded by bad publicity since the opening this spring of its Euro Disneyland theme park near Paris, is introducing special packages to try to lift group visits. Since the opening, Euro Disneyland has come under criticism for failing to make proper provision for block bookings, particularly for coach parties. The company yesterday announced a new series of deals for group visits which will include discounts of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent and 4 per cent commission for travel agents. It is offering free entrance to the theme park to coach drivers for a trial period. Euro Disney is anxious to prevent a significant fall in attendance during the seasonally slow autumn and winter months. It has always expected attendance to slacken during this period, but has hoped to counter the expected decline in foreign visitors by encouraging the French (whose attendance has so far been below target) to visit when the park will be quieter. The group packages form part of this initiative. Euro Disney recently announced that a record 94,000 people had visited the park on September 6 and that it had attracted over 6m visitors in its first five months. However, the 6m tally suggests that Euro Disneyland will not meet its initial target of 11m visitors by the end of its first year. Societe des Bains de Mer de Monaco, the Monte Carlo-based hotels and leisure group, saw net profits slip to FFr165.4m (Dollars 30.62m) in the year to March 30 from FFr178.2m in the previous year. Turnover also dipped to FFr1.7bn from FFr1.72bn. The group invested FFr280m during the year, notably on renovating the Monte Carlo Beach Hotel.</p>

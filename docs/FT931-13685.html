			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Truth in mosaic - Susan Moore examines the influence of Tuscany on John Ruskin Fervour and desperation are evident in equal measure at the Accademia Italiana's Ruskin and Tuscany. Looking around the show's rich mixture of Ruskin sketches and watercolour studies, his notebooks and letters, the silvery architectural daguerreotypes, the sepia photographs and the careful watercolours he commissioned from others, we have an acute sense of a bedazzled mind in overdrive. There was not a fragment of masonry, sculpture, fresco - or even plant  - that failed to engage his attention. 'I am perpetually torn to bits by conflicting demands on me,' he wrote to his father in 1845. In Lucca he gloried in 'church fronts charged with heavenly sculpture and inlaid with whole histories in marble', but in such a parlous state of decay that he felt obliged to record them. At the Camposanto in Pisa he found that 'everything architectural is tumbling to pieces, and everything artistical is fading away'. Only rarely was there time to linger beyond the most cursory of drawings. 'Fragments of everything from a Cupola to a Cartwheel,' lamented his father, 'all true - truth itself but Truth in mosaic.' The name of John Ruskin is more frequently associated with Venice, the Alps and the French cathedral towns than with Florence, Lucca, Pisa and Siena. Yet Ruskin was to make seven tours to Tuscany between 1840 and 1882. As the recent research of Jeanne Clegg and Paul Tucker reveals, his understanding of Tuscan art and culture was to play a central role in the development of his thought. For Ruskin, Tuscany was the cradle of modern civilisation, the meeting place of North and South, Greek and Gothic, Christian and infidel. Whether in his writing or in his lectures, he constantly raised the spectre of early Renaissance Tuscany. Giotto's Campanile in Florence was 'the model and mirror of perfect architecture', its carved panels, as he saw it, a testimony to the sacredness of labour. Jacopo della Quercia's tomb of Ilaria del Carretto in the Duomo at Lucca became his ideal of Christian sculpture - a sacred portrait of infinite peace. (His passion for this cool beauty was woven inextricably in his own mind with his devotion to the ill-fated young Rose La Touche, who quite sensibly spurned him.) To illustrate the point that 'Beautiful art can only be produced by people who have beautiful things around them,' he would confect a romantic Pre-Raphaelite vision of medieval Pisa to contrast with the squalor of suburban Rochdale. Tuscany was also a place of revelation. His 1845 trip, for instance, was conceived solely to come to grips with the religious art of the early Italian masters for the second volume of Modern Painters. Struck dumb with admiration and amazement in the Romanesque nave of San Frediano in Lucca, he was inspired 'there and then on an instant' to embark on a life-long study of architecture. The lion's share of the material on display was conceived or purchased for educational purposes. It is a dense show on a complex and maddeningly self-contradictory subject, but show and scholarly catalogue repay close attention. The only pity is that we cannot hear more of Ruskin's eloquent prose. His protege Edward Burne-Jones is represented by a slim offering, a watercolour copy of a fresco in Santa Croce. John Wharlton Bunney, a former pupil, proved more helpful, producing reams of painstaking architectural drawings and watercolours. The American Henry Roderick Newman is revealed to be a master of the art of reproducing porphyry and marble. Ruskin's determination to document the region's rapidly disintegrating heritage never abated, and his last years saw him encouraging others to take up the cause. In 1886, for example, TM Rooke, a salaried copiest for the Guild of St George, was instructed to work 'chiefly on things perishing'. Ruskin made his last Tuscan tour the same year, accompanied by HG Collingwood, a former pupil. at Old haunts were re-visited and further dilapidations deplored. Florence disgusted the ill and weary Ruskin more than ever: 'Everywhere paviours, masons, ruin - degradation - folly and noise and' - a problem only too familiar to any later tourist - 'the wretched Germans, English and Yankees busy upon it like dung-flies.' Ruskin in Tuscany, sponsored by The Guild of St George with support from the Henry Moore Foundation, continues at the Accademia Italiana, London, until February 7. It travels to the Ruskin Gallery, Sheffield, February 20-April 10, and to the Fondazione Ragghianti, Lucca, May 1-June 12</p>

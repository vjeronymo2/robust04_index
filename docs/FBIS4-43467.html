			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] Belgian Defense  Minister Leo Delcroix is in favor of logistical aid only:    [Begin recording] [Delcroix] I do not think it will be a  good  thing for Belgium to participate actively in the field and on  Rwandan territory after the events of the last few months.  However, we would like to examine the possibility of logistical  aid.    [Unidentified correspondent] Does Leo Delcroix exclude an  intervention that would take place outside the UN framework?    [Delcroix] I do not know about outside the UN framework, but  certainly in full agreement with the United Nations. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

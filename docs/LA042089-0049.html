			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY AT THE AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Up Your Alley'  </P> <P> United States, 1989, 93 minutes  </P> <P> 7 p.m.  </P> <P>  Laughs, romance and thrills among the downtown homeless: a sexy newspaper  reporter (Linda Blair) joins forces with a wino ex-comedy writer and an amiable  shopping-cart fatso to track down a trash-heap slasher. Meanwhile, lecherous  L.A. newspaper editors seduce their staff in Jacuzzis. Once in a while, some  humor, life and verve seep though in the otherwise coy street scenes, but  star-producer-writer Murray Langston and writer-director Bob Logan do prove you  can craft a reasonable equivalent for the usual studio-made $15-million fiasco  for only $150,000 -- an achievement in itself. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yusup Soslambekov by Olga Vasilyeva; place </F> and date not given: "Dudayev's Positions Are Stable"]    [Text] Yusup Soslembekov is a former deputy of  Dzhokhar Dudayev on the National Congress of the Chechen Peoples  Executive Committee. During the attempted suppression of the  "Chechen revolution" by force on the part of Moscow, he was  acting defense minister. In December 1992, he switched to  opposition to President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Like many leaders of  the Chechen opposition, he currently lives outside the  republic.    [Vasilyeva] Could you assess the stability of President  Dudayev's positions?    [Soslambekov] Neither the opposition nor Dudayev controls  the  situation throughout the republic. But the situation is similar  in all the new CIS states, and this argument could not, most  likely, serve as a criterion of a leader's stability.    I would assess Dudayev's position in Chechnya as being very  stable. Support for the opposition on the part of society is  greatly exaggerated: Umar Avturkhanov, for example, a leader of  the opposition, does not have unconditional support even in  Nadterechnyy Rayon, where he is mayor. Support for Avturkhanov  by other rayons in opposition to President  Dudayev--Urus-Martanovskiy, Gudermeskiy, Sherinskiy, the rural  Groznenskiy (although it is a long time since this rayon  existed), and Vedenskiy--is altogether out of the question. I am  sure that the idea of the formation of a provisional committee  of opposition rayons was "tossed" to Avturkhanov: Russian  politicians need some trump card for pressure on Dudayev. This  idea will enable Russian leaders to negotiate with an actual  opposition, but the legitimacy of the provisional committee is  greatly in doubt.    Political methods of struggle against the Dudayev regime are  today exhausted, nor is there a force capable of removing it  from power and restoring the constitutional system in Chechnya.  Those who believe that the Chechnya issue may be settled by  force within 24 hours are mistaken. With the modern types of  arms, a conflict cannot be settled by numerical superiority.  Practically all conflicts that we are observing currently in  Bosnia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ossetia, Iraq, or Somalia are  insoluble. There will be no military victory at the current  stage.    [Vasilyeva] Let us, nonetheless, imagine a situation where  Russia has decided to plant a governor general in  Groznyy--Zavgayev or Khasbulatov, for example. What would happen?    [Soslambekov] As far as Khasbulatov is concerned, Russian  politicians would hardly be longing to see him even in Chechnya:  Khasbulatov is a delayed-action mine for Russia. In terms of  scale, Chechnya is one administrative district of Moscow. But  Chechnya in Khasbulatov's hands would signify the destruction of  modern Russia: Khasbulatov could quickly establish interaction  with the leaders of the North Caucasus republics, with the  Cossacks. And this is the south of Russia, which has  historically opposed the center.    As far as Zavgayev is concerned, his imposition by force on  Moscow's part would not signify peace in Chechnya: It is  sufficient to recall how he was removed in the fall of 1991. He  or Avturkhanov would be supported only by Nadterechnyy Rayon.  Besides, the Russian leadership has no interest in the removal  of Dudayev.    [Vasilyeva] Why?    [Soslambekov] There is no one with whom to replace him: it  is  impossible to find a person capable of controlling the situation  in Chechnya and at the same time to abide by the policy of  present-day Russia.</p>

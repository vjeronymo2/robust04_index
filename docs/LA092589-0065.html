			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEW CHANGES IN TV STANDARDS, SAY EXECS;  </P> <P> NETWORKS ADD CENSORS, BUT LAST YEAR'S CONTENT CONTROVERSIES HAVE LITTLE IMPACT  ON NEW SEASON  </P> <P> Last season, executive producer Michael Jacobs worked without much interference  from NBC on his series "My Two Dads," a comedy about a teen-age girl who  acquires two "dads" when her mother dies without being sure which man is the  girl's father.  </P> <P> This season, things are a little different. "My Two Dads" not only has two  dads, but also two network censors with whom the producers now consult on every  script.  </P> <P> Following a TV season that ended in a highly publicized storm of viewer  complaints and advertiser boycotts over sex, violence and profanity in  prime-time shows -- ranging from NBC's titillating "Nightingales" series about  student nurses to Fox's bawdy comedy "Married . . . With Children" to a host of  tabloid shows -- the network entertainment chiefs pledged to be more sensitive  to the audience's tastes this season. NBC bolstered its broadcast standards  department and Fox hired its first person in that capacity.  </P> <P> But as the new TV season enters its second week, the face of prime-time  television does not seem to have undergone dramatic change. Most producers  report that, while the climate may have grown slightly more conservative than  it was last year, it's basically business as usual.  </P> <P> "We certainly haven't had any pressure," said David Jacobs, executive producer  of CBS' "Knots Landing" and "Paradise." He said that networks still rely more  on ratings than on advertiser input in deciding content of shows. "That's what  the networks ultimately look at: performance. As far as I can see, the networks  aren't starving."  </P> <P> Steven Bochco, former executive producer of NBC's "L.A. Law," which caused a  stir last season with an episode that included the word goddamn, said that he  continues to fight the same battles with the network censors as always on his  new ABC series "Doogie Howser, M.D."  </P> <P> "I think there is some backlash; I think they (the networks) are nervous," he  said. "But you know, I have always felt pressed by somebody about something. I  think inevitably television is maturing, it will continue to mature, and that  maturation process will always unnerve some people."  </P> <P> Even Jacobs of "My Two Dads" said that, although NBC censors have greater input  than last season, he believes it has less to do with any new-found morality  than with the fact that the show has moved from its 9:30 time period to 8:30  p.m. "I think it is a more delicate time slot," he said. "Last season, we were  on after 'Night Court,' and 'Night Court' is a very adult show."  </P> <P> And "Married . . . With Children," the focus of a storm of controversy last  season after a Michigan woman wrote to its advertisers to complain, has  returned to its usual irreverence, said co-executive producer Michael Moye.  </P> <P> Moye said that when Terry Rakolta first made headlines by asking advertisers to  boycott the show, there was "a lot of overreaction" at Fox Broadcasting -- but  that the company has since allowed the producers as much creative freedom as  they had last year.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of feverish meetings going on that we had to suffer through,"  he said. "We just had to ride it out. Our show is intrinsically controversial;  there is nothing we could do to really change it without destroying the theme  of the show."  </P> <P> Frank Dungan and Jeff Stein, executive producers of the long-running ABC comedy  "Mr. Belvedere" and the new NBC comedy "Sister Kate," about a nun in charge of  an orphanage, reported that they have had more discussions with NBC than with  ABC -- but that that was to be expected.  </P> <P> "I don't recall either network saying we have to watch it because of this  outside pressure," Dungan said. "You know, with 'Belvedere,' you're talking  about an established show. But with the NBC show, it's new and it's fragile.  You're not only doing a new show, but you're doing a new show about a woman who  is a nun, and it involves children -- you will be put under a microscope."  </P> <P> The "microscope" picked up one objectionable line in "Sister Kate's" first  episode -- and cut it.  </P> <P> In the scene, Sister Kate (Stephanie Beacham), armed with a golf club, breaks  in on one of her teen-age girls on a date with a boy who is trying to force  himself on her. "What are you doing here?" the boy asks. Her original response:  "I'm here to hit some balls."  </P> <P> The producers agreed to replace the line with "I'm here to up your handicap."  Stein said they did so as a favor to the network rather than as a result of  pressure, however. "It's a new show in an 8 o'clock time slot," he said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, despite last season's dissent over lingerie in "Nightingales,"  the same episode of "Sister Kate" did include a scene in which two of the  show's teen-age girls posed in short lace nightgowns around a sleeping older  man for what were described as potential blackmail photos.  </P> <P> "We didn't get a note from the network on that, because it played funny -- not  smarmy," Stein said.  </P> <P> NBC did have concerns about how much flesh would be on display in "Baywatch,"  its new Friday-night drama focusing on the lives of Malibu lifeguards. Grant  Tinker, president of GTG Entertainment, which produces the series, said the  network was worried that the bikini-clad bodies on the beach might conjure up  memories of the lingerie-and-leotard scenes that caused the "Nightingales"  flap.  </P> <P> "NBC made it very clear -- and I hope we didn't need to hear this -- that they  didn't want a T&amp;A show," Tinker said. "They did expect us to exercise good  judgment and good taste in terms of telling the story. They just didn't want a  lot of people oiling their bodies instead of telling a story.  </P> <P> "I think they (the networks) got a little burned last year, and it scared 'em,"  said Tinker, a former chairman of NBC. "Not just because we are all supposed to  be good citizens, but because the advertisers began to grumble and mutter. When  that happens, it can really get to you in a hurry."  </P> <P> ABC's "Living Dolls," about a houseful of teen-age models sharing quarters much  as the "Nightingales" nurses did, seems a prime target for comparison; the  girls even start their day with an aerobics class. So far, however, the  producers of the comedy, which debuts Tuesday, say they have received no  cautionary notes.  </P> <P> "It's possible that several years ago, at the height of ABC's era of 'jiggle  television,' we would be skewing the show a little differently," said  co-executive producer Phyllis Glick. "We have four very attractive girls on the  show. It's possible that we would be costuming them differently, or thinking of  the (camera) angles that would be more exploitative. That's not happening now,  and I think it's not just specifically as a result of 'Nightingales,' but a  result of an evolution of several years of television. I think audiences are  not responding to it anymore."  </P> <P> Steve Downing, an executive producer of ABC's action series "MacGyver," said  that the network does limit the number of gunshots, the number of "hooks to the  head" and -- depending on which advocacy group is in vogue at the time -- the  number of alcoholic drinks poured or cigarettes smoked. He added, however, that  the standards this season are no different from previous seasons.  </P> <P> The content of shows, Downing suggested, will probably continue to be  determined by the best interest of the network rather than by the demands of  advocacy groups. "The bottom line is . . . some producers have enough power  that other people don't tell them what to do," he said. "You'll always see  shows that get away with more outrageous things than other shows, if it's a hot  producer who the big shots at the network don't want to (cross) -- or if they  are particularly interested in seeing a certain show go on the air."  </P></p>

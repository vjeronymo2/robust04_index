			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yegor Gaydar, former Russian prime minister, now </F> a member of the democratic opposition to Boris Yeltsin: "The  Real Fascist Threat in Russia"]    [Text] Did the chaos of 4 October 1993 suffice to open a  period of calm, however precarious, in Russia? And if a crisis  arose, who would benefit from it? In all hypothetical cases, we  find the sinister "brown factor," without which a major  political accident is unlikely, although fascism (hard or soft,  brown or red- brown) would be the death of Russia, a disaster  equal to that of 1917. The events on 3 and 4 October were a  warning. Before that, who could have believed that the legal or  even legalist opposition would hold out its hand to avowed  Nazis, to Barkashov's gangsters (Footnote) (Aleksandr Barkashov,  41 years old, is the leader of the neo-Nazi Russian National  Unity Party, which has a militarized group of party stewards)?  Worse still that it would arm them? And yet that is what  Khazbulatov, Rutskoy, and the Supreme Soviet did. In a time of  crisis, in the name of the government, they thought they could  form an alliance with the Nazis, and adopt their methods. This  is the decisive political lesson of the present time....    This alliance was seen once again on 12 May during the  meeting held by the newspaper ZAVTRA (Tomorrow), the organ of  the "radical" opposition, for the launch of the Accord for  Russia bloc. Rutskoy, Zorkin, and Baburin warmly applauded  Barkashov's opening speech. The passionate support of the fringe  elements was backed up by that of part of the country's  political establishment, leaders of the parliamentary  opposition. On the one side are deputies, chosen by legal  ballot, and on the other are fringe elements and Nazis.... Of  course, the avowed Nazis have little influence and, at first  sight, are the "younger brothers" of the alliance. Seen more  closely, however, they are its driving force. This paradox can  be explained by the ideological poverty of the moderate  nationalists. Despite their statements on "enlightened  patriotism," they have never been able to define this concept  which, all-in-all, is merely a chocolate filled with red-brown  rum. On the other hand, the Nazis do have an ideology. Their  watchwords are criminal and stupid, but clear. All the  nationalist patriots can do is kneel at the polished boots of  the Barkashov militias.    Nazism is a malignant mutation of nationalism. National  egoism is as natural as individual egoism. It only becomes  aggressive if a feeling of frustration and injustice is added to  it. Weimar's Germany is an example of this. The same feeling  of lost empire exists in Russia today.    The fall of Communism created an ideological vacuum which  the  values of the "consumer society" do not fill. They are an  insult to a whole mass of people, like an advertisement for  unobtainable products. It is at this level that nationalism  comes in. The consumerist frustration is "sublimated" in  national frustration, which gives it dignity and turns it into  an ideology, gives it a spiritual dimension. The social and  national frustrations come together producing what is called  national-socialism. Remarks made by ordinary people, such as  "the Caucasians are taking everything," are turned into ideas,  producing "the universal plot against Russia is trying to turn  it into a colony of Western, American, or Zionist capitalism."  Even if racism proper is rare in Russia, this ideology plays on  national and/or social prejudices.    Behind this madness are real problems. As elsewhere, we have  an ethnically structured Mafia (in addition to the Russian Mafia  proper). On the world markets, there is a merciless struggle.  Some circles are openly hostile to Russia and are seeking to  isolate it. There is nothing surprising or horrible about that.    Why has Russian society proved more vulnerable than others  to  the action of the red-brown killer bugs? Have our social  structure and our history predisposed us to totalitarianism?    In Central Europe, the totalitarianism imposed by our tanks  collapsed once our tanks left. In our country, totalitarianism  has been imposed in an endogenic way, produced by our society  and our history. In our past, the aspiration to freedom and the  rejection of freedom were tragically and indissolubly linked.  Bolshevik totalitarianism inherited the autocracy it sought to  destroy and carried it to its extreme logical conclusion. The  Cheka shot the Black Hundreds but it was their spiritual  daughter which surpassed its parents. Another example of the  tragic interweaving of the terms of our historical conflict was  the wartime watchword: "For the Fatherland, for Stalin." This  slogan was developed to become: "For the Fatherland, and for  Stalin which is its executioner." Our tragic history weighs  heavily on the nation's memory and opposes the emergence of a  rational and moderate conservatism. What national values to be  defended could a Russian conservatism include in its program?  Civilian society? The autonomy of the individual in face of  the state? Private property? Yes, all these values exist in  our country, but only in an embryonic state. Thus Russian  conservatism is sliding, by inertia, toward the "cult of  autocracy" and the "policy of the big stick."    And yet, a healthy society must have a strong conservative  pole, because that is the most effective curb to keep  nationalism within reasonable limits. This healthy Russian  nationalism, which would be based on the Russian people's civic  rights and on their inalienable right to private property, does  not yet exist. We intend to build it if social circumstances  permit.    The structure of society is even more important than the  psychological traditions. The totalitarian regime has been  knocked out but is still standing. The economy is still  militarized. The bureaucratic oligarchy still holds the  economic and political power. It persists in its desire to  return to the past.    The ultimate foundation of a society is formed by relations  of ownership and we are still resolving this historical problem  for Russia. The move toward capitalism is now irreversible.  The problem is whether we want a bureaucratic capitalism or a  democratic capitalism. If we opt for the bureaucratic-state  option, we are condemning ourselves to stagnation and Russia  will merely be a semicolonial supplier of raw materials. This  brings us back to the famous "plot against Russia." It is not  the "Masonic lodges" which are hatching it, but our own  bureaucratic elite in the name of its so-called "sense of state"  (but this is a semicolonial state).    The bureaucracy has kept the bulk of the power, particularly  in the provinces. Its only interest is to maintain it. Like  all the rich, bureaucrats are cautious and fear extremes. That  does not prevent them from talking with the Nazis, just in case.    Is it possible that they will opt for the Nazi alliance,  thinking that they are "hiring gangsters to serve them," like  the Weimar Republic on the eve of its fall?    Only an alliance with the most aggressive party of the  bureaucratic bourgeoisie can pave the way to power for the  Nazis. Such an alliance was formed in October 1993 with Rutskoy,  Khazbulatov, and other members of the former Supreme Soviet.  Let us now imagine a mutation on a bigger scale, and we will  see the scale of the resulting political disaster.    Fascism in Russia is only possible in the form of a  dictatorship exercised by the most aggressive sections of the  parasitic "bureaucratic bourgeoisie." The alliance between this  bourgeoisie and the Nazis is the main danger which we have to  combat. Compared with the fashionable hopes in an "enlightened  authoritarianism," my position is clear: There can only be a  "good dictatorship" for those who would live happily even with a  bad one.    We must counter the possible alliance of the bureaucrats and  Nazis with our own alliance of democrats and the liberal  bourgeoisie, while neutralizing the most influential sectors of  the bureaucracy and, consequently, safeguarding their interests.    Of course, our interests are opposed to those of the  bureaucracy: We are in favor of developing the market economy,  eliminating the control of the bureaucratic oligarchy over the  economy. But, out of principle, we are opposed to a fight to  the death. We only envisage such a struggle as necessary and  inevitable against the Nazis, and we only mean the term "death"  in the political sense. Faced with the bureaucracy and the  bourgeoisie linked to it, we are still ready to seek a  compromise and pursue our policy so as never to force them into  a corner. The essential thing is to avoid an alliance within  which, for the bureaucracy, the Nazis are seen as the "lesser  evil."    The whole of Russian history shows that, for a coup d'etat  to  be possible, a situation of dual power is necessary, as was the  case in 1917, in August 1991, and in October 1993. The  democratic forces must therefore ensure that they never allow  such a situation to arise again.    We show our support for Russia's national interests by  seeking to ensure that every Russian citizen can have a normal  and dignified life, whereas the "nationalists" gauge their  patriotism by the yardstick of their hatred of non-Russians, or  even with the help of the compasses used to measure the  thickness of non-Aryan skulls. We have more of a sense of the  fatherland and state than they do and we express this by  trusting the people and telling them the truth.    Our dignity lies in our reason. And it is in the light of  reason that specters vanish, including the specter of Nazism  which is trying to terrorize our fatherland.</p>

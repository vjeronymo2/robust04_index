			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Renewed fighting between Papua New Guinea Government  troops and Bougainville Revolutionary Army troops has led to the  imposition of a curfew in parts of northern Bougainville. North  Solomons Province Administrator Sam Tulo says the curfew comes  following the murder of a police officer last week and an  incident during which two rebels were shot dead. Mr. Tulo says  all the attacks took place in northern Bougainville where rebels  have stepped up action, particularly around the Wakunai  government station. He says the situation is also tense in  central Bougainville, where clashes between rebels and  government troops have resulted in the death of one man and the  wounding of four others.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Stream of cuts erodes help for disabled Last year Remploy drew Pounds 13m from Ministry of Defence contracts as a result of the priority suppliers scheme. The orders were to provide military clothing and chemical protection suits But earlier this month the government decided to scrap the scheme to comply with a strict interpretation of a European directive. Mr Tony Withey, chief executive of Remploy, said: 'We knew that the withdrawal of the scheme would make life difficult for us.' It is the company's textile division, which gets 65 per cent of its business from the MoD, that could be hardest hit. Remploy was set up in 1946 to provide work for the war-wounded and has maintained a commitment to employing a large percentage of disabled workers. The company employs 8,736 disabled workers - about 99 per cent of its shopfloor employees - in 95 factories across Britain, providing manufacturing services in furniture, packaging, textiles, healthcare, bookbinding and printing. In the past Remploy has been able to rely on a steady stream of work from government departments. But the loss of the priority supplier scheme is only one of a number of government cuts that have affected its business. Last year the government lowered a subsidy intended to cover the costs of employing disabled workers, although Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, has said this subsidy should help Remploy maintain a competitive edge after the disappearance of the priority scheme. The company is also suffering from the government's competitive tendering policy. Last year it lost about Pounds 5m in government contracts with the Employment Service and the National Health Service. Mr Withey said that the shift from centralised buying gave his workforce unique problems. When government contracts were offered centrally, workers could be taught skills particular to one large bid. But many of the company's severely disabled workers were unable to cope with the wide range of product specifications in a decentralised market. The company has 10,400 employees. Although its disabled staff represent about 85 per cent of its workforce, they command only about 75 per cent of Remploy's payroll costs. Remploy is in dispute with its unions over a recent pay offer, which has prompted the GMB general union, the largest of the company's six-union consortium, to hold a strike ballot. The company is offering a 2.5 per cent pay rise and the only condition is that the unions co-operate with management on absence monitoring.</p>

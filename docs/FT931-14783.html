			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Senators give new cabinet easy ride IF President-elect Bill Clinton is having trouble filling the jobs in his administration, the blame cannot be laid at the door of the Senate, which has so far offered a smooth ride to his cabinet nominees in their confirmation hearings. A few have faced mild interrogation on past peccadilloes - Ms Zoe Baird, designated to be Attorney General, has become a symbol of a generation of yuppies for hiring an illegal alien as a nanny - but on policy issues, the Republicans have so far not lived up to their threats of stiff scrutiny. Beside Mr Warren Christopher, who as Secretary of State-designate underwent two days of intellectual duelling with Senator Jesse Helms, the senior Republican on the foreign relations committee, only Ms Donna Shalala has encountered anything resembling tough questioning - and that has come mostly from the Democrats. In hearings this week Ms Shalala, who has been chosen to head the Department of Health and Human Services, was criticised for focusing her statement almost entirely on health care reform, largely ignoring welfare reform, which has been a central concern for some Democrats. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, said he was distressed by 'the clatter of campaign promises being tossed out the window,' and Senator Jay Rockefeller, another Democrat who has taken the lead on health and social issues, said he heard rumours that, for strategic and political reasons, 'welfare reform is going to be put on a back burner.' But the Senate can certainly not be accused of holding Mr Clinton up in the task of building his administration. Many committees have already voted for confirmation of the cabinet members who have come before them, even though Mr Clinton cannot actually nominate them until he is inaugurated next Wednesday. Most cabinet secretaries are expected to be formally confirmed on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

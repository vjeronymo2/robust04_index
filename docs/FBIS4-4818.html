			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held in  Maputo on March 21 to form the Mozambican Preparatory Committee  for celebrating the 15th of April.    Minister of interior Manuel Jose Antonio was elected  chairman  of the committee.    He said in his speech:    The birthday of Comrade President Kim Il-song, the Great  Leader, is a great common fete day of mankind.    The great president founded the chuche idea and has  wonderfully built Korean-style socialism by applying it.    He has turned Korea into a socialist paradise where the  entire people are evenly well off.    It is a great honor and joy for us to significantly  celebrate  the birthday of this great man.    It is our first and foremost duty to defend the socialism of  Korea and support its cause of reunification.    We will discharge the duty of the preparatory committee by  more significantly celebrating the birthday of Comrade President  Kim Il- song.    April 1 to 20 was set as a period of celebrations at the  meeting.</p>

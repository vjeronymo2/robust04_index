			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Belgium hints at early start to privatisation BELGIUM could launch its ambitious privatisation programme before the end of this year, according to Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister. The committee of four 'wise men' appointed to examine privatisation prospects will submit its preliminary proposals for a first wave of sell-offs to Mr Maystadt today or tomorrow. The confidential list will consist mainly of financial institutions, such as savings banks and credit institutions. A stake in one of those companies could be advertised for sale before Christmas to test the water for further privatisation. The government wants to raise BFr60bn (Pounds 1.18bn) over four years, with a target of BFr25bn for 1993, to help bring its budget deficit in line with the Maastricht criteria for European monetary union. Individual privatisation proposals will need cabinet approval and could require a parliamentary vote. However, Mr Maystadt said he was convinced that ideological differences between socialist and Christian Democrat coalition partners would evaporate once 'concrete proposals' were on the table. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Flemish Christian Democrat prime minister, set the debate in motion two weeks ago when he said the state should put no restrictions on the assets to be sold, the identity of the buyer, or the proportion of state companies to be privatised. The deputy prime minister, Mr Guy Coeme, a French-speaking socialist, hit back by arguing that Mr Dehaene's position did not reflect the government's. Mr Maystadt, of the francophone Social Christian Party, said 'golden shares' - allowing the government to retain control of the company - were not ruled out for sensitive sectors, such as energy.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING-EDGE WAYS TO KEEP UTENSILS IN SHARPEST CONDITION;  </P> <P> MAINTENANCE: TO GET THE BEST SERVICE FROM KNIVES AND SCISSORS, THEY MUST BE  TREATED WITH CARE.  </P> <P> Because most basic cooking involves a good deal of cutting and chopping, good  knives are a must in the kitchen. Sharp scissors -- in the kitchen and around  the house -- are another necessity.  </P> <P> To get the best service from knives and scissors, treat them with care and keep  them sharp. Here's how:  </P> <P> Knives:  </P> <P> Use a knife only on a cutting board.  </P> <P> Don't stir hot food with knives, since heat can damage them.  </P> <P> Wash knives by hand right after using them and dry them thoroughly.  </P> <P> Don't soak knives in water, since water can damage and loosen wooden handles.  </P> <P> Store knives in a wooden knife block or with blades up on a wall-mounted  magnetic rack. If you must store them in a drawer, use a divider or a knife  rack to keep the blades from bumping against and nicking one another.  </P> <P> Knives with serrated edges depend on notches for their cutting ability. They  should be sharpened by professionals or not at all.  </P> <P> Before each use, sharpen non-serrated knives with a chef's steel:  </P> <P> 1. Grasp the steel in your left hand (if you're right-handed) and the knife in  your right.  </P> <P> 2. Place the heel of the blade against the steel's tip, with the sharp edge of  the blade meeting the steel at a 15- to 20-degree angle.  </P> <P> 3. Applying light pressure, quickly draw the knife toward you and to the right  so that the entire blade passes over the steel.  </P> <P> 4. Repeat the action with the blade beneath and at the same angle to the steel.  Alternate strokes until each side of the blade has passed over (or under) the  steel 10 to 20 times.  </P> <P> To restore a badly dulled blade, use a whetstone (available at hardware stores)  with coarse and fine sides. Before using it, saturate the stone with light  mineral or vegetable oil. (Some stones must soak overnight; check package  directions):  </P> <P> 1. With the stone coarse-side up and placed lengthwise in front of you, put the  heel of the blade on the stone so that its sharp edge is at a 15- to 20-degree  angle to the stone. Maintain this angle throughout the procedure. Applying  pressure, draw the blade in an arc toward you and across the stone so that the  entire length of the blade is sharpened.  </P> <P> 2. Flip the blade and reverse the stroke. Repeat 10 times on each side.  </P> <P> 3. Continue with a few light strokes over the fine side of the stone. Finish  with a few strokes on the chef's steel. Wipe the whetstone clean and wrap it in  a soft cloth for storage.  </P> <P> Scissors:  </P> <P> Sharpen scissors only if they are very dull. Frequent sharpening whittles away  too much metal, causing the blade to cut poorly. Leave removal of deep nicks to  a professional knife grinder. Before sharpening, tighten the pivot screw  holding the blades together. If the pivot is a rivet, place the rivet head on a  solid metal surface and firmly hit the other end with the ball end of a  ball-peen hammer. If tightening the pivot improves cutting, there is no need to  sharpen.  </P> <P> 1. Oil the coarse side of a whetstone as the manufacturer suggests.  </P> <P> 2. Open the scissors wide and, firmly holding one blade and handle, place the  other blade on the fine side of the stone with the inner face vertical. Tilt  the blade slightly, about 10 degrees, so that the cutting bevel is flat against  the stone. Repeatedly move the blade diagonally across the stone toward you  until you have the desired edge. Repeat on the other blade. It's not necessary  to hone scissors' blades totally smooth. Scissors cut by breaking -- rather  than slicing -- fibers.  </P> <P> 3. Wipe both blades clean with a soft cloth. Open and close the scissors  several times to remove the accumulated metal that results from sharpening.  </P></p>

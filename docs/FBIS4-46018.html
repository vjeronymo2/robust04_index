			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that  Pakistan is ready to consider any proposal, which is aimed at  verifying without interference, that its nuclear program is not  weapons-oriented. Talking to newsmen at the Foreign Office in  Islamabad yesterday, he said that Pakistan has repeatedly made  it clear that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and  the United States has accepted the Pakistani position. He said  that Pakistan will not relinquish its principled stand on the  nuclear issue, but is ready to consider any proposal aimed at  nonintrusive verification.    The foreign minister said that although Pakistan does have  the capability to manufacture a nuclear weapon, a political  decision has been taken that it will not be manufactured. He  said the decision has nothing to do with the United States or  anyone else.    Answering a question, the foreign minister said that  Pakistan  is not engaged in any secret diplomacy with the United States  and it will not compromise on the nuclear issue. He regretted  that India rejected every aspect of the U.S. proposal on making  South Asia a nuclear-free zone.</p>

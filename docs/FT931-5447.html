			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: News Corp to launch USDollars 450m convertible NEWS Corporation, the Australian-based international media group, yesterday announced yet another capital raising, causing a slide in the company's share price on Australian stock exchanges. News said a subsidiary would shortly be raising between USDollars 450m and USDollars 500m through the issue of zero-coupon convertible bonds due in 2013. The directors said the bonds would be exchangeable for ordinary News shares at a 20 per cent premium to ordinary share market value at the date of issue. The exchange mechanism could lead to a dilution in the interest of about 34 per cent held in the company by family and associates of Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive. News shares closed at ADollars 7.30 in Australia yesterday after opening at ADollars 7.40. The issue would bring equity and debt raisings by News in the past half-year to around ADollars 3bn. The funds raised are earmarked to repay debt. Merrill Lynch is placement agent for the securities, known as liquid yield option notes (Lyons), which are to be issued through an exempt offering and private placement.</p>

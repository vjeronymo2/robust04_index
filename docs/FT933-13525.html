			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (4): Some signs of improvement - United States A HEADY stock market and a heap of economic uncertainties have kept the lid on merger and acquisition activity in the US. There are some signs that business is stirring, but it is a patchy trend, made up of industrially-driven deals and much reshuffling of corporate assets. The overall figures tell part of the story. According to Merril Lynch Business Brokerage and Valuation (figures are calculated on a more limited basis than the accompanying table by Securities Data), 2,578 M &amp; A transactions were announced in 1992 and the total value of these proposed deals reached Dollars 97.1bn. That was a significant improvement on the 1991 tally: the number of deals was up by 39 per cent, while the aggregate value of the transactions increased by 35 per cent. But, while the deal volume figure hit its highest level for six years, the value of the proposed transactions was also the second lowest in nine years. This can be explained very simply. Last year saw an appreciable rise in smaller deals, but very little evidence that either the blockbuster mega-bid or the hostile takeover - the combination which provided such rich fees for investment banks in the 1980s - is returning. There were just 18 deals worth Dollars 1bn or more announced last year. Since the start of 1993, the trend has been more ambiguous. For fee-hungry bankers, the year did not start well. Again on Merrill Lynch's data, the total value of proposed mergers and acquisitions in the first three months fell by more than one-fifth from the equivalent 1992 figure, to Dollars 18.1bn. The volume of transactions, however, was down by a less painful 2 per cent at 569. But this pattern changed significantly in the second quarter, when a handful of mega deals - worth Dollars 1bn or more - were unleashed. As a result, Securities Data, the New Jersey-based financial information group, estimates that the value of domestic mergers showed a 25.6 per cent increase between the first halves of 1992 and 1993. The number and value of deals announced in May 'were the highest for a single month since July 1990', it reports. Included in this wave of transactions was a Dollars 4.3bn tie-up between British Telecom and MCI; a Dollars 3bn-plus merger of Galen Health Care and Columbia Hospital Corporation; the Dollars 2.5bn joint venture arrangement between Time Warner and US West; the Dollars 2.4bn merger of AMAX with Cypress Minerals; and a Dollars 2bn merger between Price Company and Costco, two warehouse club retailers. Is this surge in 'big deals' a flash in the pan? Bankers, who have every reason to talk their book, say no. They point to a handful of broad economic trends, plus a number of specific sectoral developments which - by their reckoning - should ensure that the transactions continue to flow. The first is the impact of very low inflation - or even falling prices  - in many industries, and stagnant demand. This has forced companies to focus on cost-cutting and streamlining their operations. So a spate of divestments has been triggered. Moreover, because of the heady stock market levels, 'demergers' or public offerings have become an increasing popular option, rather than more conventional trade sales. According to Securities Data, almost 30 spin-offs - either in the form of a distribution of stock to existing shareholders in the parent company or via a flotation of shares in the subsidiary - were announced in the first 24 weeks of the year. The 'demerger' movement has had the odd setback, however. A plan by Marriott Corporation, to spin off its hotel management business, leaving the ongoing company to hold the property assets and the bulk of the group's debts, created a storm of protest among bondholders. The proposal was fine-tuned and some peace bought, although litigation continues. But, even if the proposal is eventually implemented, some advisers suggest that the Marriott fiasco may act as a warning to other companies. 'I think everyone will now consider the demerger option very carefully,' says one banker. Meanwhile, a 'targeted stock' scheme proposed by RJR Nabisco - which would have involved listing shares pegged to the food division, but creating no legal separation from the group's tobacco interests - was finally aborted, amid criticism that the plan was too clever by half. Financial engineering, it seems, is still firmly out of fashion. It is also no coincidence that the sectors where M &amp; A activity has been most pronounced are those where technological, political or regulatory changes are under way. Perhaps the best example is in the communications field, where what was once a battleground between cable and telephone companies is evolving into a more complex network of joint ventures and alliances. Medical services are another area where the deal flow is expected to continue, if not increase. 'Whatever comes out of the Clinton healthcare reform package, you're going to see activity in the hospitals and clinical services,' says Ali Wambold, a general partner of Lazard Freres in New York. Meanwhile, the cross-border deal flows are spasmodic. With recession hitting Europe somewhat later than the US, there has been a marked lack of interest on the part of Continental European acquirers. Stock market levels in the US are also at historically high levels, and thus a deterrent to buyers. That said, the recent emphasis on cost-cutting and efficiency in the US, plus the nation's improving economic prospects, have made the US corporate sector inherently more attractive. There has been interest from UK purchasers, for example, with the likes of RTZ, Hanson, Bowater and British Telecom all tying up deals in recent months. Meanwhile, many US companies find themselves confronting a fairly mature domestic market and some burgeoning opportunities overseas. This has encouraged an increasing 'internationalism' but the sums involved in the melange of joint ventures, co-operative deals and outright acquisitions are often modest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     GLOBAL MAJORITY ACQUISITIONS*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                     Value (Dollars m)   Mkt share   No of deals  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldman Sachs                   54,381.1          16.1         175 First Boston/CSFB/CS            33,633.9          10.0         184 SG Warburg Group              33,099.0           9.8          68 Morgan Stanley                  23,126.1           6.9         102 Lehman Brothers                 19,672.2           5.8          97 Lazard Houses                   19,371.2           5.7          77 Merrill Lynch                   15,342.1           4.6          89 Samuel Montagu/J.

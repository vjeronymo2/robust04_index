That is why Russia's  Western partners, such as European Union members, refuse to  support Moscow's call for suspending and subsequently lifting  sanctions against Yugoslavia, a high-ranking official from the  Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax.    Russia works on the assumption, he said, that after the  signing of an agreement on settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina  sanctions should be suspended and gradually lifted as the  agreement begins to be implemented. "Unfortunately, such an  agreement failed to be signed at the Geneva round of talks  attended by spokesmen for all the warring sides -- Serbs,  Muslims and Croats -- and by the foreign ministers of European  Community countries. The reason for this was the dispute over  territories between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims," the diplomat  said.    As a result Bosnian Serbs are losing in tactical terms.  Western analysts see in their actions, not without grounds,  elements of the plan to form "Greater Serbia," that is join the  Serb-populated areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina to Yugoslavia."    According to Interfax's interviewee, a clear stand taken by  Belgrade could put an end to fears felt by the West and draw the  lifting of sanctions nearer. "It's obvious that the pressure  Belgrade could exert on Bosnian Serbs with a view to signing a  peace agreement as soon as possible would draw nearer not only  an end to the bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the  lifting of sanctions against Belgrade and Yugoslavia's return to  the world community," he said.</p>

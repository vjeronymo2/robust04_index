			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Exceptional gains lift Belgian retailer as sales growth slows UNDERLYING profits at Delhaize 'Le Lion', Belgium's largest retail group, slipped in 1992, and sales growth slowed. However, the group announced a 46 per cent rise in net consolidated profits, because of exceptional gains on the disposal of Treasury stock and the sale of its Pingo Doce supermarkets in Portugal. The company, which forecast a sharp increase in profits in January, reported net consolidated profits of BFr6.38bn (Dollars 189.3m), against BFr4.37bn in 1991. Stripping out the exceptional gains, net profits emerged at BFr3.86bn. The directors are recommending a net dividend of BFr20 per share, against BFr17.4 in 1991, and an additional BFr6.6 a share to celebrate the group's 125th anniversary. Overall sales rose by 5.3 per cent to BFr327bn from BFr310bn, in spite of a 7 per cent fall in the value of the dollar. Turnover was dominated by the Belgian stores which increased sales by 6.3 per cent to BFr91.1bn. In the US, the group blamed a sluggish economy and last year's alleged attempts to 'smear' the reputation of the Food Lion stores for a 13.2 per cent fall in net profits after depreciation. Sales increased by 11.8 per cent to Dollars 7.2bn, but net profits dropped to Dollars 178m from Dollars 205m. Despite the US difficulties, Food Lion increased its chain from 881 stores to 1,012 and intends to open up to 110 supermarkets this year. Sales slowed at Super Discount Markets based in Atlanta, but it returned to the black with net profits of Dollars 600,000. Delhaize said its Czech subsidiary, which operates seven stores in Prague, earned a small profit, while its Greek operation increased operating profit.</p>

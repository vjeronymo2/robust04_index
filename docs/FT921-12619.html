			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Base metals point way to recovery METAL MARKET watchers are becoming increasingly, though still cautiously, optimistic that they may be seeing the early signs of economic recovery. 'Metal prices can broadly be used as barometers of the overall health of the resource sector,' says Mr Nick Moore, analysts at Ord Minnett Research, in his latest weekly metal market report. 'What we find time and again is that two metals in particular, aluminium and nickel, outperform the other metals in terms of price and consumption growth in the early stages of an economic recovery. This reflects their use in consumer durables (relatively low cost white goods for example).' At the London Metal Exchange this week both these metals continued the price recoveries that started before Christmas. Cash aluminium closed yesterday at Dollars 1,249.50 a tonne, up Dollars 61.50 on the week and Dollars 123 since the turn of year, while cash nickel was at Dollars 7,865 a tonne, up Dollars 155 and Dollars 690 respectively. 'The real acid test of any recovery is of course how well a market absorbs profit taking,' says Mr Moore. 'This week both our star metals have been tested by selling and have not only shrugged it off but have continued to fresh heights.' Aluminium's performance has been all the more remarkable because it has been accompanied by a continuing rise in LME warehouse stocks, which started the year already at an unprecedented level. However, a slowing in the pace of arrivals at the exchange's registered warehouses - this week saw a stocks rise of 9,475 tonnes to 1,045,850 tonnes - was cited by some traders as a factor in the market's strength. There was also talk of Russian shipment delays because of increased export tax bureaucracy. Nickel's recent price rise has also taken place in defiance of a continued build-up in LME stocks - this week's 1,704-tonne increase took the total to 16,524 tonnes, the highest level since September 1984, and extended the rise on the year so far to 4,352 tonnes. But there appears to have been a profound change in sentiment in the nickel market, which fell by more than Dollars 2,500 a tonne during the second half of 1991. Waves of investment fund buying, encouraged by bullish chart patterns, had been overwhelming sporadic bursts of profit taking, at least until yesterday, when the three months delivery price's move above Dollars 8,000 a tonne was met by sterner resistance. A degree of caution has been encouraged, moreover, by fears of a German steel workers' strike - the results of the ballot are expected next Friday - which would reduce demand from nickel's key end-use sector. Most other LME metal markets saw modest gains pared or eliminated yesterday. The biggest movement was in zinc, the cash price of which finished Dollars 21.50 up on the week at Dollars 1,182.50 a tonne, after falling by Dollars 11.50 yesterday. Dealers explained that there were fears that recent chart-based buying might lead to the development of an overbought market and also noted the bearish influence of a further 2,150-tonne stocks rise announced yesterday. Lead was the only base metal to remain depressed throughout the week, the cash price ending Pounds 5.50 down at Pounds 282 a tonne. But most of that fall reflected sterling's strength against the US dollar. At the London bullion market the gold price was pushed through resistance at Dollars 358 a troy ounce on Monday by European buying. But the buying quickly dried up and by yesterday's close the price was Dollars 354.65 a tonne, down Dollars 1.70 on the week. Dealers said a Dollars 1.40 fall yesterday was prompted by South American central bank selling. The silver market had another lively week, the spot price dipping to 419 cents an ounce at one point on Monday before recovering on US investment fund buying. Then on Thursday US selling undermined the market again and in London yesterday the spot price closed at 417 cents an ounce, down 13 cents on balance. At the London Futures and Options Exchange cocoa prices were depressed by sterling's strength and the May position ended Pounds 13 down on the week at Pounds 759 a tonne. However, a market report by Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house owned by ED &amp; F. Man, forecast that several years of world production deficits - following seven years of surplus - would result in an upward trend in cocoa prices through to the mid 1990s.  --------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  --------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +2,475 to 1,045,850 Copper     -2,425 to   315,675 Lead         +600 to   127,525 Nickel     +1,272 to    16,524 Zinc       +2,150 to   162,575 Tin          -100 to    13,910  ---------------------------------</p>

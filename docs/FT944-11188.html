			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Brussels balks at German TV venture The European Commission is understood to have serious reservations about a planned joint venture by two big German media groups and the state telephone monopoly. The proposed venture between Bertelsmann, the world's second largest media group, Kirchgruppe, one of Germany's biggest private television companies, and Deutsche Telekom has been under investigation by the Commission since July, following fears that it could create a dominant position in the German market for pay television services. The companies intend to set up a company, to be known as MSG Media Service, to provide infrastructure, marketing and booking services for commercial pay-TV, including such services as video-on-demand, home banking and interactive television. Suspicions that the deal contains anti-competitive elements have emerged following a far-reaching probe by Brussels and an intense lobbying campaign by the main participants. The Commission has not yet taken a decision to block the deal, but pressure is mounting on Bertelsmann, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom to make adjustments to the joint venture. 'The companies' proposal is unacceptable,' a Brussels official said. 'They know it and (competition commissioner Karel) Van Miert told them again today.' The deal is likely to be blocked at the Commission's meeting tomorrow unless the companies came up with the necessary changes to meet competition rules. Mr Van Miert yesterday met representatives of the companies concerned, the official said. The Commission is expected to announce its decision over the next two weeks. The joint venture plans to manage and distribute new television channels, as well as other specialist telecommunications services on Telekom's network. The company would distribute new pay-TV programmes, shopping-TV and other services to 14.9m households which already have access to the cable network. Telekom has laid the network for a further 6m. The three partners are estimated to have invested around DM200m (Pounds 82m) and are planning to develop their own decoding system which would offer viewers a single billing system, charging them for what they watch. Bertelsmann and Kirch are normally fierce rivals but both are already shareholders in Premiere pay-TV. In July, when the Commission announced it would undertake a full investigation, it said it was concerned that the pay-TV market would expand rapidly with the introduction of digital broadcasting in Germany over the next few years. A very large number of households already receive cable or satellite television. Brussels is particularly uneasy that by dominating the pay-TV infrastructure at an early stage, the joint venture would control standards for any newcomers.</p>

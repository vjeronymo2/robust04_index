			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Long-term debt ratings at Ontario downgraded by S&amp;P Standard &amp; Poor's surprised the market yesterday when it cut the long-term debt ratings of the province of Ontario and Ontario Hydro to double-A minus from double-A. Yield spreads on Eurobonds issued by Ontario had tightened over the last week in the hope that S&amp;P would not cut the province's rating, which had been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications on October 4. S&amp;P said the downgrade reflected the weakened resolve of the Ontario government to take unpopular expenditure adjustments in order to meet its deficit targets in 1993-94 in the face of unexpected revenue deterioration. The move reflected S&amp;P's view that deficit targets for succeeding years outlined in the province's medium-term plan would be missed. S&amp;P removed Ontario's rating from CreditWatch yesterday and said that the rating outlook was stable. Yield spreads on Ontario's Eurobonds widened by a couple of basis points after the news broke. However, traders said that the news had removed the uncertainty which had been hanging over the market. S&amp;P's move allows Ontario to break its self-imposed exile from the Eurobond market. Syndicate managers expect the province to launch a long-dated Eurodollar offering in the near future. There was speculation that Ontario might consider a Eurobond offering in the D-Mark sector now that international sanctions against South Africa had been lifted. Canadian issuers shunned the D-Mark sector while the sanctions were in force because of the German banks' links with South Africa. Elsewhere, Henderson Land, the Hong Kong property developer, raised Dollars 300m through a widely-expected offering of five-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which were priced to yield 95 basis points over US Treasuries, had a mixed reception. Some syndicate managers said the bonds looked expensive when compared with the borrower's offering of three-year convertible Eurobonds. If Henderson Land does not proceed with the public sale of shares in Henderson China within three years, the bonds will yield 6.6 per cent to maturity. This represents a yield spread over US Treasuries of about 260 basis points. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds were priced in line with yield spreads on bonds issued by Hong Kong corporate borrowers. Goldman said a good portion of the bonds had been sold yesterday, with about 65 per cent being placed in Asia Pacific. The bonds remained in syndicate overnight. Sociedad Comercial del Plata of Argentina plans to launch a Dollars 100m, five-year Eurobond issue on Monday with a spread of between 340 and 380 basis points over US Treasuries, lead manager Paribas said yesterday. The launch depends on gaining the expected permission from the Argentine securities commission. The company - a conglomerate mainly involved in public services, energy and construction - aims to use the issue to pay off short-term debt incurred during its purchases of stakes in Argentine utilities during the privatisation process.</p>

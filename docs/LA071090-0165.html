Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MCMAHON SIGNS 1-YEAR DEAL AS EAGLES' BACKUP QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> Jim McMahon agreed to a one-year deal today with the Philadelphia Eagles, who  expect to use him as a backup to starting quarterback Randall Cunningham.  </P> <P> Coach Buddy Ryan said McMahon understands the Eagles' plans for him.  </P> <P> "We have no problem. He was interested, he wanted to be an Eagle," Ryan said at  a news conference.  </P> <P> Terms were not disclosed.  </P> <P> The deal reunites the quarterback and defensive coordinator from the 1986 Super  Bowl champion Chicago Bears.

He became a free agent after the season.  </P> <P> McMahon's agent, Steve Zucker, said his client was ready to play second string  to Cunningham.  </P> <P> Zucker wouldn't say whether McMahon was taking a big cut in salary to join the  Eagles.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Togolese Union for Democracy in </F> Lome on 14 March]    [Text] On behalf of the Executive Committee of the Togolese  Union for Democracy [UTD], I acknowledge the publication of the  results by the Supreme Court. Despite obstacles of all kinds  put in the way of the party during the election campaign, it has  been officially recognized as a buffer group in the new National  Assembly. Conscious of its uniqueness and placing itself  resolutely above the fray, the UTD intends to strive as hard as  possible to help achieve national reconciliation and economic  recovery which are today the major priorities of the Togolese  society.    [Signed] Edem Kodjo, UTD chairman for the Executive  Committee.</p>

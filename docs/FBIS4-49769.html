			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "MOFTEC Official Says United States Obstructs </F> China's Entry to GATT"]    [Text] Yi Xiaozhun, director of the Department of  International Economic and Trade Relations under the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], said that China  proposed at the working session on China's entry to the GATT  that the establishment of the World Trade Organization [WTO] (on  1 January 1995) should be set as a date for talks on China's  entry to GATT. However, this proposal was rejected by the  United States using the excuse that the time was not ripe. Yi  said that this move by the United States blocked China's entry  to the GATT.    In an interview with HSIN PAO, Yi Xiaozhun said that during  the past two round of talks, that is, the fifth and sixth  working sessions on China's entry to GATT, other GATT members,  including the EU countries, backed China's efforts to accelerate  the pace of the talks. At these sessions, the Chinese  representative proposed that the establishment of the WTO should  be set as the date for talks on China's entry to GATT to avoid  the talks from dragging on. However, the U.S. representative  said that this proposal was unacceptable.    The WTO is scheduled to be established on 1 January 1995 or  earlier. If the original timetable is followed, China has only  six months to strive for GATT entry. According to Yi Xiaozhun,  because of domestic legislation, some of the founders of the WTO  say that it is unlikely that they can complete the relevant  legislation before 1 January 1995. Hence, they may ask for a  postponement of the organization's establishment. Most members  have suggested that the date of inauguration should be postponed  to 1 July. If that is the case, China will have sufficient time  for the talks.    As GATT is to be replaced by the WTO and abolished after the  founding of the new organization, what happens if China cannot  complete negotiations on entering GATT when the WTO is founded?  Would this mean that China had to start preparations and talks  on entering the WTO all over again? From a legal point of view,  Yi Xiaozhun replied that GATT was somewhat different from the  WTO. China has recently participated in negotiations on trade in  services rather than the trading of ordinary goods. Talks on  trade in services are within the scope of the WTO. In other  words, obligations undertaken by China in the talks are not  limited to GATT obligations. They cover a lot of ground and are  accepted by WTO members.    Yi Xiaozhun said that the United States probably has  political considerations in not being positive enough about  China's entry to the GATT. When asked whether the United States  had linked China's entry to the GATT with the extension of  China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, Yi replied  that the United States had explained in the past that the two  would be handled separately.    Yi also cited examples of the passive attitude taken by the  United States. He said that a protocol on China's GATT entry is  now under deliberation. The protocol is a legal document  defining the rights and obligations of GATT members, which is  important and indispensable for GATT entry. The EU has already  submitted a draft protocol on China's entry to the GATT.  Instead of offering suggestions on the draft, the United States  insisted that the timing was not right and was against  discussing the protocol at the present stage. As a result, it  was impossible to hold multilateral discussions on the protocol.    Yi Xiaozhun said that China would not accept the conditional  U.S. extension of its MFN status and that China would retaliate  even against partial sanctions imposed by the United States.    Earlier, a Canadian official said that if the United States  withdrew China's MFN trading status, Canada, as a North American  market, would open its door wider to China. If changes are  effected in Sino-U.S. trade because of problems with MFN trading  status, Yi said, it would be possible to make up for losses by  finding a third party to serve as a substitute and pay no price.  He believed that Canada could replace the United States in  trade with China to a certain extent. He went on to say that  Canada and Europe could replace the United States for wheat and  exports of certain equipment and technology.</p>

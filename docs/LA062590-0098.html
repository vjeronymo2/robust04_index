			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> CITY STAFF TO RECYCLE USED OFFICE PAPER  </P> <P> The city will soon launch a recycling program to help all municipal employees  be environmentally responsible without having to leave their desks.  </P> <P> The program, which the City Council approved and which will begin operating  next month, will provide each employee with a desktop recycling bin. All city  government departments -- including the libraries and the police and fire  departments -- will participate.  </P> <P> Although the waste management plan began in January as a pilot program,  officials hope that its full implementation will become a model for companies  to follow. A training videotape will be made available to any company  interested in starting a recycling plan, said Philip Pierce, street division  manager for the Department of Public Works.  </P> <P> Throughout City Hall, each desk will be equipped with a 10-inch high bin  divided into two sections, one for white paper and one for colored and mixed  paper products. Employees are being asked to dump their memos, typing and  computer paper into the box. When it fills up, they are supposed to transfer  the waste to a larger bin in their office.  </P> <P> "We've had nothing but a great response from management level all the way  through the rank and file," Pierce said. "If you make it easy, they'll do it."  </P> <P> Three departments participating in the pilot program recycled nearly 6,500  pounds of mixed paper in six months, and sold it to Paper Scrap Specialists for  $300, Pierce said. The city is currently negotiating with vendors to sell its  waste under the new program. More than 90% of office paper is considered high  quality and recyclable, and the program should become self-supporting, Pierce  said.  </P> <P> The program was first discussed three years ago, long before last year's state  mandate requiring public agencies to reduce their solid waste 25% by 1995,  Pierce said.  </P> <P> It comes at a time when other cities are also exploring recycling plans. Irvine  launched a program earlier this year, and Costa Mesa has implemented an trial  program at City Hall. Pierce predicted that other cities will soon follow.  </P> <P> "I think people get surprised when they find out how much trash is generated,"  he said. "I think we had the decade of the hippies and the decade of  this-and-that, and the '90s should be the decade of solid waste. We really have  to do something about it." MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

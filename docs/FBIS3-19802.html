			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- In the view of Bundeswehr Inspector  General Klaus Naumann, participation in foreign operations  including all duties is essential to strengthen the Bundeswehr's  marred public image. As far as risk-sharing is concerned,  Germany can no longer claim a special role in Europe, Naumann  said at the WELT AM SONNTAG-sponsored Bundeswehr-Forum in Berlin  on Tuesday [22 March]. The Bundeswehr must be able to assume  all the tasks that are asked of it within the framework of NATO,  the Western European Union, and UN missions.    In practice there cannot be a clear dividing line between  humanitarian, peacekeeping, or peace-making operations. Anyone  who withdraws his troops because one of these tasks cannot be  clearly carried out is making a "clown of international  politics" out of himself. He is no longer able to make people  understand why, given Albania's permission, a German warship is  unable for constitutional reasons to enter Albanian territorial  waters to identify a foreign ship while implementing the embargo  against the rump Yugoslavia. On 19 April, the Federal  Constitutional Court will discuss these controversial foreign  missions.    Naumann sharply rejected the de facto equal treatment of  military service and alternative civilian service, particularly  since the Constitutional Court emphasized the precedence of  military service. Only 5-10 percent of those doing alternative  service were doing really hard work in social institutions,  while the rest were rather enjoying privileges compared with  doing military service, Naumann said. The inspector general  then gave assurances that he was intending to implement  consistently the recently presented report on cost restrictions  regarding the operations of the Armed Forces.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Lull before the battle resumes: As world economies diverge, is further turmoil likely on financial markets? John Plender says the dollar holds the key Is the worst over? After two months of unremitting turbulence in global markets, a hint of optimism finally emerged this week. The first pointer to more stable conditions came with Monday's mini-crash on Wall Street, which managed to right itself in a matter of hours. Since then global equities have been shaking off the malign influence of bonds; and within the bond markets Europe is no longer quite so tightly shackled to the US. The battlefield remains heavily scarred in the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve's decision to start raising interest rates on February 4th, but the contours are becoming clearer. One reason for thinking that this lull is not necessarily the end of the shakeout is to be found in the accompanying table, which shows what has happened to bond yields in the group of seven industrialised countries since the Fed's initial move. The striking feature is that the upward adjustment in UK gilt yields has been broadly in line with the upward move in US Treasuries, despite the different stages in their respective economic cycles. Continental Europe and Japan, in contrast, are no longer moving precisely in tandem with the US. Their bond yields have risen on average by around half the UK-US increase. Yet that is still a step in the wrong direction given that their real, inflation-adjusted, bond yields are high for economies that are growing at well below potential as they limp out of recession. A quirkier aspect of the present pattern of yields is that the markets are indicating surprisingly stark outcomes for individual countries. Canada, for example, has seen the biggest yield adjustment in the G7, reflecting worries about deteriorating debt problems and a weakening political situation. With real bond yields at 6.8 per cent, the country is either heading for an appalling upsurge in inflation and a further decline of an already depressed Canadian dollar, or an astonishing bull market in bonds. The contrast with Italy - where there are huge political uncertainties after the election, a budget deficit close to 10 per cent of GDP and a total stock of public sector debt approaching 120 per cent - is interesting. Inflation there is running at about 4 per cent, compared with a negligible rate in Canada. Yet nominal yields have risen broadly in line with the other big continental European economies - much less than in Canada. Admittedly Canada's outstanding stock of debt is now running at little short of 90 per cent of GDP, and the country is much more dependent on external finance than Italy. That no doubt gives rise to portfolio fatigue. Yet the markets appear, at first sight, to be indulgent to the Italians in the light of their historic record with inflation. The same could be said of a comparison with UK gilts. The much greater upward yield adjustment for Britain looks equally odd given the greater credibility of UK fiscal policy. As for equities, the transatlantic pattern has been broadly similar. While continental bourses were cheering up under their own impetus this week, the UK market remained more in thrall to Wall Street. Japan, meantime, has been a special case, with international fund managers being prepared to take a more bullish view of the post-bubble market than shell-shocked domestic investors. It all adds up to a curious picture. If the requirements for a bear market include rapid economic growth, lax monetary policy and high capacity utilisation, then only the US comes close to fulfilling those criteria. In continental Europe precisely the opposite conditions apply. So the broadly synchronised movement of US and European equities raises as much of a conundrum as the one-way behaviour of bond markets. How can this apparently perverse set of events be rationalised? For extreme pessimists, renewed inflationary pressure provides the answer. The recalcitrant behaviour of the UK markets, for example, might be attributed to a return to an all too familiar kind of British economic cycle: where pay settlements are about to turn up sharply with recovery, the government will be tempted into pre-electoral loosening of fiscal policy and the structural weakness of the balance of payments will ultimately cause the party to end in tears. Certainly this week's output data suggest that the recovery is more robust than widely assumed. The gap between index-linked gilts and long-dated gilts has recently been pointing to underlying inflation of between 4 1/4 -4 1/2 per cent - well above current levels. And the respected Income Data Services research concern has also warned that the majority of pay rises this year were ahead of the current inflation rate of 2.4 per cent. The current account of the balance of payments, meantime, was in deficit throughout the recession and UBS Global Research has done extensive research on the new methodology of compiling the figures that leads it to conclude that the deficit is worse than it looks. Yet most of the recent news from the micro-economy is still about corporate downsizing, consumer-led disinflation and structural improvements in productivity. Retailers remain under pressure, and leading British investment institutions are complaining bitterly about the poor returns on shares in utilities where the regulators have succeeded in reducing costs to the consumer. In the motor industry, the management of Ford has revealed that its Dagenham plant - once famous for its appalling labour relations - is now slightly more competitive than its German operations. The cost of making a Ford Fiesta at the east London site plunged by 23 per cent between 1989 and 1993. The number of hours required to build a car fell by 45 per cent over the same period. If that is remotely indicative of what has been happening to competitiveness in the tradeable goods sector, the scare stories about the balance of payments may be overdone. Some of the deficit in recession was, anyway, the counterpart of investment by the Japanese in the motor industry and elsewhere. Given the fiscal tightening that begins to bite this month and again this time next year, there must, at the very least, be a possibility that consumption will henceforth be more restrained and that a better balanced recovery will impose less strain on the current account. As far as Germany, France and Japan are concerned, an inflationary upsurge looks even less plausible. All are operating with a wide gap between actual and potential output - the best guide to short and medium-term inflation prospects. And the impact of the bond market slide has been to tighten monetary policy, especially in France and Germany, where long rates have a disproportionate influence on economic activity. An alternative rationalisation argues that synchronised market movements stem from the way that governments and companies compete with each other to tap a global pool of funds. Investors choose between them on the basis of yield, adjusted for likely currency movements. The markets tend, in this world of global capital, to move together unless economic circumstances are seen to change. As Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research points out, synchronised markets have actually been the norm for much of the post-war period. And they posed no problems because the G7 economies were subject for much of that time to exactly the same external shocks, such as the successive oil price hikes and the subsequent oil price collapse. The trouble has happened where the shocks have been unsynchronised. Bretton Woods was tested to destruction when the US and the European and Japanese economies were out of sync. Similarly, the European exchange rate mechanism was the victim of the shock of German unification, which first postponed Europe's recession, then intensified it. The point is that, when external shocks cause bond and equity prices to move against the grain of domestic economic conditions, the exchange markets have to provide the adjustment mechanism. If, as most mainstream forecasters have been predicting, the dollar is set to rise when short-term capital flows into the US in response to rising short-term and long-term rates, Europe will suffer higher long-bond rates as capital deserts their markets, causing economic cycles to run even more out of phase. Something would then have to give. One possibility is that governments would respond to tougher monetary conditions by relaxing fiscal policy. There are already hints of this in France, where Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has been retreating on all fronts since he capitulated to demands for a less painful restructuring of Air France last autumn. There are fears that, as the next general election in Britain comes closer, similar temptations will afflict the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. A broader caveat is that the dollar is simply defying the forecasters. It appears to be driven at present more by long-term than short-term flows, and has remained weak because US pension funds and mutual funds continue to diversify their portfolios overseas to the tune of Dollars 200bn-plus at a time when the current account deficit is running at more than Dollars 200bn. If the result is that the dollar remains weak, then long rates in Europe will not have to rise and the markets will be able to decouple. The European recovery will grow in strength. The snag is that the dollar may yet decide to follow the commands of mainstream forecasting opinion. US short-term rates look low, in real terms, for such a robust recovery and the Fed's Alan Greenspan is committed to returning them to a 'neutral' level, having held them artificially low in the period when he was seeking to recapitalise the debt-laden US banking system. If he raises them further, as the markets expect, money will flow out of mutual funds back into the banking system. So the capital flow from US mutual funds to the rest of the world would shrink dramatically. As long as markets are out of step with conditions in the underlying economies, the scope for turmoil will remain. And it could be exacerbated by the political weakness of so many governments in the developed world, particularly where, as with the US and Japan, it threatens to lead to trade friction which upsets markets. The dollar probably holds the key. A prolonged bout of strength for the US currency would pose Europe with a nasty dilemma. But if it remains weak, the European markets are in for a buoyant ride.</p>

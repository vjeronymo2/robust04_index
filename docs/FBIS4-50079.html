			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China has caught up with  the world's developed countries in the technology and industrial  application of slurry, a new coal-based clean fuel.    Hao Fengyin, chairman of the National Research Center of  Slurry Engineering and Technology, said that although China has  been late in starting research in this field, it has developed  its own set of technologies.    Slurry, composed of 60-70 percent of coal, 30-40 percent of  water, and some one percent of additives to keep the mixture  stable and fluid, is believed to be a good substitute for fuel  oil.    The technology of slurry was born during the world oil  crisis  in the 1970s. The United States, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the  Soviet Union invested large amounts of money and technical force  in its research and development.    The Chinese Government showed interest in exploiting and  using slurry to supplant oil, which was falling short of demand,  and listed slurry technology as one of the key projects for  research in the three consecutive "five-year plans" starting  from 1980.    During 1985-90, China succeeded in completing research of  slurry, developed a complete set of technologies and built  demonstration projects and bases for experimenting with slurry  preparation, pipeline transportation and industry-oriented  combustion.    Since 1990, the state has approved five energy-saving and  environmentally sound projects using slurry instead of oil,  bringing to a new stage the large-scale, streamlined industrial  application of slurry technology.    At present, six slurry preparation plants have been built in  China, with their annual production capacity totaling one  million tons. Specialized workshops can produce 500 to 2,000  tons of slurry additives, with only two-thirds, or even half,  the cost of their foreign equivalents.    Breakthroughs were also made in slurry combustion for  industrial scale boilers and kilns and power plant boilers,  slurry storage and transportation and research and development  of specific equipment.    Hao said China is developing second-generation slurry  technology, including preparation of super-low ash slurry and  intensified low- sulphur combustion, which has attracted the  attention of foreign counterparts.    It is estimated that by the end of this century, China's  slurry production will replace 10 million tons of fuel oil and  the capacity of pipeline transport will reach 30 million tons.    Hao said this will not only help ease the congestion of rail  transportation, but also greatly reduce the emission of ash and  other pollutants into the atmosphere.    China is rich in coal deposits as against oil resources, Hao  said. Coal accounts for more than 75 percent of the country's  consumption of primary sources of energy. "It is imperative to  put the slurry technology into full play, so as to attract more  clients, domestic and foreign," he added.    He proposed that a high-tech coal processing conglomerate be  established based on the national research center to undertake  large-sized projects in and outside China.    He also expressed China's willingness to develop  international cooperation, from the pure technological type to  an all-around one incorporating technology, industry and trade.    This would pave the way for China's slurry technology and  products to enter world markets, he added.</p>

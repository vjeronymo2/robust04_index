			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Uncle Sam in retreat ONCE THE Soviet Union disappeared, the US was left in sole possession of the cold war battlefield. The machinery of the United Nations was at its disposal. The world looked, with varying degrees of hope and anxiety, to see what use it would make of its victory. Inevitably a debate broke out among the American 'foreign policy community'. Some favoured a unilateral assumption of world leadership, using American power to promote good and punish evil, recruiting allies where available but never sacrificing the country's freedom to decide for itself when and where its power should be used. Others stressed the need for a multilateral approach, placing American power at the service of the world community and using it only for purposes approved by a broad international consensus, in conformity with international law. A third school sought to downgrade foreign policy altogether, arguing that the disappearance of the Soviet threat permitted America at last to lavish attention on its many domestic problems. Mr George Bush was somewhere between the first and the second schools, and his successor is somewhere between the second and the third. Not himself, strictly speaking, an isolationist, Mr Bill Clinton had no compunction about exploiting popular resentment against Mr Bush's apparently exclusive concern with foreign policy; and he would not have been elected had not Mr Ross Perot, with a much more crudely isolationist message, taken a large share of Mr Bush's vote. Once elected, Mr Clinton recruited many foreign policy specialists to advise him, most of whom inclined towards the multilateralist school of thought. Underlying ambivalence Yet, partly because they are not confident about carrying either the public or the president with them, there remained an underlying ambivalence. The US wanted to work through the UN and other multilateral institutions, but always on the assumption that it would be in the lead - not only politically, but also in the sense of having command of any combat operations in which its troops were involved. This version of multilateralism is hard to sustain, because it means asking something of the US's partners which the US itself is not prepared to grant. It also leads to confusion about where the responsibility for policy decisions actually lies. In Somalia, many UN officials feel they have been effectively commandeered as extras in a film produced and directed by Americans. Yet US policy-makers have blithely put the blame on the UN for things that have gone wrong. Serious resistance That things have gone wrong neither side now seriously disputes. But the damage extends far beyond Somalia itself. The whole notion that the UN can bring order into parts of the world afflicted by chaos has been discredited. The remarkable success of the simultaneous, but much more carefully planned, and much more genuinely multilateral, operation in Cambodia has been eclipsed. To much of the world the UN has been portrayed as a mere tool in the hands of a blundering and arrogant superpower, instinctively inclined to tackle all problems with a show of military force, yet ready to back off as soon as it encounters serious resistance. To the US public, the UN has been proved a dangerous will o'the wisp, luring idealistic American soldiers to a humiliating and pointless death. The result has been a loss of nerve among the multilateralists in the State Department, the Pentagon, and the National Security Council, and a reassertion of Mr Clinton's own instinctive reluctance to get bogged down in complex foreign policy issues. Already, when he addressed the UN general assembly last month, he was clearly multiplying the conditions that had to be met before the US would involve itself in further peacekeeping or 'peacemaking' operations. The chances of US troops being sent to Bosnia, never very great, are now virtually zero. From now on, the US is unlikely to risk its forces in any conflict where there is not a direct and more or less self-evident threat to its national interests. Those who believed the cold war would be followed by a period of Pax Americana, worldwide or even in Europe, need to think again, and urgently.</p>

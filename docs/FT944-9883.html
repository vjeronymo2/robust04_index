			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Carmakers anticipate boom in Chinese market Around 20 of the world's leading carmakers are to present plans to the Chinese government this week for the development of an ambitious small family car project. The Family Car Show in Beijing, organised by the Chinese authorities, is one of the best opportunities for carmakers from west Europe, the US and Japan to establish a presence in the Chinese car market, which is expected to set one of the fastest growth rates in the world car industry during the next two decades. Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany, said annual new car registrations in China were expected to grow from around 450,000 to more than 2m by 2004. 'China is an important market of the future' which would experience a substantial growth in motor vehicle use, said Mr Werner. Mercedes-Benz, the German car and commercial vehicle maker, is seeking to enter the Chinese car market with its Family Car China project for a 1.3 litre, petrol-engined, five-seater car. It proposes an initial capacity to produce 250,000 cars a year. The basic version would have a price of around Dollars 10,000, and Mercedes-Benz is offering a number of versions including a seven-seater MPV (multi-purpose vehicle), a pickup and a light van. Mr Alex Trotman, chairman of Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, which is also competing in the Family Car Show, met China's vice premier Li Lanqing in Detroit last week, to discuss Ford's plans for establishing technical and manufacturing centres in China. Ford is seeking to strengthen its case by establishing a series of automotive parts joint ventures in China, but it said it was 'eager to establish vehicle assembly projects in China at the earliest opportunity'. The fierce competition in Beijing this week among carmakers coincides with the publication of a report that urges caution, however, on vehicle producers seeking to gain access to the emerging car markets of the Pacific Rim and China. The study by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a 55 per cent growth in sales of new vehicles in the region during the next seven years from 4.75m in 1993 to 7.36m in 2000. It warns that much of this growth will not be accessible to outside investors for a decade or more, however. 'As the mature markets of the world approach saturation, as the levels of competition rise and unit profit margins decline, and as the burden of overcapacity grows, the attraction of these emerging markets is in danger of being overstated by vehicle manufacturers anxious to find a new route into volume growth.' Congestion and pollution are already problems in the region, with Bangkok suffering the world's worst traffic congestion. Investment in the infrastructure of these countries is far behind the growth in motor vehicles, the report says. The passenger car market usually begins to grow quickly when GDP per capita reaches around Dollars 5,000 a year, but it would take China at least 45 years to reach this level, and the position is far worse in India and Vietnam. The main areas of opportunity in the markets of the Pacific Rim and China are currently in components and commercial vehicles, says the report.

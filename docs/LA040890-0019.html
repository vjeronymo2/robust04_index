			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSCAR MEMORIES  </P> <P> With respect to the best-actor Oscar, one can only surmise that Daniel  Day-Lewis won over Morgan Freeman because the academy was impressed with his  portrayal of a physically handicapped character. (So was I.) However, I wonder  if any academy member could even fathom the difficulty inherent in Freeman's  extraordinarily believable portrayal of a character whose imposed disadvantages  were more visceral than visual.  </P> <P> HARRIET J.

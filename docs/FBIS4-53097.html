			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] Three years ago a tube clogged with rust broke in  the No. 2 reactor of the Kansai Power Electric Company's Mihama  nuclear power plant. An inhouse company report has found out  that similar problems have occurred at six other nuclear plants.    In the incident three years ago, one of the tubes in a steam  generator at the Mihama No. 2 reactor broke and leaked a large  amount of primary cooling water, used to cool fuel in the  reactor. Investigators later found one of the tubes had broken  because an antivibration bar had not been properly installed.  They said that foreign objects, including rust, had accumulated  in a small gap between a tube and the bar, which supported the  tubes. The tube eventually became fixed and could not withstand  vibration.    NHK, which obtained a copy of the Kansai Electric Power  Company's inhouse report, says after the accident investigators  took samples from tubes at nine other pressurized water  reactors, which are similar to the Mihama No. 2 reactor. They  confirmed the tubes had become fixed because a gap between the  tube and a bar in six of the reactors had become clogged. The  report says that each of the 30 to 40 tubes that were checked at  the Mihama No. 3 reactor and the No. 2 Ohi reactor, which are  still in operation, were clogged with rust and dust and  completely fixed.    Kansai Electric officials say that even though the tubes  were  clogged with dust, they would not break like the one at the  Mihama No. 2 reactor unless it was triggered by an accident.  They say they intend to replace the steam generators, together  with the tubes, over the next four years. Antinuclear groups,  however, including citizens' group, say that the reactors should  be closed down immediately.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Prices depend on response to rising rates - London The chancellor of the exchequer has obliged UK analysts to face the question they have been skating around all summer; will economic recovery, in the shape of higher company earnings and dividends, triumph over higher base rates to keep the market moving ahead? The City's answer seems to be, on balance, positive, perhaps surprisingly considering the range of views. It is not difficult to find two diametrically conflicting quotations from leading securities houses. 'The increase in base rates was a necessary move,' or 'In our view, the pre-emptive move on UK rates was unnecessary.' Just to add to the confusion, the first writer then hedges his bets by adding that 'a further rise may not be necessary', while the second says the chancellor may be 'jostled into moving base rates up by another  1/2 per cent this year'. Mr John Shepperd at Yamaichi also sees another  1/2 per cent rise this year and base rates at 7 per cent by the end of 1995 - 'which should be about the top of the interest rate cycle'. Markets in Europe as well as London appear to have moved firmly to the view that the interest rate cycle is now on the turn, and the outlook for share prices this week will hinge on the response to this prospect. The case for a further advance by equities before the year-end, and there are still plenty of 1994 Footsie forecasts in the 3,300 to 3,500 range on record, is rehearsed by Strauss Turnbull which has raised its end-1995 Footsie forecast range to 3,700 - 4,000. Strauss repeats its view that equities can out-perform following base rate rises, pointing out that rate troughs in 1977, 1984 and 1988 were followed by gains in share prices which delivered returns on equities averaging 33 per cent. On the economic growth side, Strauss sees dividend growth at 10 and 12 per cent per annum over 1994 - 95. NatWest Securities prefers 9 per cent for this year and 8 per cent in 1995 with a Footsie forecast of 3,500 by the year-end. But equity performance this week is likely to hang on the more considered response from UK government bonds to the rate rise. At mid-week, the auction of the new bond is expected to be a difficult process for both the Bank and the market, especially after the poor response to the RPI and latest PSBR data. Without a more positive performance from gilts, the equity market is not going to make any permanent recovery just yet. Friday afternoon, although a shock for the market, could prove a decisive moment for equities. Market strategists suggested that, while gilts had reason to react to the US economic data, shares have every reason to benefit from the further signs of recovery in one of the world's leading economies.</p>

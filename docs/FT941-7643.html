			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / LegCo votes for Patten's HK reforms The first stage of governor Chris Patten's democratic reforms for Hong Kong have won more support than expected after a marathon series of debates in the colony's 60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo). The support for the governor's legislation was in defiance of China's wishes. After last November's breakdown in Sino-British talks on the colony's political development, Beijing warned that it would dissolve LegCo on resumption of sovereignty in 1997 and hold fresh elections if LegCo voted on the Patten package. Mr Tam Yiu-chung, of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, said the passage of the bill 'signifies that Britain has gone down the road of no return.' He said that trust between the UK and China had been 'totally shattered'. The crucial vote was on a motion to defer consideration of the bill. This vote, which was expected to be close, gave Mr Patten a majority of 13 and improved on the majority of 11 he secured in November 1992 when LegCo first voted on his democratic proposals. It paves the way for the publication tomorrow of Mr Patten's second bill to broaden the democratic franchise in Hong Kong. LegCo members approved Mr Patten's plan to lower the voting age in Hong Kong to 18, abolish appointments to local government, and institute popular voting in the three tiers of government in the colony. LegCo also removed the prohibition on Hong Kong delegates to People's Congresses in China standing for election in the colony. The normally polite atmosphere which pervades LegCo gave way to some uncharacteristically robust parliamentary exchanges during the 10 hours of debate. Anti-British feeling ran high in conservative circles. Mrs Elsie Tu, an independent who tried to get Mr Patten's bill deferred, said passage of the bill would only increase uncertainty about 1997. In 1997 the governor would be 'basking in the glory' of having introduced limited democracy in Hong Kong but 'we in Hong Kong do not know what is in store for us, we have to face 1997,' she said. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, said the passage of the bill was a test of Hong Kong's ability to secure its high degree of autonomy as promised by China in the 1984 Joint Declaration. 'It is important to remember that Hong Kong's political arrangements and elections should not be decided by Beijing - even after 1997,' he said.</p>

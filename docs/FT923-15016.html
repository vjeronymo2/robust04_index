			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / All set for a second-best summit: The prospects for next week's G7 meeting Next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Munich is almost certain to decide second-best solutions for the world's most pressing problems. The leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Canada and the European Commission (which also takes part in most of the talks) are gathering against the background of a weaker-than-hoped-for world economy and an increasingly worrying slippage of economic reform efforts in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union. Their two overriding objectives will be to boost business confidence in the industrialised world and help as far as possible with economic and social transformation of the former communist countries and their integration into the mainstream world economy. While they may make some progress, the solutions chosen will probably be less than optimal. Each of the G7 countries has pressing political or economic concerns at home that are making them inward-looking and which impose limits on their willingness and ability to co-operate. Although the summit theme is about shaping a new international partnership between the former communist countries and the developing world, there is unlikely to be significant progress on the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, which is the one issue that could help all. This year's summit host, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, has ordered a lean agenda and a short final communique in an attempt to focus the summiteers' discussions. On Wednesday, after the formal close of the economic summit, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin will join the group for lunch and further discussions in the afternoon. Although there is always a risk that global political problems such as the bloody civil war in Yugoslavia will hijack the summit, Mr Kohl is determined that the meeting should live up to its name. The two and a half days of talks beginning on Monday will therefore focus on economic issues and cover: world economic developments, and especially the need to enhance the growth prospects of the leading industrial countries; how best to help the states of the former Soviet Union overcome growing economic crisis and secure democracy; the difficult progress of eastern Europe towards pluralism, democracy and the market economy; co-operation between industrialised and developing countries; the follow-up to the recent Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro; and plans to make safe Soviet-designed nuclear power stations in the former USSR and eastern Europe. The striking thing about the summit agenda is that the first four points would be greatly advanced by a breakthrough in the long-running Uruguay Round trade talks. Freer trade and an end to the negotiating stalemate could also provide the boost to confidence that the world economy needs. But, although last-minute surprises cannot be ruled out, all the indications over the past week argue against a solution to the deadlock between the European Community and the US on agricultural trade at the summit. While the main players, such as Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, and Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will be in Munich, pre-summit briefings have deliberately lowered expectations. US officials and Mr Horst Kohler, the German government sherpa charged with preparing the summit, have pointed out that a gathering of government leaders is not the forum for complex technical negotiations. The discussions will therefore centre on the first two agenda points and on the nuclear safety problem. Without a trade breakthough, the G7 will be left with a patchwork of less impressive measures to stimulate growth and help the former communist nations and the third world. These measures have been falling into place over the past week. The US cut its discount rate by half a point to 3 per cent, its lowest level since 1963. Japan's ruling Liberal Democrat Party has proposed the introduction of an economic growth package that could total between Y6,000bn (Pounds 25bn) and Y10,000bn later this year. Germany announced a strict 1993 budget and four-year savings plan that is intended to pave the way for lower interest rates eventually. But it offers no relief to Germany's partners in the European Monetary System which are forced to follow the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy. All G7 countries are aware that President Yeltsin cannot leave Munich having suffered a rebuff. After swallowing hard, the industrialised countries are likely to agree to grant Russia a breathing space of perhaps three or five years on servicing its official debts. They will also signal their willingness for the International Monetary Fund to provide Russia with Dollars 1bn in loans on condition that Moscow gets its budget deficit and inflation under control. The summit will give its blessing to practical help such as improved co-ordination of technical assistance for Russia and the other former Soviet states through a system of country co-ordination groups. Although differences remain about how to organise the safety programme for the Russian-designed nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, the G7 agrees on the need for action. But the leaders are all having to look inward. Germany is only slowly waking up to the size of the task of absorbing the former east Germany. US President George Bush is distracted by the looming November presidential election. Japan has a weakening economy and a weaker government. The EC is currently preoccupied with the aftermath of the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty. Italy has only just appointed a new government after months of difficult coalition building. France is facing its own referendum on Maastricht in September while the popularity of President Francois Mitterrand is low. In Canada, Mr Brian Mulroney's government is trying to deal with complex constitutional problems and has long been below an approval rating of 20 per cent in public opinion polls. The UK government has a working majority for a full five years in office: but Mr John Major, the prime minister, faces increasingly difficult economic problems and cannot ignore the hostility of part of the Conservative party to the Maastricht agreement. The problems faced by Presidents Bush and Mitterrand go a long way to explaining why a Uruguay Round breakthrough is unlikely, even though all can agree that the Dollars 320bn paid in farm support each year by the industrialised world is a waste and that the best way of helping eastern Europe and Russia would be to open markets for their steel, textiles and food products. Officials preparing the meeting admit that the world will not be a very different place next Thursday, after the leaders and the accompanying 4,000-strong media circus have left Munich. But if it adds a little to mutual understanding, the G7 gathering will have done some good. In view of current global uncertainties there is much to be said for Winston Churchill's remark that 'to jaw-jaw is better than to war-war'.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SAN QUENTIN 6' DEFENDANT SPAIN WILL NOT BE RETRIED  </P> <P> Closing a bloody chapter in California history, Marin County Dist. Atty. Jerry  Herman said Friday that he will not refile charges against "San Quentin Six"  co-defendant Johnny L. Spain for participating in a 1971 prison escape attempt.  </P> <P> Spain, a former Black Panther now free on bail to lecture college students and  counsel troubled youths, had his double-murder conviction overturned by a  federal appeals court because he was shackled before the jury during his  204-day trial in 1976.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused a prosecution appeal to reinstate one  conspiracy and two murder convictions produced in that trial. Prosecutors had  90 days to set a new trial date to retry the case.  </P> <P> "Since this case is now 19 years old, and since the defendant Spain has now  been out of custody and led a crime-free life for three years, it is impossible  to believe that a conviction secured after a retrial would result in the  defendant Spain being resentenced to prison," he told the Associated Press.  </P> <P> Spain, 40, has actually been out of prison since March, 1988, when a judge  ordered the state parole board to ignore the San Quentin melee when deciding  whether Spain was suitable for parole from a 1967 murder conviction.  </P> <P> Herman said the widows and families of three prison guards who were killed in  the incident, and three other guards who survived after their throats were cut  "support our decision not to retry the case."  </P> <P> Inmate George Jackson, author of the book "Soledad Brother," also died in the  incident, which authorities said began when Jackson used a smuggled gun to try  to escape from the prison's isolation unit.  </P> <P> Spain, then serving a life sentence for a Los Angeles murder committed when he  was 17, was one of six inmates accused of plotting the escape. They became  known as the "San Quentin Six." Prosecutors did not suspect Spain himself of  killing anyone during the brief revolt.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 22 June -- In an interview for the "Details"  program on Russian television this evening Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said that "he had spoken about" the  question of extending the powers of deputies "a month and a half  ago with both the president and with State Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin." "We came to an understanding on this question, and in  principal there were no objections either from the president or  from the State Duma chairman," he said.    "Two years is a very short time for deputies to `get into'  normal legislative work," was how Vladimir Shumeyko explained  his position.    For his part, State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin in fact denied  Vladimir Shumeyko's statement that the State Duma chairman had  agreed with his proposal. In an interview with "Details" he  said that the extension of the powers "should still be put to  the people." "I think the Russian electorate thinks  differently, and perhaps one ought to move toward re-election  next year," he said. In his opinion, "considering the people's  bitter experience, people of a quite different direction could  be elected."    "It is possible to extend powers in a stable situation when  the policy of those who carried it out has been fully  justified," believes Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of Russia's  communists. "In the present situation, when the policy has  become completely bankrupt, when the socio-economic situation  reminds one more and more of genocide and catastrophe, and when  the spiritual disintegration of society has reached an  unprecedented level, the question of changing course and  changing those who are in charge has not only ripened but has  overripened," he told a correspondent with the "Details" program.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Personal View: Need to legislate now on privacy law The least attractive attribute of British newspaper editors is their penchant for propagandising against a fundamental human right. They have been at it again in the past few days, denouncing and distorting the modest proposals by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, to give UK citizens the kind of protection against invasions of their privacy as is enjoyed by other Europeans, and by Americans and Canadians. In fact, the real objection to Lord Mackay's 'consultation paper' is that it calls for 'consultation' rather than action. It is a further delaying device by a government that does not have the guts to cause discomfort to the newspapers which promoted its election. The Lord Chancellor proposes no more than a new cause for action in the county courts (for damages up to a mere Pounds 10,000) to compensate individual victims who have suffered 'substantial distress' as a result of harassment or molestation, or revelation of intimate personal details about health or family relationships. The victim must prove invasive conduct of a kind which would cause anguish to someone of ordinary robustness; this may be defeated by proof that the conduct aimed to serve the public interest. These are moderate recommendations, although objections of principle can be made to their legal fine print. It is wrong to place upon defendants the burden of proving such 'defences' as consent, lawful authority, and public interest. It should be for the plaintiff to show these considerations cannot justify the invasion of privacy - to show, for instance, that the public interest is not involved. The only real danger to media freedom is the consultation paper's suggestion that pre-publication injunctions should be available on the 'balance of convenience' basis appropriate for other torts. This approach is both unprincipled and pettifogging: press stories should only be suppressed where there is no basis even for arguing that they could serve the public interest. The worst feature of the consultation paper lies in its refusal to countenance any extension of legal aid. At present, legal aid is denied only for libel actions, originally on the ground that the poor should not be encouraged to bring their 'over-the-fence' squabbles to court. The paper gives a wholly inaccurate justification for this unjust discrimination and concludes that the poor should be as powerless to protect their privacy as they are to protect their reputation because 'resources are very limited'. So they are, but if this tort is to have any deterrent effect on the buggers, eavesdroppers, data-defilers and dirty tricksters, it is absurd to confine the remedy to the rich. A belated recognition by the civil law of a right to privacy might be thought to be the minimum step necessary to fulfil the promise of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It will not be much used (most victims of privacy invasions do not wish to relive their experience in open court) but the occasional courageous plaintiff will set important precedents which will make data collectors, private detectives, and gutter journalists mind how they go. The role of the newspaper industry in opposing and delaying a civil right to privacy is both contemptible and counter-productive. It has involved an expensive public relations exercise - originally by the Press Council and now by the Press Complaints Commission, which falsely claims to protect privacy by 'voluntary self regulation'. The real danger to press freedom is that editors are behaving like the boy who cried 'wolf'. The Lord Chancellor's proposed remedy is, with some amendments, no danger to investigative journalism - unlike the draconian criminal privacy laws devised by Sir David Calcutt, or the statutory quangos recently threatened by parliamentary committees and private members' bills. Acceptance of a civil remedy for invasion of privacy would end the clamour for these oppressive alternatives, and free editors from their obligations to trumpet, dishonestly, the virtues of the PCC. They could instead point out that it is time for this government to stop 'consulting' and to start legislating - not only to provide citizens with some legal protection to their privacy but to fulfil its alleged commitment to openness by a Freedom of Information Act and by reforms to the laws of libel and breach of confidence. The case for greater freedom of important speech becomes more compelling once it is conceded that some personal matters are important only to the private individuals they concern. The writer is the author of 'Freedom, the Individual and the Law', the new edition of which will be published by Penguin Books next month</p>

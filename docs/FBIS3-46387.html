To implement a sustainable development strategy, said Gao  Guangsheng, official from the State Planning Commission, is to  develop the economy on the basis of protecting the ecological  environment from deterioration and keeping resources sustainably  available.    At an international seminar on the environmental protection  action plan which closed today, Gao said, the old development  model characterized by high input and high consumption is no  longer in keeping with reality.    Experts at the seminar said that the basic ways of realizing  the sustainable development strategy include increasing the  efficiency in using resources and energy, waste recycling, and  developing new alternative resources.    According to the official, China is considering the  selection  of about 100 priority projects concerning key problems which  urgently need to be solved in implementing the strategy, to  promote cooperation with international environmental protection  organizations.    "The first batch of priority projects will be selected by  March this year," he said.    The official said these projects will be those with a  sufficient input of funds.    Cooperation is necessary in this field, since seeking  development is the common task for all countries in the world,  said Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the National Environmental  Protection Agency.    "As a developing country, China should use the experience of  other countries, especially of developed countries, for  reference," Zhang said.    He said China has promoted cooperation with Britain,  Germany,  Denmark and Canada in this field and some projects are in  progress or under discussion.</p>

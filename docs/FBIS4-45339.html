Police spokesman Faustino Sanchez told ACAN-EFE that  Guatemala is a "bridge and storehouse" for international drug  trafficking, adding that most cocaine shipments arrive by air  from Colombia and Panama. Sanchez said drugs are "unloaded" at  night and stored in clandestine warehouses ready to be shipped  to Mexico and the United States, their final destination.    One of the most recent important seizures took place on 7  June in Malacatan, in the northwestern San Marcos Department,  bordering Mexico. Sanchez said two Guatemalans were arrested  with 79 kg of cocaine worth $1.3 million, which they tried to  smuggle into Mexican territory. The alleged "drug traffickers,"  who were travelling in a microbus, were identified as Walter  Heberto Torres Recinos and Oscar Antonio Segura Chacon.</p>

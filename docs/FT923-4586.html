			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Going to work on a wok - Nicholas Lander turns up the heat in a Chinese kitchen ACROSS the divide which separated 250 noisy diners from hard-pressed kitchen staff came two unusual sounds. The first was the giggling from 10 young girls who stood by the kitchen door receiving food from the chefs, assembling it on trays and thrusting it to clamouring waiters. The second noise came from half a dozen washers-up, mainly women in wellingtons and rubber gloves, working as fast as they could. Rents are now so high in Hong Kong and the volume of dirty plates so much greater in Chinese restaurants (they can have eight sets of crockery in circulation compared to three in a western restaurant) that electric dishwashers cannot be justified. There are enormous differences in how western and Chinese professional kitchens operate. In the west we prize the individual while in China the will of the individual is restrained for the benefit of the community. Hence, in the west, the tradition of great individual chefs from Taillevent onwards. Chinese cooking, in spite of its many changes, boasts no individual chefs of national fame. Kitchens in the west are organised hierarchically and in a way that allows strong individuals to exert their authority. As a written order comes in, it goes to the head chef who shouts the details (known as the pass). On hearing the two phrases 'Ca marche' and 'Envoyez' the brigade goes in to action. Sous chefs set to, calling instructions to lesser mortals such as the chefs de partie while the lowest of the low, commis chefs, hover on edge. The kitchen's other prima donna, the pastry chef, listens for the first dessert order. The Chinese kitchen is bereft of such hierarchy. The person in charge at the Victoria City Seafood Restaurant in Hong Kong (tel: 827-9938), was the man cooking at the Number One Wok. About 5ft 8in tall, thin, wiry and with very powerful arms, he did nothing other than cook. He worked in front of six woks, powered by propane, controlling the temperature with his kneecaps and a lever under the range. This way of controlling the heat meant that all the chefs' hands were free to cook. The chef's cooking utensils were simple. A large, extremely hot wok, groundnut oil and a large flat sieve with which he drained off all excess oil. He used large amounts of water, recycling it, to cool the range and a cooking technique that would terrify any amateur. Once the wok was hot and thinly coated in oil, he threw in the ingredients and then took the wok off the heat, tossing the contents as they cooked. He could cook in this way during the one-hour lunch service (it lasts no longer to allow the diners to return to the stock market) because he never moved. When an order comes into a Chinese restaurant the No 1 Wok is the last person in the kitchen to see it. The order is taken in the same way, in triplicate, with one copy to the cashier, one for the waiting staff and the last for the kitchen. In a Cantonese kitchen serving dim sum at lunchtime (and in Hong Kong 1m sit down to such a lunch every day) the order goes first to the back of the kitchen where the raw ingredients for each order are prepared. Instructions for the steamed dishes - shrimp or beef dumplings, char sui buns, the delicious glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaves - then go to a side of the kitchen which houses a row of steamers. These, at full tilt, resemble a scene from Dante's Inferno as the cooks appear and disappear behind thick clouds of steam. All the ingredients for the dishes to be cooked in the wok make their way from the preparation area to the back of the cooks via a chain of expeditors. They pass the finely chopped ingredients in sequence virtually into the hands of the cooks and then whip the plates away as soon as they are ready. Lids on, they are passed to the gaggle of giggling girls who assemble the orders from both sides of the kitchen and make sure they are never without clothes pegs. Economics are forcing certain changes. Soaring rents (new restaurants rarely open on a ground floor but invariably in a cheaper basement or upper floor) have led to the disappearance of the traditional dim sum trolleys. And, with 1997 so close, restaurants must repay their investors quickly. Other outstanding Hong Kong restaurants: Yung Kee, 32-40 Wellington Street, Central, (522-1624), for their roast goose; Rainbow Room, Lee Gardens, Causeway Bay, (895-3311) for the best Peking Duck; Sun Tung Lok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, (730-0288) for sharks fin exotica; Zen, Pacific Place, (845-4555) for modern design and cooking, Hunan Garden, Exchange Square, (868-2880), for hot spicy Hunan food, and The Happy Seafood Restaurant, Yuen Long, New Territories (472- 3450) for the very freshest seafood and, on a clear day, a view of China.</p>

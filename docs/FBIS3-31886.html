			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, special rapporteur of </F> the UN Human Rights Commission for the former Yugoslavia, by  Helga Hirsch; place and date not given: "Helplessness is  Outrageous"]    [Text] [Hirsch] Have the Serbs really fulfilled the  demands of the West so far that an air strike is no longer  necessary?    [Mazowiecki] To be really able to assess how far they have  placed their weapons under UN control, one would have to study  the situation on the spot. Undoubtedly, however, the  development proves that resolute pressure can force decisions.  The point is now that the things that have been achieved are  not lost.    [Hirsch] Will the Russian UN contingent really be neutral?    [Mazowiecki] As part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR],  the Russians have to observe its rules. On the other hand,  Russia has, of course, achieved a political success.    [Hirsch] In the West, many opposed any military intervention  by saying that the political objective of the war is unclear.  Might the West not be involved in intricate fights for an  incalculable period?    [Mazowiecki] Conversely, I am asking: What would happen  without intervention? Is the alternative supposed to be: Let  them bleed to death...?! Helplessness is outrageous in the  event of such serious human rights violations. As early as  August 1992, President Alija Izetbegovic told me that bombs have  to be dropped if the heavy weapons are not withdrawn. At that  time, this also seemed to be exaggerated to me. However, I am  convinced that it would have been possible to get the weapons  under control by strong political pressure as early as one and a  half years ago.    [Hirsch] How much is the West also to blame for the  escalation of the conflict?    [Mazowiecki] It started with the absence of any ideas for a  global solution in the former Yugoslavia: How the rights of  nations and nationalities could be preserved if Yugoslavia  disintegrates. Slovenia and Croatia were recognized without  clarifying what would be done with small Bosnia. The second  mistake was made with the London conference or the lack of  preparedness to implement its resolutions. At that time, in  August 1992, all committed themselves to refrain from further  "ethnic cleansing," to dissolve the prison camps, and not to  prevent humanitarian help any longer. And what happened? None  of the resolutions was adhered to, but the negotiations  continued. When the monitoring of the embargo really began on  the border between Bosnia and Serbia in the spring of 1993, the  Serbs threatened to shell Rome or Paris or Vienna -- and the  West yielded to the threats. All the time it was like this:  First the West announced a resolute course of action and then  it stated that it could not be implemented. Undoubtedly, the  hesitation spurred the warring parties on.    [Hirsch] How do you explain the helplessness of the West?    [Mazowiecki] There is the fear that, for example, the death  of every English soldier will lead to troubles in Great Britain:  "We will not die for Sarajevo." I understand this fear. But  can criminals be tolerated without any consequences? The  situation was certainly different in 1939. But there is a  parallel to that time, when nobody wanted to die for Gdansk.    In addition, the "Vietnam complex" continues to be felt. On  the other hand, let us not forget that the man in the street in  Paris, Bonn, Warsaw, or London asks the justified question: If  it was possible to intervene in Iraq, why can this not also be  done in Bosnia?    [Hirsch] The longer the war lasts, the more every side will  make itself guilty....    [Mazowiecki] Unfortunately.    [Hirsch] ....and therefore the West is increasingly  justified in talking of a fratricidal war. Do you still see  clear differences in the guilt of the warring parties?    [Mazowiecki] Certainly. The policy of "ethnic cleansing,"  with all its brutality, was applied by the Bosnian Serbs. Then  it was again revived in the Croatian-Muslim conflict -- above  all by the Croatian side. In view of such a cruel policy, the  respective other side -- also the Muslims -- carried out  reprisals.    [Hirsch] Do you know of cases where Muslims shot at their  own people to force the West to intervene?    [Mazowiecki] I have heard of such cases, but I can neither  confirm nor deny them because I did not investigate them myself.  However, one should bear in mind that the Bosnian Government has  the greatest difficulties in controlling its irregular troops.  A desperate act of an individual or a unit cannot be completely  ruled out. I think that such a course of action is unlikely as  a deliberate tactic of the government. If this became known, it  would be completely compromised and would have to expect even  greater pressure from the West to sign a peace treaty.    [Hirsch] What is known about the situation of the raped  women? How many prisoners and how many camps are still there?    [Mazowiecki] According to the International Red Cross, there  are still 4,000 people in prisons and camps. The number of  rapes has apparently decreased. However, they still occur on  all sides. The children also deserve particular attention:  According to experts' estimates, 280,000 children have been  indirectly or directly involved in the war. Some 16,000 have  probably died.    [Hirsch] What political solution is realistic after these  horrors?    [Mazowiecki] The pressure for the settlement of the basic  problems has to continue resolutely: All prisoners have to be  released and all camps have to be dissolved. Unhindered access  has to be ensured for the convoys providing humanitarian help.  It is extremely difficult to negotiate a solution. On the one  hand, certain realities and, on the other, law and justice have  to be taken into account. In my opinion, however, a peace  process that makes a pluralist coexistence gradually possible is  feasible after the demilitarization of the territory. But the  presence of international forces and institutions will be  required for a long time.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ILLINOIS' $69-MILLION LOTTO PRIZE TO BE SHARED 4 WAYS  </P> <P> There was no $69-million man or woman in Illinois on Sunday, but there were  four winners who will have to be content with $17.25 million or so each as  their shares of the world's biggest lottery jackpot.  </P> <P> None of the winners had stepped forward by midday Sunday, but lottery director  Sharon Sharp said two of them bought their tickets in the Chicago area, one in  west-central Illinois and one in southern Illinois.  </P> <P> "For all of you who said it's easier to be struck by lightning than to win the  Lotto, four people were struck last night, and they struck gold," Sharp told a  news conference.  </P> <P> The winning numbers, drawn Saturday night, were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46, 54.  </P> <P> The holders of the four winning tickets -- be they individuals, couples or  groups -- will each receive at least $17.25 million before taxes, to be paid  out over the next 20 years, she said. The prize may be even larger after final  sales figures are tallied today, she said.  </P> <P> Hopeful players from around the country descended on Illinois in the past week  and bought tickets in record numbers that enabled lottery officials to pad the  prize. Some travelers changed flight plans and stood in long lines at O'Hare  International Airport; other players called from as far away as Europe to find  out how to get a piece of the action.  </P> <P> Losers, who were bucking odds of 13 million to 1, said they were disappointed  but took the loss in stride.  </P> <P> "I just got one ticket because . . . if you're going to win, you'll win with  one," said Lonny Taylor, a systems engineer from Chicago. "I didn't win, but it  didn't bother me at all."  </P></p>

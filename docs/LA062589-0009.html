If,  after reviewing the choices, the people begin to react favorably to  legalization, the politicians will be able to respond.  </P> <P> Decriminalization does not condone drug use but, instead, recognizes the great  peril that drugs are to all of society, especially to the youth of this nation.  It will eliminate profit and reduce drug demand by providing money for  prevention and treatment.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH OLSON  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed political commentary] </F>   [Text] The Ibrahimi Mosque crime cannot be viewed from a  political viewpoint and be detached from the nature of the  conflict in the area. The savage crime did not take place for  political motives to have it be said that the occupied territory  is witnessing political violence and that violence by its nature  hits in all directions.    The attack on the worshipers in Hebron clearly shows the  religious dimension of the crime. The Jewish settlers think  that the Muslims must leave their areas, that these territories  belong to Israel, and that whoever refuses to leave will have to  be liquidated in an ugly way. It is clear that the attack on  the Muslim worshipers in a sacred place reflects the depth of  the Jewish hatred, which has been manifested in more than one  way. The Talmudic mentality agrees with the logic of force used  by the Jews against the Palestinian people and the other Muslim  peoples.    The Zionist aim is to uproot the Palestinian people and  force  them to surrender so that the settlements can stay in the  occupied territories and the Jews can have the upper hand  politically, militarily, and economically.    In light of the clear Zionist aims, the practical response  to  this crime is not to absorb the emotional reaction of the Muslim  masses and regard the incident as a transient moment of madness.  The Muslims are called upon to seriously and genuinely support  the Palestinian people by supporting the intifadah and enabling  the Palestinians to exercise the right of legitimate defense.  It is unreasonable for the Palestinian people to remain the  victims of Zionist terrorism and the continuing madness while  the governments and regimes call on the Palestinian people to  refrain from exercising their right of self-defense on the  pretext of facilitating the peace process.    The natural response to the Zionist crime is to make the  Israelis understand that Palestinian blood is no less precious  than Jewish blood, and that for every Palestinian that is killed  an Israeli attacker must be killed. The battle in essence is  one of existence between the Palestinian people and the new  immigrant Jewish settlers. When the Jews seek to implement  their designs through a Talmudic ideology, which they believe is  sacred and regard as their strategic program, the resistance  idea must rely on a solid basis, especially when the other ideas  have been frustrated as a result of the miserable illusion of  peace.    The series of unending violence, blood, and terrorism that  is  affecting the Palestinian people confirms that the talk about  peace is only designed to dope the Muslim masses and make them  believe that the area is moving toward peaceful coexistence.  This is at a time when the correct reaction is to give the  masses freedom of action to prove their ability to defend the  Muslim nation's sanctities and dignity. Restricting popular  reaction will be the biggest service rendered to the  Zionist-Western scheme in the area. Official, rhetorical  reactions will not dress the wounds of the Palestinian people  and will not make the Jews understand that their crimes will not  remain unpunished. Israel is used to rhetorical statements and  long communiques. But a single jihad operation in southern  Lebanon or in the occupied territory is sufficient to teach the  Jews many lessons. It will teach them that their security will  always be threatened because security cannot be based on  usurpation, terrorism, and the logic of force.</p>

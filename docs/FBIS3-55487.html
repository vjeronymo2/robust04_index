Kavsadze, who is a member of the Georgian delegation, told  Interfax that the return of refugees to Abkhazia rather than the  political structure of that republic would dominate the talks.  "Abkhazia's autonomy is not questioned. It is the shape of its  statehood that will be discussed by the Georgian Constitutional  Commission and the whole people of the republic," he said.    On the other hand, he continued, the Georgian delegation can  expect anything in Geneva even though UN, CSCE and Russian  officials who will attend the talks want the conflict to be  resolved by political means.    In his words, if the talks are impassed, "we will have to  protect the national interests by force. We have the right to  do this because the conflict in Abkhazia is an internal affair."  Kavsadze placed the blame for the possible failure of the talks  squarely on the Abkhazian authorities.    He did not agree that Georgia would be in the position of a  country which lost the war at the talks. He said that "there  will be no winners or losers in this war" because "both  Georgians and Abkhazians lost it, for this is a war within a  country."    The Georgian negotiators in Geneva will be headed by  Chairman  of the Emergency Committee Jaba Ioseliani and the Abkhazian  negotiators, by Prime Minister Sokrat Jinjoliya.</p>

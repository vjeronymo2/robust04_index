			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Parliament Wants Community </F> To Give Impetus To Follow-up on Earth Summit"; as released by  Brussels TEXTLINE database]    [Text] The World Environment Fund, the result of a  Franco-German initiative which was launched as a three-year  experimental phase by the World Bank, must be reformed if it is  to run efficiently, and must favor projects of a local scope in  order to allow sustainable endogenous development respecting  biodiversity. This is what the Parliament [European Parliament,  EP] called for when it adopted the report by French Liberal  Jean-Thomas Nordmann, who underlines in particular the  importance of the European Union's participation in the Fund, a  participation that should facilitate the coordinating role in  the world environmental problems facing the Union.    Finally, the EP wants the mention "token entry" which is  currently indicated in the Community budget for the financing of  the Fund to be replaced in future by appropriate amounts. The  EP fears that the existence of the Fund itself is in jeopardy  after the expiry in June 1994 of the temporary period of its  operating. The EP has also adopted the report by Spanish  Liberal Gudalupe Ruiz- Gimenez Aguilar on the follow-up by the  European Union [EU] of the implementation of "Agenda 21" adopted  at the Earth Summit in Rio, requesting in particular that the  Commission and member states add to the ECU3 billion promised in  Rio additional resources intended for the implementation of  "Agenda 21." The Commission is also invited to include in all  international trade agreements a clause on the protection of  natural resources, and to propose to the Council a Green Paper  on trade and the environment. As for member states, they must,  according to the Parliament, establish in 1994 committees and  national plans for sustainable development accompanied by  mechanisms inherent in the formulation of indicators of  sustainable development. During the common debate on the two  reports, Mr. Nordmann, underlining the Environmental Fund's  operating problems, invited the Community to play its  coordinating role fully whereas according to him the World Bank  should be limited to a role of technical support for projects.  Mrs. Ruiz-Gimenez Aguilar insisted in particular on the  implementation of conventions on biodiversity and the climatic  change and underscored the need to have additional financial  means to implement the "calendar 21" adopted at the Earth  Summit. The European Union must abide by the commitments  entered into at Rio, the MEP [member of European Parliament]  said.    European Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro shared the view  of the MEPs about the need to provide renewed impetus to the  implementation of the Rio decisions and believed that the 5th  program on environmental matters constituted a strategic  framework that should enable bolstering the Union's action in  this area.</p>

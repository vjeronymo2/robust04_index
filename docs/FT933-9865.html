			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Beer row with Canada settled THE US and Canada have reached agreement on a long-running dispute that Ontario beer retail stores, owned by Canadian breweries, also will sell American beer, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. Canada has agreed to eliminate its tariff on US beer - 16 cents a litre - and to lower Ontario's minimum beer price. But it will not remove Ontario's 10 cents-a-unit levy on beer sold in cans, which is intended to encourage the use of re-usable glass bottles. Large American breweries are unhappy with the settlement, which they say allows the use of environmental measures as trade barriers, and they worry that it will be imitated by other countries. Canadian brewers said that the decision 'allows the industry on both sides to end the uncertainty and get back to the business of selling beer'.</p>

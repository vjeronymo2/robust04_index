			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Thomson tries to reframe bid for US missile maker THE US Treasury said last night that Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, had withdrawn its offer to buy the missiles division of LTV, the bankrupt US conglomerate. The French company was reported to be in negotiations on a new deal under which a US group would take over and operate the LTV missile division. Thompson would be just a minority partner. These moves were prompted by US government hostility to Thomson's bid, which has also encountered opposition in Congress. In addition the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a review body chaired by the Treasury, is understood to have voted to recommend that President George Bush should block the LTV deal. If Thomson's bid had been rejected by Mr Bush, it would have been only the second company to receive such a rebuff, after the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, whose application to buy a Seattle-based aircraft parts maker, Mamco, was denied in 1989, largely as a rebuke to the Chinese government over the Tiananmen Square massacre. The Thomson bid for the missiles unit, in conjunction with a bid for the LTV aircraft division by the Carlyle group, a Washington merchant bank, would have put around Dollars 450m (Pounds 235m) in the pockets of LTV, which has operated under the supervision of a New York bankruptcy court for the past six years. Northrop, the US defence contractor which has signed a memorandum of understanding with Carlyle to buy a minority stake in the aircraft division, has been most frequently cited as a likely partner for Thomson in a new bid. Even such a restructured deal, however, was expected still to face opposition in Washington. Thomson said during congressional hearings that it would not accept a blind voting trust or proxy arrangement, but this might be the only structure acceptable to the Pentagon. A deal in which Thomson would have only a minority of the voting rights, but pay most of the purchase cost by buying non-voting preferred stock, could still be viewed sceptically. The campaign against the Thomson-LTV deal has been led, right down to punctuation and misspellings in statements by congressmen and expert witnesses, by Lockheed and Martin Marietta, whose joint bid Thomson topped. But Thomson had been unable to assuage fears about the possible loss of US military technology, or to calm the broad streak of francophobia which has been demonstrated in Congress. Although LTV creditors still have a back-up bidder in the shape of the Lockheed-Martin Marietta consortium, the outright failure of the Thomson bid would raise difficult questions about US policy on similar foreign acquisitions in the future. As defence budgets are slashed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US is reluctantly facing the same dilemma as other, smaller countries which have discovered they cannot on their own order enough military materiel to sustain a domestic industry covering the full range of defence equipment.</p>

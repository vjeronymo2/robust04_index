			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / European Diary: Zurich braces itself for drugs park withdrawal symptoms - Switzerland TENSIONS in Zurich's notorious Platzspitz, one of Europe's main gathering places for drug addicts, have risen ominously in the past few days with the erection of high steel fencing around the benighted park. The construction signals that the city's tormented leaders have at last settled on a course of action to end an experiment in rehabilitating Switzerland's surprisingly numerous drug addicts. Platzspitz has become famous as much for its ironic location - within a stone's throw of the glittering shopping and banking plazas of central Zurich - as for the macabre scenes of its everyday life. City officials admit that the park, which had been intended as a place where addicts could find clean syringes and a path to rehabilitation, had become a huge open market for professional drug dealers. According to one official, the dealers there were serving not just the 2,000-odd regular addicts in the park but an additional 10,000 or more casual customers from all around the region. Also, concentration of the region's addicts at Platzspitz was causing increasing resentment among Zurich residents. Not only did it add considerably to the city's operating costs, it also boosted crime levels in the centre of the city to levels that merchants were no longer willing to tolerate. For all this, the Platzspitz experiment has not been a total failure. Dr Albert Wettstein, Zurich's chief medical officer, says that only 5 per cent of those coming to the park since the free syringe policy was introduced have contracted Aids. Before that, the figure was as high as 50 per cent. However, last October, the city council conceded defeat and agreed in principle to close down Platzspitz. A new strategy of dispersing addicts, in the hope of getting rid of both the professional dealers and the crime, would be implemented. This has not proved easy. Other local authorities around the country have not been exactly delighted at the prospect of having their addicts come home. And there has been strong opposition from residents in areas of Zurich where the council has set up shelters for its own Platzspitz refugees. From yesterday the new fences around Platzspitz and an adjacent underground shopping centre where many addicts sleep at night will be locked from 10pm until 7am. Transportation is to be provided to take addicts to shelters in the city for the night, but they will be allowed to stay at the shelters only at night, and will be unable to reserve a bed from one night to the next. Non-Zurich residents will be barred after five consecutive nights and pointed toward their homes. Mr Robert Neukomm, director of the Zurich police department, said Platzspitz would be closed 'before the end of the winter'. Police patrols would be stepped up to make sure that no new centre for drug dealing established itself. Zurich's struggle with drug addicts dates from the late 1970s when young people, disaffected with their country's clockwork society, gathered in the Bellevue area of the city. A socialist city administration was loathe to be tough on them. Some counsellors even campaigned to have heroin distributed free. Under pressure from merchants, city leaders sought a less conspicuous gathering place for the addicts, settling in 1987 on Platzspitz which, although central, is hidden behind the National Museum on a promontory where the Limmat and Sihl rivers meet. There, dealers could sell their drugs, addicts could inject themselves and no one noticed. The police were under orders not to arrest people who carried only small quantities of drugs, and the social services did what they could. In 1988, alarm at the rising of level of Aids in the Zurich area prompted the city to institute a policy of distributing free syringes and clean needles in the park. From then on, Platzspitz grew and grew. According to statistics released this week, 116 people in the Zurich area died from drug-related causes last year, almost double the number of the year before. Despite its international fame, Platzspitz regulars are almost entirely Swiss. According to the Zurich police, about a third are Zurich residents with almost all the rest from elsewhere in the country. How they will be provided for once Platzspitz closes remains uncertain. One option was eliminated when the national interior minister, Mr Flavio Cotti, flatly rejected a request from 100 Social Democratic politicians from the canton of Zurich that heroin be distributed free to addicts under medical supervision.</p>

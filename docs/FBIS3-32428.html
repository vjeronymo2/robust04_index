			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 5 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus today said the U.S. blockade against Cuba  "is not the proper medicine" to get this country to return to a  democratic system. According to Niehaus, a candidate for post  of OAS secretary general, "bloodshed" has to be avoided in Cuba,  and a change in Cuba's current political system -- a system that  has been in place for more than 30 years -- has to be achieved  through dialogue and respect for the people's self-determination.    The head of Costa Rican diplomacy said: "None of us want our  Cuban brothers to shed one drop of blood. We have to talk to  them to avoid this. They are part of the American family that  is outside" the OAS because of the isolation decreed against it  by the organization in the 1960's.    Nevertheless, Niehaus warned that for Cuba to be readmitted  as a member of the American community of nations, it has to  respectfully adhere to the principles of the OAS Charter and to  the defense of human rights. In this sense, the foreign  minister said, he agreed that Cuba should not be invited to any  American Summit -- the next summit has been scheduled in the  United States at the end of 1994 -- until a democratic change  takes place on the island governed by Fidel Castro, the Marxist  leader who took power in the 1959 revolution.    According to Niehaus, had Western Europe isolated the Soviet  Union, "we would still have the USSR." In this way, he  reiterated that it was counterproductive to continue using the  method of isolation to achieve change in Cuba. Regarding the  renewal of relations between Cuba and Costa Rica, which were  broken off more than 30 years ago, Niehaus said this is not the  only way to get closer to the Havana regime, and he added that  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon was the one who had  to ultimately decide this issue.    Today Niehaus met with foreign reporters covering Costa  Rica's electoral process that ends tomorrow with the election of  a new president, two vice presidents, 57 deputies, and  authorities for the 81 Costa Rican municipalities.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT SEEKS TO REIN IN TAX ON HORSES;  </P> <P> RACING: THE CASE INVOLVES CONFLICTING VIEWS OF A STATE LAW GIVING BREAKS TO  OWNERS OF FIVE RACING BREEDS. OWNERS SAYS THE DECISION COULD HAVE A MAJOR  IMPACT ON BREEDING.  </P> <P> Nestled deep in the blue-ribbon horse country of southern Ventura County and  wrapped softly in a late-morning haze, the ranch of millionaire developer David  H. Murdock is a quiet bustle of activity.  </P> <P> Under a cool canopy spread by towering oaks, expensive Arabian stallions trot  lazily across a pasture. A sleek mare circles a hot-walker machine, cooling  down after a run. Inside a carefully maintained brick barn, a blue-jeaned young  woman sweeps her way past the stalls of top-quality fillies and geldings.  </P> <P> Sprawled over 1,500 acres in the wealthy Lake Sherwood area just south of  Thousand Oaks, the ranch -- called Ventura Farms and home to 200 Arabians --  has produced national champions of the United States, Canada and Brazil. In a  slick booklet, the ranch advertises itself as "one of the most significant  Arabian breeding farms in the world today."  </P> <P> But as his horses peacefully graze, Murdock's lawyers are busily preparing for  a court battle Monday with Ventura County that is being closely watched by  racehorse breeders across California. At issue is how much the county can tax  such horses -- a question that owners claim could have a major impact on the  future of racehorse breeding in Ventura and other counties.  </P> <P> The case involves conflicting interpretations of a 1971 state law that gives  tax breaks to owners of five racing breeds: Arabians, Appaloosas,  Thoroughbreds, Standardbreds and quarter horses. The statute was intended to  help build up California's horse racing industry, boosting race track betting  and putting more money in state tax coffers.  </P> <P> The Ventura County assessor's office contends that to qualify for the tax  break, a horse must be entered in races and be registered with the state as a  racehorse and that its ranch include a training track and race trainer.  Otherwise, horses are subject to taxation at 1% of market value, the same rate  as boats, airplanes or other personal property.  </P> <P> But in a lawsuit filed last year, Murdock argued that a horse should be  classified as a racer if it is merely eligible to race or produces a foal  eligible to race, said Richard Craigo, one of his attorneys. Murdock claimed  that his stock, even if some of the animals had not actually been in races,  were still racehorses under the law, qualifying them for a far lower flat tax  rate of $200 to $1,000 a head, Craigo said.  </P> <P> For breeders with as much stock as Murdock, the difference in tax rates can  mean a savings of tens of thousands of dollars a year.  </P> <P> If the county loses, it may ultimately have to rebate up to $500,000 in taxes  already paid by Murdock from 1981 through 1986, Assessor Jerry Sanford said.  </P> <P> Sanford acknowledged that Ventura is evidently the only county in California  that still taxes some horses as personal property, a policy that some breeders  claim may encourage other counties to apply the higher tax rate to racehorses  and drive some owners out of state, thereby hurting race track-tax revenues.  </P> <P> "It takes years to develop a good racing string. If you're going to be taxed as  though they're not for racing, it's going to be very expensive to keep horses  in California," said Michael Sypolt, treasurer of the Arabian Racing Assn. of  California.  </P> <P> "We have 65,000 Arabians in California and 24,000 owners. This case could be  very important," he said.  </P> <P> But Sanford dismissed the argument, saying breeders who are in compliance with  the state race horse law have nothing to fear from the tax man -- in Ventura or  elsewhere -- because they will receive a racehorse exemption.  </P> <P> The dispute can be traced to 1985, when then-Assessor Jack Waterman conducted a  routine audit of horse ranches, including Murdock's, Sanford said. Although in  previous years most Ventura horses had so little value that county tax  appraisers largely ignored them, he said, the 1985 audit revealed "$30 million  to $40 million worth of value out there," and the county decided to step up  collection of taxes on ranch stock.  </P> <P> Many horse owners, recalled Sanford, were shocked when their new tax bills  arrived.  </P> <P> "One horse I think we had appraised for $13 million. And a week later, the  horse died. I'm not sure if the owners showed the horse the bill or not," he  said, laughing.  </P> <P> County officials, Sanford said, were caught in "kind of a Catch-22" because  they were assessing some racehorses at a time when their prices had reached  all-time highs, some zooming 500% in a single year. But the following year,  prices plunged as a speculative boom in Arabians slowed sharply.  </P> <P> Attorney Craigo criticized the county's position as "a little selfish,"  charging that if its tax policies drive breeders away, the county may be  fattening its own tax coffers in the short term at the expense of long-term  state revenues.  </P> <P> Sanford said that at the time his office began applying the personal property  rates to horses, many of Murdock's animals did not qualify for the racehorse  exemption. Since then, however, Murdock has built a race-training track,  registered some of his horses as racers and put more of his stock into races.  </P> <P> As a result, county officials re-appraised Ventura Farms and in July agreed to  lower Murdock's assessment for the 1987-88 and 1988-89 fiscal years to $1.6  million from $25.2 million, Sanford said. The cut meant the county had to give  back $237,000 in taxes already paid by Murdock, he said.  </P> <P> Scott Zimmermann, another attorney for Murdock, said the developer is pursuing  his expensive litigation with the county not to save money but to prove that  his reading of the state racehorse law is correct and to help other breeders.  </P> <P> "Murdock can afford the taxes, but a lot of other people have smaller  operations, and the tax can be a significant extra burden for them," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: US and German influences in conflict TWO main elements influenced the direction of the world's senior equity markets last week: President Bill Clinton's plans for the US economy, and surprisingly good money supply data from Germany. In aggregate, they produced a decline in the FT-Actuaries World index in local currency terms; but if one excludes the US, the index shows a modest rise. US equity markets tumbled on Tuesday, after Mr Clinton's television appearance the night before in which he revealed his proposals to increase taxes, with a loss of more than 80 points in the Dow, leaving it some 4 per cent below an all-time high seen just two weeks before. It is uncertain how much of the economic and budgetary proposals will get through debate in Congress. However, Mr Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, comments that the current proposals favour European bonds rather than equities, owing to the broadly negative effect the Clinton plan will have on economic growth. This theory was supported last week by rising prices in the US bond market, which the president himself, as a politician rather than an economist, interpreted as a positive sign for his planned tax increases. Germany continued to power ahead last week, although some of the reasons suggested for this rally began to indicate misguided optimism rather than sound investment strategy. The general consensus among European analysts is that the rise in the DAX has been driven by technical factors with little, if any, thought given to fundamentals. At the beginning of the year, they say, many fund managers, facing an underweight position in German equities, started to buy the liquid blue chips such as Daimler, Siemens and Allianz. But, as some analysts warn, price strength in, for instance, Daimler is not borne out by earnings prospects for 1993 or, indeed, 1994.</p>

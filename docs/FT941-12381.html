			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Wave of executions in anti-crime campaign Dozens of alleged criminals have been put to death across China in what appears to be an attempt by the judicial authorities to clear their books before the Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally an occasion for family reunions. Reports over the past few days from Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and elsewhere indicate a widespread campaign is under way to remind the populace of the severe penalties for a wide range of crimes. According to a recent report by an Australian human rights delegation, at least 55 offences carry the death penalty. The delegation expressed concern that categories had recently been extended to include 'economic crimes' such as embezzlement and the production of counterfeit goods. International human rights groups regularly question China's predilection for capital punishment as a means of dealing with crime. A report published last year by a mission to China led by Lord Geoffrey Howe, Britain's former foreign secretary, expressed concern about 'reports of execution within public view, of instances of convicted persons being paraded in public prior to execution, and of the use of organs from executed for spare part surgery'. The Howe mission urged the Chinese to reduce the number of capital offences, to apply the death penalty more sparingly and to introduce a code of conduct for execution that would lessen the humiliation suffered by the condemned. Hundreds of officials, most of them relatively junior, have been executed since the anti-corruption campaign began last July. No official statistics are available for the number of executions in China last year, but the figure almost certainly exceeds that in 1992. According to Amnesty International the number of executions annually has risen sharply since 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In 1989, 370 death sentences were imposed of which about two-thirds were carried out. By 1992 the figure had risen to 1,891 imposed and at least 1,079 carried out.</p>

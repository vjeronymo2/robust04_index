			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: Iraq's gruesome stalemate - The west must now formulate clearer and more specific objectives in relation to the Gulf Exactly a year ago, Iraqi forces were in headlong retreat from Kuwait. Operation Desert Sabre - the coalition ground offensive - was in full and deadly swing: one of the most rapid and overwhelming military victories in the history of warfare, ancient or modern. The US-led, UN-authorised coalition unquestionably won the war. But did it lose the peace? That is a much harder question. Kuwaiti sovereignty was restored, yet Kuwait today is by all accounts a broken-backed, acutely xenophobic society, insecure both in its domestic affairs and in relations with its neighbours. Apart from the inevitable reprisals against those accused, justly or otherwise, of collaboration, whole communities of people who lived in Kuwait for a generation or more - helping to build and run its ultra-modern infrastructure in return for a very modest share of its enormous oil revenues - have been forced to leave. The citizenship laws remain as restrictive as ever, but the ruling family seems reluctant to concede any real power even to those who qualify as citizens. Of the new security arrangements in the region, much talked about before, during and after the war, there is no sign. Kuwait and the other Gulf states remain dubious about accepting any long-term military presence of their Arab 'allies', nervous about the growing power of Iran, and desperate for continued protection from western countries which, for their part, are much happier to sell arms than to envisage any further involvement of their own forces. Above all, President Saddam Hussein remains in power, alternating submission and deception with provocation and truculence, as the UN struggles to get a hold on his programmes for manufacturing weapons of mass destruction - programmes which turn out to have been far more advanced and extensive than was suspected even a year ago. The war was fought to liberate Kuwait and to 'restore international peace and security in the area'. The liberation of Iraq from Ba'athist tyranny was not an official war aim, although US President George Bush did (on February 15 last year) call on the 'Iraqi people to take matters in their own hands to force Saddam Hussein the dictator to step aside'. In his mind this was a means, not an end: a less dangerous (for the coalition forces) and less destructive route to victory than the direct liberation of Kuwait by a ground offensive. But the Iraqi people took it the other way round, seeing the coalition's victory as a route leading to the overthrow of Mr Saddam's regime. They rose in revolt too late to be useful from Mr Bush's point of view, and their expectation of his assistance was cruelly disappointed. I remain convinced that the insurgents could have won last year's civil war in Iraq if the US and its allies had given them firm support - even without the allies committing their own ground forces to a new offensive. They could have been supplied with food and weapons, plenty of which had been captured from Iraq during the liberation of Kuwait. They could have been given air cover, particularly against helicopter attacks (as they were, under the terms of the ceasefire, against fixed-wing aircraft). And the west could have pledged support for their proclaimed objective of a united but democratic and pluralist Iraq, bringing their leaders together and cementing their new-found unity. That is disputed in the analysis of the Gulf conflict published by the International Institute of Strategic Studies*. The rebellions, it points out, were 'spontaneous, disorganised and poorly armed, and were no match for the fire-power of the troops loyal to the regime. Also, very early on, the revolts came to be seen as inherently sectarian and secessionist . . .' That is true, but it begs the question. Western support would have gone far to correct this impression, especially if endorsed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. All three of those countries were on record as wanting to see Mr Saddam overthrown, and the Turkish president, Mr Turgut Ozal, explicitly called for a democratic regime in Iraq while publicising his contacts with Iraqi Kurdish leaders. Such a combination would have helped to convince the Iraqi officer corps, drawn predominantly from the Sunni Arab minority, both that Mr Saddam was a loser and that the successor regime would be a moderate one under western and Arab tutelage, rather than a sectarian Shi'ite one backed exclusively by Iran. Why reheat this long-cold meal now? Because, in one form or another, it still has to be digested. Today in Downing Street the British prime minister receives Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic party and, thanks to the western intervention last spring, one of the two de facto rulers of northern Iraq - an area from which Mr Saddam has withdrawn his military forces, but which he is now trying to starve into submission. Mr Barzani will plead for food supplies to be sent in directly, across the Turkish and Iranian frontiers. He will also ask Britain to send official observers to witness elections in Kurdistan. To refuse such requests would be yet another cynical betrayal of the Kurds, like that which Mr Barzani's father suffered in 1975 when the US acquiesced in the Algiers agreement between Iraq and Iran, cutting off the aid that had encouraged the Kurds to fight.** But to grant them would take Britain close to supporting a separate Kurdish state, unless it is done as part of a strategy for liberating Iraq as a whole. For the fact is that the repression in the south has been, if possible, even more savage than in the north, and in the south there is no 'safe haven'. There, too, there is an acute shortage of food and medical supplies, with epidemics rampant and infant mortality rising steeply, not because food and medicine are embargoed but because Mr Saddam refuses to sell oil to pay for them on the terms fixed by the UN Security Council. Western policy towards Iraq has resulted in a gruesome stalemate, of which the Iraqi people are the main victims. Recognising this, Mr Bush and his vice-president, Mr Dan Quayle, have recently pledged that Mr Saddam will not be allowed to remain in power indefinitely, although without explaining how they intend to remove him. Meanwhile, the Iraqi opposition is again gathering itself together, and planning to unite at a congress in Vienna at the end of March. This time, the west must be much clearer and more specific about its objectives. It should encourage the proclamation not of a separate Kurdish state, but of a provisional government for the whole of Iraq, and should supply that government with weapons and air cover so that it can gradually expand the area denied to Mr Saddam's forces, until at last those forces turn against him. Anyone who wants to help some of Mr Saddam's victims in the south can support the Iraqi Humanitarian Relief Committee, which is trying to buy second-hand ambulances in the UK and send them out to the Iraqi refugee camps in Iran. Its patron is the British MP, Ms Emma Nicholson, and its address is 50 Wendover Road, London NW10 4RT. * The Gulf Conflict: A Political and Strategic Analysis (IISS Adelphi Papers 264, Winter 1991-92). ** See David McDowall, The Kurds: A Nation Denied (Minority Rights Publications 1992), page 97.</p>

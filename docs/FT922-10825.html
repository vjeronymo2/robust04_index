			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Swiss to make regular bond issues THE Swiss finance ministry said it would issue bonds on a regular monthly basis, and publish a calendar, Reuter reports from Berne. Mr Peter Thomann, Treasury chief, said the move was designed to ease the absorption of federal bonds on to the market and avoid surprises. The Treasury had until now had a calendar of new issues, but had not made it public. Mr Thomann said the Treasury planned to issue a further seven bonds this year, totalling around SFr3bn, bringing the total for the year to a record SFr5.6bn. Last year it issued SFr1.35bn, and the previous record was SFr4.5bn in 1976. Earlier it expected to double its issue of money-market certificates to SFr4bn, but Mr Thomann said he was not sure this figure would be reached. The certificates are one of the Treasury's chief short-term funding tools. In a sign of the increasing importance of the bond market in federal finances, the Treasury last year said it would issue fungible bonds to boost market liquidity.</p>

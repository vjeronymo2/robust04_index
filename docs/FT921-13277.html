			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Car buyers prefer fixed price THREE OUT of five new car buyers would prefer to have a lower, fixed basic price for a car, rather than a higher price from which they have to negotiate their own discount, according to the 1992 Lex Report on Motoring. The study, based on a Mori survey of nearly 1,300 regular car drivers in 160 locations throughout the UK, claims that only a minority of new car buyers like to bargain with a car salesman to get a good deal. The findings appear to support the initiative taken last autumn by Vauxhall, which lowered the dealer margins and list prices of some new models to reduce 'haggling' in new car purchasing. The Lex study says that men feel more comfortable bargaining with car salesmen, with 50 per cent of men saying they enjoy haggling, compared with only 28 per cent of women. The report also discloses that 78 per cent of motorists would support random breath testing, and 85 per cent support the inclusion of eye tests for night vision in the driving test. The latest report of the Advertising Standards Authority, published yesterday, found particular cause for complaint with the motor industry, Gary Mead writes. The authority upheld complaints received in November against Citroen UK for inaccurately suggesting the superiority of some aspects of a Citroen 1.4-litre Avantage over a Ford Escort 1.4LX. Complaints were upheld against Peugeot Talbot for a claim concerning the environmentally 'clean' nature of diesel engines against conventional petrol engines fitted with catalytic converters, and against Seat UK for a newspaper advertisement that combined a slogan featuring a car costing Pounds 5,444 with a photograph showing a model costing Pounds 8,099.

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: London City Ballet's 'Romeo and Juliet' - Ballet London City Ballet has taken up residence at Sadler's Wells for what seems by now a regular engagement at the year's end. The repertory comprises Romeo and Juliet in Ben Stevenson's staging and a couple of attractive triple bills, with an admixture of guest artists to tickle the box-office palate. I have a great deal of time for LCB because of its dogged determination to succeed, its no less dogged determination that audiences shall enjoy themselves, and its resilience in the face of official indifference - this somewhat improved since last year by an Arts Council grant for touring. Private sector subvention is still essential to the company, and LCB has an excellent record of finding corporations who respond to the company's ideals - this year's activities have benefited from Barclay's generosity. If some of the troupe's large-scale stagings have been ill-advised - La Traviata a few years ago was a brute - the present Romeo, like last season's Swan Lake, is decent. Stevenson's version was made for his Houston Ballet, and it is cleverly adapted to LCB's more modest forces. It is a production able if not especially imaginative, and its dance is bland, but LCB's artists give of their best and bring theatrical vitality to every moment. (There are a couple of characters who look lightly stunned, but how good to see a Friar Laurence - Michael Hogan - who cares deeply for the lovers). David Walker's design is stylish, and gives an unaccustomed depth for the Wells' stage. The reduction of the Prokofiev score to suit the numbers of LCB's orchestra has been sensitively done by Chris Nicholls. It is, all in all, a fine achievement for the company, and in Kim Miller, the Juliet of Tuesday's opening, it has a clear, potent central interpretation. Miss Miller dances, and speaks to us with feeling. Her natural style is beautifully rounded and fluent - there are hints of Lynn Seymour (who will appear as Lady Capulet in this season) in the way movement melts and flows onward. She carries conviction in everything: in the way movement is stated, with especially lovely arms; in the way the dramatic climate of a scene is established. I think she pushes a couple of moments rather hard - she might tone down the choreography's girlish capers with the nurse - but she enhances Stevenson's ideas by the distinction of her talent. Her Romeo was Paul Thrussell, attentive, loving, responsive, his reading touching in its innocence. And from Viktor Barykin a tremendous Tybalt. Barykin, on whose admirable interpretations with the Bolshoy I have reported in the past, gives a brave account of a saturnine, provocative bully. He cuts through the action like his own sword and is fine indeed. This LCB season is very welcome. London City Ballet is at Sadler's Wells with 'Romeo and Juliet' and two triple bills until January 2. Sponsorship by Barclays; Texaco</p>

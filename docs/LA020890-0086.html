			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE AT CALIFORNIA GIFT SHOW;  </P> <P> KITCHENWARE: A 20-QUART ICE CREAM FREEZER, A LASAGNA PAN AND A PRESSURE COOKER  ARE SOME OF THE MORE NOTEWORTHY ITEMS .  </P> <P> Culinary showrooms at the L.A. Mart welcomed buyers with new kitchen and  table-top products during the recent 110th California Gift Show. As far as  presenting something really new and different, the manufacturers'  representatives didn't unveil anything as dramatically unusual as the Japanese  bread-making machine introduced two years ago. However, many of the items  displayed offered function and high style mixed with durability. Here are some  noteworthy examples of interesting kitchenware. (Next week's article will  feature table-top accessories.)  </P> <P> A 20-quart ice cream freezer promises to be the fun solution around  warm-weather party time to please homemade ice cream fans. Leo Neeleman, vice  president of Kitchen Concepts, presented the monster ice-cream maker along with  its normal smaller versions. Built by one of the first companies to construct  wooden tub freezers, the huge hand-crank model from White Mountain Freezer Inc.  carries a nostalgic old-fashioned appeal yet projects a modern approach with  its bright teal tub color and electrical mode capability.  </P> <P> Recognized for its patented triple motion ice cream freezer with a three-gear  drive, White Mountain has been building quality wood tub freezers since 1853,  around the time when the first ice cream makers were invented.  </P> <P> The perfect lasagna pan has finally arrived, says Kitchen Concepts' Carolyn  Teninty, who brought out the new Chef's Design Lasagna Pan Plus ($55 with  cooking rack, $50 without rack). Manufactured by Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry  Inc., the professional weight black pan is made of hand cast aluminum with a  wide lip on each end that acts as a handle.  </P> <P> What makes it perfect? The pan size, 12x10 inches with three-inch depth, is  unusually deep to avoid those common lasagna spills and large enough to save  trimming the long, wide pasta. The sturdy baking pan also features non-stick  surface for easy clean-up.  </P> <P> Joining the revived pressure cooker arena is the Efficient Pressure Cooker from  Bra USA Inc., also represented by Kitchen Concepts. Made in Spain, the sleek  18/10 grade stainless steel cooker offers even heating with its triple-layer  diffusing base and safety features that protect against handling errors.  </P> <P> An upscale new Barbecue Tool Set from Carlo Giannini ($80) was shown by Tom  Bryckner, who represents the Italian kitchen tool company. Packaged in a long  carrying case, the finely finished tool set consists of a fork, a spatula and a  pair of tongs. A long barbecue brush is available separately for $25.  </P> <P> Bryckner also recommended the Rialto Infuser by Italian designer Sambinelli,  introduced by Carlo Giannini last year. Made of stainless steel and  borosilicate glass, the French press or infuser not only works well for coffee  but is great for herbal infusions and teas. Other interesting pieces from  Giannini are the new espresso demitasse set ($35) with a thermal feature to  keep that cup of espresso steaming hot and the beautifully designed stainless  steel Rialto teapot ($90).  </P> <P> Cookware Specialists of Los Angeles offered a collection of attractive looking  18/8-grade Stainless Steel Kitchenware from Sitlax Ltd. Presented by showroom  owner Darrel Stone, the high-polished Sitlax steel group included airtight  canister sets, colander sets, a cocktail shaker, Champagne bucket, vases, oil  dispenser, trays and charger plates.  </P> <P> Representing Alessi, Niel Sheffield, vice president of marketing at  Gallant-Friedman Showroom, brought out some daring spring-to-summer products  from the Italian firm, adding them to its collection of highly successful  architecturally designed home accessories. One futuristic gadget is the Starck  Juicer ($75), which takes a little bit of pondering to identify. The single  juicer, which resembles a Space-Age knight standing on three long slender legs,  is the brainchild of French post-modern architect Philippe Starck.  </P> <P> Made of polished aluminum, the reamer is shaped like a twisted cone so that  when citrus is squeezed on its rounded top, the juice runs along the streaks of  the spiral, flowing into the glass placed under the juicer. "It really works,"  Sheffield said, "I tested orange after orange to prove that the juice really  flows directly into a glass."  </P> <P> Another dramatic design by the same architect is the monolithic Philippe Starck  Water Kettle ($125). A one-piece construction, the aluminum teapot consists of  a large cone-shaped body pierced at the top by a slimmer slate blue cone, which  serves as the handle and spout.  </P> <P> Would you pay $300 for a colander? No, it's not silver- or gold-plated or  copper. But that didn't stop buyers from choosing this product. The Starck  Colander from Alessi is made of finely crafted stainless steel but stands tall  and elegant on three shining brass feet. Of different sizes, the holes have a  distinctive pattern that make this colander unique. An upscale item, it  deserves to be handled as a decorative fruit bowl or a rare plant holder.  </P> <P> In another culinary showroom, Marjorie Duncan expressed high hopes for the  Chill-n-Go nylon picnic packs from Go Lightly Manufacturing Co. ($19.95 for a  small snack pack to $56.95 for a gourmet pack). These food and beverage picnic  bags are sturdy, comfortable to carry and lightweight. Another high point is  that each is fitted with an easy-closure compartment containing a reusable  chill-pack, which can be removed and frozen until ready to use. The frozen pack  maintains cold temperature of beverages up to seven hours. For quantity orders,  the bags may also be custom printed with your company logo or event. Another  item is the Chill-n-It (from $13.95), a light table-top cooler that keeps  Champagne cool at the table for up to two hours.  </P> <P> Duncan also recommended a new barbecue or chef apron that's made of  machine-washable leather. Flame retardant like the original mitt products, the  apron is manufactured by American Leather Products ($78.95) and designed by  Sandra Asbell. Duncan said she got excellent response from buyers, the majority  of whom ordered black aprons. The other colors were rust, mink and gray.  </P> <P> One product that has received a number of rave reviews from buyers, according  to Darrel Stone of Cookware Specialists, is Halves Inc.'s Wine Preserve  ($39.95). It displaces oxygen, the enemy of opened wine which leaches out  flavors and aromatics in unconsumed bottles. Wine Preserve is a simple  cartridge system that squirts nitrogen into the surface of the wine. Non-toxic  and flavorless, the protective blanket of nitrogen prevents deterioration of  wine up to 30 days after applying.  </P> <P> One nitrogen cartridge will treat approximately 20 bottles of wine, including  Ports and Sherries. In addition to preserving wine, the system also works  effectively for specialty oils and vinegars, exotic teas and coffees.  </P></p>

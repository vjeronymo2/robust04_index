			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Cardoso cruising to easy election victory First results from Brazil's presidential elections on Monday suggested Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister, was set to score an easy victory over his main rival, the left winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. By yesterday afternoon, with about 700,000 votes counted - less than 1 per cent of the total - Mr Cardoso had more than 50 per cent of valid votes cast. This compared with about 23 per cent for Mr da Silva. The results, which mainly came from the country's more developed south, were in line with exit polls released on Monday night, which predicted a nationwide victory for Mr Cardoso by a wide margin. The first results also confirmed opinion poll projections that Mr Cardoso would poll more votes than all his competitors, thereby winning the election outright without the need for a second-round run off. Mr Cardoso was reported to be resting in Sao Paulo state yesterday, and is waiting for more votes to be counted before commenting on the results or claiming victory. Counting is likely to take at least 10 days, but Mr Cardoso is expected to return to Braslia today or tomorrow and give a press conference on his plans as future president. His mandate does not begin until January 1 and he is expected to use the next months to build a cabinet and prepare a number of economic and tax reforms to underpin the Real currency, introduced earlier this year. The exit polls suggested a strong showing for Mr Eneas Carneiro, the far-right candidate who seemed to have appealed to Brazilians seeking to cast a protest vote. He looked set to receive 6 per cent of the votes and finish third, ahead of established politicians such as Mr Orestes Quercia and Mr Leonel Brizola, former governors of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro respectively. In spite of Mr Cardoso's strong showing, some of his political allies appeared to be in trouble. Mr Mario Covas, until recently clear favourite to win the governorship of Sao Paulo, Brazil's most important state, appeared to have lost support and may face a second round run-off. Mr Antonio Britto, who was also expected to easily win the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, also looked to be heading for a surprise second round run-off. Also up for grabs in the elections were 27 state governorships, 54 of 81 Senate seats, all 513 lower house deputies and 1,059 state legislators. Voting was festive and peaceful across the country, although a ban on last-minute campaigning was widely ignored.</p>

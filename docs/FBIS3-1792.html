			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing said here today that China's reform requires a  contingent of advanced professionals.    Li said this in a meeting with some foreign entrepreneurs at  Zhongnanhai, seat of the Chinese Communist Party's Central  Committee and the State Council.    He noted that the trend of China's reform, which cannot be  reversed, is correct, adding that the gate of China can only be  more and more open.    To accelerate China's reform, he said, the key point is to  speed up the training of specialists.    Li met respectively council members of the international  council of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated, John Hunter,  president of the Coca Cola Company International sector, Chung  Se-yong, chairman of Hyundai Business Group, Robert Hormats,  vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, and Lord Griffiths of  Fforestfach.    Li told the visitors, who attended the 40th session of the  J.P. Morgan Council held here from February 27-28, that China  requires more advanced specialists having a good command both of  modern business management and specialized knowledge.    The vice-premier indicated that China is willing to  strengthen international cooperation in the field of personnel  training through various channels.    George Shultz, chairman of the Morgan International Council,  Lee Kuan Yew, member of the council and senior minister of  Singapore, and former British foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey  Howe, took part in the meeting.    When meeting with Hunter, Li said that China's market for  beverages has a great potential, hoping that the Coca Cola  Company would further its cooperation with the Chinese beverage  industry through China National Light Industry Council, and  develop new drinks by using Chinese resources.    As the largest international beverage company, Coca-Cola has  set up 12 bottling factories with a total investment of some 70  million U.S. dollars, since the first factory of the kind was  built in Beijing in 1981.    Hunter said that the purpose of his current visit is to  promote the cooperation between his company and the beverage  industry of China.</p>

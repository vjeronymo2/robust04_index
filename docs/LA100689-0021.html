			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> BRUIN WOMEN STRUGGLE BUT BEAT CARDINAL  </P> <P> The UCLA women's volleyball team, with only two seniors, is young and somewhat  inexperienced. It is also extremely talented, which explains its success.  </P> <P> Seemingly headed for an easy victory over Stanford, their toughest Pacific 10  Conference rival, the Bruins stumbled and bumbled before eventually beating the  Cardinal, 15-7, 14-16, 15-2, 7-15, 15-6, Thursday night before 2,518 fans at  Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> Without taking anything away from Stanford, ranked sixth in the nation, it was  clear that the Bruins, with standouts Daiva Tomkus, Elaine Youngs and Jenny  Evans, still need to become accustomed to each other.  </P> <P> The second-ranked Bruins (10-1 overall, 5-0 in Pac-10) increased their  conference record for consecutive victories to 23. They are 20-9 against the  Cardinal (8-4, 4-2).  </P> <P> Youngs, who led both teams with 20 kills, including two key spikes with the  Bruins leading, 10-6, in the final game, said she was surprised that after  taking the first game so easily the Bruins were forced to go five games, but  admitted that the team still needs a lot of work before realizing its full  potential. "Communication is a key," she said, "and we lost it in the second  and fourth games."  </P> <P> Though they were sloppy at times, Stanford did have its moments. Hitter Kristin  Klein was constantly a thorn in the Bruins side, serving the Cardinal to  victory in the second game and finishing with 19 kills.  </P></p>

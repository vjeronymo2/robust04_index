			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] At the request of the Attorney General's Office,  President Cesar Gaviria today ordered the dismissal of General  Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales, who led the counterattack on the  Justice Palace [which was taken over by the M-19 in November  1985]. Defense Minister [Rafael Pardo] sent a letter to the  attorney general expressing his disagreement with the decision.    Defense Minister Pardo established his ministry's position  on  the dismissal of Gen. Arias Cabrales. He said he will obey the  order but disagrees with it. Why? First, he said that Gen.  Arias Cabrales only fulfilled a legal duty and carried out a  legitimate order from his superiors. Pardo insists that the top  commanders were fully aware of the operation and could have  stopped it.    Second, says Pardo, Gen. Arias Cabrales' responsibility in  the case is not entirely clear because the criminal  investigation has not been concluded that an inquiry ordered by  the prosecutor appointed by the Attorney General's Office is  still pending.    The "National Newscast" has learned that the purpose of this  inquiry is to find out who gave Gen. Arias Cabrales his orders,  who was in the chain of command, and who planned the attack on  the bathroom where several hostages died.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Three men accused of  robbery and murder in the March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy were  sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life  here today.    The judgment of first instance was made earlier today by the  intermediate people's court of Hangzhou city in east China's  Zhejiang Province.    The court ruled that the facts of the crimes were clear and  the evidence was complete.    The court verdict, read out by Yang Gang, president of the  intermediate people's court of Hangzhou city, said that Wu  Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun had committed robbery and murder  in the boat-fire tragedy, which claimed the lives of 24 Taiwan  tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, a major  tourist attraction in Zhejiang Province.    It said that the three men seized large quantities of the  tourists' property by threatening them with violence and then  murdered the victims by blowing up the boat and setting fire to  it to cover up the crime, and the punishment was for both  robbery and murder.    The court turned down the defence lawyers' appeal for  lenient  punishment, because the crimes were very serious, cruel and  caused great harm to the society.    The court also ordered that the robbed goods and money be  returned to relatives of the victims, and the motor boat used by  the criminals be confiscated and turned over to the state.    According to law, the three accused can appeal, either  through the intermediate court of Hangzhou city or directly, to  the higher people's court of Zhejiang Province within three days  after they received the verdicts, which had already been handed  to them today.    More than 200 people were present to hear the judgment at  the  court today, including local residents, relatives of victims  from the mainland, and representatives of the Soaring Travel  Service of Taiwan.</p>

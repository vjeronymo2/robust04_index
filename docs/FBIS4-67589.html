			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jean-Francois Augereau report: "COGEMA Will Be Able To </F> Reprocess 1,600 Tonnes of Nuclear Fuel Per Year"]    [Text] The government has just given the go-ahead to the  opening of the latest units in the second nuclear fuel  reprocessing plant in La Hague (Manche). This new unit, with an  annual capacity of 800 tonnes, should come into production this  summer and reach its nominal power in 1996. It will be entirely  dedicated to fuel from the EDF [French Electricity Company]  power stations.    The General Nuclear Materials Company (COGEMA) has just  received from Industry Minister Gerard Longuet and Environment  Minister Michel Barnier permission to start up the latest units  of its new UP2-800 irradiated fuel reprocessing plant in La  Hague (Manche). This decision is the latest stage in the program  to extend the reprocessing capabilities of the La Hague plant  launched in 1979.    Henceforth COGEMA has two factories, each with a capacity of  800 tonnes, on this nuclear site situated at the extremity of  the La Manche departement, a few kilometers from Cherbourg. The  first, UP3, which came into service on 23 August 1990, is an  ultramodern plant, valued at 27.8 billion francs [Fr], the cost  of which was virtually completely funded by the contracts which  27 foreign electricity companies have signed with COGEMA for the  reprocessing of around 7,000 tonnes of nuclear fuel.  <H5>  EDF Contract </H5>   The implementation of these contracts, which has already  begun, had prompted some anger in November 1992 when France  delivered 1.5 tonnes of plutonium to the Japanese authorities.  Between now and the year 2000, around 20 tonnes of plutonium  should leave for Japan, because it is the very function of  reprocessing nuclear fuel to sort through the "ashes" left by  the reactors to find the reusable pure material (96 percent  uranium and 1 percent plutonium) in the waste proper (3 percent).    Although foreign reprocessing requirements are fulfilled by  the operation of UP3, at present the only factory in the world  capable of reprocessing on an industrial scale, EDF's  requirements should be fulfilled by the very new UP2-800 plant.  Moreover, EDF has signed a contract with COGEMA for the  reprocessing of 8,400 tonnes of fuel from its pressurized water  reactor (PWR) nuclear power stations.    Around Fr30 billion has been spent (the difference in price  between the two factories is partly due to taking account of  inflation) to equip this new unit, which was built on the  remains of the former UP-2 plant which reprocessed its first  barrel of fuel in June 1966, but which experienced real problems  during its conversion for the reprocessing the PWR fuel in the  eighties. It then only slowly reached its nominal production  capability set at 400 tonnes per year.  <H5>  Installation Rethought </H5>   UP2-800 is, however, an installation which has been entirely  rethought, virtually an identical copy of UP3, but which has  benefited from the experience of this factory which, so far, has  reprocessed a little more than 1,900 tonnes of foreign used  fuel. But it differs from it slightly in that in the future it  will have to reprocess relatively limited tonnages of other  kinds of fuel known as mixed uranium-plutonium fuels (MOX).    Taking this MOX reprocessing into account in the UP2-800  concept made it necessary to think in advance about process  modifications because of the presence of bigger quantities of  plutonium in the installation. Therefore, there is already a  plan to build a factory known as R-4, which will make it  possible, in particular, to run that process. It could start  around the year 2000 and, according to COGEMA, presupposes "a  technological leap forward if we wish to keep reprocessing costs  down."    This concern seems particularly legitimate because, after  the  lifting of many legal obstacles, Britain is starting up its  Thorp plant worth 2.8 billion pounds (around Fr25 billion)  situated in Sellafield in northwest Britain. But, although  COGEMA is no longer alone on the reprocessing market because of  this competition, the announcement of the launch of UP2-800 will  undoubtedly revive the controversy over the value of  reprocessing used fuel.</p>

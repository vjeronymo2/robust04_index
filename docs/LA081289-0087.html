			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA TELLING CONTRAS THEIR CHIEFS ARE QUITTING; U.S., REBEL AIDES DENY IT  </P> <P> The Sandinista army, moving quickly to sow confusion among the Contras, has  instructed its field units to spread word that the rebel command structure is  collapsing in the wake of a Central American agreement to disband the  U.S.-backed movement.  </P> <P> The orders, published here Friday, are the first step in a campaign to woo  rebel foot soldiers home under terms of the regional peace accord. They were  issued after the Contra army's chief of staff and eight other officers applied  for political asylum in the United States.  </P> <P> State Department and Contra spokesmen denied that the rebel leaders were  abandoning their troops, saying that the asylum petitions were being granted to  make them eligible for U.S. travel documents that facilitate movement around  Central America on behalf of the anti-Sandinista cause.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Left Without Command'  </P> <P> But the message from Gen. Humberto Ortega, defense minister and commander of  the Nicaraguan army, said that the Contra troops have been "left practically  without command or direction" and should be approached with offers of amnesty,  personal security, land and economic aid if they disarm.  </P> <P> "The supposed leaders (of the Contras) have assured their own political asylum,  leaving the troops adrift in another display of opportunism, irresponsibility  and cowardice," the Sandinista newspaper Barricada commented Friday.  </P> <P> Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as Commander Franklin, countered  with a statement to Radio Impacto, a Costa Rican station with close ties to the  rebel movement. Interviewed in Miami, Galeano declared that "the struggle will  continue," and a spokesman said he later boarded a flight to Honduras to return  to the rebel camps there.  </P> <P> "Galeano has not been fighting eight years just to get a green card," said the  spokesman, Bosco Matamoros.  </P> <P> The propaganda war is expected to intensify in the coming weeks as rebel  leaders try to keep intact their army, weakened by more than a year of  cease-fires and regional peace efforts, and as the Sandinistas try to hasten  its dismemberment.  </P> <P> Under the summit accord signed Monday by the presidents of Costa Rica, El  Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, an international commission is to  be named by the United Nations and the Organization of American States and sent  to the rebels' Honduran camps by Sept. 6. The commission would then have 90  days to achieve what the accord calls the "voluntary" disarmament and  relocation of the rebels to Nicaragua or other countries. By Dec. 5, the  Honduran camps would have to close.  </P> <P> Contra leaders say they will try to keep their current force of 11,000 troops  in Honduras while seeking still-undefined political concessions from the  Sandinistas in talks to be set up by the commission. They say they might deploy  many of those troops into Nicaragua before the December deadline rather than  disarm.  </P> <P> Gen. Ortega's message focused on the 2,000 to 3,000 Contra troops already  inside Nicaragua. It instructed the army to act with "discipline and  responsibility" to protect the rights of any who choose to disarm but to be  ready to "repel vigorously" any attack.  </P> <P> He said the government will encourage a revival of independent local peace  councils, made up of church and community representatives, in the war zones.  Scores of such councils sprang up two years ago when the Central American  presidents began working to end the Contra war, but they failed to persuade  many rebels to lay down their arms.  </P> <P> "This is not the first time our troops are the target of psychological warfare  by the Sandinistas," said Xavier Arguello, an adviser to the Contras'  political-military commission. "Obviously, it could be demoralizing if their  commanders are seen as retreating from the struggle, but I am not worried about  morale. The vast majority are not going to be deceived."  </P> <P> But some U.S. officials and other Contra leaders said they fear the summit  accord will prompt most of the rebels to quit and try to enter the United  States. "We'll probably end up with about 40% of the troops staying, no more,"  one rebel official estimated.  </P> <P> Contra leaders are quietly asking how many rank-and-file soldiers will be  allowed to settle in the United States as refugees, but so far the Bush  Administration has not stated a policy.  </P> <P> The nine rebels who applied for U.S. asylum Wednesday include six military  commanders and three political advisers who had gone to Washington on Honduran  travel documents before the summit to lobby for their cause.  </P> <P> Galeano and two others were given asylum Thursday, allowing them to move their  families to the United States, work there and apply for permanent status. U.S.  officials said the other requests would be approved, enabling them all to  travel more easily in Central America than they can on the Honduran documents.  </P> <P> "It is their intention to travel throughout the region to present their views  and assist in any negotiations" on their army's future, State Department  spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Norman Kempster and Doyle McManus, in Washington,  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A team of Nigerian military personnel has arrived in  Freetown to train and reorganize the Sierra Leonean Armed  Forces. The 32-member team is led by Brigadier General (Seidu  Zubiru).    Addressing newsmen in Lagos, the director of defense  information, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, said the team will  be in Sierra Leone for an initial period of two years. He said  the exercise was at the instance of Sierra Leone Government,  adding that more African countries were also requesting similar  military assistance from Nigeria.    Meanwhile, about 200 Nigerians residing in Sierra Leone were  flown into Lagos last night, in a Nigerian Air Force plane,  following renewed fighting by government and rebel forces in  that country. They are mainly children and women. A radio  Nigeria correspondent reports that some of them came with little  or no luggage, saying that they had been dispossessed of their  belongings.</p>

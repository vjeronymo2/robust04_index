			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORITIES, DRUG USERS TARGETS OF AIDS RESEARCH  </P> <P> Federal health officials, in an "outreach" attempt to make AIDS clinical  research accessible to minorities, women and intravenous drug abusers, Thursday  announced $9 million in contracts to AIDS community-based programs in 14  cities.  </P> <P> "We look upon this as science at the community level," said federal AIDS chief  Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.  </P> <P> Fauci said at a press conference that the programs are intended to produce  valid scientific data from "non-traditional" sources. He said that they will  draw on the expertise of health workers in local clinics and other facilities  already treating AIDS patients. The hope, he said, is to include AIDS patients  previously under-represented in traditional studies typically carried out at  large academic medical centers.  </P> <P> "As (AIDS) infection has spread among blacks, Hispanics, intravenous drug  users, women and children, we at the NIAID have felt a particular urgency to  reach out to people in these groups and offer them the opportunity to  participate in clinical research," Fauci said.  </P> <P> But some groups were angry that they did not receive grants funding their  proposals. The New York-based Community Research Initiative, which is  considered a pioneer, was one of the groups whose proposal was not funded. CRI,  along with the County Community Consortium of San Francisco, contributed data  that led to the recent federal approval of aerosol pentamidine to prevent  pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a life-threatening AIDS infection. The  consortium, however, did receive a grant.  </P> <P> Michael Callen, president of CRI, complained that his group's exclusion was a  "politically motivated slap," by NIAID. But he said that his program "will  survive without NIAID funding."  </P> <P> The American Foundation for AIDS Research criticized the selections as programs  that were "not truly community-based."  </P> <P> "We have a different definition of community-based clinical research," said  David Corkery, a spokesman for AMFAR. "Many of the groups that were funded were  either university-based, or hospitals."  </P> <P> Fauci said that the programs were chosen by "peer-review" committees composed  of community clinicians, nurses, social workers, researchers, people infected  with human immunodeficiency virus and "representatives of the groups now  under-represented in clinical trials." The committees "scored" the proposals,  and those with the highest scores were selected. The contracts are for five  years, with $9 million funded for the first year.  </P> <P> Jean McGuire of the AIDS Action Council, who sat on one review committee, said  that she was not involved in evaluating CRI's proposal but said that the review  process was "rigorous and equitable" but "there just wasn't enough money to go  around."  </P> <P> Fauci admitted he was surprised that CRI was not selected, so much so that he  called a special staff meeting to find out why. "I was very concerned. . . . I  would have liked to see CRI get funded, I really would have. But I saw their  score clearly put them out of the fundable range." He said he could not  publicly disclose the reasons for the decision.  </P> <P> Dr. Neil Schram, a Harbor City, Calif., physician who heads the AIDS task force  for the American Assn. of Physicians for Human Rights, decried the lack of  funding for other gay-identified groups in addition to CRI, such as the  Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington and the Fenway Health Center in Boston.  </P> <P> "The whole idea behind community-based research is to involve the doctors on  the front lines," he said. Gay doctors "are where the patients are and where  the experience is," he added.  </P> <P> No Los Angeles programs were funded.  </P> <P> Staff writer Victor F. Zonana in San Francisco contributed to this story.  </P></p>

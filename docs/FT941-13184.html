			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Unicef criticises economic reform's high human cost Economic and social reforms in central and eastern Europe have proved far more costly in human terms than originally anticipated, with a massive rise in poverty and widespread social disintegration, the United Nations Children's Fund says in a report* published yesterday. Presenting the report in Geneva, Mr James Grant, Unicef's executive director, said immediate action was needed to minimise and compensate for the human cost of reform measures. While reforms were necessary, policymakers had focused almost exclusively on economic issues to the detriment of social concerns, he said. He also criticised bilateral aid programmes for the region which he said were all too often driven by short-term commercial interests rather than the needs of the receiving country. The report, which documents the impact of the economic slump on living conditions in nine countries since 1989, points out that while all have suffered the negative effects of reforms the crisis is most pronounced in eastern and south-eastern Europe. There, the spread of poverty, surging death rates, plunging birth rates, falling school enrolment and an unstoppable crime wave have reached 'truly alarming proportions'. 'These costs are not only the cause of unnecessary suffering and waste of human lives but also represent a source of considerable instability and social conflict that could threaten the entire reform process,' Unicef argues. Crude death rates (for the population as a whole) were up 9 per cent in Romania, 12 per cent in Bulgaria and 32 per cent in Russia. Between 1989 and 1993 the yearly number of deaths in Russia rose by more than 500,000. Mr Giovanni Andrea Cornia, principal author of the report, said the increase was partly due to the spread of infectious diseases such as diphtheria and tuberculosis as immunisation programmes lapsed. There has also been a serious rise in deaths from accidents, poisonings and murder. In Poland the number of suicides rose by one-third between 1989 and 1992. Unicef notes that, although there are some signs of recovery in certain areas, only the Czech Republic appears to be slowly returning to normal. In Romania, Russia, Ukraine and, to some extent, Bulgaria the crisis is deepening. * Public policy and social conditions, available from Unicef International Child Development Centre, Piazza Santissima Annunziata 12, Florence, Italy</p>

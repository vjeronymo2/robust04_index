			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Silver lining to a year of drama and cost - Volvo Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, will on Thursday report its results for 1993 - a year in which it forged a merger with France's Renault only to renege on the deal in December. The immediate impact of the merger's collapse - and the subsequent unravelling of a three-year-old alliance - will be to drag Volvo down to a pre-tax loss for the third time in four years. This will follow the SKr3.3bn (Pounds 280m) pre-tax loss incurred in 1992. Volvo said last month that it would write off SKr5.2bn against 1993 earnings in goodwill and provisions related to the dismantling of cross holdings in the state-owned French company. But Volvo will direct attention towards a much more favourable underlying picture of rapidly rising operating profits. One Stockholm analyst predicts a profit before write-downs and minority items of almost SKr2.7bn. Volvo has benefited from a number of favourable factors. The pay-off from the krona's devaluation is coming through strongly, new model development costs are at a low point and sales are picking up in Sweden, the US and the UK. But shareholders will have to wait until the annual meeting in April for answers to the more worrying question of what its long-term strategy will be now that it is without a partner in the tough motor industry world.</p>

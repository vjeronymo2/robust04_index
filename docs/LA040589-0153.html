			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. ACCUSED OF OIL SPILL COVER-UP  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine today accused the federal government of  hiding from the nation the possibility of a major oil spill and the  ineffectiveness of clean-up technology.  </P> <P> The California Democrats blamed the Reagan Administration for what they called  a cover-up and asked President Bush to cancel further oil leasing off the  California coast pending a complete review of the program.  </P> <P> Levine released internal memoranda from the Reagan Administration on the  proposed lease sale in Northern California that he said revealed the likelihood  of a major spill, other adverse effects on the environment and an attempt to  whitewash the information.  </P></p>

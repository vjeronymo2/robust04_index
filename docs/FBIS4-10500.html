			<p>BFN     [Text] Respect for the human rights of those arrested on  drug trafficking charges in the Upper Huallaga zone is no longer  a cold guideline given by the military and police commands. It  is now a conscientious action taken by all members of the Army  and the National Police operating in that part of the Peruvian  jungle.    On 2 April in San Martin, an inhospitable area in the  Tarapoto jungle, a Dinandro [National Antidrug Division] patrol  supported by the Air Police detected a lab for processing  cocaine base and acted by surprise. Not even the torrential rain  or the thunderstorm stopped police, who arrested five people.    After the operation, police seized 128 kg of cocaine base,  many ingredients for making the drug, and a shotgun.    Back at the Tarapoto airport the arrested were taken to the  police station. The police then, without knowing reporters were  present, gave the arrested soft drinks and their own food  rations they used in their operations.    None of the arrested showed signs of violence on their  bodies  when they were put under the jurisdiction of judicial officials.  They also never complained about being mistreated by police.    A police sergeant said: "We always respect the rights of the  people we arrest, even under the most adverse circumstances  after they use their weapons on us and we capture them."    This National Police action, without the tempting presence  of  cameras and microphones, shows that human rights are indeed  respected in Peru and that there is no need for "spokesmen"  abroad to report alleged human rights violations. The real  situation is in that remote region where perhaps one of those  "spokesmen" never saw what happened.</p>

The minister is aware that these debts were the result of  regional and international circumstances that forced Jordan--due  to its position--to bear the consequences of these circumstances.    The instability in the region, whose responsibility is  shouldered by the entire international community, forced Jordan  to be on the longest Arab front with Israel. This exhausted a  huge portion of the loans Jordan was forced to seek.    At a time when Israel was receiving all forms of support  from  the United States and the allied countries, including France,  Jordan was not receiving even the Arab assistance decided by  Arab summit conferences, whose decisions were not respected.  Jordan's share of international support was below what is  needed although Jordan was a main victim of the Western allies'  support for Israel and the Cold War between the Eastern and  Western blocs.    Juppe emphasized that his country will support the  rescheduling of Jordan's debts, and the United States had  earlier announced that it was seriously studying economic and  military support for Jordan. We hope that these encouraging  signs would be implemented in order to compensate this country  for the losses caused by circumstances that Jordan did not  create and for which it is not responsible. Based on its  position, message, and principles, Jordan remained committed to  its principles and endured the consequences of such commitment  and the duties stipulated in the pan-Arab and international  charters.    Jordan stands as a main test for the international good  intentions toward stability and justice in the Middle East. The  more Jordan is compensated for its debts and burden caused by  instability and lack of justice, the more the international  intentions toward the region and the future relations with it  would be in the right direction.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Major's political secretary to leave Mr Jonathan Hill is to stand down as political secretary to the prime minister amid signs that Mr John Major wishes to revamp his team of personal advisers in the run-up to the next election. Mr Hill has held the job since 1992. He is one of the longest serving members of the Downing Street staff, having been an important figure in political strategy and planning for more than four years. However, colleagues have said that he lacks inside experience at Westminster and there have been indications that Mr Major is looking for a more heavyweight figure. Mr Hill took over as political secretary from the late Mrs Judith Chaplin, who later became MP for Newbury. Unlike departmental special advisers, the political secretaryship at No 10 is not a civil service post and is paid for out of Conservative party funds.</p>

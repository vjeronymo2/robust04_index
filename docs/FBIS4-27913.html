			<p>CSO     [Text] International Telecommunications of Japan (ITJ; Chuo  ward, Tokyo; Hiroshi Ohara, president), a new international  common carrier, will begin offering international video data  transmission services within the year. It will aim to provide  low-cost transmission services through the use of digital  transmission using what is called the "C-band." In the past,  international video data transmission was monopolized by Kokusai  Denshin Denwa (KDD), but it appears that lower rates will go  into effect with the participation of ITJ.    On the 30th, ITJ and Fuji Television conducted a joint  experiment in transmitting digital data between Japan and the  United States. A tracking and data relay system (TDRS) satellite  and digital receiving facilities owned by Columbia  Communications was used to transmit animated images from an  Earth satellite station located in Washington State to Fuji  Television headquarters in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo.    "C-band" operates at a frequency where attenuation  distortion  is minimal during rainfall. The recent experiment involved the  use of the "Ku-band" because of the fear of jamming in the case  of Earthbound radio waves in Japan, and demonstrated the  commercial feasibility of receiving services.</p>

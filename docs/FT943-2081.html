			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: Comedy gets the specialist treatment - Television Comedy on television today is far more varied than it used to be which is surely a good thing. However, even more than most programme areas, comedy is becoming subject to political correctness which is surely a bad thing. If you doubt the increased breadth of comedy consider It's Just A Ride, the tribute to the late Bill Hicks screened 10 days ago by Channel 4. Even 10 years ago it would have been unthinkable for any channel to transmit this. True, there was little, if anything, from Hicks' own material in this programme which had not already been shown in the last few years on British television, albeit late at night, but even on a second viewing it still had the power to surprise. Many would describe Hicks, who died earlier this year at the age of 32, as foul mouthed, and it is true that he used four letter words with a frequency which virtually drained them of value. That alone would have kept him off television until recently. But Hicks' value was as a social commentator, even if some people found his material more painful than funny. He was a comedian in the tradition of Lenny Bruce and all those licensed jesters down the centuries who have used their position and their flair to show us unpleasant truths about ourselves and our societies. One of his fellow comedians, paying tribute in this programme, said 'With me, I'd do a joke, then a little bit of truth; a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. But with Bill there weren't no spoonful of sugar'. That is undeniable and consequently watching Hicks could be uncomfortable, but the significant point is that today viewers can see what was prohibited 10 years ago, and that is progress. Anyone offended by his language could switch off at the first swear word. Nor is the increased variety in comedy merely a question of access to 'stronger' material. Where there used to be only two categories - situation comedy and stand up comedy - we now have shows such as Have I Got News For You, Whose Line Is It Anyway? and Clive Anderson Talks Back. Anderson began a new series on Friday with an edition that showed off all his strengths: funny and flirtatious with Goldie Hawn and startlingly honest with football expert Jimmy Hill and comedian Jim Davidson, who readily admitted that he was willing to ridicule anyone - 'Welsh women with beards, black people, daft Irish' and so on. In this, Davidson now looks daringly old fashioned, even shocking, because comedy is rapidly becoming the paradigm of political correctness. The irony is that apartheid ('separate development'), so recently the number one hate on every liberal agenda, is now being positively - some would say obsessively - pursued by supposedly liberal broadcasters. We are given a separatist comedy programme for gays, and a special enclave is set aside for black comedians so that they can develop their own material within their own culture, uncontaminated by whites. At this rate it will take the broadcasters very little time before they start providing special series of the sort described with such scorn by the late James Cameron (yes, lovely liberal Mr Cameron - after all his years as a war reporter he saw humanity with a sad but clear eye). When Channel 4 began, he declared that its more 'specialised' output seemed to be aimed at 'black lesbian social workers living in Hull'. If you really did make such a programme the target audience would probably give it a phenomenally high 'RI' or Reaction Index, which is the researchers' calculation of the viewers' appreciation of a programme. This has always shown that the more specialised the appeal, the higher the RI. Steam train freaks appreciate steam train programmes even more than soap fans like Coronation Street. But however much homosexuals liked Channel 4's Just For Laughs: The Queer Comics, and however much black people may enjoy BBC2's black enclave The Real McCoy (well, some homosexuals and some black people, anyway), they constitute only a minority of the viewing population. In fulfilling their desires, what are the broadcasters doing to everybody else? For straight viewers Just For Laughs managed to be simultaneously embarrassingly over defensive and irritatingly arrogant. On the one hand, gays wanted pity because even their own parents did not understand them, and on the other hand homosexual men want to be seen as superior to straight men for all sorts of reasons - they understand women so well, for instance. The Real McCoy, which excludes white people, features some performers who certainly could hold their end up in a multiracial talent contest and others who seem to get into this programme solely because their patois or some other aspect of their material ensures that they will not be understood by whites. No doubt the broadcasters would claim indignantly that their motives in making these programmes were of the highest, designed solely with the interests of frequently persecuted groups in mind - precisely the claim made by South Africa's late white government. But whether preached in Johannesburg or London, the argument suffers from the same innate condescension, the unspoken assumption that members of the group concerned are incapable of making their way in the world without special treatment. The odd thing about this belief, seemingly so widespread among broadcasters today, is that all the evidence is against it. You only have to have one Julian Clary starring in his own very explicitly homosexual series, and one clearly black Lenny Henry starring in his, to prove that those with talent can succeed regardless of whatever minority they may belong to. When the non-black, non-homosexual viewing majority see the success achieved by Clary and Henry without recourse to any special enclaves, what are they expected to think about the abilities of those selected by the broadcasters to appear in their blacks-only or gays-only programmes? The answer seems unavoidable.</p>

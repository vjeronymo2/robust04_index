			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The head of a government  tax panel indicated Friday [15 April] his support for adopting a  new regional tax instead of simply raising the consumption tax  as a new tax revenue source.    "It could be a tax on consumption...but new thinking is  necessary," Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, an  advisory panel to the prime minister, told reporters after a  panel meeting.    Noting that the views were personal, Kato, emeritus  professor  at Keio University, said regional governments need their own tax  sources to decentralize national authority and to improve  regional social welfare.    His proposal apparently stems from a welfare tax plan that  called for permanent cuts in national income and regional  residents' taxes to offset a 7 percent welfare tax, which was  proposed to replace the 3 percent consumption tax.    Under the current consumption tax system, the national  government collects the tax and distributes a given amount as  tax grants to regional governments.    The plan drew strong opposition from the Social Democratic  Party (SDP) -- The largest of the ruling coalition parties --  and was scrapped a day after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  announced it in February.    But the SDP has recently relaxed its stance on accepting a  higher consumption tax in view of increasing welfare costs amid  an aging society.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii maintained his opposition to  a regional consumption tax in his recent press meeting.    Kato said the issue will be discussed thoroughly at a  working  group for regional tax that was officially formed at Friday's  panel meeting.    The group of 11 private experts will hold its first meeting  on Tuesday, aiming to issue a report in May, Kato said.    The panel meeting centered on burden sharing between tax and  social insurance in line with a welfare vision for the 21st  century that was compiled by an advisory forum to the health and  welfare ministry in March, Kato said.    He noted the panel will next meet on April 22 to continue  studying welfare from broader aspects.    In line with requests made by Hosokawa at the first meeting  on April 8, the commission is discussing permanent income and  residents' tax cuts and net tax increases to realize a balanced  tax system to cope with an aging society.    A final report offering several options for politicians to  decide later is slated for issue in June.</p>

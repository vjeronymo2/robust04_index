			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "At the First Hour" newscast] </F>   [Text] Subcommander Marcos held a news conference for the  U.S. media on 28 March; during this news conference, he  requested U.S. aid:    [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording, in English] We want  the  U.S. people to help us with medicines, clothes, milk, but the  first and most important thing we want is for them to know the  right reason for our struggle.    We think the Clinton administration is upset about us. They  do not know if there is really no foreign nation behind us. I  think the computer of the CIA and the FBI and the State  Department they do not have any response [sentence as heard].  They put in the computer: Subcommander Marcos, he has a big  nose. They put these facts in the computer, and there is no  answer, because there is no more Soviet Union, the Cubans are  cornered. The people's struggle in Central America, they are  behind history and the computer there is mad. [sentence as  heard] It is crazy about us. Maybe they are looking for  Subcommander Marcos' past. Was he in the Soviet Union, Havana,  Managua, Mexico, Tepito? [end recording]</p>

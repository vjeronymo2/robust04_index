			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Letessier: "The Post-GATT Era Has Begun"] </F>   [Text] International trade following the Uruguay  Round negotiations--a new factor? While Peter Sutherland, the  director general of the GATT is meeting with the officials of  the European Union today to discuss the implementation of the  agreement signed last 15 December, LE QUOTIDIEN is studying  their impact on the French economy, sector by sector, and  analyzing the prospects for the post-GATT period. The conclusion  is that France emerges from the fray rather well, but the war  will continue.  <H5>  The Stakes in Industry and Agriculture </H5>   "I will be following up on the commitments made by our  partners with particular care," Gerard Longuet said last  Wednesday [12 January] on the occasion of his announcement of  the "consolidation of the GATT accords" as one of his goals for  1994. The minister of industry and foreign trade was commenting  on the document published by his staff on the results of the  Uruguay Round negotiations.    Is it too soon to make an evaluation? Matters will change  further between now and 15 April. Some countries have not yet  finalized all of their offers with regard to the lowering of  their customs duties. The participants have until the spring to  submit new proposals more favorable to free trade. But the  essentials have been established. France, for example, has  reached final agreements with its 25 main trade partners. A  global agreement was necessary. Now, it must be admitted that  the success achieved in this realm is not complete. Certain  sectors are still covered by separate agreements, if indeed they  have not been completely excluded from the areas covered by the  final Uruguay Round negotiation documents. Where these  agreements are concerned, talks will have to be continued in the  coming months, or even years. Maritime transportation, aviation,  and the audiovisual media are the sectors mainly involved. This  has led some to say that these are the sensitive issues that  have vitiated the general agreement. No fair judgment of the  scope of the accords will be possible until after their actual  implementation, but a first assessment can now be drafted. It  appears that some Third World countries are particularly  displeased with the agreements, as is the case with India. "I  have never heard such negative talk following an international  agreement," Jean-Francois Boitin, deputy director of the  Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE) at the Ministry  of Finance admits. According to this highly placed French  official who has followed the negotiations closely, the  situation is relatively clear. "If I were the negotiator for one  of the developing countries, I would be rather unhappy with the  cavalier procedure used. On 14 December, an U.S.-European  agreement was presented, with the other countries being given 24  hours to approve it." But the GATT is not the only tool for  promoting free trade. The financial aid provided by the  International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to the countries  of the Third World is regularly accompanied by "firm  encouragement" to open up their frontiers and to reduce customs  barriers.    LE QUOTIDIEN has attempted to determine what the situation  is, sector by sector, in order to analyze the advantages the  signatory nations might derive therefrom and to identify the  stakes involved in the coming years.</p>

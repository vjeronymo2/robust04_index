			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> correspondent Mahir Shalabi in Jerusalem from the Face-to-Face  program, in English with superimposed Arabic translation; date  not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, the  Clinton-al-Asad summit has given an impetus to the peace  opportunities between Syria and Israel. After the summit, you  declared that the withdrawals from the Golan would be subjected  to a public referendum. Are you not erecting obstacles to the  chances for peace with Syria?    [Rabin] No, I don't think so, because I believe that the  people of Israel are interested in achieving peace with the  Palestinians in the way that we have been pursuing since the  signing of the Declaration of Principles in Washington, and with  Syria because of its strategic importance and its influence in  what is going on in Lebanon, and in a more limited way with  Jordan.    Furthermore, I believe that the Syrian leadership and people  need peace. But this is not enough for Israel. The Syrian  leadership is responsible for convincing the Israeli Government  and people that Syria indeed means peace. I don't expect the  Syrian leadership to do the same thing that President al-Sadat  did to convince the Israeli people that he wanted peace. No  doubt -- in my opinion -- Al-Sadat's presence in Jerusalem  accomplished 80 or 90 percent of the work of former Israeli  prime minister Menahem Begin in convincing the Israeli people  that Egypt wanted peace. This made it easy for the Israeli  Government to pay a high price for peace.    We are involved in negotiations with Syria but they are not  being held in the same way that we had our negotiations with  Egypt. But at the same time, Syria is not making much of an  effort to reduce the terrorist activities of Hizballah against  Israel. Therefore, the issue is very important to the people of  Israel. I believe that there is democratic life in Israel and  that on certain issues the opinions of the people must be taken  into account. I did not do that when I signed the Declaration  of Principles document with the PLO. I do not intend to do that  when the Declaration of Principles Accord is implemented with  regard to the Gaza-Jericho First and then regarding the  subsequent stage. As for Syria, the issue is much more  important.    [Shalabi] How do you expect the Syrian side to carry out  confidence-building steps when at the same time you are accusing  the Syrians of supporting Hizballah?    [Rabin] I believe that in July, the Lebanese Government was  prepared to deploy 3,000 Lebanese troops in south Lebanon, north  of the security zone, alongside the South Lebanese Army, to  prove that they could prevent terrorism. If, after six month of  deployment, the Lebanese Army an prove it is capable of  preventing terrorist activities and disarming Hizballah, I am  prepared to sign a peace treaty based on the international  borders that existed during the British mandate. This treaty  would produce security arrangements and would confirm to the  Lebanese who cooperate with us in the security zone that they  will not be harmed and that no actions will be taken against  them beyond those taken against the other militias, which were  disarmed by the Lebanese Government over the past one and a half  years. Therefore, there is no reason not to have peace with  Lebanon.    [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, the recent incidents in  Lebanon have led to calls by the Israeli right to launch a  large-scale attack against the Hizballah. What is your opinion  on this?    [Rabin] I do not want to specify what kind of military  operations we will conduct in the future. I think that the  method and policy I pursued when I served as defense minister in  the National Unity Government in 1985 are the same today. A new  war in Lebanon will lead to nowhere. At the same time, we will  maintain freedom of military activities whenever and wherever we  find it necessary against Hizballah targets all over Lebanon.    [Shalabi] So, do you expect the situation to remain the same  in southern Lebanon until a settlement is reached with Syria?    [Rabin] I believe that a solution to the problem between  Lebanon and Israel is a peace agreement when the Lebanese  Government, with the support of Syria, is able to prove that it  is in full in control of all Lebanese sovereign areas. As I  said before, let the test be six months from the time the  Lebanese forces have deployed and have taken action against  Hizballah and show that they are capable of doing that. Once  they have proven that, you know that there is no territorial  problem between Israel and Lebanon. We do not want an inch of  the sovereign soil of Lebanon. We do not want one cubic meter of  it. All what we want is peace and security, and to give the  option to the Lebanese Government to prove its ability to  control its sovereign soil and prevent the use of its territory  as a springboard for attacks against Israel. [passage omitted]    [Shalabi] There are reports of a decision to release about  2,000 Palestinian detainees. Is this true?    [Rabin] No. We made it clear that the release of the  prisoners and the detainees, particularly the detainees, will  take place together with the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  First agreement, after they are separated in groups. There are  groups of Palestinian prisoners who have killed Israelis, and I  do not think that they will be released. Furthermore, we have  our own demands to make of the Palestinians. For example, we  have three soldiers who have been missing since the June 1982  war who were killed [as heard] in a clash with a Palestinian  force under Syrian command. We expect the PLO to indicate their  whereabouts and whether they are alive or not. We need  cooperation on the part of the Palestinians. The demand cannot  be one-sided. We want a responsible position from the  Palestinian side regarding the missing.    [Shalabi] Regarding this particular point, there are reports  about hundreds of Palestinians missing since 1967 who are being  held in Israeli prisons. Is there any truth in that?    [Rabin] We cannot keep anyone in any Israeli prison without  announcing it; our laws demand this. Anyone who violates these  laws will be brought to trial.    [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, after the Madrid conference,  everybody has been talking about a new Middle East. How do you  see it from your standpoint?    [Rabin] I hope that once we reach an agreement with the  three neighboring states--Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon--in  addition to the peace with Egypt--the 15th anniversary of which  we are celebrating these days--and the start of the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles with the  Palestinians, there will be a better chance to check the  activities of the extremist Islamic groups that are threatening  the moderate regimes in the Arab world. This will lead to a new  Middle East and a better climate for cooperation among the  countries and peoples of the area for the benefit and progress  of all the peoples and the countries of this area.    [Shalabi] Thank you very much.</p>

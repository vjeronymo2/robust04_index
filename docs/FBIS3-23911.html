			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Zolotonosov: "A Carefully Selected Fifth </F> Class"]    [Text] Judging by the fact that on the day of the so-called  "communications workers strike" Channel 5 was operating as  usual, communications workers in Petersburg had received payment  due from their television center on time. This is good, of  course. But this also leads one to assume that Channel 5  management has some special ways of getting money.  And having made this assumption, one simply has to go one step  further in this reasoning.    The impression came through as early as 1990 (and  intensified  as years went by) that it was thanks to Kurkova and Channel 5  that Boris Nikolayevich became chairman of the RSFSR Supreme  Soviet; that it was specifically for Kurkova's live  broadcasts that Yeltsin was coming to Leningrad to speak to  the people. Since it is hard to suspect Yeltsin of ingratitude,  one has to advance the hypothesis that his kindness toward  Kurkova continues to this day--when the decline in the quality  of Channel 5 broadcasting has reached catastrophic proportions,  and the question of removing the chairman could not fail to come  up, among other reasons because of the precarious decline in  Petersburg TV ratings. But since B. Kurkova continues on her  job, even under these circumstances, and does not let go of the  microphone, one is left with an assumption that the Boss, not  knowing how events will be developing, whether he will run in  presidential elections in 1996, and in whose favor the odds will  be tilting, may be using the same logic as Emperor Paul I in the  short story "Second Lieutenant Kizhe": "We should hold off  burdening him with a division. He is needed for more important  things." That is: do not promote, do not transfer to Moscow; she  will still be needed in Petersburg, right there at Channel 5.    Apparently for the same reason the "maker of politicians"  and  "charisma-builder" is permitted to sit in two "cushy chairs"  simultaneously: She is also the chairman of the St. Petersburg  board of directors within the All-Russia State Television and  Radio Company, a de facto first deputy to Oleg Poptsov. Only old  comrades-in-battle are rewarded this generously. By the way, I  am curious: Can one state employee be the head of two state  organizations at the same time?    We also have to take into account one more important person  in this story--Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. Judging by all the signs,  what we now have in St. Petersburg is a mutually beneficial  alliance of the executive and the monopolized TV power, as a  result of which any criticism of Sobchak's actions is completely  absent from television.    Judging by what we see one may assume that Kurkova's power  is  practically absolute, and therefore Channel 5 has become a  precise reflection of political, professional, and esthetic  views of the director and the chairman of the board. It is  obvious that in both her own broadcasts and those of her  subordinates Kurkova cares only about political  content, interpreted as tendentious support of specific  persons (not economic or political ideas but exactly  that--persons!). The emphasis on propaganda has  displaced even hints at analysis: The style of the  "Fifth Wheel" in the late 1980's, when the "talking heads"  anticommunist monologue made a sensation in both capitals, now  has become a model for all of Channel 5. The only difference  being that no sensations are possible now, since the trick  outlived itself "one lifetime ago." As to analytical coverage,  this issue has been resolved in a cardinal manner. To interpret  "something political," they invite politicians (A. Sobchak, A.  Belyayev); when all else fails, the job is entrusted to B.  Kurkova and her deputy V. Pravdyuk.    From the above follows the esthetic side: A strong  provincial  flavor, most noticeable in the absence of modern computer  graphics; programs existing outside of time and rhythm; the  absence of necessary components of artistic form--from an  inventive script to a decent studio interior. Petersburg TV is  the least attractive of all Russian television facilities. It  appears that this is of no concern to the leadership, while in  the absence of excitement everything deteriorates--moving toward  the absence of style, form, and expression. Moreover, everything  is done to make the ugliness prominent, for which purpose  Channel 5 continues to broadcast NTV programs ("Itogi,"  "Segodnya," "Namedni") against whose background its own product  looks even more miserable.    The absence of editing, rhythm, and direction on the whole  had been felt even in "Fifth Wheel." But at the time this was  explained by the topicality of struggle against communism,  which--in order to prevent interference of oblast party  committee censors--carefully observed the three classic  postulates of unity: place, time, and action. In order to  prevent any sort of cuts, editing was abolished. Now this has  become Channel 5's main esthetic principle--the principle  of classic amateur performance, which manifests itself  especially graphically in live broadcasts: direction is still  confused with censorship, and therefore what is valued most is a  complete absence of any artistic interference. As a  result of the absence of direction, mise en scene is formed  "naturally": of the simplest combination of three  components--the camera, the anchor, and the speaker. This set of  components permits making broadcasts of any length  without expending any effort; in addition, the anchor does not  so much ask questions as sit as a "battle complement" next to  the speaker (Kurkova's favorite state on camera when she  "interviews" someone).    A typical program is "Itogi XX Veka" ("Summarizing the  Twentieth Century"): The "speaking man" is seated; the camera is  in front of him (only two angles are used), and a monologue  calmly continues for an hour! From time to time the "radio text"  is interrupted by a "video clip" that is only remotely related  to the topic.    There are, actually, wilder programs as well, for instance,  the fun "Weather-Show": Two mummers sit by samovar--a boy of  about 10 and a middle-aged man. The task of this "creative  collective" is to wedge the weather forecast into a  "fun" conversation. It is not quite clear why all of this is  needed. Nevertheless, the boy asks the man: What would be your  last words before execution? To which the man, without blinking  an eye, answers: "Good-bye, Central Russia! Where, by the way,  minus 15 degrees is expected tomorrow..." Then the same man in  Lenin's voice (!) relates the weather forecast for Arkhangelsk  and Murmansk Oblasts. To make it really funny, the man calls the  boy by name and patronymic... The lack of which technique can  explain this flight of creative imagination?    Toward the end of the 19th-beginning of the 20th Century the  profession of theatrical director emerged in the European  theater so that a stage show would not be a mere "sound track"  of the script but expressed a certain directorial concept of the  man and the world. A director became the show's creator and  organizer, and a synthetic image began to express some new  contents. Keeping in mind the specificity of directorial  profession one may guess why Petersburg TV lacks directors and  editors. It is apparently better and safer not to have people  around who have fantasy, concepts, and an ability for  independent creative activities. It is safer politically, but  this also results in most regular programs being shapeless and  not put together: from the boring "Sunday Labyrinth" to  "Zebra"--a television version of the "Young Pioneer Sunrise."    Somehow the phenomenon of editing and the effects  produced by it has bypassed Petersburg television producers; for  this reason I can recommend Mikhail Yampolskiy's compendium  "Editing" as required reading in "all the companies, squadrons,  and ships" on Channel 5. Neither would it hurt to read up on Lev  Kuleshov and Sergey Eisenstein... I have no right to insist on  it, however.    The abundance of boring conversation and the shortage of  well  put-together stories at this point is counterbalanced, in my  opinion, only by the "Tele-Store." Following in the footsteps of  Russian futurist Ilya Zdanevich, the program contends that an  American shoe is more beautiful than the Venus de Milo. The  five-minute-long advertising display of expensive consumer goods  is the only program where the image on the screen is in harmony  with the text, while the short length of the show does not give  the viewer enough time to wallow in envy. There is also a  pleasant anchor, who combines provincial shyness with the  ingenuity of a beginner stockbroker. Nika, the anchor of another  program, also is a feast for the eye. Provided one watches her  program with the sound turned off.</p>

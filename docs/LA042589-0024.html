			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEARING SCHEDULED ON CHARGES AGAINST ANTI-ABORTIONISTS  </P> <P> A federal judge in Los Angeles on Monday set a June 6 hearing to determine why  anti-abortion activists should not be held in contempt for violating a court  order that forbade them from closing abortion clinics.  </P> <P> In a declaration to Judge A. Wallace Tashima, the American Civil Liberties  Union named 20 alleged participants in abortion-clinic blockades in addition to  the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. The ACLU has filed for the contempt  proceedings on behalf of medical facilities that perform abortions.  </P> <P> Two of those listed in the complaint are Will Lehman of Vista and Connie  Youngkin of Poway. The respondents have until May 15 to file written  declarations of their defense, said Betty Wheeler, legal director of the ACLU  Foundation of San Diego and Imperial counties.  </P> <P> "Anyone who does not file a written declaration will not be permitted to  testify at the evidentiary hearing," she said.  </P> <P> Wheeler said that, if the ACLU can show that damage was caused to either a  clinic or an individual, the court could order the respondents to pay  restitution.  </P> <P> The ACLU will be submitting more contempt-of-court proceedings against those  who participated in the April 8 blockade of a Hillcrest doctor's office,  Wheeler said, as well as those who participate in blockades scheduled for the  "National Day of Rescue" on Saturday.  </P></p>

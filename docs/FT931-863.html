			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Gerstner delivers blow to RJR Nabisco THE DEPARTURE of Mr Louis Gerstner to IBM, comes at a testing time for RJR Nabisco, which he has chaired since the record Dollars 25bn buy-out of the food and tobacco group in early-1989. RJR Nabisco is in the throes of a complex 'targeted stock scheme'. This should create a new class of shares pegged to the fortunes of its food business. The existing shares will then be renamed, and largely track the performance of the tobacco operations. In the process, RJR Nabisco - still carrying a Dollars 14bn debt load - hopes to raise Dollars 1.5bn. The scheme, with the Securities and Exchange Commission for review, must then be marketed to the investment community, and the Dollars 1.5bn-worth of new 'food' shares sold. At the same time, investors have been increasingly twitchy about the declining RJR Nabisco share price and lack of visible progress in the company's large domestic tobacco business. The annual shareholders meeting is set for April 2. 'The situation,' as one analyst put it, this week, 'is delicate'. So ever since Mr Gerstner started to emerge as front-runner for the IBM job, the consumer products company has hinted privately that the chairman's shoes would be filled internally. This would minimise upheaval and lessen uncertainty. In fact, within an hour of the IBM news, RJR Nabisco made its own management position clear. Mr Lawrence Ricciardi, the group's general counsel, and Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance director, are to become joint co-chairmen and chief executive officers, while retaining their legal and financial responsibilities. Management of the operating divisions will be unaffected. This is, indeed, a simple solution. RJR Nabisco has been run, at corporate level, by Mr Gerstner and three executive vice-presidents - Mr Ricciardi, who followed Mr Gerstner from American Express, Mr von der Heyden, and Mr Eugene Croisant, head of human resources and administration. The speedy 'joint chairmanship' announcement also pre-empts internal wrangling. The question, however, is whether the two chairmen will produce the long-term leadership and vision which a large consumer products company, operating in some difficult and competitive markets, needs. Mr von der Heyden, 56, has well-regarded track-record, having been finance director of H. J. Heinz and vice-president of manufacturing at Pepsi-Cola Bottling. Mr Ricciardi, 52, had 16 years experience with American Express. But, in a tricky situation, everything has yet to be proved.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Plants to close at offshoot of Cincinnati Milacron CINCINNATI Milacron, the US machine tool group, is restructuring its newly-acquired subsidiary, Valenite, with the closure of nine plants, including two in Brazil and one in Mexico, and net job cuts of about 480, AP-DJ reports from Cincinnati. The company said the restructuring would improve Valenite's profitability by lowering working capital requirements, reducing overall expenses, increasing plant modernisation and improving capacity utilisation. Costs associated with the restructuring, to be substantially completed this year, were provided for at the time of the acquisition in February. As a result, there would be no special charges, Milacron said. Of Valenite's 27 facilities worldwide, nine will close. Those plants are in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Australia, two in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and the UK. Two plants in Michigan and Canada will be reduced in size. Four operations, including plants in South Carolina, Texas, France and Germany, will receive additional work.</p>

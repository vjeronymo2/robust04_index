			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic People's Party, by Janos A. Szilagyi; place and date  not given: "I Would Also Accept the Leadership of an Opposition  Party"]    [Text] [Szilagyi] Both the National Committee and the  Executive Committee of the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] have already discussed the political situation that  emerged after the first round of the elections. How did you  evaluate the election results?    [Surjan] According to the leading bodies of the KDNP,  despite the modest increase in votes compared with the 1990  elections, the first round of the current elections was a  failure for the KDNP. The aforementioned increase in votes was  not proportional with the organizational development of the  KDNP. Our party obtained better-than-average results in areas  where we succeeded in presenting a candidate who won the  confidence of the voters, a confidence that exceeded the general  support for our party.    [Szilagyi] How do you intend to improve your position in the  second round?    [Surjan] The balance of forces between various parties was  practically determined by the first round of elections. The  KDNP suggests that the voters take primarily the candidates'  professionalism into consideration, but they should not forget  about the parties that have similar concepts with us either.  Just like in the case of nominating candidates, local  organizations decide on support. One thing is certain: There  will be no written agreement with the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF], like the one signed in 1990, because an agreement on  mutual withdrawal has already been achieved in the two districts  where we remained opponents.    [Szilagyi] Two days ago, you did not exclude an anti-leftist  cooperation that would include the Alliance of Free Democrats,  like an opposition roundtable.    [Surjan] Reality shows that the opposition roundtable cannot  be revived overnight, and there are no possibilities for the  emergence of a five-party government. The gaps between the  parties are too deep for this to happen.    [Szilagyi] You clearly excluded the possibility of a  coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] earlier.  Nor did you consider any cooperation with the SZDSZ as  possible. In view of your election results so far, has your  position changed?    [Surjan] My answer is a firm no. The MSZP failed to come up  with a principled declaration regarding the 1956 events, and  their close contacts with the trade unions also makes our  cooperation impossible.    [Szilagyi] The KDNP Executive Committee postponed the  detailed analysis of the election results until its next  meeting. In your view, why did the KDNP fail to obtain the  expected 12-18 percent of the votes?    [Surjan] Many circumstances played a role in our failure.  In the course of the governing burdens, the KDNP did not assign  enough time and energy for the reorganization of its internal  structure. The KDNP failed to operate the flow of information  adequately within the party, it did not ask the members enough,  and it failed in making the society aware of the party's  concepts. We failed to make the people really aware of the  successes and objective difficulties of the governing activity.    [Szilagyi] The Executive Committee decided yesterday on  convening the National Committee in July to carry out personnel  changes. Your decision means that your election failure could  have personnel consequences. What responsibility do you feel  for your party's election results?    [Surjan] Every party leader should think over what he could  have done better. I do not have to evaluate my four-year  activity; the relevant body will probably do this in the near  future. In any case, as required by our statute, I will resign  and thus give the opportunity for my party to decide whether to  extend my mandate as party chairman.    [Szilagyi] Do you also consider the possibility of leading  the KDNP as an opposition party?    [Surjan] I find an investigation necessary, so that we can  continue our work calmly. The KDNP is preparing to play the  role of an opposition party. Social justice and the protection  of small people should determine our policy in the coming years,  but we will not make use of any demagogy.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Currency gains help Pict advance 63% Pict Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production group, saw net profit for the year to June 30 rise 63 per cent to Pounds 4.82m on turnover of Pounds 9.58m, compared with 1992 figures of profit of Pounds 2.96m on turnover of Pounds 10.8m. The results were helped by currency gains of Pounds 1.57m (losses Pounds 482,000) because of the stronger dollar and higher net interest received of Pounds 837,000 (Pounds 537,000). The fall in turnover was mainly attributable to the disposal of the interest in the Claymore field. The average price rose to Pounds 11.1 per barrel (Pounds 10.54). Earnings per share were 9.34p, against 6.65p.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser advances 55% RECORD US prices for timber helped Weyerhaeuser, the forest products group based in the Pacific Northwest, produce a 55 per cent increase in first quarter earnings, excluding special one-time gains. Environmental constraints on logging in the Pacific Northwest, to help preserve an endangered species of owl, have sent prices for logs, lumber and plywood soaring this year, benefiting companies such as Weyerhaeuser with good supplies of timber. The company reported earnings of Dollars 229m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, compared with Dollars 86.6m, or 43 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Net sales rose 6 per cent, from Dollars 2.2bn to Dollars 2.3bn. However, some Dollars 44m, or 22 cents a share, of the earnings were due to a gain on the sale of the company's nappy business, while a further Dollars 52m, or 25 cents a share, was due to the extinguishment of debt. The company's timberlands and wood products business produced Dollars 226m of earnings, up from Dollars 111m in the same period of 1992. However, this contrasted sharply with a drop in profits at the company's pulp and paper business, from Dollars 75m to Dollars 35m, due to low prices and an excess of global production capacity relative to demand. The company said that during the quarter prices continued to erode in pulp, containerboard packaging and bleached paperboard.</p>

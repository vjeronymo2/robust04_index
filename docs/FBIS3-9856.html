			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dan Andronic and Radu Tudor: "The Head of the </F> Counterintelligence Division of the Romanian Intelligence  Service Is in Possession of Documents That Can Lead to Virgil  Magureanu's Dismissal"]    [Text] A short while ago, immediately after President Ion  Iliescu's departure on his Asian tour, Virgil Magureanu,  director of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], made a  surprising move: He dismissed Major General Gheorghe  Diaconescu, head of the SRI's Counterintelligence Division.    Although absolute silence was kept on this subject,  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI soon learned the real reason for Maj. Gen.  Diaconescu's dismissal.    According to information we have been able to obtain thus  far, in the wake of certain operative actions carried out by the  Counterintelligence Division, Maj. Gen. Diaconescu put together  certain intelligence files according to which Maj. Gen.  Magureanu and his first deputy, Maj. Gen. Victor Marcu, were  involved in monkey business. Although he proceeded in  accordance with the law and notified the Department of Military  Magistracies through Maj. Gen. Mihai Ulpiu Popa-Cherecheanu,  deputy prosecutor general of the General Magistracy of the  Supreme Court of Justice, Maj. Gen. Diaconescu found himself  nonetheless dismissed. Mihai Ulpiu Popa-Cherecheanu did nothing  else but to seal the filing box with the compromising documents  against Virgil Magureanu.  <H5>  Virgil Magureanu Launched a Diversion: "The Cristea Case" </H5>   The latest data obtained by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI show that  Virgil Magureanu launched an obnoxious diversion to divert  attention from the "Diaconescu case" to the "Cristea case." We  would like to recall that Maj. Gen. Dumitru Cristea, rector of  the Higher Institute for Information Studies and deputy SRI  director, was accused of immorality, that is of having a sexual  affair with a former female student.    The "Cristea case" was presented in detail by Virgil  Magureanu to the parliamentary commission for supervising the  SRI activity and was reported with suspect promptness by all  newspapers, who were supplied an abundance of information on the  topic. The entire fabric of the scandal involving Maj.Gen.  Dumitru Cristea was construed in accordance with the classic  rules of disinformation.  <H3>  The Sealing of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's Filing Cabinet Was  Done in Secret </H3>   The aim of all these efforts to divert attention from the  compromising files on Maj. Gen. Magureanu was to guide the  research of the journalists, of the members of the Parliament's  SRI Supervisory Commission, and of the members of the  parliamentary defense commissions into a totally different  direction, namely the alleged sexual affair of Virgil  Magureanu's deputy with a former female student.    In reality, the tension within the SRI is caused by the  existence of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's sealed filing cabinet, which  contains some extremely compromising files that would lead to  Maj. Gen Magureanu's immediate dismissal by Ion Iliescu.    In this respect, the efforts made by Virgil Magureanu to  divert attention elsewhere appear extremely logical.    It is worth mentioning that Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Diaconescu's  dismissal and the sealing of his filing cabinet were done in  great secrecy, without prior notification to the SRI Supervisory  Commission. One can easily assume that in the time which has  elapsed since then, the documents have disappeared without a  trace. Normally, the members of the SRI Supervisory Commission  should have been notified in advance and its chairman, Senator  Vasile Vacaru, should have been present at the sealing of the  filing cabinet.  <H5>  Maj. Gen. Diaconescu Is Being Subjected to Great Pressure </H5>   Although it is not the first time that we write about the  implications of the "Diaconescu case," the former head of the  Counterintelligence Division has not been yet heard; instead, he  is being subjected to very strong pressure from Virgil Magureanu.    Anyone who has ever read an espionage book cannot possibly  understand why Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's physical and psychological  protection has not yet been secured up to this date. This  omission can be easily explained if one considers the hypothesis  that several persons, much more important than Maj. Gen.  Magureanu, are involved in this scandal.    The immediate hearing of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu by all  relevant  bodies, including by the parliament's Defense Commissions, and  the placing of the former chief of the Counterintelligence  Division under effective protection are essential for the  elucidation of this case.</p>

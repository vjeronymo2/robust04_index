This industrial system became one of  the three pillars for production of civil products in 1993, with  the gross output value and sales turnover of the entire  industrial system jumping to 45 percent and over 50 percent,  respectively, over those in 1992.    In 1993, the number of enterprises from province's national  defense scientific and technological industry with an annual  output value exceeding 100 million yuan and over 50 million yuan  totalled three and six, respectively. Among them was Swan Air  Conditioner Company, which realized an output value of 260  million yuan, posted an increase over 50 percent in terms of  production and sales over those in 1992, acquired the capability  to produce 300,000 air conditioner units annually, despite  having been hit with another unseasonably cool summer. Huaihai  Machinery Plant rolled out over 10,000 Flying Tiger brand cars,  quadrupling output value to 254 million yuan and generating  14.85 million yuan of profits and taxes for the state from those  in 1992, acquiring the capability to annually turn out 20,000  Flying Tiger cars, thus initially meeting the requirements for  large-scale production. Wuhu Shipyard began building the first  10,000 [dead weight ton] dwt-class vessel -- a 12,000 dwt  low-waterline freighter which can dock at harbors along the  Changjiang -- thus opening the way for 10,000 dwt-class  freighters to call at ports along Changjiang all the year round  as well as bringing good market prospects for Wuhu Shipyard to  build 10,000 dwt-class freighters. In 1993, in addition to  becoming one of the three pillars for production of products for  civil use, the province's national defense scientific and  technological industrial system also set up an assembly line for  production of 200,000 hinge joint sets for sedans, an assembly  line for 20,000 car air conditioners, and an assembly line for  1,500 gear reducer sets, thus constituting new growth areas for  the province's national defense scientific and technological  industry in 1994. In 1993, the province's national defense  scientific and technological industrial system invested 210  million yuan in technological transformation, a 49-percent  increase percent over 1992.    The province's national defense scientific and technological  system also developed 102 new products. Among them were an  international-class colloidal core for ring-type antisprayers  [huan xing fang pen qi jiao xin 3883 1748 7089 0899 0892 5231  5361], a colloidal core for antisprayer valves, a container for  super-fine filters, portable microwave communications equipment,  and a water recycling and cooling system. Some 90 new products  were put into mass production, with their output rate reaching  22.97 percent.    Industrial product mix experienced a profound transformation  thanks to a large scale technological transformation carried out  by the province's national defense scientific and technological  industry and to its development of new products in 1993. Based  on the achievements in 1993, in 1994, provincial national  defense science and industry office will, making key enterprises  and key products to serve as the point of departure, promote the  economic development of the entire system; strive to increase  output value by 35 percent and efficiency by 80 percent;  establish four and eight enterprises with output value over 100  million yuan and over 50 million yuan, respectively; and further  expand the results of the entire system to switch from military  production to civil-product production.</p>

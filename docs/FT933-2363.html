			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Books: Wild life of Born Free couple THE GREAT SAFARI: THE LIVES OF GEORGE AND JOY ADAMSON by Adrian House Harvill Pounds 20, 465 pages HIGH IN the bestseller lists of the 1960s and '70s was a trio of artlessly-told, beautifully-illustrated books about a lion cub who was adopted by a Kenyan couple, reared, and then returned to the bush. Born Free, Living Free and Forever Free sold in their millions; the image of the happy pair was probably most effectively conveyed by the film of Born Free, in which Joy and George Adamson were played - wonderfully - by a thespian couple, Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers. Virginia McKenna in those days was the archetypal girl-next-door, and Bill was an appropriately beefy and amiable partner. The casting was brilliantly successful - and grotesquely misleading. The fact is that Joy Adamson was a monster, George was a wretched, long-suffering spouse, usually living apart from her, and the marriage had been made in hell. In their different ways, their lives were rescued by the animals of East Africa. Adrian House was their London editor, and has at last written the history of the Adamsons. It is one of those biographies which, regrettably, feels obliged to cram in everything the author knows, from the Scramble for Africa to the history of Mau Mau; it is not well written; but the story comes through, and has a horrifying compulsion. For anyone who remembers the books or the films, this is a fascinating read. The Adamsons represented two opposite faces of White Kenya. George was a classic example of the dedicated game warden, always happiest in the ferocious terrain of the Northern Frontier District, where the Somalis persist in their southern migration (they would eventually murder him). Joy, originally 'Fifi', was a neurotic Austrian cosmopolitan with two husbands behind her, a Nazi step-father, broken English, pretensions to culture, a passion for the safari, a record of dissatisfied promiscuity, and a chronic inability to be civil to her servants (who would eventually murder her). Mr House is on George's side, but his portrait of the appalling Joy has the stink of truth. Heaven knows why George put up with her for 35 years; Mr House concludes, in effect, that he was a gent. She married him in a grand and mutual passion, went off him sexually within a fortnight, developed a renewed craving for her (equally long-suffering) Swiss ex-husband, and - as all Kenya knew - made George's life miserable for much of the time. She even refused him a share of the fortune she made from the books, although his role in the dramas of Elsa and her cubs was fundamental. He was only saved from penury by the films Bill Travers made with him later, and the spin-off books under his own name in the 1980s. Nothing in this domestic tragedy would be a particularly unusual story in Kenya if it were not for the lions. Why did Joy's first book have such an extraordinary impact? The answer, at its simplest, is not hard to understand. In Peter Scott's words, 'as an example of near perfect relationships between man and animal, it is unique'. Plenty of game wardens had raised lion cubs, but Elsa reached maturity, was successfully released into the wild, and then retained her affection for the human 'parents' even after she had mated and borne cubs. So, for many people, this apparently ordinary story was unexpectedly moving because it seemed to offer them a bridge between man and the natural world at a time when - we can now see - we were beginning obscurely to worry about this gap. (Other books were having a similar effect at the time: see, for instance, the otters and Gavin Maxwell, whose biography also appears this month). At a deeper level of interpretation - and Mr House only flirts with this point but he is at least aware of it - it would be necessary to go into the legendary role of the lion in the life of man throughout the ages. There was a debate about the value of the Adamsons' work. They were not scientists, so what was the significance of their anthropomorphic observations? After all, lions were never an endangered species, so why all the fuss? And wasn't it dangerous to return these lions to the bush, and in particular to a national park? Were the Adamsons producing man-eaters? (In later years George was to be directly and painfully confronted by this point.) The conclusion today seems to be that the Adamsons' observations added something to the sum of human knowledge and offered the conservationists various lines for future inquiry. More important, I suspect, is the very simple point that the Adamsons transformed public opinion in that they did more than anyone to make lions accessible, wonderful, majestic, loveable, to all of us. After Elsa, Joy reared a cheetah and also raised leopard cubs. She had a big affair with Billy Collins, her publisher, described here in discrete detail. She saw less and less of George. She wounded her hand and lost her separate career as an extremely distinguished artist of Kenya's flora and anthropology. She was killed in 1980. George had retreated to a remote camp on his beloved Tana River and lived to a hearty old age, rearing lion cubs and entertaining British soldiers and uninhibited young ladies. Then, in 1989, the Somalis came and killed him. He was, in Adrian House's affectionate portrait, rather a hero.</p>

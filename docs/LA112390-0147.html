			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> EDVARD MUNCH'S HAUNTING IMAGES;  </P> <P> THE NORWEGIAN MASTER IS REGARDED AS A KEY PIONEER OF EXPRESSIONISM. A  DISTINGUISHED COLLECTION OF 94 OF HIS WORKS IS ON VIEW AT THE COUNTY MUSEUM OF  ART.  </P> <P> Occasionally, when life gets a bit much, the desire to escape envelops us.  Where to go? Once we've dismissed Bali and other exotic places, Scandinavia  starts seeming like a good getaway. Civilized, cultured and humane, it's just  far enough off the main stem that one could live above the fray as an observer.  All the advantages of Euro-American culture without the stress. Endless summer  days. Cozy winters when it barely gets light. Might be nice to live among one's  imaginings of a robust and handsome people.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there is Edvard Munch.  </P> <P> Modern Scandinavian literary and artistic tradition has a dark side that  stretches from Soren Kierkegaard to Henrik Ibsen and Ingmar Bergman. Every few  years, a Munch exhibition materializes as a reminder of that intense,  essentially moral strain. The latest today at the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art is "Master Prints by Edvard Munch From the Epstein Family Collection." On  view to Jan. 6, it presents 94 woodcuts, lithographs and intaglio prints by an  artist acknowledged as among the great masters and innovators of the medium.  </P> <P> Along with the older Vincent van Gogh, the Norwegian Munch holds pride of place  as a key pioneer of modern Expressionism. Unlike the tragic Dutchman, Munch is  not a beloved household name, although the two artists shared temperamental  qualities and some oddly parallel experiences.  </P> <P> Both were passionate, disturbed and drank more than was good for them. Both  injured themselves in sexually charged circumstances. Van Gogh severed his ear  after an encounter with a prostitute. Munch accidentally shot himself in the  hand during a lover's quarrel. Both were hospitalized after nervous collapses.  </P> <P> Maybe Munch seems less poignant than the successfully suicidal Van Gogh because  Munch recovered and lived to be 80, dying in 1944. It seems more likely that  Van Gogh holds broader appeal because his work speaks of humane and healing  hope, while Munch's best-known images seem pessimistic and so clearly  autobiographical that they can be dismissed as one man's skewed view of life.  Maybe Munch is simply harder to take and truer to the troubled psyche of the  20th Century. He is the one who seems like a candidate for analysis by another  older contemporary: Sigmund Freud.  </P> <P> Once seen, Munch's imagery is as unforgettable as it is haunted. It  participates in a Scandinavian artistic tradition that views human life in  large and elemental terms. The work is arranged to dramatize its brooding,  heavily symbolic themes.  </P> <P> Raised in bourgeois Oslo (then called Christiania), Munch had lost both his  mother and sister to tuberculosis by the time he was 14. Images of sickrooms  such as "Death Chamber" show faces in blank-eyed grief. Figures in black  dresses become abstract shapes whose undulating outlines project feelings of  vertigo. Few artists have so effectively used pattern to express tension.  </P> <P> Munch's many self-portraits show he grew up handsome. And, despite his  stiff-backed army doctor father, he fell in with the local avant-garde crowd  that included Hans Jaegger, a young anarchist who espoused free love and wrote  a novel that was promptly suppressed. The ambience of these early years is  caught in the etching "The Morning After." Munch's style was conventional then,  but it didn't stay that way.  </P> <P> By 1892, he'd had the first of a string of passionate, frustrating love affairs  and spent time in Paris absorbing the whiplash contortions of Art Nouveau and  the insistent decadence of Symbolism. Where Van Gogh had been a man of the  earth, Munch was something of a dandy.  </P> <P> That year, his Berlin exhibition ignited outraged protest and was shut down.  Munch became a hero of the underground and went on to make his main reputation  in Germany.  </P> <P> In Berlin, his crowd hung out in an Unter den Linden cafe that boasted 900  varieties of liqueurs. Other intimates of the circle included playwright August  Strindberg and the Polish poet and satanist Stanislaw Przybyszewski. The female  muse of the group was Dagny Juell, who eventually dumped Munch and married  Przybyszewski. In 1901, she was murdered. Munch didn't do it, but you'd never  know it from the masterpieces of the period.  </P> <P> "Madonna" shows the essential woman to be a kind of sainted vampire. "Jealousy"  uses exaggerated depth to capture the moment a man is gripped with anxious rage  as his lover stands nude before another. Munch's use of vortex space should be  counted among the great visual metaphors.  </P> <P> Of all his recurrent motifs, the anguish of carnal love produced the most  searing images. In prints, the masterpiece is "The Kiss." In it, a pair of  lovers are united into a single black shape against a wood-grain pattern that  is both a background and a prison for the figures. They are trapped in it as in  their desire.  </P> <P> Munch's breakdown came in 1908. After it, his work lost its intensity, a  circumstance that's caused many an artist to avoid psychotherapy. Actually, his  later work has considerable merit. It grew a bit stolid but it actually pursued  themes that broadened away from the neurotic absorption with sex and death that  became a kind of joke in the Woody Allen era.  </P> <P> Among his most profound themes are variations on "The Three Stages of Woman  (The Spinx)." In it, the archetypal female is seen as an innocent virgin full  of hope, a wanton nude and, finally, as a widow in mourning. In variants, the  virgin stands near a young man on the seashore as if waiting. It's subtitled  "The Lonely Ones." Later, she stands in intimate conversation with the widow,  staring out at the surf. It could have inspired the scene where the knight  plays chess with Death in Bergman's "The Seventh Seal."  </P> <P> The collection on view was started in the '60s by Sarah and Lionel Epstein. Now  regarded as one of the most distinguished in the world, it includes not only  Munch classics but less familiar prints like "Melancholy."  </P> <P> Sarah Epstein writes movingly of the collection in a catalogue essay that  reveals her as the mother of five, a champion of liberalism and a particular  advocate of family planning. Funny, in a way, that such a person would respond  to Munch's art. There are those who see the artist and the men in his milieu as  misogynists who subjugated women.  </P> <P> Evidently, Sarah Epstein understands Munch's art for what it really is. It sees  both sexes irresistibly subject to natural forces that drive them together  willy-nilly in an eternal dance. In it, each partner holds the power of life  and death. Or, at least, so it seems to the other.  </P></p>

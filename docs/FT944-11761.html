			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: View 'music to the ears' Sir, It was most refreshing to read Christopher Haskins' article on partnership and social justice (Personal View, October 24). To hear a senior UK industrialist condemn the 'obsessive pursuit of a low skills, low investment strategy' is truly welcome; to hear him express support for the European Union's Social Chapter, relating this to the need for responsible and progressive company personnel policies, is surely music to the ears of all of us who have become so depressed by the negative stance adopted by some leaders of industry and some (many?) leading politicians. If Mr Haskins' views were to become an integral part of public policy, and if companies took on board the same enlightened policies, the UK would stand a decent chance of becoming the modern, efficient, progressive economy that we all claim to want - certainly the economy that is needed for social justice to become reality.

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FAMILY TORN;  </P> <P> SURVIVORS TRY TO COMPREHEND LOSS  </P> <P> The sound of women wailing came out of the small yellow stucco house in East  Los Angeles on Monday morning. A family birthday party had become a family  massacre.  </P> <P> On Sunday evening, Maria Navarro's estranged husband, Raymond, 26, had burst  into her birthday party uninvited and started shooting.  </P> <P> Now Maria, 27 to the day, was dead. Her aunt Francisca was dead. Elderly aunt  Maria was dead. The close friend they called aunt Leticia was dead. Aunt Berta  was in the hospital, barely alive.  </P> <P> Maria's three children and their cousins had witnessed murder.  </P> <P> Outside, brothers and grown nephews poured gallons of bleach onto the driveway,  trying to scrub away the blood with brooms. Not satisfied, they added detergent  until suds flowed down the driveway pure and white.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Close Family  </P> <P> At last, the stains were gone. But the fabric of a large and close family had  been torn. For 25 years, despite the fact that part of the family had lived in  Mexicali and part had lived in Los Angeles, they had remained extremely close.  </P> <P> On Monday, relatives arrived at the modest home in the 3600 block of Lanfranco  Street from both sides of the border. For several hours, all they knew was that  four women were dead and one was barely alive. But, in the confusion, they  didn't know who. All they knew was that no matter how it turned out, there  could be no sighs of relief.  </P> <P> "Porque? Porque? (Why? Why?)" cried Delia Fajardo when she arrived in Los  Angeles from Mexicali Monday morning.  </P> <P> Then, she screamed: "Mi hija! Mi hija! (My daughter! My daughter!)"  </P> <P> Perhaps none lost more than Delia Fajardo. She was the mother of the slain  young woman, the niece of the two elderly women who were dead, Maria Garcia,  69, and Francisca Arizpe, 62, and sister to Berta Galvan, 47, who was in  critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. Another woman who was so close  to them all that they called her tia, or aunt, Leticia M. Dipp, 47, was also  dead.  </P> <P> Francisca and Berta were not married, relatives said. Neither, they said, was  Dipp, whom the family had adopted as one of their own.  </P> <P> "Berta was like a second mother to Maria," said Fajardo, who spoke briefly to a  reporter about her daughter before collapsing in tears. "I had always asked  Berta to look after Maria."  </P> <P> And Berta did. Especially after Maria Navarro had separated from her husband in  early 1988, following complaints that he had physically abused her. Berta would  stop by the house asking if there was anything Maria and the children needed.  Often, she gave them money.  </P> <P> They worked together too, along with Leticia Dipp, at the Plaza del Sol  shopping center in East Los Angeles. Dipp was manager of the shopping center.  Maria, in recent months, worked two jobs to make more money for her three  children, Claudia, 7, Denise, 6, and Raymond Jr., 5. Berta wore a security  guard's uniform but never carried a gun, co-workers said.  </P> <P> The three women were strong and strong-willed, merchants and employees at the  shopping mall said Monday as they tried to absorb the shock of the murders.  </P> <P> "The three women ran the place," said Carmen Cortez, an administrator at the  Latino Immigration Service. "We feel lost without them. They would help  everyone. They were strong ladies. . . . Those ladies weren't afraid of  anything."  </P> <P> Maria was pretty, the kind of young woman whom strong aunts felt they needed to  protect, particularly from her jealous husband, friends and relatives said.  They described Raymond as jealous and abusive, a man who prided himself on his  weightlifting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High School Sweethearts  </P> <P> He had married his Roosevelt High School sweetheart. A few years ago, friends  said, Maria had been a contestant in the Miss Primavera contest in East Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> But recently, she had come to fear her husband. Her aunt Berta grew more  protective.  </P> <P> "Berta used to come with her because they were afraid of him," said Carlos  Hernandez, owner of Sandwich Express at the shopping center. Maria worked from  about 4 a.m. to noon at International Tour Service, a shuttle bus line between  Los Angeles and Tijuana, as a receptionist. After she got off that job, she  would go to work as an assistant to her aunt Leticia.  </P> <P> Hernandez said Berta had told him she came to work at 4 a.m. with her niece  because they were afraid of her husband. Once, he said, Raymond Navarro had  followed her upstairs at the mall, kicking her.  </P> <P> "I asked her (Maria) once, 'Why don't you leave him?' " he said. He said she  answered: " 'Because if I leave him, he would kill me.' That's what she told me  about six, seven months ago."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: ROWE IS SLOWED, TUIOTI STOPPED BY KNEE PROBLEMS  </P> <P> In what otherwise was termed an outstanding day of practice Thursday at San  Diego State, Coach Al Luginbill had a couple of not-so-pleasant subjects to  discuss -- both involving knee injuries.  </P> <P> Receiver Patrick Rowe, a junior, is still ailing from an irritation in his left  knee and may not be ready for the Aztecs' opener a week from Saturday at Air  Force.  </P> <P> "Patrick Rowe's situation has become more doubtful for the opener," Luginbill  said. "We'll know by Monday."  </P> <P> After the Air Force game, SDSU has a week off before the home opener against  UCLA Sept. 16. Luginbill indicated he should know by then if Rowe would be  redshirted.  </P> <P> Junior Dennis Arey will start at flanker if Rowe is unable to.  </P> <P> Reserve defensive lineman George Tuioti, a sophomore, has been declared a  "medical hardship" because of persistent left knee injuries.  </P> <P> "He will be on scholarship at the university as long as he keeps a 2.0  grade-point average and continues to pursue his degree," Luginbill said. "It's  all related to a previous knee injury that medically cannot be corrected."  </P> <P> Luginbill said he and SDSU's medical staff do not want to run the risk of  having Tuioti permanently crippled.  </P> <P> Senior offensive tackle Roman Fortin (hip flexors) is expected to play against  Air Force.

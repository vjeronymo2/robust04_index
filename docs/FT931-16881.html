			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: A question of carts and horses - Monetary union WILL the existence of separate national currencies undermine Europe's single market? And what will happen to the ideal of a level European playing field if a group of EC member countries decide to form a monetary union? In principle there is no reason why a single market or customs union, with no barriers to internal trade, should need a single currency, or somehow be 'incomplete' without one. There has been no suggestion the recently negotiated North American Free Trade Agreement would require a single North American currency. Instead, a monetary union implies a trade-off between the gains from no exchange risk or transactions costs and the costs from losing the flexibility to change currency and interest rates. Separate currencies in the single market mean a degree of uncertainty and transactions costs. Inefficiencies caused by short-term fluctuations in exchange rates are likely to be small and largely avoidable for businesses. The Commission estimates that elimination of foreign exchange transaction costs would add about 0.5 per cent to the Community's GDP. More serious is the risk that sudden speculative attacks on currencies, unrelated to underlying economic realities, will unfairly reward or penalise companies in different countries. But the UK had a much higher inflow of Japanese direct investment in the late 1980s than any other European country, even though sterling was not a member of the European exchange rate mechanism. But single currencies have costs too. If all countries suffered the same economic calamity at the same time, giving up the power to vary the exchange rate would be no great loss. But if countries are affected differently by an economic event - such as an oil shock or German unification - the desired response may not be the same and therefore the costs of tying monetary policies together high. What does the evidence suggest about the costs and benefits of this trade-off? The US is not free from regional swings in the fortunes of individual states. But US state unemployment rates do not stay high for long  -the US does not have persistent high or low unemployment regions. The main reason is the very high level of migration between US states, much higher than between British regions, let alone between European countries. Region-specific economic shocks are more common in Europe than in the US. Research co-ordinated by Mr Barry Eichengreen at the University of California at Berkeley finds there tends to be more variation in economic growth rates across European countries than US states. This pattern does not hold for different combinations of European countries. The European 'core' (Germany, France, Denmark and the Benelux countries) looks much more like the US. The risk - especially for the poorer southern European countries - is that monetary union would carry with it a high political cost: high unemployment and slow growth. To argue that the single market requires a single currency in order to work may be putting the cart before the horse. The single market may, in fact, be a necessary forerunner of any monetary union because it would encourage the greater economic integration, labour mobility and convergence of living standards without which a single currency would prove too painful for some.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Campaign for more support to aerospace THE AEROSPACE industry, struggling under defence cuts and the downturn in civil business, is launching a campaign to coincide with the start of the general election to seek greater government support. On Monday the Society of British Aerospace Companies will send a series of briefing papers to potential parliamentary candidates from all parties warning them of the plight of the aerospace industry and the repercussions on jobs and technology in industry as a whole. The society warns that aerospace industry employment will fall as much as 25 per cent - or about 44,000 jobs  - between 1989 and this year because of defence cuts and the civil aerospace recession. It estimates employment in its 240 member companies will fall from 194,000 jobs in 1989 to about 150,000 by the end of this year. 'Further job losses will take place in small companies providing services and goods to the aerospace industry.' A society official said yesterday that aerospace workers were voters in 340 constituencies. Of these, two thirds were regarded as among the top marginal constituencies in the forthcoming election. Sir Ralph Robins, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, yesterday stressed that the UK aerospace industry required the same 'level playing field' as rival aerospace industries, which were facing the same pressures of defence cuts and a downturn in civil orders. He told the Aviation Club of Britain: 'Some of our foreign friends receive considerable help from their governments. Either we have to stop these governments doing this or we must join them and help our industry in the same way.' The society is pressing for a closer dialogue between companies and government to ensure that the UK maintains the optimum defence industrial base and leading edge technological competence in spite of restructuring. Among other industry demands are increased government investment in new space and civil aerospace projects and the increasing of government launch funds for civil aerospace projects to include components and avionics. It says the government should support aerospace companies considering investment outside their traditional activities.</p>

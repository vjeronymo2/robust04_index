			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Senior CIA agent charged with spying for Moscow The US issued a strong formal protest to the Russian government yesterday after the arrest of a senior Central Intelligence Agency official and his wife on charges of spying for Moscow. 'It is a very serious case,' President Bill Clinton said after the arrests had been made public. Charges filed in a federal court in Virginia said Mr Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran, had spied for the Soviet Union from 1985 until its collapse in 1991, and then continued to spy for the Russian Federation foreign intelligence service. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, summoned the Russian charge d'affaires to the State Department to deliver a strongly worded protest, and Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador to Russia, issued a similar complaint to officials in Moscow. White House officials refused to discuss in detail what consequences the incident might have for US-Russian relations, but would not rule out the possibility that it could affect the level of US financial aid to Russia. Last night, a White House official demanded that Russia voluntarily withdraw the diplomats who handled the CIA agent. If Russia does not take the action, the official said, 'We'll have to take the action ourselves.' Although now in the CIA's counter-narcotics unit, Mr Ames was previously in charge of the Soviet division of its counter-intelligence arm. Government officials said there had been suspicions as early as 1985 that a mole might be at work, but the investigation of Mr Ames and his wife Maria began only 10 months ago. Papers filed with the federal court said top-secret documents unrelated to Mr Ames's work had been found in his office last June. A subsequent search of the couple's home produced a typewriter ribbon from which agents extracted damaging information. Justice Department officials said Mrs Ames, a 41-year-old Colombian-born, naturalised US citizen, was co-operating with the investigation, but it was not clear if she had agreed to testify against her husband. Mr Ames, 52, and his wife allegedly received more than Dollars 1.5m in exchange for some of the most damaging secrets ever lost by the US, including details of CIA operations and agents. Officials said the arrests capped a two-year probe, which had been apparently triggered by a tip from a KGB defector. Last night Mr Toby Jessel, Conservative MP for Twickenham, said he would raise the issue with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, to find out if British security had been put at risk or been infiltrated.</p>

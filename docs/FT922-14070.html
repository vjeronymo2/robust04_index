			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Sticking a neck out to save the crane - The competition for land between rice farmers and conservationists in Vietnam The eastern Sarus crane, a tall grey bird with a brilliant red neck, can live for more than 80 years and mates for life. In Vietnam, it is a symbol of eternity, carrying man's spirit to heaven. Nevertheless, the creature is fighting for its life as farmers and conservationists compete for the land on which it feeds. Until seven years ago, the Sarus was feared lost to south-east Asia. Land development, the ravages of war in Indo China and hunting left no wild Sarus alive in China, Thailand and the Philippines. Its status was questionable in Burma, Laos and Cambodia. Then in 1985, ornithologists discovered a group of the cranes in Dong Thap province in south-west Vietnam. The discovery has moved environmental matters up the political agenda in a country preoccu-pied with post-war economic development. Dong Thap province, bordering Cambodia, has thus become the focus of worldwide attention. The International Crane Foundation, based in Baraboo, Wisconsin, has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars on field research to save the crane. A nature reserve called Tram Chim (meaning bird swamp) has been set up to protect the birds' feeding ground, with a field centre financed by German conservationists. Vietnamese conservationists and authorities have devoted efforts to preserving the natural habitat. The problem is that the land comprising the 9,000-hectare nature reserve is very much in demand. Thousands of impoverished farmers are being moved to the region's wetlands to relieve population pressures elsewhere in the country. The land, with poor growing soil that is highly acidic, can produce up to three rice crops a year. The more land a farmer has, the better his chances of making a living. George Archibald, director of ICF, spends about one month a year at the reserve to oversee its development and protect incursions by the farmers. 'The reserve is under pressure because the local people would like to turn the whole area into one big rice field, cutting down all the trees. That's what we are battling against,' he says. His task has been to heighten the local people's awareness of the importance of the crane. Through Earthwatch, the environmental charity, Archibald brings paying volunteers from abroad to help him with his field research, including visiting villages and local schools to educate people about the birds. The fact that the volunteers - mostly American  - pay a lot of money to join the Earthwatch team does not escape the notice of the Vietnamese government. Nguyen Quyen Sinh, general director of Vietnam National Tourism Corp, the government body responsible for tourism, told this year's group of international volunteers that he would ask the prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, to make the reserve into a national park. Archibald believes there is great potential for ecotourism in the area - for example, bird-watching holidays. Tourism in Vietnam remains underdeveloped, with general tourism approved by the government only five years ago. Agriculture is the mainstay of the country's economy, employing about 80 per cent of the workforce. Last year 350,000 tourists and businessmen visited Vietnam, but more infrastructure development is necessary before the market grows significantly. In the meantime, local farmers are concerned only with feeding their families. Conservationists are therefore pinning their hopes on finding alternative sources of income for the Dong Thap area. Le Dien Duc, co-ordinator of the wetlands and water birds working group at the University of Hanoi, believes forestry might be the answer. The wetlands area is home to the Melaleuca, a valuable tree that withstands rot and is used in the construction of house foundations, dykes, dams and furniture. Its oil has medicinal value, its flowers are used for honey, and the wetlands where the trees grow harbour commercially valuable fish. Melaleuca forests used to cover 250,000 hectares in the Mekong delta before the Vietnam war, and during the war were home to the Communist-backed Viet Cong. The US army sprayed toxic chemicals, bombed and napalmed the area and dug drainage canals to kill the forests. After the country's reunification in 1976,farmers continued the deforestation, adding drainage canals to create rice fields. Trees have since been planted but there are still only 116,000 hectares of Melaleuca growing in the area. Duc says such forests would help to minimise the damage caused by storms in the rainy season - when whole areas, including houses, can be under water. The trees help to improve the quality of the soil over time by preventing acidification. They also filter pollutants from underground water. 'It's our solution to help the local people live in harmony with the environment,' he says. Farmers have rejected Melaleuca forestry in the past because of the five-year delay before timber harvesting is possible. Duc believes that with financial and technological support - most likely from international organisations and foreign governments - the local people could learn to restore and manage the forests profitably.</p>

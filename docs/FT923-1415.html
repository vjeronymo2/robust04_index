			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TT moves up 10% to Pounds 7.5m TT GROUP, the industrial holding company, managed to increase interim pre-tax profits by 10 per cent in spite of its UK dependence. Profit rose from Pounds 6.77m to Pounds 7.47m on turnover static at Pounds 78.6m. Operating profit advanced by 3 per cent to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 8.54m), while interest costs were reduced to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 1.77m). Although the group is noted for its acquisitiveness - and is having talks with loss-making AB Electronics - these figures were virtually unaffected by recent purchases. Magnetic Materials, finally acquired this summer after a hostile bid fell short last year, is expected to have a neutral effect on the second half. Before that, the last significant acquisition was Crystalate, a maker of electronic components, in 1990. Mr Nicholas Shipp, director, said further improvements had been achieved by continuing to weed out low margin business. Although there was no divisional breakdown, the industrial division, which includes Crystalate and last year accounted for 62 per cent of sales, showed the best growth. A slight improvement was achieved by the packaging division. Beatson Clark increased efficiency with the help of new plant. Building services, a much smaller operation, suffered falls in both sales and profit. Mr Shipp said that after a share placing that raised Pounds 6.88m, and expanded the equity by about 5 per cent, gearing fell below 20 per cent at the half-way stage. At the year-end it was 25 per cent on net debt of about Pounds 17m. The MMG acquisition had added Pounds 7m to debt, taking gearing into the high 20s. The group currently holds stakes of about 7 per cent in both AB Electronics and ML Holdings, a manufacturer in aerospace and electronics. Talks with the latter were not active. Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 6.9p (6.5p). The interim dividend is 2.4p (2.2p). COMMENT It is no mean achievement for an industrial company with nearly three quarters of its sales in the UK to keep profits and earnings per share moving ahead. Yesterday's 1p rise in the share price to 198p looks a bit churlish and does little to recover the ground lost since the late May peak of 239p. The explanation seems to lie in anticipation of more paper being issued for the next acquisition; in a quibble about the gearing position (eventually accounting standards might dictate that the Pounds 10m of preference shares are treated as debt); and in doubts about the quality of the product portfolio. The first and third questions are partly answered by TT's track record in turning acquisitions round, which includes dealing ruthlessly with poor-margin turnover. The accounting change is some way out and would affect many. Pre-tax profit is forecast to rise to Pounds 16.2m for the full year, compared with Pounds 14.6m. On a prospective p/e of 12.5, the shares look moderately priced. Although acquisitive mini-conglomerates are not to everyone's taste, there looks to be scope for an improved rating.</p>

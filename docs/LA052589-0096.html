			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: NEW PLAYS, NEW MONEY TO SPARK CTG/AHMANSON  </P> <P> Plays by Edward Albee, August Wilson, Alan Ayckbourn and Neil Simon will make  up Center Theatre Group/ Ahmanson's first full season in the organization's  temporary home at the Doolittle Theatre.  </P> <P> And CTG/Ahmanson has received an infusion of money from the Ahmanson Foundation  -- $1.5 million as a working capital reserve fund and $100,000 for a study of  the potential physical reconfiguration of the Ahmanson Theatre.  </P> <P> The announcements of the 1989-90 season and the "unprecedented and unique  grant" were made this week by the organization's new producing director, Gordon  Davidson.  </P> <P> He also announced a "pre-season bonus option" for Ahmanson subscribers: Derek  Jacobi as Lord Byron in the American premiere of Jane McCulloch's two-actor  show, "Byron -- Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know." Isla Blair will play all the  women's roles. Subscribers can buy discounted tickets to "Byron," scheduled for  Aug. 23-Sept. 17.  </P> <P> The season itself will open Oct. 5 with a revival of Albee's "Who's Afraid of  Virginia Woolf?" directed by the playwright and starring Glenda Jackson and  John Lithgow. It will play through Dec. 17.  </P> <P> "Our hope and expectation is that we will then do it in London," said Davidson.  "I want to create an exchange between here and there." Next season Davidson's  other theater, the Mark Taper Forum, will present the American premieres of  three plays previously staged in London.  </P> <P> Next up at the Doolittle is Yale Repertory Theatre's production of Wilson's  "The Piano Lesson," Jan. 18-April 1. The play "will be re-rehearsed and  re-worked" by Wilson and director Lloyd Richards, said Davidson. "They want to  do it one more time before they take it to New York." The current version of  "The Piano Lesson" is at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, closing Sunday.  </P> <P> Davidson announced "The Piano Lesson" as part of the Mark Taper Forum season  two years ago, but then pulled it from the schedule at the request of its  producers. It had been conceived for a proscenium stage and "they didn't want  to re-stage it for (the Taper's) thrust stage," said Davidson. The Doolittle  has a proscenium stage.  </P> <P> Davidson will direct the season's third offering, Ayckbourn's "Henceforward . .  .," scheduled for April 19-July 1. A comedy set in a high-tech future,  "Henceforward . . . " was initially staged at Houston's Alley Theatre before  becoming a hit in London. This will be the play's return to the United States.  </P> <P> The touring company of Simon's latest Broadway hit, "Rumors," will appear at  the Doolittle July 12-Sept. 23, 1990, Gene Saks directing. The farce was first  presented last fall at the Old Globe. Five earlier Simon plays had their  premieres at the Ahmanson, and Davidson said he hopes Simon will resume that  tradition at the Doolittle and/or the Ahmanson.  </P> <P> Simon will be the only local playwright represented in either the  Ahmanson/Doolittle or the Taper mainstage seasons this year. Asked about this,  Davidson replied, "Give me a break." Then, assuming a more serious tone, he  continued: "Now that I've got two seasons set, we can deal with (play)  development. I'll be on the lookout in the Taper Lab for new work that could be  done at the Doolittle as well as at the Taper."  </P> <P> As previously announced, "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," a dance musical opening in  November at the Shubert Theatre, will also be offered as part of the Ahmanson  season. Selected seats will be reserved for Ahmanson subscribers during eight  of the first 12 weeks of the run -- and for former Shubert subscribers during  the other four weeks. A Shubert spokesman said the order of which weeks will be  assigned to which subscription list has yet to be determined. But for Ahmanson  subscribers, an attempt will be made to match the location of their seats at  the Shubert with their seats at the Doolittle.  </P> <P> Does the expansion of Davidson's realm to the Shubert mean that his title is  now: artistic director-producer of Center Theatre Group/ Mark Taper Forum and  producing director of the Center Theatre Group/Ahmanson Theatre at the UCLA  James A. Doolittle Theatre and the Shubert Theatre?  </P> <P> Just asking . . .  </P> <P> The Ahmanson Theatre itself hasn't been forgotten. Davidson said he hopes the  $100,000 from the Ahmanson Foundation for "exploratory work" on the potential  Ahmanson remodeling will result in specific proposals within the next six to  nine months -- with the goal that "on the day 'The Phantom (of the Opera)'  closes, we'll be able to move in there (and begin reconfiguring)."  </P> <P> Asked whether the new season would have worked at the Ahmanson, Davidson  replied that "the Ahmanson would probably be too large for all the shows in  this season. Each is eminently suited for the (1,021-seat) Doolittle; they may  or may not have worked at the (2,071-seat) Ahmanson."  </P> <P> The $1.5-million reserve fund from the Ahmanson Foundation "lifts a tremendous  weight off our shoulders," said Davidson. "No more will we have the feeling of  'one false move, and we're dead.' "  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ahmanson subscribers will actually be able to see something at the  Ahmanson next season, too -- "The Phantom of the Opera." Next year's  subscribers will be offered a chance to buy four "prime location seats" to "The  Phantom" -- in addition to the "Phantom" tickets that were part of the Ahmanson  package this season. Dates for the new set of tickets will be after Nov. 26 --  the last date for which tickets are currently being sold.  </P> <P> Speaking of "The Phantom," alternate Marcy D'Arcy will play Christine at the  next two Saturday matinees and then regularly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Dale  Kristien plays the role at all other performances.  </P> <P> AWARDS: Jerri White and Lester Barrie won first place in the Inner City  Cultural Center's annual Ira Aldridge Acting Competition.  </P></p>

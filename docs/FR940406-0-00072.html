			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Under the new expedited McKinney Act screening process, the Military Departments shall sponsor a workshop or seminar in communities having closing or realigning bases before reporting to HUD. All available property at closing and realigning bases that will become surplus to Federal Agency needs will be reported to HUD: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) By June 1, 1994, for the 1988, 1991, and 1993 closures and realignments, unless the community requests a postponement of the declaration of surplus under paragraph (a)(7) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Within 6 months of the date of approval of the 1995 base closures and realignments unless the community requests a postponement of the declaration of surplus under paragraph (a)(7) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) HUD shall make a determination of the suitability of each property to assist the homeless in accordance with the McKinney Act. Within 60 days from the date of receipt of the information from the Department of Defense, HUD shall publish a list of suitable properties that shall become available when the base closes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Providers of assistance to the homeless shall then have 60 days in which to submit to HHS expressions of interest in any of the listed properties. If a provider indicates an interest in a listed property, it shall have an additional 90 days after submission of its written notice of interest to submit a formal application to HHS, a period which HHS can extend. HHS shall then have 25 days after receipt of a completed application to review and complete all actions on such applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) During the new expedited McKinney Act property screening process (from 60 to 175 days following  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> publication, as appropriate), disposal agencies shall take no final disposal action or allow reuse of property that HUD has determined suitable and that may become available for homeless assistance, unless and until: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) No timely expressions of interest from providers are received by HHS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) No timely applications from providers expressing interest are received by HHS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) HHS rejects all applications received for a specific property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) If no provider expresses an interest to HHS in a property within the allotted 60 days, the Military Department should promptly inform the affected local redevelopment authority, the Governor of the State, the local governments, and Federal Agencies that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property will be available for community reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written expression of interest to incorporate the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) If there are expressions of interest by homeless assistance providers, but no application is received by HHS from such a provider within the subsequent 90-day application period (or within the longer application period if HHS has granted an extension), the Military Department should promptly inform the local redevelopment authority, the Governor of the State, and Federal Agencies that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property will be available for community reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written expression of interest to incorporate the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan for the base. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) If at any time during the 25 day HHS review period HHS rejects all applications for a specific property, the Military Department should promptly inform the local redevelopment authority, the Governor of the State, and Federal Agencies that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property will be available for community reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written expression of interest to incorporate the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan for the base. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) During the allotted 1-year period for the local redevelopment authority to submit a written expression of interest for the property, surplus properties not already approved for homeless reuse shall not be available for homeless assistance, unless such homeless assistance is included in the local redevelopment authority's plan. The surplus properties will also not be advertised by HUD as suitable during these 1-year periods. The surplus property may be available for interim leases to any entity, including local redevelopment authorities as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

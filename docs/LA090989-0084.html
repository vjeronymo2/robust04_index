			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAIR CONVICTED IN STARVATION DEATH OF SON  </P> <P> A jury convicted an unemployed couple of third-degree murder Friday for  starving their 14-year-old son during a six-week fast that the family endured  while leaving nearly $4,000 for God and waiting for his help.  </P> <P> Larry and Leona Cottam, who are Seventh-day Adventists, held hands and showed  no emotion as jury foreman Maria Uitti read the guilty verdicts before the  packed Luzerne County courtroom.  </P> <P> Eric Cottam died Jan. 3 after the family had not eaten since Nov. 22. The  Cottams' 12-year-old daughter, Laura, recovered from malnourishment and is in  foster care.  </P> <P> Besides third-degree murder, which required a jury finding of malice on the  part of Cottam, 39, and his wife, 38, the couple were found guilty of reckless  endangerment and endangering the welfare of children.  </P> <P> The Cottams remained free on $50,000 bail each posted by an anonymous  benefactor. No sentencing date has been set. The Cottams face a maximum of 28  years in prison.  </P></p>

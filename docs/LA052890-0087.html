			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN, 19, KILLED AS TRUCK FLIPS  </P> <P> A 19-year-old man was killed in East San Diego when the pickup in which he was  riding was struck by a car that ran a stop sign, authorities said Sunday.  </P> <P> Two people inside the car fled the area on foot, police said, and were still at  large Sunday.  </P> <P> Richard J. Figueroa, who lived at 3868 38th Street in East San Diego, was  pronounced dead at the scene from massive head injuries, a coroner's office  spokesman said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred at 11:53 p.m. Saturday at 38th and Wightman streets. The  pickup in which Figueroa was riding was westbound on Wightman when it was  struck by the car, said a San Diego Police Department spokesman.  </P> <P> The impact flipped the pickup on its side, crushing Figueroa's skull, police  said. Mark Harris, 28, the driver of the truck, escaped injury, as did a second  passenger, whose name was not released.  </P> <P> Police said that Harris, although not at fault in the accident, was arrested  for driving under the influence, in this case a misdemeanor. Had his drinking  contributed to the death of Figueroa, he would have been booked on a felony,  police said.  </P></p>

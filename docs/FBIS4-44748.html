			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "30 Million for Chip Program"] </F>   [Text] Utrecht -- During the next five years the Foundation  for Technical Sciences [STW] will inject as much as 30 million  guilders in the chip program Prorisc. This will serve as a  platform for researchers in the broad field of microelectronics;  from the manufacturing of simple chips to the design and  realization of complete systems, including peripheral  electronics. STW's annual report announces that 60 researchers  are involved in the Prorisc program. Contacts also exist with  researchers from Belgium. Prorisc is recognized by the IEEE, the  American Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p>

An important statement. Among the believers are men who have  been true to their covenants with Allah; of them some have died  and some still wait, but they have never changed their  determination in the least. [Koranic verse]    O masses of our lofty Yemeni people: As history recorded in  its black chapters the hideous crimes and rancorous practices  perpetrated against the honest people of Abyan by warmongers and  vampires, it also recorded in its shining chapters the honest  stands, sacrifices, and heroic acts carried out by the sons of  Abyan throughout ages.    Abyan represented the torch of the revolution. We only  mention this as a reminder to say that we are proud that Abyan  is the birthplace of [name indistinct], 'Abbas, [names  indistinct], Muhmmad 'Ali Haytham, and former Yemeni president  'Ali Nasir Muhmmad.    O masses of our lofty people: The Abyan Governorate, which  turned over the black chapters of history, [passage indistinct].  What took place during the past stages will not prevent us from  continuing to struggle and defend unity and democracy. Abyan  will always remain a symbol of loftiness and pride. As it was  the cradle of revolution and revolutionaries, it will continue  to be so during the unity.    Let the banners of unity and democracy remain high. Splendid  victory is the lot of our masses. Pride to Abyan and glory to  its sons.    [Signed] The sons of the Abyan Governorate, Sanaa    [Dated] 22 [as heard] February 1994</p>

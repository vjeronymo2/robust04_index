			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / People: Sir Robert Clark to chair bank boutique At 69, Sir Robert Clark, one of Britain's best-connected merchant bankers, has finally got an investment bank with his own name on it. He has been made chairman of Rauscher Pierce &amp; Clark, a London investment banking boutique, being established by the Dallas-based firm, Rauscher Pierce Refnes. The new boutique plans to marry Rauscher Pierce Refnes' strengths as the leading investment bank in the US South West with the contacts of a group of European investment bankers led by Sir Robert, who rose to prominence as a merchant banker during his chairmanship of Hill Samuel from 1974 until it was taken over by the TSB Group in 1987. A former director of the Bank of England and vice chairman of TSB until March 1991, Sir Robert is currently chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers, vice chairman of SmithKline Beecham, and has a string of other directorships including Shell Transport and Trading. David Quint, a 42-year-old lawyer and managing director of the new firm, says he has known Sir Robert for ten years having been introduced to him by former Hoover boss Sir Peter Boon, a fellow director of Belden &amp; Blake, a small US oil company. Sir Robert and Quint visited three US regional firms before linking up with Rauscher Pierce which has 25 offices around the US South West. The US firm will have 25 per cent of the equity and Sir Robert will have 'almost the same'. Sir Robert said yesterday that it was nice to work 'for oneself for a change' and he expected to devote about a third of his time to the new venture. The advantage for the US parent is that its new European outpost - it will also have a Zurich office - needs little capital and will have low overheads. 'It only takes a couple of projects to make quite a difference,' says Quint. Sir Robert has recruited a couple of 'old friends' to his board - Richard Butler, a former president of Paine Webber International, and James Ladner, a Zurich-based investor and former executive vice president of Coutts' Swiss bank. Rauscher Pierce will be represented on the board by David Smith, chief executive, and Robert Brown, head of corporate finance. ***** Pat Dyer, managing director - gases at BOC, has been appointed deputy chairman of the BOC group. He will deputise for Patrick Rich, chairman and chief executive, in a wide range of roles, allowing him to concentrate on strategy and planning. The group is also reorganising its divisional structure in an effort to integrate its regional businesses more effectively and increase the spread of its technology. Chung Kong Chow, known in the business simply as 'CK', has been appointed to the new position of group operating officer and chief executive of BOC gases. He was previously director North Pacific gases.</p>

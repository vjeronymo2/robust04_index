			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEARNING TO DODGE THE PARKING LOT DODGE  </P> <P> I enjoyed your column (Joseph Bell, Aug. 24) this morning. The parking lot  dodge has irritated me for decades. We had a 1965 black-and-silver Porsche  years back that we didn't let anyone else drive, not even tux-wearing  parking-lot parasites.  </P> <P> At a Century City affair about 25 years back, we pulled up to let my wife out  at a hotel door. The parking lot honcho wanted to take over. "No way," I said.  </P> <P> "Well, you'll have to take care of me," the parking parasite insisted. I gave  him a five and parked the bomb myself.  </P> <P> The last few years, a certain Dana Point restaurant has swarmed with beady-eyed  parking lot pests. We foil the greedy, grasping goofs by arriving early. If we  ever arrive when the lot is filling up, I'll get my binoculars out of the trunk  and pretend to be enjoying the view. While the leeches are victimizing some  other innocents, we'll slip into the restaurant.  </P> <P> JOE McGUIGAN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

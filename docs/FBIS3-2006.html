With the country's 100-plus real estate companies taking  part, the exhibition has been mounted in Beijing's  newly-completed building material mansion.    The exhibition is sponsored by the Construction Commission  of  the Beijing municipal government and jointly hosted by the  Beijing real estate development market and the Dayin Real Estate  Exhibition Center.    Being displayed are the achievements and recent development  of real estate all over the country. Deals on houses of various  grades built for sale on the open market are taking place at the  event.    Personnel from the municipal housing management departments,  banks and legal departments are on hand at the exhibition to  handle on the spot such matters as transfer of ownership for  house-buyers.    The Beijing municipal government has also provided  well-designed apartments -- on sites totalling two million  square meters in area -- for sale at the exhibition so that  ordinary salary-earners can enter the house market as well.</p>

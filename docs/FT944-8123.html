			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Setback for Forza Italia in local polls: Government parties pay price for splitting up to contest many towns and regions Forza Italia, the political movement founded and led by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday sought to play down the results of Sunday's local elections which indicated the party was losing grassroots support. The main national coalition parties - Forza Italia, the populist Northern League and the far-right National Alliance - split up to contest many of the 242 regional and mayoral elections, and suffered as a result. Of the government parties, only the Alliance was able to boast of increasing its share of the vote. The main opposition party, the former Communist PDS, also performed well. In spite of the difficulty of interpreting the scattered local results, analysts estimated yesterday that Forza Italia's support could have slipped by 10 points since the June European elections, in which the party received more than 30 per cent of the national vote. Mr Cesare Previti, Forza Italia defence minister, said a low turnout of voters had hampered the performance of the centre parties. Mr Gianfranco Fini, the Alliance's leader, said yesterday that the only way forward was for the feuding members of the coalition to stick together. He pointed out that had they agreed to run under a single banner they would have outscored the centre-left parties in many of the local polls. The most closely watched contest was in the northern industrial town of Brescia, where Mr Vito Gnutti, the League industry minister, supported by Forza Italia, was beaten by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, ex-leader of Italy's former Christian Democrats, in the first stage of the two-round poll. With nearly all the results in, Mr Martinazzoli had received 41 per cent of the votes, and Mr Gnutti 26.8. Mr Gnutti and Mr Martinazzoli will fight the second round alone, on December 4, and the final result could depend on the choice made by National Alliance supporters. The Alliance's young candidate, Ms Viviana Beccalossi, won 12 per cent of the first-round votes. This was more than expected, to the irritation of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, who considers Brescia and the surrounding region his party's heartland. Mr Berlusconi, in Naples for the opening of the United Nations conference against organised international crime, was able to draw comfort yesterday from news that his government's much-criticised 1995 budget measures had passed their first parliamentary hurdle, winning the formal approval of the lower chamber.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Wrong order of priority: Last week's real disasters were not in the money markets 'The Russian Revolution? You can't stop me shrugging my shoulders. On the scale of ideas it is, at most, a vague ministerial crisis.' The author of those words was a surrealist poet, Louis Aragon, who later became a leading French communist. By the same token, perhaps one day I shall become a convinced monetarist. But, for the moment, my view of the turmoil in the currency markets is essentially Aragon's view of Russia, vintage 1924. 'To call it revolutionary,' he added, 'is a veritable abuse of language.' The same could be said when words like 'disaster' are used about the demise (or relaxation) of the European exchange rate mechanism. I'm not sure I would go quite as far as The Independent - the admirable but eccentric British newspaper which banished the ERM completely from its front page on Monday morning and used the space to print the names of more than 2,000 people supporting its call for military action to save Sarajevo. But I sympathise with its objective, which must have been to restore our sense of proportion. The real disasters of the last week were not in the currency markets but in Bosnia and Lebanon. It's hard to say which was more depressing: the grim face of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, who told a parliamentary committee his offensive in Lebanon was designed (yes, designed) to create a wave of refugees; or the beaming faces of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, when Bosnia's president Alija Izetbegovic conceded their aim - a division of his country along ethnic lines. Israelis do not like being compared with the Serbs. In a letter in Monday's FT, one explained that Bosnian Moslems have no choice but to flee, whereas the Lebanese do have the choice. All they have to do, it seems, is 'express their hostility to the terrorist group', Hizbollah, and 'Israel will welcome these inhabitants back'. Very generous, I'm sure. But one thing one can say for the Serbs is that they are only seeking, by utterly barbarous methods, to control areas of Bosnia and Croatia where they already live. No Israeli has ever lived in south Lebanon. In so far as others who do live there support Hizbollah, they do so because it is fighting Israeli occupation of the 'security zone' inside Lebanon. Israel rightly objects to Katyusha rockets being fired at its territory. That has been the ostensible reason for all its military activities in Lebanon, including the unbelievably destructive invasion of 1982. But the problem is still there. The one solution Israel has not tried is the one ordered by the UN Security Council back in 1978: a full withdrawal to the international border, leaving the UN interim force to prevent a return of Palestinian guerrilla units to the border zone while the Lebanese state reimposes its authority. Yet even now the 'international community' does not insist on compliance with that resolution. Indeed, the Security Council had nothing to say about last week's fighting. The US seems to accept the Israeli view that this cynical use of violence, which destroyed the homes of many thousands of people, has somehow 'advanced the peace process'. Meanwhile, in Geneva the EC and UN mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, have been twisting Mr Izetbegovic's arm to get him to accept what they and their employers have often pronounced unacceptable. Last September, Lord Owen said: 'We have to convince the Moslems that they are not going to be the victims of realpolitik.' Now, it seems, he is trying to convince them of the opposite, and is irritated by suggestions that Nato aircraft might, after all, intervene to prevent the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo, fearing this will encourage the Moslems to hold out a little longer. In a Channel 4 TV interview screened on Monday night Lord Owen admitted he could have resigned in May when the Washington conference scrapped his previous peace plan. That plan involved a territorial partition of Bosnia on effectively ethnic lines, but a fairer one than is now proposed, with far fewer people being displaced. But Lord Owen apparently thought that to do so would have been quixotic and self-indulgent. It is a perverse sense of honour which keeps someone doing a dishonourable job. If Lord Owen felt - as well he might - that his task had been rendered impossible by the unwillingness of western powers to confront Serb and Croat realpolitik, he should have resigned and said so. As it is, he finds himself (as one who has worked closely with him remarked last week) behaving like the character played by Alec Guinness in The Bridge on the River Kwai: an officer in charge of a detachment of prisoners of war who takes pride in the bridge he has built for the enemy and is horrified by his own side's desire to blow it up. The true nature of the new world order is becoming clear. I know, 'new world order' was last year's cliche, or rather the year before's. Nowadays one is supposed to talk about 'world disorder'. But even more sinister than chaos and violence in themselves is the deliberate use of them to bring about a new political order; and even worse than an international community that clucks ineffectively and does nothing is one that busies itself with dignifying such callous realpolitik with 'agreements' on which the victim must shake the hand of the aggressor. Perhaps that is the only kind of world order there ever was, or could be, but it leaves a very unpleasant taste in the mouth. Moreover, it is hard to see why such agreements should last any longer than the balance of forces which dictated them.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Cathedrals take the road to Rouen - William Packer admires Monet's masterpieces in situ There have always been artists who have engaged themselves, at least loosely, with the idea of the series. The natural narrative of the lives of the saints is an obvious example, as is the regular return to a particular theme or image - the self-portraits of Rembrandt and Van Gogh, or the near-formulaic landscapes of Hobbema or Turner. But the insistent return to the particular image and its re-statement in its identical format is something that we now recognise as being peculiar to the art of the modern period. Indeed we have grown so used to it by now as a convention of modernism that we hardly notice it. The conceptualism of the late 20th century, so dear to our contemporary critical, avant-garde hearts, could not get by without it. Malevich, the Russian suprematist, who had seen the two examples of Monet's Rouen cathedral facades in the Pushkin museum in Moscow before the Revolution, was moved by the experience to say that 'Monet's cathedral has a capital importance for the history of art and forces entire generations to change their conceptions.' Now, to brand Claude Monet as a pioneer of conceptual art would be perhaps a shade mischievous, but it remains most certainly true that of all the great artists of Impressionism and post-Impressionism he was the pioneer in the practice of working thus closely in series. Furthermore, to take any of the paintings from those series that became the determining feature of his later career - the poplars, the hayricks, the Thames at Westminster, the pools and water lillies, and of course the cathedral facades - and consider them not simply but within the context of its particular group is inevitably to take into account certain near-conceptual questions and assumptions. For what we have are images that if they differ at all, they do so only marginally and to little material effect in the bare terms of what they superficially represent. Yet the differences between them are manifest, and of the first importance to any direct experience, as much physical as imaginative, of the works themselves. Elusive and imponderable as they are, such differences register the shifting, delicate nuances of personal response, ours and the artist's together, to the fleeting moment and passing of time. There on the canvas is the stroke of the brush, and the accumulation of paint that marks and records it and makes it permanent. And there, in the mind as in the eye, is the conjuration of something altogether more intangible and ephemeral, as the shadows pass across those immovable, ever-changing arcades and pinnacles of the old cathedral - now light, now dark, now yellow, pink, blue, morning and evening. Monet knew Normandy well, especially the coast between Etretat and Dieppe, and had often passed through Rouen. He had discovered Giverny, down the Seine north west of Paris, in the early 1880s, and in 1890 bought the house where he was to live for the rest of his life. He began at once to build the water-garden which was to be the greatest and most compulsive of his subjects, but his garden, as would any other, took time to grow. Besides, he was never its prisoner and Rouen was less than forty miles away towards the sea. He paid his first extended working visit to the city in 1892, returned in 1893 and in the spring of 1894 embarked upon the series of cathedral facades that, but for the later Nympheas, would be the greatest of them all. He made 30 paintings in all, of which 20 were shown in Paris the following summer by his dealer, Durand-Ruel. Monet's old friend, Georges Clemenceau, saw at once that the state should buy the lot, le pacquet, and addressed himself in no uncertain terms to the president of the Republic, Felix Faure, to say so. But the moment passed. Inevitably they were dispersed, all but ten of the original 30 eventually fetching up in public collections around the world, but only seven of them in France. Eleven were brought together in 1990 for the Royal Academy's spectacularly successful exhibition of the several 'Series of Monet,' and now 16 are being shown in Rouen, the first time in a century so many have been reunited, and where better than in the city of their making. All conform more or less to the same format, more tall than wide and never much more than three feet by two. The two earliest are exceptional in that they concentrate less on the fabric of the cathedral itself than on the old houses clustering round the foot of the corner tower that were destroyed in the last war. For the rest, it is the facade proper that dominates, at first full frontal, looking straight at the high-pointed gothic porch and round west window, and then fixing on the more oblique and famous view that slants across from the south west. And always the emphasis is across and upwards, the ground incidental where it is described at all, the image ever more suggestive, abstracted, hinted at rather than described. Pink fuses with ochre, grey with violet, yellow with orange, the cathedral itself seeming to dissolve into exquisitely covered smoke or mist, as it were a most substantial pageant, faded. These paintings are indeed such stuff as dreams are made on. Les Cathedrales de Monet: Musee des Beaux Arts, Rouen, until November 14.</p>

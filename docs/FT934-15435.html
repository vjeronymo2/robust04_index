			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: A revealing dilemma - When should company secrets be made public in EC competition investigations? When European companies are faced with a competition investigation by the European Commission, they have two interests that are often at odds with each other. On the one hand, they need as much detailed information about the allegations against them as they can find. On the other, they want to keep their own commercial information secret from other companies, especially their competitors. This issue of when a business secret should be protected by the Commission and when it should be disclosed is a matter of debate among competition lawyers. In general terms, the secrecy accorded to information is in inverse proportion to the right of access to the Commission's case file: if the right of access is increased, the right to protect commercial information is correspondingly reduced, and vice versa. By definition, two or more companies - usually competitors - are involved when the Commission is investigating suspected cartels or collusion. All companies involved have equal rights both of access and of secrecy. This results in a conflict of principle. In practice, it may be resolved by the Commission deleting sensitive information before letting other companies see documents. But there must be criteria for allowing a deletion, since there are bound to be cases where other companies have a legitimate claim to see the sensitive information. When differences arise, the Commission has to resolve them. It has been told by the European Court to make a decision that can be appealed there and then if it decides to disclose a company's business secrets to a company that is not one of those under investigation. It is possible that the Court would extend this principle in future to cover disclosure of information to co-defendants. Meanwhile, the Commission's refusal to reveal evidence to a particular company, or its disclosure of evidence when it should not have done so, may in general only be remedied by annulment of the Commission's final decision by the European Court of First Instance. This court is a new force in EC competition law. It takes its duty to scrutinise procedure seriously. In several cases it has been willing to strike down a Commission decision because of procedural irregularities. This is creating a fully fledged legal control of Commission procedure. The procedural law emerging as a result was reviewed at a seminar organised in Brussels by the Commission's competition directorate, DG IV, at the end of last month. Access to the Commission's case file emerged as the single most contentious issue. It seems certain to be raised before the CFI before long. The Commission obtains a great deal of documentary evidence - agreements, letters, memoranda, notes of meetings, etc - in the course of an investigation. Companies have little power to resist its broad powers of seizure, provided it acts lawfully and within its powers. When the Commission comes to examine the evidence and compile its case against the company, the process becomes adversarial: the Commission acts as prosecutor. The company being investigated must be able to defend itself. It is entitled to know the nature of the charges against it. Access to the file by companies directly concerned is required by case law as part of their rights of defence. The extent of these rights depends on their nature, which was strongly disputed at DG IV's seminar. Mr G Vandersanden, of Brussels law firm De Backer &amp; Associes, said the rights of defence existed as a matter of law. They were not in the gift of the Commission, to be granted in its discretion on a case-by-case basis. Mr Peter Duffy, an English barrister, went further. He argued that they were the fundamental rights to fair trial guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Although the Commission is an administrative rather than a judicial body, the heavy fines that it may impose (up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover) are sufficiently serious to give the procedure a penal character. As a penal procedure, the human rights convention would apply, he said. Dr Klaus Ehlermann, EC director-general of competition, did not accept that the human rights convention applied to the Commission's competition procedures. But, even if it did, he argued, an administrative procedure would be evaluated in a fundamentally different way from a criminal procedure. Also the convention's application to companies should be fundamentally different from its application to individuals. Mr David Vaughan QC, took the view that countervailing interests, such as business secrecy, would almost invariably fall into a lower category of protection than a right of defence. They could not be put forward as a reason to deprive a company of its right to defend itself. The first question that needs to be answered is: what is the file? This is far from clear. If it consists only of the Commission's statement of objections against the defendant companies and their replies, no one could object to its disclosure to all parties. The file is now generally understood to mean the information in the Commission's possession on which it is basing a particular case. This may include vital commercial information about a company. A company's co-defendants are among the people to whom it would least like to show this information. There was no consensus at DG IV's seminar on the underlying legal principles governing secrecy. The discussion was confined to companies' proprietary information which could not in principle be disclosed to a wider public. Disclosure to a competitor complaining to the Commission, rather than being investigated by it, raises a parallel issue. Mr Fernando Pombo, of Madrid law firm Gomez-Acebo &amp; Pombo, analysed the legislation and the principles underlying the scant case law on the subject. He reasoned that the use of information collected by the Commission was always restricted in a general sense because the information was 'confidential'. Information concerning a company that was not public knowledge came within the category of 'professional secrecy'. The Commission had a duty not to disclose it except in specified circumstances, which might override a claim to secrecy by the company affected. 'Business secrets' were a sub-category of professional secrets which could not be disclosed to anyone without the consent of the company to which the information related. Such information included industrial property, information on prices, costs and sales, product development details and investment plans. Mr Julian Joshua of DG IV disagreed with Mr Pombo. He argued that professional secrecy depends not on the nature of the information, but on the quality of the person holding it. The degree of disagreement among lawyers on the basic principles affecting information in the Commission's hands was unexpected, and it seems certain that, before long, these issues will end up being litigated. Open dialogue between the Commission and those involved in its procedures is clearly a good idea. It would be even better if, the next time DG IV debates the issue, it invites those most closely affected, the corporate in-house lawyers.

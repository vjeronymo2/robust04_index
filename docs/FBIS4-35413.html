			<p>BFN     [Text] His Royal Highness Crown Prince has said that Arabs  were cautiously optimistic about peace with Israel.    This came in a speech before an annual meeting of the UN  agency caring for Palestinian refugees, read on behalf of his  royal highness by Minister of State Mr. 'Adil 'Irshayd.    The crown prince said the continued frustrations Arab people  have lived over the past two years are regressing now, and are  being replaced by cautious optimism that the peace process will  continue its march until it reaches a comprehensive solution.    But Prince Hasan added that the feelings of fear and anxiety  are still there, referring to unresolved Arab-Israeli issues and  agreements signed but never implemented.    Prince Hasan said the UN Relief and Works Agency should  continue health and education services until the plight of 3  million refugees were settled in a fair and permanent way that  secures their rights in line with UN resolutions.</p>

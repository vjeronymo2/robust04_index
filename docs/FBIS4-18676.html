			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the Socialist and Communist Party groups in  the National Assembly, as well as some members of the Republique  et Liberte group, proposed the first no-confidence motion  against the Balladur government.    Drawn up on the initiative of the Socialist Party, the  motion  criticizes the Balladur government's record since it came to  power a year ago and calls for the repeal of the five-year law  on employment.    The 83 MPs who signed the motion say that the law "relies on  the deregulation of labor, the massive insecurity of  employment...and the undermining of the status of employees."</p>

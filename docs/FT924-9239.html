			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Observer: Won't wash Even Britain's Europhile MPs might think again about 'closer union' with continental neighbours after seeing a survey of 20 nations' habits, made by the IP group. True, it assures us that attending to personal hygiene is typically the third most time-consuming daily activity of Europeans, after sleeping and cooking. But nearly one in 20 don't include personal hygiene in their day's routine at all. On the other hand, when the average European grooms the car, the job takes no less than 86 minutes. Brits are supreme in two particular occupations. They spend more time each day watching tv (four hours 13 minutes) than any of their counterparts, and less time working. The most enviable Europeans seem to be the Danes. Not only do they claim to have the most satisfying love lives in Europe, but no less than 95 per cent pronounce themselves happy with their daily lot - Maastricht treaty or no.</p>

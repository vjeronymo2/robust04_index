			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> The editorial is little more than a mean-spirited tirade directed against  animal rights activists. Referring to these activists as cranks, and as being  self-absorbed and vulgar, and as people engaged in self-righteous tantrums is  uncalled for.  </P> <P> In the same issue in the View Section there is an article about Jane Goodall, a  scientist of unquestionable reputation, whose attitude concerning medical  research on animals is much more reasonable than that presented on the  Editorial Page. She advocates that more money and research be invested in  funding alternative research methods and that there be more effective  supervision to see that the animals in medical laboratories receive the best  possible treatment.  </P> <P> Surely there must be ways of discovering medical knowledge other than  continually torturing so many helpless animals. If there is such a thing as a  just God, the human species will be punished for its cruel treatment of other  animals.  </P> <P> RONALD N. DAY  </P> <P> Lemon Grove  </P></p>

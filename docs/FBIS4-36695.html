			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 12 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak  received Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat at his place of  residence in Tunis this evening. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  also attended the meeting. After the meeting, 'Arafat said that  his meeting with President Mubarak is within the framework of  his constant meetings with him. He expressed pride in the firm  ties between Palestine and Egypt. He said that he emphasized to  President Mubarak that the Palestinian people will not forget  the noble and firm stance of the Egyptian leadership and people,  noting the efforts President Mubarak made until the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed in Cairo on 4 May. He  said that the Palestinian people fully appreciate this effort.    'Arafat pointed out that he explained to President Mubarak  certain issues relating to implementing the Israeli-Palestinian  agreement and the need to implement it honestly and quickly. He  noted that he focused on the poor state of the infrastructure in  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a result of complete  destruction -- particularly the schools, hospitals, and  universities. He noted that the people are suffering from  problems with the drinking water in Gaza and that kidney failure  cases are rife in the Gaza Strip as a result of using this  water. He said: We have to start from square one and expressed  confidence that brothers and friends will assist the  Palestinians.    'Arafat stressed the need to implement the Cairo agreement  meticulously and honestly, noting that Israel places obstacles  in the way. He said: We have to begin receiving powers in the  West Bank but this procedure is still crippled. He said that  the Palestinian detainees problem is a basic issue, noting that  a number of detainees, particularly those with long sentences,  have not yet been released. He said that the Israelis must  fulfill their obligations. Concluding his statement, he  reiterated his greetings and appreciation to the Egyptian  leadership, government, and people for standing by the  Palestinian people at the start of their liberation and until  the Palestinian flag is raised over all the West bank and the  Gaza Strip.</p>

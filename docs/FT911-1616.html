			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Steady advance inspired by Wall St A STEADY advance in London share prices yesterday was inspired by Wall Street's good performance overnight and, to a lesser extent, by the start of the new session as well. Domestically minded investors waited for the results of UK local elections and found little direction from a mixed bag of corporate news. The market shrugged off the latest in the series of rights issues. The Pounds 119m cash call from engineer T &amp; N surprised sector specialists. Market strategists see more on the way. They reiterated their view that the stream of rights issues - worth Pounds 1.1bn in April and more than Pounds 300m in the first two days of May - would be a drag on share prices. Such cash as was being invested in the UK was directed primarily into the less speculative sectors, such as food retailers, utilities and banks. Better than expected results from Wellcome triggered heavy buying of the stock and made it the sharpest riser of the day in the Footsie. Mr Richard Kersley at BZW saw the interest in retailers as more than just a response to the Appeal Court ruling earlier in the week which opened the way for more shops to open on Sundays. He said it also reflected a conviction that when the economic recovery came it would be consumer-led. Its scale would still be modest, however, perhaps half that of the growth in consumption in the late-1980s, widely seen to have stoked up inflationary pressures at the time. The interest in defensive vehicles also allowed investors to take into account the widely divergent views on when recovery would begin in earnest. Even the most bullish of broking houses sees little recovery in the near term, and there are several prepared to pencil in the summer of 1992 rather than the last quarter of 1991. Analysts were wary of committing themselves on the very short term as well. County NatWest believes that politics will be the key to sterling and gilts over the next week. Mr Bob Semple at County said that while yesterday's local elections would help indicate whether the government had succeeded in reducing the vote-losing effect of the poll tax, London shares would still look to New York for inspiration. He added that the US stock market, where prices already discount a recovery, was more vulnerable to downgradings than London, especially if US inflation figures came in above expectations. Today's US employment figures will provide the next test of sentiment. True to form, the 42-point rise overnight on Wall Street underpinned London's opening. Hopes for more to come pushed the FT-SE 100 index to a high for the day, just before Wall Street opened, of 2,539.3. While US stocks did indeed stage early gains, they were not enough to stave off scattered selling in London. The Footsie drifted back to end at 2,530.7, up a net 22.3. Turnover reached 516.6m, continuing the week's gentle rise. The extra activity yesterday was said by traders to have been the result of funds taking the opportunity to sell selectively into the rally. These levels of trading leave brokerages uncomfortable: turnover is more than 100m shares a day below the levels seen in the March bull market and barely two-thirds of the Pounds 1bn a day seen as a profitability benchmark by the City. The brewery sector was the softest. Aided by bid speculation, it has bucked the market trend for several days. But such thoughts were forgotten as attention turned to the more measured rally elsewhere.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Management: A deal that aims to deliver / A look at the attraction of logistics alliances As more multinational companies cut their number of factories in Europe, and concentrate production in fewer countries, many of them are also subcontracting their transport and warehousing services to a single outside provider of 'logistics' services. But most of this 'outsourcing' is focused too much on cost reduction, and too little on improvements in service deliveries to customers. This is one of the main conclusions to emerge from a study of 'logistics alliances' between 50 customer companies and 20 logistics specialists across five north European countries*. The study was carried out by McKinsey, the management consultancy, with the Centre for European Logistics. The study reports that logistics alliances are being set up rapidly, in both industrial products and consumer goods. But so far most of them involve only the stocking, handling and transport of finished goods. Less than half those surveyed also covered the inflow of goods, parts and materials. Specialisation of production across borders is one of two motives for the creation of logistics alliances, according to the study, the findings of which are reported in the latest issue of the McKinsey Quarterly by two consultants, Peter van Laarhoven and Graham Sharman. The other factor is the decision by some companies to focus on 'core competences' such as product development, manufacturing, marketing and selling, and to outsource logistics to a specialist provider. Among the pioneers of such deals, the study cites Rank Xerox, the copier maker, and the Dutch transport company Frans Maas, whose relationship has evolved over a decade, with periodic increases in the scope and value added by the arrangement. Almost half the deals involving international flows are being taken by forwarders such as Sweden's ASG and Germany's Kuehne &amp; Nagel, according to Laarhoven and Sharman. But the overall market leaders - if purely national deals are also included - are warehousing specialists such as Nedlloyd's Districentres and NFC's Exel. Non-European 'integrators' of both warehousing and transport are now becoming 'more active', says the study. For the majority of deals, the study's use of the term 'alliance' may be premature: Laarhoven and Sharman themselves say that most are still at an early stage of development - which they christen 'contract logistics'. Companies are tending to choose their service providers on the basis of hard, competitive cost bidding. Only one in seven of the customer companies in the study chose to negotiate with an existing service provider on a 'sole source' basis. But the study argues that many relationships will grow deeper with time. The excessive focus of most deals on cost reduction, and the inadequate priority they give to service improvement, probably result from the fact that the main stimulus behind most of them is corporate restructuring, say the consultants. Too much emphasis on cost reduction in negotiating an alliance actually inhibits a successful outcome, argue Laarhoven and Sharman. Instead, they advise companies to emphasise delivery service as the first priority. Opportunities for cost reduction will arise through improved methods and co-operation once the alliance has settled down. The consultants also advise customer companies, most of which are several times larger than their service providers, to avoid the temptation to respond to recession by reverting to traditional 'arm's length' purchasing methods. Logistics alliances will only flourish if companies are willing to nurture their relationships, share information and explore ways of extending the scope of the arrangement. A few companies have gone as far as subcontracting management control of all or part of their inward and outward 'supply chain'. *Logistics Alliances: the European Experience.

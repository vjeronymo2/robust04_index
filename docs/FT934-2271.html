			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Tough job for the job seekers: Michiyo Nakamoto on a Japanese employment market mismatch The sign on the front entrance to the public employment office in central Tokyo is inviting. 'Hello, Work' it proclaims to the 1,000 or so people who approach the grey building each day in search of work. But inside, the scene in the smoke-filled counselling room crowded with be-suited men and women is grim. Many of the panels which should have contained advertisements for job openings are marked with a sign saying 'No offers'. The number of job offers advertised at the Iidabashi Public Employment Security Office has halved since two years ago. The number of job seekers visiting the office each day has doubled in three years. As the recessionary pressures facing the Japanese economy have continued unabated, more companies are finding they can no longer afford to honour the Japanese tradition of lifetime employment. 'Japanese companies do not lay off employees, because that is socially unacceptable,' says Mr Kazutoshi Saiki, vice-chief of business at the employment office. 'But there are a growing number of people, older men in particular, who are being encouraged to retire early. And when that happens, it becomes too uncomfortable for them to stay with their company.' Officially, unemployment in Japan is 2.7 per cent - still moderate compared with the west. The ratio of job openings to job seekers throughout the country has reached 0.67, the lowest in more than six years. At Iidabashi there are still 1.32 job offers per job seeker but it is especially difficult for two groups of people - general office workers and those over 40. To a larger extent than in the past, growing unemployment in Japan is a white-collar problem. Most of those flipping through folders or talking to staff behind the counters at the employment office in Iidabashi are middle-aged navy-suited men, and women both young and old. For general office workers, the jobs to job seekers' ratio is as low as 0.32. Two-thirds of calls received by an employment hotline set up by an association of lawyers in mid-November, were from men and women over 45. When hiring from outside, most Japanese companies value personality, ability to fit in with the group or attitude to work above qualifications or past experience. It is also felt that paying an outsider an attractive salary could damage the morale of long-serving employees who are having to work their way up the corporate ladder. As a result, people looking for a second career often feel that the pay and status being offered to a newcomer fail to reflect their true worth. Furthermore, companies seeking extra employees are medium- to smaller businesses which generally cannot meet the more attractive conditions offered by larger companies. Things are likely to get worse before they gets better. According to a Labour Ministry survey of manufacturing companies last month, nearly half said they felt the strains of excess labour. Mr Saiki argues that the Japanese employment system, which creates general managers rather than specialists and which prizes loyalty over qualifications, has created this mismatch between job seekers and jobs available. Unless Japanese society itself changes, things will not improve for middle-aged people looking for new jobs, he says.</p>

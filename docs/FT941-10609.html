			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Brazilian spending fund approved Brazil's Congress yesterday averted a clash with finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso when it approved the first of two votes on an emergency fund to help balance the government's budget. Mr Cardoso, who had threatened to resign if the fund was defeated, finally won Congress' support following last-minute concessions apparently designed to limit education cuts. He is now expected to push ahead with the next steps in his economic stabilisation programme, designed to tackle inflation of more than 40 per cent a month. The emergency fund is designed to give the government more control over spending and raising new money. It will hold and directly distribute spending which would normally be immediately transferred to states and government agencies. By retaining these resources, the government will be able to claim a balanced budget. About Dollars 16bn of tax and social contributions will be channelled into the fund, slightly more than was expected when Mr Cardoso announced his package last year. He was forced to negotiate an increase in the fund after Congress defeated a proposal for a slight increase in corporate tax. Instead, the government will raise taxes and social contributions on banks and retain federal employees' income tax now transferred to the states. The fund is being set up through a constitutional amendment and therefore requires a second vote.</p>

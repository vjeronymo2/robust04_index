			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : SNIPES IS RISING FAST WITH ROLES IN 'KING OF NEW YORK,' 'JUNGLE  FEVER'  </P> <P> Wesley Snipes gets fifth billing in the new ultra-bloody, ultra-violent "King  of New York." He plays one of several cops out to stop a self-styled Robin Hood  drug kingpin (Christopher Walken) who's determined to distribute his ill-gotten  wealth to the poor.  </P> <P> But remember Snipes' name -- it's rising fast.  </P> <P> He gets top billing in "New Jack City," directed by Mario Van Peebles and due  out early next year from Warner Bros., portraying a sophisticated, ruthless  drug lord.  </P> <P> And Snipes is starring in Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever," now shooting in New York  City. Snipes, who portrays an upwardly mobile architect involved in a  relationship with his white secretary, admits to some trepidation about the  role.  </P> <P> "I've been concerned about how to pull it off," he says of the acting stretch.  "I'm very grass roots, he's a yuppie. I'm not a yuppie at all. I'm hard-core --  rough, man, rough. I grew up in the South Bronx."  </P> <P> For all his professed street toughness, Snipes, 28, has plenty of professional  polish. He appeared as a villain in Michael Jackson's "Bad" video, as an  aspiring boxer in the film "Streets of Gold" and as a speedy baserunner in  "Major League."  </P> <P> But his strongest critical plaudits were earned in Lee's last film, "Mo' Better  Blues," in which Snipes portrayed a jazz saxophonist whose cool demeanor belies  a deeper caring and complexity.  </P> <P> "The response to my work has been wonderful," says Snipes. "It's nice, because  they comment on my work, rather than personal (aspects). They seem to respect  me as a young cat who's a versatile actor coming up."  </P> <P> He'd like to do more action films -- "the more action, the better" -- but he's  also pleased with his rise to stardom.  </P> <P> "I got no complaints," he says, while keeping his success in perspective.  "We'll see how long it lasts." JOHN M. WILSON  </P></p>

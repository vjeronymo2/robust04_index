General Burlakov's Press Conference"]    [Text] "The former political leaders of the ex-USSR --  Gorbachev and Shevardnadze -- signed in October 1990  understandings on pulling out the Western Group of Forces [WGF]  without giving a thought or consideration to the future of tens  of thousands of families of officers who had no apartments, and  who are to return to their country," Colonel General Matvey  Burlakov, commander in chief of the WGF, stated today in a press  conference in Berlin.    He pointed out that despite the difficulties involved in  pulling out history's biggest group of forces located on the  territory of a foreign country to their homeland in a short time  frame, this "uniquely complex" task is being tackled according  to an agreed schedule. To date, 90 percent of servicemen,  military hardware, and supplies have been withdrawn to Russia.    The main problem, according to the WGF chief commander,  remains as before a considerable -- up to 40 percent -- lag in  the construction of housing for WGF servicemen in Russia behind  the rate of the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany.    The commander in chief did not hide his dissatisfaction with  and great anxiety at the fact that the total number of  apartments in Russia for WGF servicemen yet to be completed is  47,000. That includes, in almost equal shares, the housing that  was supposed to be constructed with 7.8 billion Deutsche marks  (25,000 apartments) and with the money provided from the budget  of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry (22,000 apartments).    Another problem is the rising crime around WGF garrisons in  Germany: Attacks on Russian servicemen by emigrants "of all  stripes," as the chief commander put it, and from German  neo-Nazi hooligans, have not stopped.</p>

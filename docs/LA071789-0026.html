			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL OPENS ANNUAL FESTIVAL WITH 'RUDDIGORE'  </P> <P> Occidental College opened its 30th annual summer theater festival Friday with a  bright, sprightly production of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Ruddigore." But if  Gilbert's spoof of 19-Century melodrama was well served in the Remsen Bird  Hillside Theater, Sullivan's music fared less well.  </P> <P> Credit director Brian Nelson for the fluid staging and setting an antic tone by  interpolating the cliche of a villain stealing candy from a baby during the  Overture. But his bringing the ghosts on stage during the legend of the  Murgatroyds in Act I reduced their impact when they stepped out of the picture  frames in Act II.  </P> <P> As Robin, Kevin Pariseau acted with comic flair and mobile facial features, and  sang in an acceptable sprechstimme. Margaret Scheeper proved an attractive  Rose, singing with a silvery soprano that grew edgy in the night air.  </P> <P> Timothy Syverson was a virile Dauntless, but prone to crooning. As Despard,  Jonathan Hogan flung his cape wickedly, but sang weakly. George P. Michaels was  a vocally unsteady Sir Roderic.  </P> <P> As Hannah, LaVonne Alexander combined vocal security and sympathetic acting.  Kathie Cole Freeman was an eerie, but small-voiced Mad Margaret.  </P> <P> The chorus was well drilled by music director Stephen Gothold. But as the  ghosts, the men sounded too thin, pale and unthreatening.  </P> <P> Pianist Russ Litchfield gamely conducted a small band made up of winds (Allen  Savedoff), cello (Pamela de Almeida), synthesizer (Philip Orem) and percussion  (Kris Mettala). But his directing from the side led to some spotty vocal  entrances, plus a major glitch when the picture frames opened before the  timpani roll designed to cover any mechanical noise.  </P> <P> Tom Butsch designed the handsome, compact set units, which were warmly lit by  R. Craig Wolf.  </P> <P> "Ruddigore" continues in repertory at Occidental Summer Theater Festival  through Sept. 2. CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

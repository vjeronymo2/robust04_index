			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 18 April carries in its  regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic. Reception is fair.    Updating the situation in Gorazde, Enes Musovic says that  "the early evening hours bring only continuation of the agony,  chaos and hell. The Chetniks are intensifying their murderous  attacks. They are about to enter the town." He says that  "while NATO planes continue their futile flights high above  Gorazde, the aggressor is continuing the slaughter of civilians.  The Chetniks have fired dozens of thousands of shells today  alone, and it is a miracle that anybody is still left alive  here."    In his report from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that  "throughout the day, Chetniks have been shelling the defense  positions and civilian targets from several artillery  strongholds. The enemy has been pounding Djukici, Vranovaca,  Boderiste, and the central part of the Brcko defense with  mortars and recoilless guns. A B-1 hill cannon [as heard] has  been firing from Cadjavac at Vranovaca and Omerbegovaca." He  says that "the general alarm was sounded twice today, at 1200  [1000 GMT] and 1600, thus marking the periods of the heaviest  shelling of the free Brcko territory, which has been exposed all  day to fire from the Chetnik 120-mm and 155-mm howitzers."    The Teocak Press Center reports that "this morning howitzer  and tank shells, and mortars fired from the Chetnik stronghold  of (?Dzemad), Priboj, (Dusanovo Brdo), and Lokanj landed today  on the villages of (Snjeznica), Jasikovac, (Bivalici), and Stari  Teocak. Several people were wounded."    The 206th Chivalrous Zvornik Brigade reports that "since the  early morning hours, tanks, howitzers, and mortars of all  calibers have been used to indiscriminately pound Sapna,  Kobilice, Vitinice, Zaseok, Nezuk, and Kodus. Over 150  destructive shells landed on the free Zvornik territory, but  miraculously there were no casualties."    Jasmin Puskarevic reports from the "free territory  Doboj-East" that "in the operative zone of the 109th Doboj  Brigade the aggressor has been continuously shelling the defense  lines and the civilian targets in the area of Lukavica, Rijeka,  and Klokotnica. Several civilians were wounded in these  attacks." He says that "one interesting thing is that the  Chetniks have recently been firing Russian-made 57-mm missiles."    Reporting from Gracanica, Izudin Durakovic says that "early  this morning the Serb aggressor launched a fierce artillery  attack on the defense positions of the 109th Doboj Brigade, and  the civilian targets of Klokotnica, Lukavica, (Sanic Rijeka),  and Hodzici. The attacks continued during the day. The  Chetniks attempted several infantry breakthroughs in the region  of Mujanov Mezar, but without much success." As for Gracanica,  he says that "the Chetniks fired with tanks, howitzers, and  cannons at the defense positions of the 111th Gracanica Brigade;  then they pounded Lukavica, and (Lukavica Rijeka) with  artillery."    Smajl Terzic reports from the operative zone of the 7-South  Operative Group that "this afternoon new armored-mechanized  units were spotted in the region of (?Smajevac), which indicates  that the aggressor is preparing new artillery and infantry  attacks. One should add this: Today the enemy continuously  pounded Jelah, Tesanjka, Matuzici, and Alibegovci for five  hours, and there are dozens of casualties."    As for Sarajevo, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Press  Center reports that "a sniper from Faletic is firing at  Grusulje, and an antiaircraft machine gun is firing from Gradina  at Hodivode."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] The principal commissioner of the French  International Technical Service, Christopher Chaboud,  acknowledged Mexico as an example for both Latin America and  Europe in the battle against the drug traffic. He claimed that  our country has one of the most modern laboratories in the field  of expert and criminal investigation services on the American  Continent.    During the course to update forensic chemical analysis of  narcotics and psychotropic substances, given by specializing  officials from the Attorney General's Office [PGR], the French  researcher admitted that our country already has gained  experience in this field. He noted, however, that since all  nations have areas that should continue to be developed, an  international records system on drugs, for example, might  possibly be created. This would enable the various nations to  compare statistical data and drug samples, so as to locate the  centers for narcotics and psychotropic substances.    Addressing the PGR's general director of expert services,  Miguel Oscar Aguilar Ruiz, and investigators from our country's  various attorney generals' offices, Christopher Chaboud declared  that Mexico has a vast knowledge and a history of its own  regarding the investigation of, and the battle against the drug  traffic. He said that, therefore, other nations should view its  experience as an example.    He indicated that Europe has a different type of experience  in this field, but admitted that, in any event, there is just  one battle and the problem is the same internationally. Hence,  exchanges of views and information will help to accrue better  results in the fight against the drug traffic on all its levels.    Elsewhere in his remarks, the French official emphasized  that  Mexico and France have mutual cooperation agreements (the latest  one ratified this year). Through them, both nations have  promised to exchange information for the purpose of curbing the  dreadful phenomenon of drug addiction and trafficking which,  unfortunately, is afflicting the two countries.    He stressed that Mexico has a real, strong commitment to the  rest of the world in this respect and, although admitting that  each country has its own policy for fighting the drug traffic,  he said that Mexico would continue to be an example in this area  for both Latin America and Europe.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Funds threat to British Council BRITAIN'S cultural diplomacy is threatened by cuts in public spending and the government's drive to open up the Civil Service to competition from the private sector, Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the British Council, warned yesterday. Sir Martin, former chairman of Barclays de Zoete Webb, said at the launch of the council's annual report that the government's efforts to reduce public expenditure plans threatened the grants made by the Foreign Office each year to support the efforts of the council, the main agency for promoting British culture and the English language overseas. He also warned that it might have to withdraw from some countries altogether if it lost the contracts for work on behalf of the Overseas Development Administration. The report showed the first real decline in turnover since the early 1980s. Income from the council's commercial network of language-teaching centres rose 17 per cent to Pounds 38m while income from agency work on behalf of other bodies fell 8 per cent. As a result, it withdrew from the Cote d'Ivoire and scaled down activities in the Nordic countries. It managed to harness funding from different sources, including increasing private-sector sponsorship from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 5.5m. Annual Report.

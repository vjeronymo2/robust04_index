			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Mail delays hit investors outside UK  -Expatriates miss out on share offers EXPATRIATE shareholders may be missing out on UK companies' share offers and rights issues because of their inefficient mailing systems and other postal problems. George Kluge, an FT reader living in the Bahamas, has missed several share offers plus enhanced scrip dividend and rights issue deadlines because postal delays have eaten into the limited time available to take up the offers. Post between Europe and the Bahamas takes up to a week in normal circumstances. The usual time allowed to respond to rights issues is three weeks, so any delay can wreck an investor's chances of taking part. Post to other parts of the world can take even longer. 'Our recent experience has been that UK companies farm out the posting and could not care less about their overseas members,' says Kluge. One UK company recently failed to frank or stamp an envelope containing offer documents which was posted to the Bahamas. It was delivered weeks after the offer closed, and Kluge was forced to pay the postage. Sidlaw, the company involved, said that the company's offer documents normally were posted in pre-paid envelopes by the printers, but could not say what had gone wrong. It is now investigating the problem. RTZ also had some difficulties with a shareholder mailing earlier this year but, in this case, the Royal Mail accepted responsibility. In some cases, even if the item is delivered promptly, expatriate investors miss their chance to take up offers such as the BT3 share offer, which allowed only nine days for applications to be sent out and returned. Stuart Valentine, director of research at Proshare, the organisation which promotes shareholding by private investors, says he does receive occasional complaints about the length of time shareholders are given to respond to rights issues and other share offers. These complaints come not only from overseas shareholders but also from UK residents worried about missing opportunities while away on holiday. Extending the offer period, however, can expose companies and their underwriters to increased risk of market movements in the intervening period, which could affect the success of the issue. 'I think three weeks is a reasonable balance between the companies' needs and those of the shareholders,' Valentine says. Having a nominee shareholder who will receive mailings on your behalf might slow the process even further, as documents then have to be forwarded. Valentine says the only answer could be to give someone in the UK discretion to act for you although he accepts this has obvious drawbacks: you have to rely on another person's investment judgment, and you might not want to surrender control of potentially large sums of money to someone you do not know well. There is little action investors can take if they feel they have lost out financially by receiving offer documents late - neither the company nor the post office is liable to pay compensation, and it can be difficult to determine whose fault - if anyone's - the delay might be. If, however, enough shareholders let companies know about faults in the system, efficiency might improve.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister on  Friday [8 April] stressed the urgent need to create a new  political framework to prevent a further stall in Japan-U.S.  trade talks.    International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai  called an emergency press conference after Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa offered his resignation earlier in the day.    "The situation surrounding Japan-U.S. ties requires urgent  action," Kumagai said. "There is not much time left before  June."    Japan pledged to show concrete market-opening plans in June  or before the leaders of the world's seven major economies  gather in Naples in July for their annual summit meeting.    Kumagai said he understands Hosokawa's resignation offer,  saying the prime minister must have reached the decision as a  way to take responsibility for his financial dealings which have  paralyzed Diet discussion of the fiscal 1994 budget.    Hosokawa's coalition government was formed with top priority  on establishing high ethical standards for politicians, Kumagai  said.    The trade minister said the Hosokawa administration has  broken through many difficult problems its predecessor, the  Liberal Democratic Party, was unable to handle, Kumagai said,  citing political and administrative reforms, rice market  opening, deregulations and tax reforms.    What Hosokawa achieved is worthy of being remembered in an  historical context, Kumagai said.    Kumagai severely criticized the LDP for boycotting debate  over this year's budget. "The LDP is committing a suicidal act  that denies the fundamental function of the parliament," he said.    Kumagai said he is uncertain whether the planned meeting  between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor in Morocco on April 15 will take  place as scheduled.    The meeting was intended to seek a breakthrough in the  stalled trade "framework" talks between Tokyo and Washington.    "Paving the way for resumption of the framework talks is  something that should be taken care of by our cabinet but I  don't know what will happen," Kumagai said.    Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a major  coalition party, is tipped as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa.    Concerning a government to succeed the Hosokawa  administration, Kumagai said it should be formed after parties  concerned agree at least on the controversial tax issue.    The current ruling coalition parties were sharply divided  over how to finance tax cuts. This created political confusion  earlier in the day that delayed formulation of the fiscal 1994  budget.</p>

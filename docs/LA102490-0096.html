			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SECTION HAS HANDS-OFF POLICY ON FUND-RAISING  </P> <P> The Southern Section has no rules regulating fund-raising, according to  publicist Scott Cathcart.  </P> <P> A school can raise as much money as it likes and spend it however it wants.  </P> <P> "The only recommendation we make is that someone from the school's athletic  department be directly involved in the fund-raising process," Cathcart said.  </P> <P> There are rules regarding bonuses to players and coaches.  </P> <P> A school can't give a team's most valuable player $5,000 or a new car, t for  example.  </P> <P> And the team's coach cannot be paid directly with money generated by  fund-raisers. But there is a simple way to legally circumvent that rule. The  booster club can donate the money to the school district, which then could give  that coach a raise.  </P> <P> In the future, however, schools might have to give the state a slice.  </P> <P> The State Board of Equalization ruled last February that a Monterey high school  wrestling team must pay a sales tax on the thousands of dollars it made selling  fried calamari.  </P> <P> The 3-2 decision cleared the way for taxes on fund-raising for high school  sports.

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Inflation fears drive long-dated Treasuries lower Longer-dated Treasury bonds moved sharply lower yesterday as a regional survey of business conditions suggested mounting inflationary pressures. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 1/8 at 84 1/32 , with the yield rising to 7.615 per cent, its highest level since early May. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/8 at 99 21/32 , to yield 6.169 per cent. The market was forced to digest a batch of fresh economic news on a thin trading day. It not only was the last session before the end of the second quarter, but it fell a day before the official start of the long Independence Day weekend. Many traders were already on holiday, while others were waiting to see if next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm would result in the year's fifth increase in short-term interest rates. The data did not go down easily. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its June index of prices paid by manufacturers was well up at 69.7 per cent, against 63.6 per cent the previous month. The jump, combined with a moderate gain in the employment index, stirred the market's ever-present fear of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-rate investment. The Chicago survey often provides a preview of the national purchasing management report, due out today. Offsetting the bad news on prices, the Chicago index of overall business activity showed a modest decline in May, and initial claims for unemployment benefit last week were unchanged. But there was another indication that the economy was continuing to accelerate. The Commerce Department said that new factory orders in May had climbed 0.6 per cent, their third consecutive monthly increase. The net impact of the morning's releases was to drive down bond prices across the board, though the long end, which is most vulnerable to inflation, was hit the hardest. The extent of the downturn was exaggerated by the light activity. European government bonds fell back sharply in busy futures-driven trade. Markets were unnerved by the weakness in US Treasuries, the poor response to the Bank of England's tap offer of tranches of conventional gilts, strong UK economic data and by aggressive selling of French bonds. 'There was no single catalyst for the decline, it was rather that the more positive tone of recent days has faded,' said Mr Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch. UK government bonds dropped sharply through key psychological levels, dragged down by fears of rising inflation and by the lack of enthusiasm for the Bank of England's offer of Pounds 500m worth of tranches of conventional gilts. Encouraged by the success of its auction of floating-rate gilts on Wednesday, 'the Bank thought this was a good time to tap the market further, and in particular to tap the long-dated market', said Mr Sanjay Joshi, chief economist at Daiwa Europe. But although one tranche - a Pounds 150m tap offer of 7 per cent gilt Treasury stock due 2001 - was quickly exhausted, there was less enthusiasm for other tranches. Inflation fears were triggered by the UK purchasing managers' index for June, which showed a sharp rise in manufacturing activity and strong price pressures. The September long gilt future on Liffe was down 2 1/8 at 99 17/32 points in late trading. Italian government bonds, hit particularly badly by the renewed pessimism in Europe, suffered further from weakness in the lire and concern about the size of the budget deficit. Investors were unnerved by a warning from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that decisive action to limit the budget deficit should not be delayed and by a rise in the minimum rate at the Bank of Italy's repurchase tender to 8 per cent from 7.85 per cent. The Italian September BTP futures contract on Liffe was down 2.5 points at 102.70 in late trading. A cut of 10 basis points in the Bank of France's intervention rate to 5.1 per cent failed to halt the decline in French government bonds. The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at 115.26, down 1.24 points on the day. German government bonds also fell. The German September government bond contract on Liffe was down 1.03 points at 91.61 in late trading.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Gardiner falls to Pounds 1m as recession bites GARDINER GROUP, the distributor of security and surveillance products, yesterday reported a sharp drop in first half profits as recession continued to hit volume and margins. Mr Yashar Turgut, chief executive, said that the recession meant this year would be 'a bit of a non-event' for Gardiner, but that the strategy of developing its dominant European position in security systems distribution had not altered. Pre-tax profits for the six months to April 30 fell from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 1.04m on sales up 28 per cent at Pounds 36.6m. The result was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 479,000 to cover the cost of reorganisation, redundancy and compensation for the early departure of the finance director. He resigned after it emerged last year, shortly after the company had made bullish trading statements to the City, that the accounts had been based on some over-optimistic assumptions about margins. The poor results follow a traumatic period for the shares after the group reported pre-tax profits of only Pounds 6.03m last year, significantly below City expectations. The shares have fallen from a peak of 69p last September to yesterday's close of 19 1/2 p. Part of the increase in sales came from the acquisition of Multi-Video Distributors and AW Alarm System, bought last year as part of the strategy to reduce dependence on the UK intruder market and enter the closed circuit television business. Excluding these acquisitions, sales still grew 13.6 per cent, but at the expense of lower margins. Earnings per share fell from 2.56p to 0.72p, but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.47p. The UK intruder alarm market showed no volume growth, but Gardiner maintained market share, albeit at reduced margins. In Spain, the group suffered from what Mr Thomas Buffett, chairman, called the discounting policies of certain overseas manufacturers. In Benelux, however, sales and profits rose while in Scandinavia the group benefited from the acquisition of AW Alarm System.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Observer: Perssonal view Sweden's Social Democratic party is riding high in the opinion polls, ahead of next month's general election. Pity it's running scared of the financial markets. The SD is procrastinating on its election manifesto, leaving publication until after the markets close for the weekend. Can its leadership be worried about the effect the manifesto might have on the already flaccid Swedish krona? Creator of Sweden's gigantic welfare state, the party has been rumbling about tax increases if it returns to power. Pure chance that such noises have coincided with a slump in the krona and a surge in long-term interest rates, to their highest levels since the currency was floated in November 1992. The manifesto sounds pretty dull anyway. Goran Persson, shadow finance minister, said on Tuesday it would not detail public spending cuts. 'Persson sinks the krona,' shouted Wednesday's local business press headlines. Not that the krona's nosedive following Persson's words garnered many votes for conservative prime minister Carl Bildt. Sweden's tabloids preferred a thwarted armed break-in at the house of Curt Nicolin, formerly a senior aide of the Wallenberg family. Perhaps the manifesto will hint at big increases in spending on the police force - and free lunches for tabloid editors?</p>

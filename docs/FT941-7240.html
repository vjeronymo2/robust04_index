			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers sets float price at 153p United Carriers, the parcels and freight distribution company, finalised its flotation details yesterday, pricing the shares at 153p to produce a market capitalisation of Pounds 51.8m. Net proceeds to the company will be Pounds 6m, which will be used initially to reduce borrowings and strengthen the balance sheet, cutting gearing from 42.5 per cent at the year end to between 15 per cent and 25 per cent. Mr Allan Binks, chairman, said that, with the continuing recovery in the UK economy, the group would now be 'well placed to take advantage of its potential for profitable growth in the future.' Just over 15m ordinary shares, worth Pounds 23m, are being placed with institutions. The biggest seller is Phildrew Ventures, which in 1989 backed the management in a Pounds 55m buy-out from Bunzl, now a paper and packing company but then a conglomerate. Bunzl is selling its remaining 8 per cent stake. After the buy-out institutions will hold 68 per cent of the group. Directors, who held 31 per cent, will have 18 per cent. The remaining 14 per cent will be held by employees and former employees. The company's prospectus shows that operating profits on continuing operations before exceptionals rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 5.3m in the year to December 31. Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 93m to Pounds 106.4m. The notional net dividend for 1993 is 4.9p, giving a notional gross dividend yield of 4 per cent. The placing is sponsored by Lazard Brothers and brokers are UBS. Dealings are expected to commence next Thursday.</p>

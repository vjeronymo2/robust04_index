			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN TV PROGRAMS INVADE HOMES IN ASIA  </P> <P> Asian governments that want to control what their people see on television are  fighting a losing battle with satellites and receiving dishes.  </P> <P> Direct broadcasts from foreign countries into private homes via satellite are  spreading rapidly.  </P> <P> Some officials fret over the impact on their people's values and way of life.  Western diplomats say others fear that their social and political control might  be questioned if citizens have wider freedom of choice.  </P> <P> Ever smaller and cheaper receiving dishes and the launch of a major  telecommunications satellite make it increasingly difficult for governments to  deny viewers direct access to foreign television.  </P> <P> "We may not be able to check foreign TV intrusion into our lives for much  longer," Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore said in 1988, but he has done  a pretty good job so far.  </P> <P> The only known satellite-reception dish not in his government's hands that is  capable of receiving foreign programs sits on the roof of the U.S. Embassy.  Installation was permitted "strictly for embassy use" two years after an  application was filed.  </P> <P> Others in this prosperous city-state are prohibited by law from owning or  selling such dishes, except for export. Foreign programs for the three  Singapore Broadcasting Corp. channels are screened to "filter out unacceptable  and harmful values and lifestyles," said communications official Mah Bow Tan.  </P> <P> One official said full access to foreign TV shows, permissive American  offerings especially, could harm a young nation composed of different races,  religions and cultures. He said censorship of foreign movies, magazines and TV  was necessary to repel cultural subversion.  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees. Lim Boon Heng, a member of Parliament, said the government  should consider broadcasting to the surrounding region by satellite and stop  trying to control the use of receiving dishes.  </P> <P> Compact new receivers are small enough to fit into a suitcase, and Lim said:  "When dishes get to that size, the authorities will have a hard time to control  the use of satellite receivers . . . so why fight it?"  </P> <P> A major enemy in this information war is positioned slightly to the east and  22,753 miles up. AsiaSat-1 was launched from China in April by a Long March III  rocket and is in orbit near the Equator.  </P> <P> Telecommunications satellites are not new to the region. Indonesia was the  first country in Asia and third in the world, after Canada and the United  States, to have a domestic satellite. Japan and Australia also have  communications satellites.  </P> <P> AsiaSat-1, the first privately owned satellite, has the potential to beam  signals to and from the Middle East, Singapore and Tokyo, and could offer a  dozen new channels to an area with more than 2 billion potential viewers. The  owner is a consortium led by Hutchison Whampoa (Holdings) Ltd. and based in  Hong Kong.  </P> <P> In Indonesia alone, where reception from the government's Palapa series of  satellites was established in 1976, an estimated 25,000 dishes can pick up  AsiaSat-1.  </P> <P> Hong Kong officials announced in early August that individuals could own and  operate dishes for personal use without licenses, lifting a ban that had been  widely ignored for years. Broadcasters and operators of dishes that serve more  than one viewer must have licenses.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, the picture is equally mixed.  </P> <P> Satellite dishes are legal in the Philippines upon approval of an application,  but few applications are approved. Those who can afford it put them up anyway,  apparently assuming the government has more important rules to enforce.  </P> <P> Direct reception of satellite television still is forbidden in Thailand, which  maintains close control over telecommunications, but pressure against the  policy is increasing.  </P> <P> "We cannot stop technologies from growing," Joompol Rodcumdee of Chulalongkorn  University in Thailand told a regional seminar on the socioeconomic impact of  broadcast satellites.  </P> <P> "Today we may say we will not use them, but tomorrow we may not be able to get  away from them," he said.  </P> <P> Vijay Menon, secretary-general of the Asian Mass Communication Research and  Information Center, said the estimated 150,000 satellite dishes in South Korea  are "not viewed as a blessing or even as a sign of progress."  </P> <P> "Journalism professors have been filling local newspapers with letters  denouncing the impact of foreign TV on Korean society," he said. "Foreign  programs, they feel, are making viewers in Korea adopt alien ways of thinking,  life and customs and deepening the dependency of Korea on alien culture."  </P> <P> Malaysia bans private satellites for direct TV reception, and Madzhi Johari of  the government broadcast training institute said: "Direct access to  broadcasting satellites means direct import of norms and values of the  developed countries and will result in stress and conflict in our society."  Indonesians seem relaxed about the impact of numerous private dishes.  </P></p>

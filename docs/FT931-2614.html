			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: SCA cushioned by strong hygiene operations rise SCA, Sweden's second-largest pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a SKr451m (Dollars 58m) profit after financial items for 1992. A strong performance from its Molnlycke hygiene division helped to cushion 'extremely unfavourable' conditions for traditional forest industry products. The result was 63 per cent down on 1991's SKr1.22bn profit but it stood in sharp contrast to the company's two leading domestic competitors, Stora and MoDo, both of which have disclosed deep losses for 1992. SCA is holding its dividend at SKr3.20 per share. SCA said it expected 1993 profits after financial items to rise to SKr1bn-SKr1.5bn, even though conditions remain very difficult and falling prices have eroded much of the benefit from the devaluation of the Swedish krona. Sales fell to SKr32.1bn from SKr32.7bn. SCA benefits from having a more diversified range of products than other Swedish forestry groups and Molnlycke, in particular, has proved a recession strength. It boosted operating profits by 24 per cent to SKr901m as sales rose to SKr12.5bn from SKr11.6bn.</p>

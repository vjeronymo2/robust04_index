			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Clinton keeps up pressure on Serbs THE Clinton administration yesterday kept up pressure on Bosnian Serbs ahead of the vote tomorrow by their self-styled parliament on the Vance-Owen peace plan, signed by Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic on Sunday. Bolstering warnings delivered in Europe by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, President Bill Clinton said in brief comments prior to a meeting with Mr Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, that the US was ready to support a United Nations peacekeeping effort with a substantial US military involvement. Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said Nato was working on a peacekeeping plan with the UN. She noted that although Mr Clinton had ruled out a unilateral deployment of US ground forces in Bosnia, participation in 'the implementation of a mutually agreed peace treaty' was under consideration. Mr Clinton scheduled another afternoon meeting yesterday with senior advisers, at which the US contribution to a peacekeeping force was again to be discussed. Some controversy centres on the command of such an operation. Although the US force still in Somalia reports to a Turkish general appointed by the UN, it is assumed that the Pentagon would be uncomfortable if it enjoyed less than effective control over an operation as dangerous as that in Bosnia. Nevertheless, the administration is taking cautious - if temporary - satisfaction from the perception that its threat to use military force in Bosnia seems to have been influential in bringing about the provisional Athens agreement. There is also a more palpable sense of vindication that US support for President Boris Yeltsin of Russia has paid immediate dividends in the Balkans. Pressure from Moscow on Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, is seen as instrumental in getting Mr Karadzic to sign the Vance-Owen plan. This qualified sense of achievement is, however, tempered by the awareness that the war in Bosnia is far from over and that Mr Karadzic's signature may yet mean nothing. 'I want to evaluate them (the Bosnian Serbs) by their actions,' Mr Clinton said yesterday, repeating his weekend comments of the importance of 'deeds, not words'. Before he agreed to put 'one American soldier there. . . we're going to watch events,' he said, adding he would talk 'directly to the American people about it'. US participation in a peacekeeping force would not be politically risk-free at home, especially if it involved the deployment of 20,000-30,000 personnel. A Newsweek poll published yesterday found 60-27 per cent opposition to sending ground forces, while a Time-CNN survey found 52 per cent believed the US had already done enough to stop the fighting in Bosnia. The administration hopes, however, that politicians and the public would be more willing to support an allied peacekeeping operation under a UN umbrella and with Nato's engagement than a unilateral approach.</p>

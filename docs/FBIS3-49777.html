REPUBLIKA is the daily of the government-run Slovak News Agency.    These newspapers have evidently prospered from foreign  sources, Hofbauer says, with their reports on minorities coming  from Hungarian press cuttings. He says Slovakia is the only  European post-communist country which has thoroughly redressed  the wrongs of the past which were committed against all  religions.    On the subject of press freedom in Slovakia, Hofbauer says  the government is basing its policy on the Council of Europe's  resolution on journalistic ethics. Hofbauer adds no one in the  government has the task of inspecting the press, because in  Slovakia there is no censorship.    Statements about the "extermination of Hungarian from road  signs" are "considerably exaggerated," he says, because in every  state there is a legal form for road signs which cannot be  changed at will. If it could, there would be organizational  chaos in transport, Hofbauer says.    He says that Premier Vladimir Meciar's speech last September  about the Romany community was the work of CTK journalist Karel  Hirman, who put the words into the premier's mouth. This is why  legal proceedings have been started against Hirman.    Last autumn's physical attack on Rabbi Baruch Mayers was  connected with the growth in crime and had nothing to do with  race, Hofbauer says. The offenders were detained and the stolen  object, a hat, was returned to its owner, Hofbauer says.    There is therefore no need to fear for democracy in  Slovakia,  and it is enough to confirm "the continuation of the journey to  its own promised land," Hofbauer said. The results which  Slovakia achieved in its first year of independence are better  than international politologists and economic forecasters  predicted, Hofbauer tells REPUBLIKA.

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Management: Technology demands a more balanced view Technology tends either to daunt top managers or to dazzle them. Outside the confines of high-technology industries such as electronics, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals, few US and European chairmen or chief executives have a balanced grasp of what product or process technology can do for their company - and where the limits are. As a result they tend to veer between suspicion of technology and over-enthusiasm for it. The problem is particularly acute in the US and Britain, where only a handful of top managers outside high-tech industries have a technical background. It is aggravated further in companies which have a passion for one-off managerial 'flavours of the month'. Such naifs lurch constantly and dangerously between the latest one-dimensional 'best way' of revitalising their business, and the next one. Total quality management is overtaken by customer service, which then gives way to 're-engineering', and so on. Until the early 1980s the general executive attitude to technology was one of suspicion. Studies at that time showed that, even where a company had appointed a 'chief technology officer' or 'technical director', he was seldom ranked by the chief executive as a core part of his team. Research also showed that most companies' corporate and technology strategies were developed in isolation from each other. The arrival of microelectronics, new materials and powerful information technology appeared to change all that, even in relatively mundane industries such as motor vehicles and food. But more top managements were attracted to new process technology than to products, in part because it seemed less risky. Consultants advised them that the quickening pace of innovation around the world was making it harder to sustain a competitive edge through new products alone. The process mania drew many converts. As with any new religion, the most extreme were in the US. Deere &amp; Co, the conservative tractor maker, became almost as carried away by factory automation as General Electric and General Motors, which made expensive investments in the field but then proceeded to burn their fingers badly, both as makers and users. After several years of travail, GE, GM and Deere saw the light and pulled back, relegating automation technology to its rightful place as part of a wide spectrum of instruments - most of which are human and organisational, not technological - for improving quality, flexibility, productivity and cost-effectiveness. But GM's new-found technomania also led it up another garden path: the idea that IT would affect its industry so radically that it needed to own a computer services company. It chose fast-growing Electronic Data Systems (EDS). This week it emerged that GM is at last planning to sell EDS. It has recognised what common sense could have told it a decade ago: it can only revive its fortunes by focusing all its attention on becoming a better motor company. In less spectacular fashion, other companies saw the IT light several years ago. In the mid-1980s they had been dazzled by its promise, giving IT tsars big salaries, vast budgets, and a status in the corporate hierarchy which often outranked all other types of technology executive. But within a few years they ran into the now familiar corporate IT pattern of overspend and under-performance. Richard Heygate, a McKinsey director who specialises in IT, told a conference last week that the failure of computer technology to deliver 'bottom line value' over the past 20 years has made top executives search for almost any method of managing change that does not rely on technology. Technomania has given way to the old technophobia again. This lurch in attitude is blinding top executives to the much more flexible and cost-effective ways in which IT systems are now being designed and applied. It is also deterring them from using intelligent technology to reconfigure the way in which they do business, thereby stealing a considerable march on their rivals. Benetton did that in clothing and retailing, as have various mail order houses. First Direct has followed suit in UK banking, and Direct Line in insurance. In some companies, IT's plunge from grace has harmed the perception of technology as a whole. But in others the status of research and development has risen, as top management has realised that its consultants were wrong to downplay the importance of product innovation. R&amp;D spending has held up surprisingly well in the US over the last few years. In Europe, some companies now pay their R&amp;D chief as much as his finance colleague. But these are in the minority. In a recent study of high R&amp;D spenders, PA Consulting and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the chief technology officer (or equivalent) was a member of the top strategy-setting team of almost every company in Japan, but of under 60 per cent in Europe, and of just 20 per cent in the US. Only 34 per cent of US chief executives, and 37 per cent of the Europeans, were highly involved in developing the company's technology strategy, compared with 46 per cent in Japan. In other words, most western top managers still distrust technology, and keep it at arm's length. It is high time they made more of an effort to understand it, and put it on an equal footing with marketing, finance, and all the other inter-linked essentials of the modern business system.</p>

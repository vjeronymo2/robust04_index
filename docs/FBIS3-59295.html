According to a conservative estimate of the World Gold  Association, in 1992, gold sold on the Chinese mainland for  ornamental purposes amounted to somewhat over 250 tons, enough  for China to overtake the United States which has held the  record for the last 25 years as the world's largest buyer of  gold.    On passing into the "Year of the Rooster" [1993], the gold  ornament market throughout China has "turned the whole landscape  red" [a poetic quote, red being the color of great zeal and  flourishing prosperity] somewhat like an immense fiery explosion.  <H5>  Gold Prices on the Mainland Rose in Five Consecutive Stages </H5>   On the basis of last year, let us look more carefully at  gold  sales in Beijing, as gold prices rose within five months in five  consecutive stages. They rose from the original 100 yuan/gram to  150 yuan, to 115 yuan, to 120 yuan, 135 yuan, to 140 yuan/gram,  with swarms of buyers still eager to buy more.    As gold prices on the mainland rose briskly almost daily,  the  temporarily declining world gold prices were thereby given a  boost and restored to great splendor. Since March, world gold  prices have risen 25 percent. London, Zurich, New York, and Hong  Kong became bullish, prices rising from $325 to $360 per ounce,  and after a short development at a slower pace, again suddenly  jumping in May and June, piercing the $400 per ounce ceiling in  the first week of July, when prices reached the highest level  since 1991.    After the Spring Festival, the heat came on strong in the  otherwise frosty northern city of Harbin, namely the heat of  purchasing gold ornaments. One customer, who had selected a gold  necklace of 80 grams at Harbin's Asia Modern Dress and Jewelry  Store, then found it still too small, and he finally preferred  to buy 200 grams of other gold ornaments.    At the ornamental gold counter of the Qiulin Company, daily  sales at most amounted to 200,000 yuan. Some gold shops that  normally sold about 10,000 yuan could also increase their sales  three- or four-fold, and many shops warned the market that they  received insufficient supplies.    In Changsha, the gold ornament sales outlets at the various  large markets continuously brought in new supplies, but still  found all their supplies insufficient to meet demand. At times,  frantic buying emptied the shelves. Average daily transactions  at the gold ornament counters reached to over 100,000 yuan.  <H5>  Frantic Buying Clears All Gold at Exhibition </H5>   Formerly, the market for gold ornaments in Hunan had always  been weak, and shops had already reduced 24 K gold ornaments  from 100 to 95 yuan per gram, which still evoked little consumer  interest. Now, however, even such ornaments as bracelets of less  than 99.99 fineness, which had been unwelcome in the past, have  become fast selling items.    In Nanjing, according to information from relevant quarters,  a total of 312 kilos of gold ornaments were sold during January  this year, which was something hardly ever seen before. During  1992, the slightly more than 60 sales outlets in Nanjing, sold  1.9 tons of gold ornaments, on the average only 158 kilos per  month, but since coming into the "Year of the Rooster," there  has been a steep rise in the sales of gold ornaments.    The last few days, according to news from the Third Shanghai  Jewelry Exhibition, sales of various kinds of gold ornaments  there amounted to 36.5 million yuan, which was four times the  amount sold at the first such exhibition which had taken place  last year.    At the exhibition, the buying public still mainly preferred  ornaments of pure gold. During the first three days of the  exhibition, gold sales reached the high figure of 6.2 million  yuan, which was 70 percent of the total sales. Chains,  necklaces, and bracelets sold fastest at the exhibition. The  original intention was to have three days for the sale of the  chains and necklaces, but unexpectedly almost all were sold out  at the first day of the exhibition. Small pendants for children,  such as small butterflies, small keys, or small roosters of  about 1 gram each, altogether somewhat over 700 pieces, were all  sold out the first day.    The Shanghai Far Eastern Gold and Silver Jewelry Factory  exhibited items it planned to put into production, such as  artistic replica in gold of the 12 animals of the Chinese  zodiac, also a "golden boy of wealth" and a "Tang-Dynasty-style  imperial goblet." Each item was priced at several tens of  thousands yuan, and all were carried off by eager customers.  <H5>  China Enters Its Golden Age </H5>   This was the banner headline in the NEW YORK TIMES,  used--certainly with some irony implied--when it reported on  this subject, "..and speaking of the world's gold mines, the  next specially large gold mine will be the Chinese consumers."  What an eye-catching headline, what a perceptive vision!    Main reasons for the present gold-buying frenzy are the  desire to preserve value and the people's traditional  infatuation with gold. It was made possible by the higher living  standards of the citizens and their increased consumption  capacity. A spokesperson of the State Statistics Administration  revealed that individual bank deposits of common people amounted  to RMB 1.8 trillion yuan. After an individual will have spent on  the "three old things," namely watches, bicycles, and sewing  machines, and will have gone through the "three new things,"  namely TV's, washing machines, and electric refrigerators, and  while he will find his capacity insufficient for the purchase of  the trendy new commodities of the 100,000-plus level, such as  motorcar and house, there will be nothing else for him to buy.  This will leave the citizen with some money, which will then  unavoidably be idle, awaiting a future opportunity.    Since there are no further commodities being offered at the  10,000 yuan level, and even though bank interest rates have been  raised, the Chinese economy is still undergoing dramatic  changes, resulting in periods of turbulence, so that the common  people are suspicious of a possible currency inflation,  therefore take refuge in the value-preserving function of gold.  Although the value-preserving function of gold is continuously  declining, the traditional mentality of the people seemingly  will not accept this fact in a short time, and gold, thus,  remains in the minds of the people a safe, all-weather  life-line. It is therefore natural to expect a gold-buying  frenzy and its continuation.  <H5>  Startling Effects on the World Gold Market </H5>   In their analyses of the world gold market, experts believe  that the continued demand for gold by Chinese consumers is to  blame for the continuous increase in gold prices during the last  decade. They furthermore believe that the more active China's  economic development will become -- China being the world's most  populated country -- the more money will be available to the  Chinese consumers, and the larger will become the demand for  gold, which in future will be a demand for several million or  even several tens of millions ounces of gold.    As these experts see it, reasons for the large purchases of  gold by China are, for one thing, China's rapidly growing  economy and lenient government policies, combined with the  limited channels for the use of cash savings; secondly are the  preparations by the government to take action against the  country's currency inflation and the devaluation of China's  currency.    Ordinary Chinese women had not worn gold necklaces for quite  a few decades, but now, with the higher living standards, they  have started again to wear gold and silver, and this alone has  been sufficient to exert a surprisingly strong effect on the  world gold market, so that traders are beginning to watch more  carefully the huge market that the 1.2 billion people of China  represent.    The international organization that has for some time been  promoting gold sales, the World Gold Association, held a meeting  early in 1993 at the Beijing Hotel for the exchange of opinions  on developments in China's gold market. Said organization also  undertook, for the first time, investigations at Beijing,  Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and as a result of these investigations  revealed that among China's gold buyers 19 percent were women  and 11 percent were men. As to the proportion of the various  uses of gold, the ratio of gold used for ornamental purposes was  15 percent, used ornamentally for the mounting of precious  stones 2 percent, used for gold coins and gold bullion only 0.3  percent, the ratio of gold ornaments bought for personal use was  11 percent, and gold used in presents to others 6 percent.  Overall, the rate of domestic gold purchases has not yet reached  the degree of full saturation, and compared with other  countries, where people own six or seven articles of gold, there  is here still a large disparity. The said association therefore  concluded that China offers the largest ever potential in the  world for becoming the largest consumer of gold. China will, in  effect, induce a shift in the entire market toward the east.  <H5>  Vigorous Inception of Privately Operated Gold Markets </H5>   Faced with the strong demand in China's gold ornament market  and the steady rise in the prices of gold ornaments, gold  markets of every description are vigorously being developed, as  the times seem to require. In Ganwang Township, within Haicheng  City of Liaoning Province, famous for its production of  vegetables and for its clothing market, an open, privately  operated gold market was suddenly, and quite unostentatiously,  initiated. During the period from 1 September 1992, when  firecrackers announced the opening of the first privately  operated gold ornament shop, until the beginning of 1993, 106  business licenses to operate gold shops have been applied for,  73 were to be operated by private individuals and only 3 to be  operated by collectives. The privately operated gold market has  had over 1,000 visitors per day, and has transacted tens of  millions of yuan. Businessmen have come to investigate and to  buy not only from 10-odd provinces and municipalities of China,  but some have even come to gain information on conditions and to  negotiate business from more than 10 foreign countries and  territories, among them Canada, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Hong  Kong, and Taiwan.    With their courageous action, the people of Ganwang have  challenged the last aristocratic stronghold in the financial  system, namely gold. Their example will be emulated all over the  country by "chiefs who challenge their overlords."    In Yantai City, the foremost gold producing city, the city's  Gold Bureau initiated, on 28 April 1993, a Yantai Gold, Silver,  and Jewelry Trading Center. At this place, trading proceeds  openly and fairly, and is also favored by the development zone's  preferential policy regarding tax exemptions.    On 10 May 1993, the country's second largest gold-producing  city of county rank, Lingbao City in Henan Province, did  similarly, and its gold, silver, and jewelry center came into  being as a timely event. It was a place where 75 state-run,  collectively run, and privately operating gold, silver, and  jewelry shops were concentratedly engaged in production,  processing, and sales.  <H5>  Indecision as to the Imposition of Controls </H5>   On 19 June 1993, the Tongguan Gold, Silver, and Jewelry  Street was inaugurated in Tongguan County, a key gold producing  center in Shaanxi Province. It had resulted from the fruitful  cooperation between the said county and the Wanlida Jewelry Co.,  Ltd. of Hong Kong.    A well-informed person at the People's Bank of China  revealed  that there have by now been about 11 cases throughout the  country, where local governments or trading firms in this way  took the lead in setting up gold markets. Besides these, there  have also been many underground, concealed markets, not  controlled by any authority or government department. They  blossom forth and disappear all of their own, and there is no  way to cover such cases statistically.    Even so, the People's Bank of China has issued circular  notices in which it repeatedly stated that prior to any state  plan for the opening up of the gold market, no local authority  or unit may of its own institute gold markets. However, abstract  and monotonous notices and government decrees are no match for  the very concrete and explosive gold price developments, and  will therefore naturally end in defeat. Faced with the tidal  wave of gold market formations, the government agency charged  with the control of gold must come to a decision: shall there be  an opening-up or shall it be a closed area. The competent  authorities are still in a quandary as to their next move.</p>

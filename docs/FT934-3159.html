			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / S African oil embargo to end The United Nations yesterday agreed to the unrestricted resumption of shipments of oil and petroleum products to South Africa, ending a 16-year embargo that was widely observed although not mandatory, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. Mr Samuel Insanally, president of the UN General Assembly, announced the decision in comformity with an October 8 resolution that proposed the lifting of sanctions when the South African Transitional Executive Council became operational. The only measure now remaining against South Africa is a mandatory arms embargo imposed by the Security Council in 1977 which is expected to continue until after elections in April.</p>

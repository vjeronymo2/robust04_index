			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Palestinians in the territories greeted the  signing of the agreement in Cairo with mixed feelings. There  were no expressions of joy over the additional step on the way  to the implementation of the agreement on self-government, but  people intensely followed media reports about the talks.    "Until people see changes happening before their very eyes  they will not believe that a new era is indeed on their  doorstep," Ghassan al-Khatib, a leading member of the team  conducting the peace talks, said shortly before the agreement  was signed.    Al-Khatib is one of a group of public figures who have been  strongly criticizing the PLO leadership's decisionmaking  process. Palestinians involved in the peace process have been  resentful over the fact that they have not been included in the  talks ever since the Declaration of Principles was signed. In  view of this criticism, Faysal al-Husayni was summoned to Cairo  at the last minute.    Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi is not sure that the Cairo  agreement  constitutes a step forward. He heads the critics of the PLO  leadership, and has not budged from his position that the  settlements are the obstacle precluding the attainment of the  main goal. "As long as the settlements remain untouched and as  long as land, particularly in Jerusalem, is being confiscated to  build houses I do not think we are advancing toward the goal we  are seeking to reach."    The aspiration for a just peace that meets the expectations  of both peoples is not being realized, 'Abd-al-Shafi believes.  Israel is forcing on the Palestinians all sorts of clauses and  things that they should not accept.    Moreover, he believes that the insistence on controlling the  border crossings was unnecessary. "Let Israel go on controlling  the borders. It does not matter, as long as there is a change  on our side," said 'Abd-al-Shafi, alluding mainly to the  settlements and what ensues from their continued existence.  [passage omitted]    Furayh Abu-Middayn is pleased that some progress has been  made in the talks, but like many others in the Gaza Strip, is  sorry that Yasir 'Arafat was forced to accept conditions and  arrangements he does not like and which might cause problems in  the future.    "Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is not pleased either, but he  realizes that the Palestinians are the weak side because Rabin  is unwilling to give in. 'Arafat hopes that a new mechanism of  relations will nevertheless evolve that will enable a  substantial change in the future."    What worries Abu-Middayn most is the arrangement concerning  the roads leading to the settlements. "The continued presence  of Israeli soldiers in the area constitutes a powder keg. This  friction will cause problems. We will not be able to control  the extremists, and extreme soldiers may also act irresponsibly."    In his opinion, an arrangement could be worked out similar  to  the convoys driving to Mount Scopus before 1967. "The roads  could be opened to the passage of settlers two or three times a  day. You need not assemble a gigantic military convoy each time  they want to drive to Tel Aviv to buy a carton of milk. People  in Israel apparently do not understand what this means to the  Palestinians who have to be in contact with the soldiers day in  and day out."    The arrangement concerning Netzarim and Kfar Darom is  absolutely illogical, says Abu-Middayn. "Because of 40 people,  hundreds of thousands will suffer," he says. If the inhabitants  of Netzarim and Kfar Darom were relocated, even to settlements  in the Qatif Bloc, the Palestinians would retain territorial  continuity and there would be fewer points of friction. He  claims he has heard Netzarim settlers say they are willing to  leave. "They will quit the moment they get compensation and, if  not, they will slowly leave of their own volition," he asserted.</p>

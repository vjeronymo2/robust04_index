			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Failure to act on surplus distorts companies' behaviour - Advance corporation tax is threatening the UK's use as a multinational base ADVANCE corporation tax has not been popular with companies since its introduction in 1973. But the problem of unrelieved ACT is now posing a threat to the UK being used as a base for multinational companies, whether originating in Britain or abroad, and deterring UK companies from investing overseas. With 40 per cent of the earnings of quoted companies coming from abroad, the tax, which effectively penalises the payment of dividends out of non-UK profits, is a serious issue for the stock market. Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, said recently, 'as it stands, this tax acts as a deterrent to overseas investment'. Companies are being required to overpay tax, in the form of ACT, to the tune of Pounds 500m a year. And the total of surplus ACT which had piled up is now approaching Pounds 6bn, according to some estimates. There is concern that higher tax rates caused by surplus ACT which reduce earnings, and hence share prices, is making it more expensive for them to raise equity capital needed to finance their way out of recession. Such is the concern at the Department of Trade and Industry about the loss of competitiveness the ACT problem is creating that Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, has lent his support to lobby groups which are tackling the Treasury on this ticklish subject. Representatives of the 100 Group, formed by the finance directors of 100 top companies, have had discussions with Mr Heseltine. He promised the DTI would support them in finding proposals acceptable to the Treasury, which would at least partially relieve the surplus ACT liability. But there appears to be a split between the DTI and the Treasury. Although Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, mentioned the question of surplus ACT in the budget, the government's current shortage of funds appears to have pushed the topic down the agenda again. One finance director said: 'All the signals from government are that they cannot give any hand-outs whatsoever. They have said they are prepared to listen to recommendations from industry on surplus ACT provided they are tax neutral in corporation tax terms. They put in that proviso to show willing but give absolutely no help.' One academic remarked: 'The way the revenue has managed to introduce the neutrality of a proposal as a prerequisite for consideration is scandalous'. Meanwhile, the Inland Revenue is becoming more zealous in its attempts to stop companies trying to get round the tax, for instance by acquiring other companies with a record of mainstream corporation tax payments against which they can offset ACT. ACT is a method by which the Inland Revenue passes to companies the responsibility of collecting basic rate income tax on dividends. When a company pays a dividend it must pay the basic rate income tax due to the taxman. If the recipient of the dividend is a non-taxpayer, such as a pension fund, it can then reclaim the tax. When the company comes to pay its UK corporation tax it can deduct the ACT paid from the bill. The ACT cannot be offset against corporation tax paid in other countries. The system works well so long as the company's UK corporation tax bill is greater than the amount of ACT it has paid. If it is not the company has to pay the ACT and the corporation tax. As Mr Barry Bracewell-Milnes, who writes on ACT for the Adam Smith Institute, said: 'In certain circumstances ACT is not an advance tax but a final tax.' In effect some companies are being penalised by paying a higher rate of tax than other companies. Those with a large proportion of profits from non-UK sources and a dividend in line with normal UK pay-out ratios, are unlikely to have sufficient UK corporation tax to mop up the ACT liability. Companies paying uncovered dividends are also hit. Surplus ACT is partly a cyclical problem as the recession hits UK profits. But it is increasingly regarded as structural as more companies develop international businesses. Many industrialists and academics believe ACT is having a distorting effect on how companies behave, which, they say, is bad for corporate UK. While few will admit to doing anything solely for tax purposes, a survey by the London Business School found that of companies with a surplus ACT problem, a third said it influenced their dividend payments, and three quarters said it was a factor in deciding where to borrow. More than half admitted it influenced decisions on investing abroad and a quarter that it affected the location of research and development. These corporate consequences of the tax system can be detrimental to the UK economy, leading to the loss of jobs and business opportunities in the UK, and driving skills overseas. As for the incentive to make acquisitions, Mr Bracewell-Milnes said that having 'a built-in fiscal incentive for acquiring other companies is not a good way to run an economy'. The DTI is not just concerned about UK companies, though. The ACT regime is such that it can deter foreign groups setting up a holding company in the UK. Take a US company wishing to group its European businesses under one holding company. Profits from the subsidiaries in each country would be passed to the UK group, which would then pay them to its US parent in the form of a dividend. The UK holding company would have to pay ACT on the dividend, but would be unlikely to have paid enough UK corporation tax to offset that ACT. Such a company could find a much more sympathetic tax regime in the Netherlands or Belgium, for example. The loss of such companies from the UK has an adverse effect on providers of services such as banks, accountants and lawyers. There are almost as many proposed solutions to the question of surplus ACT as there are companies troubled by it, ranging from doing nothing to overhauling the entire tax system. However, most ideas would involve a loss of revenue for the government or an increase in tax for the shareholders. The government might simply choose to address the holding company issue, perhaps by creating 'international holding company' status and giving that category exemption from ACT. But this would cause an outcry among the many UK-owned groups facing the same problem. At present some companies such as Unilever and Shell with dual corporate status pay ACT only on the dividends paid on the UK shares. Mr Roger Wood, finance director of Wimpey, the construction group, is chairman of the 100 Group's working party on surplus ACT, which has put forward three other proposals. He said it had suggested a change in the rules to allow a pound-for-pound offset of ACT against corporation tax. The difference in basic income tax rate and corporation tax rate means that a company must pay Pounds 33 of corporation tax to offset Pounds 25 of ACT. If there was a pound-for-pound offset it would only need Pounds 25 of corporation tax. This appears to be the most likely idea to find government acceptance in the short term. He also said that companies should be allowed to pay ACT on only a proportion of their dividends. For instance dividends paid out of foreign profits would be paid free of ACT. The Inland Revenue would then have to collect tax on the remaining percentage. Offsetting ACT against overseas tax would give the Treasury a problem as shareholders which do not pay tax would be able to reclaim tax although the Treasury had not received it. It would take new tax treaties with other countries to solve the problem. The Ruding Committee, which reported earlier this year, suggested that within the EC it should be possible to offset ACT, and its variants in other countries, against corporation tax paid anywhere within the community. However, the committee's recommendations are not expected to come into force in the foreseeable future. The 100 Group's third suggestion is that the market in companies with spare ACT capacity should be allowed to flourish, in the same way that tax losses can be bought and sold. Other lobbyists go further and argue for a fundamental reform of the UK corporation tax system, going back to the pre-1973 arrangements or even to before the introduction of corporation tax itself in 1965. Hopes of radical change are unlikely to be realised. If the government does agree to reform the system at all, it is more likely to be a matter of tinkering. However, if companies are given a way to offset ACT written off in previous years they may enjoy low tax rates, and thus higher earnings, for some years to come.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  IMPACT OF ADVANCE CORPORATION TAX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Company      Company     Company     Company                                A            B           C          D  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         pounds m     pounds m    pounds m    pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax profits              100          100         100         100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  from UK operations          100           33          25         Nil  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  from overseas operations    Nil           67          75         100  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Net Dividend                  25           25          25          25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ACT on dividend              8.3          8.3         8.3         8.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK corporation tax charge     33           11         8.3         Nil  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ACT not offsettable against UK corporation tax     -            -         2.0         8.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total UK tax paid             33           11        10.3         8.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  as per cent of UK profit     33           33          41      Infinity  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How ACT works: Companies pay the basic rate of income tax on the gross dividend to the Exchequer - In the example above a gross dividend of pounds 33.3 million yields ACT of pounds 8.3 million and a net dividend of 25 million. The company can then offset ACT against its mainstream UK corporation tax charge, as companies A and B do. But ACT cannot be offset on a pound-for-pound basis because of the difference between corporation tax and basic income tax rates. Companies must pay pounds 33 of corporation tax to relieve pounds 25 of ACT. Thus company C is unable to relieve part of its ACT bill. Company D is unable to offset any.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MARY STAR BELTS PATER NOSTER, 38-0  </P> <P> Recording its second shutout in six days, the Mary Star High football team beat  visiting Pater Noster, 38-0, Thursday night at Daniels Field in San Pedro in a  Santa Fe League game.  </P> <P> The Stars (4-3, 2-0) have out-scored their league opponents, 93-0.  </P> <P> Quarterback Nick Mariani (who accounted for two touchdowns), running back Mike  Baker (two touchdown runs) and kicker-running back Jose Bermudez (13 points)  led the way against winless Pater Noster.  </P> <P> After a first half in which the Pater Noster defense gave up 24 points and its  offense had only one first down (on a penalty), the Eagles had to wonder if the  long bus ride down the Harbor Freeway from Eagle Rock was worth it. Pater  Noster's attitude didn't improve in the second half when it hurt itself  immediately by getting an offsides penalty on the opening kickoff (one of 10  penalties it had).  </P> <P> Mary Star scored on its second possession of the game as Mariani passed 20  yards to Brian Bolgona. Matt Redlew's 25-yard punt return set up the 35-yard  scoring drive.  </P> <P> On their next drive, the Stars made it 14-0, with Mariani scoring on a  nine-yard run. A 35-yard field goal by Bermudez made it 17-0 early in the  second quarter.  </P> <P> Baker scored on a 27-yard run with 2:33 left before halftime.  </P> <P> Bermudez had a 15-yard touchdown run in the third quarter and Baker's one-yard  dive in the fourth quarter made the score 38-0.  </P> <P> Pater Noster, despite using an exotic offense that often utilized five wide  receivers, didn't manage a scoring threat until it got inside the Mary Star 10  with under two minutes left in the game.  </P> <P> Pater Noster had zero yards of total offense in the first half.  </P></p>

The  official, requesting anonymity, said Germany, which is to host  the G-7 meeting, has shown interest in discussing the Russian  issue but Japan has not yet received any notice about inviting a  Russian delegation, he said.    Meanwhile, the official said arrangements are now being made  for Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to meet U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor who arrived in Tokyo later Tuesday.    Fujii intends to meet Kantor if his schedule allows, he  said.    On the ongoing negotiations on insurance service -- one of  the top priorities under the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks,  the official said further talks are needed ahead of the February  11 summit of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill  Clinton.    The two sides are reportedly at odds over an objective  criteria with Japan refusing U.S. demand for quantitative  criteria that can be interpreted as numerical targets in market  access. The official said the criteria could be something  different for each field.    On the macroeconomic field, the official stressed that it is  for review by reporting each other's measures and not for  negotiations. "The U.S. side recognizes it, and this is also  how the macroeconomic field is taken at G-7 meetings," he said.</p>

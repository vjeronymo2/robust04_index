			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Together on the Road" column by Dr. Fa'iz al-Sa'igh] </F>   [Text] The "victories" the Yemeni leaders are achieving  against other Yemeni leaders in the bloody battles on Yemeni  territory call for great disgust. How can one Yemeni attack his  Yemeni brother before the whole world in this way? How can the  Yemeni generations accept the justifications made by both  parties, with each party standing in its own bastion and trench,  in defense of everything except the Yemeni unity? How can  Yemeni history be written in this black period of a unified  state?    The Yemeni people throughout the unified homeland vehemently  refuse to follow what is taking place. They also strongly  condemn these battles, which are being falsely waged in the name  of unity. Unity has nothing to do with either the style or the  results of these battles, even if they lead to comprehensive  Arab unity.    What heinous crime is being committed on the land of the  "miserable Yemen" in the name of unity? How can one Yemeni  soldier stand to see body of another Yemeni soldier on the side  of the road while expressing the "victory" smile and waving the  "victory" sign with two fingers in the same way that led the  Palestine question to the "Jericho farm" or the Jericho enclave,  as some prefer to call it.    Anyone who hears and follows the hysterical statements and  counter statements, and who counts the victories achieved by  this party against that, will realize the extent of enmity  harbored deep inside these souls and the extent of self-hatred  and rancor held against the homeland. Had there been no  remnants of pan-Arab commitment, these people would have been  denied their Arabism, Islamic affiliation, and even their  affiliation with this dear homeland and this good land. We  testify that the man on this good land is pure and chaste.  Moreover, harm is done to this land's history and civilization  whenever a wound bleeds or whenever its calm nature is disturbed  by a gunshot, whether it is stray or fatal.    Yemen is dying in the name of unity. The Yemeni leaders are  vying with one another to fire the "bullet of mercy" at an  exhausted body [Yemen] whose history is angry with those who led  it to this disastrous fate. I do not believe that anyone can  say that I support one renegade against another. This is  because both renegades are bitter. Both renegades are leading  to a dark tunnel for the miserable Yemen in which chaos is  prevailing. Everything in the two Yemens, or rather in the  several "Yemens" will be black until further notice or until  another generation comes.    Brothers, unity between two countries is an intellectual  dialogue and a spiritual convergence, not to mention unity among  the sons of one country, the one Yemen, and the one heart. Is  it really for the sake of unity that the Yemenis are fighting  each other, storming others' homes, and attacking others'  families? Or is it rather through this fighting that the  Yemenis are actually driving an eternal nail in the coffin of  the comprehensive Arab unity? This unity rejects such storming  operations and victories. Unity requires a dialogue that will  establish the kind of future for which the generations aspire.  Let this farce stop before the world, and let its pioneers  bring themselves to trial before the tribunal of history. Long  live the unity of Yemen.</p>

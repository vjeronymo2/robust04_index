			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium industry 'needs help' to stem CIS flood THE DEVASTATING economic disruption to the aluminium market caused by the collapse of the former Soviet Union may well be beyond the resources of the world aluminium industry to handle. This warning was given last night by Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan Aluminium of Canada, the second-biggest producer of the metal. 'Unless the problem is tackled on a concerted and negotiated basis, the current conditions are likely to persist and bring this industry to its knees,' he said. He pointed out that, following a surge in annual exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States to about 1m tonnes - three to four times what they were in 1990 - western stocks had grown to 2m tonnes and prices had dropped by about half. Most of the world's aluminium smelters were operating a below even their cash costs. The western industry had already made production cuts of 1.4m tonnes a year  -nearly 10 per cent of its capacity - yet stocks continued to accumulate at the rate of 1.8m tonnes a year. 'Thus, against a background of slow growth in demand, a correction to this surplus by western world producers would require a further cut back of about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of its production capacity - a staggering requirement.' Speaking at the annual dinner of the UK Aluminium Federation in London, he added: 'I believe it may require western governments to jointly pursue negotiations with the CIS governments to establish some rules of transition which will enable the CIS aluminium industry to be integrated into the world industry on the same terms and conditions on which western producers now operate'. The European Commission's recent decision to impose restrictions on CIS aluminium imports, was of little or no use, Mr Morton said. 'This merely diverts the problem. When you are filling a bath, it does not matter from which end you fill it. What matters is the level of the bathwater.' He was speaking two days before multilateral talks are to begin in Moscow about the issue of CIS aluminium exports - figures of 1.5m to 2m tonnes are being mentioned for this year - and how the world industry might make production adjustments to help absorb stocks.</p>

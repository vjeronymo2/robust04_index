			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS: SUNSCREEN INFLATION?;  </P> <P> SKIN DOCTORS DEBATE SUN-PROTECTION FACTORS NUMBERED HIGHER THAN 15  </P> <P> WHILE sunscreen makers race to put the highest sun-protection-factor numbers on  product labels, some dermatologists are warning that numbers over SPF 15 may  represent little more than a marketing ploy. Yet, other doctors encourage  patients to use products with high SPF numbers. Why the controversy?  </P> <P> Dr. Arnold Klein, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA School of  Medicine, says that labeling products with an SPF greater than 15 may be  misleading.  </P> <P> "Higher numbers give people a false sense of security, making them think that  it is safe to stay in the sun all day. Prolonged exposure to the sun simply  isn't safe," Klein says.  </P> <P> Most sunscreen preparations do better protecting the skin from the sun's  burn-producing ultraviolet B (UVB) rays than from UVA or infrared (IR) rays.  Most products fail to protect the skin from the damaging UVA rays and IR rays.  Such exposure explains why people tan, even though they are wearing sunscreens  with high SPF numbers. A tan always represents sun damage to the skin. Such  damage is cumulative and can result in skin cancer and premature aging of the  skin.  </P> <P> According to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates sunscreen  products, a lotion labeled SPF 15 allows an individual to remain in the sun --  without burning -- 15 times longer than he or she could without the product.  That is, if it takes a fair-skinned person 10 minutes to show signs of a burn,  that same person could theoretically remain in the sun for 150 minutes wearing  an SPF 15.  </P> <P> Dr. Nelson L. Novick, an associate clinical professor of dermatology at Mount  Sinai School of Medicine in New York and author of the new book, "Super Skin,"  maintains that numbers higher than SPF 15 are essential, especially in Southern  California. Novick contends that the amount of protection received from a  sunscreen is proportionate to the amount applied.  </P> <P> Dr. Nicholas Lowe, a clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA School of  Medicine who is writing a medical text about sun protection, suggests wearing  an SPF 15 every day and using an SPF 29 or 30 during periods of concentrated  sun exposure, "whenever you're outdoors for more than an hour."  </P> <P> Lowe says he is encouraged by the introduction of a new ingredient called  Parsol 1789, which blocks UVA rays. He notes that, to date, the only  over-the-counter product approved by the FDA that includes the ingredient is  Photoplex by Herbert Laboratories.  </P> <P> Although dermatologists and other specialists do not appear to agree on SPFs,  they do concur that there is no such thing as a safe tan and that using a  sunscreen of at least SPF 15, wearing protective clothing and limiting the  amount of time spent in the sun are the only ways to protect the skin from  damaging rays.  </P> <P> Hair and makeup: Sher Kohr / Zenobia; model: Meg Haskell / Elite Model  Management; styling: Cathy Hughes / Zenobia  </P></p>

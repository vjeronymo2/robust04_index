The four nations made unfounded allegations in an open  attempt to justify maintaining the irregular status quo in  northern Iraq.    It is universally recognized that conditions in  al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk Governorates are the making of  the allied nations of aggression that have facilitated the  commission of murders, thefts, lootings, and the destruction of  what Iraq has built over the years for the well-being of our  Kurdish and Arab peoples alike.    The allied nations' brute force brought about a state of  lawlessness in the north and in the no-fly zone, thereby  encouraging rebellious gangs to wreak havoc in the region.  These nations are directly responsible for the irregular  conditions. They are meddling in the internal affairs of a  founding member of the United Nations, whose laws and  conventions the allied nations boast about upholding.    Shuffling the cards will not do. There is no reason why we  should overlook the fact that the U.S. Administration and some  of the allied nations are seeking to clothe their interference  in Iraq's internal affairs in humanitarian garb. They are aware  that their interference is unjustifiable and has a devastating  impact on regional security and stability. Any attempt to  undermine Iraq is in nobody's interest; indeed the last quarter  century has shown it to be unavailing.    Turkey's assistant foreign minister Ozdom Sinberk's [name as  published] remarks at the end of the four nations' session point  to a chaotic meeting, where the double standard approach was  obvious. The representatives of these nations advance  justifications for their continued support of the rebellious  forces in the north, retention of the no-fly zone, and the  continued deployment of their troops on Turkish territory, and,  in the same breath, contend they stand for Iraq's unity and  territorial integrity. Concern for Iraq's unity and territorial  integrity should translate into the hostile allied nations  avoiding meddling in its internal affairs. Throughout history,  Iraq has proved it can hold together and survive. Its people --  both Arabs and Kurds -- have shown that, when their brotherhood  and sense of responsibility are brought to bear, they can sort  out their problems for themselves.    Outside interference is illegitimate, and it can only bring  with it woes and devastation, and jeopardize security and peace  in the region.    Watching the session's proceedings, we are dismayed by  Turkey's double-standard approach. How can Ankara note the need  to lift the unfair embargo on Iraq on account of the enormous  damage it has done to Turkey's and Iraq's national interests,  while, at the same time, its representative notes the need, to  quote the unsavory press release, for extending the presence of  the multinational force stationed in Turkey to keep a close  watch on developments in northern Iraq?    As a neighboring state with which Iraq has close bonds, one  would expect Turkey to remember that its participation in  illegitimate and illegal actions pursued by the Americans and  their allies in northern Iraq goes against good neighborliness,  the UN Charter, international law, and the 1926 Iraq-Turkey  border treaty.    The Turks know only too well that only through effective  cooperation with Iraq and reckoning with its national interests  can they advance their national interests. Regional security  and stability are hardly served by the aircraft and guns of one  nation or another. They will only bring further outside  interference in the region's affairs. The Turks also realize  that the aggressive Americans harbor hostile intentions against  the entire region, including Turkey itself. Any minute the  Zionist advisers at the White House see fit to resurrect the  human rights issue in Turkey, they will do so.</p>

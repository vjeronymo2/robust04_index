			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / US to abolish levy on defence equipment THE Bush administration has decided to abolish a levy on foreign sales of defence equipment or civilian goods using technology developed by the defence industry. The levy, known as recoupment fees, is designed to recover some of the costs incurred by the US government for the development and production of defence equipment. Originally charged only on government-to-government sales of important defence equipment, it has been extended progressively to commercial goods having as little as 10 per cent in common with an original defence product. Abolishing recoupment fees is expected to help US defence manufacturers compete in overseas arms markets, and is also intended to benefit defence and technology industries by reducing the amount of paperwork it has to do to enable the Pentagon to calculate the recoupment fees. The total cost of the fees is uncertain, but the AIA calculated in 1990 that the paperwork needed to comply with recoupment rules alone would cost Dollars 42m (Pounds 22.7m) a year. However the abolition of recoupment fees could also revive an argument with the European Community over the Airbus passenger aircraft company. While the EC agreed to limit direct subsidies to Airbus, an end to recoupment would call into question the US's commitment to limit indirect subsidies to aircraft makers through defence contracts.</p>

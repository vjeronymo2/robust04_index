			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). The public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. A public meeting and open house has already been held. Additional meetings will be held if necessary, but are not scheduled at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments from the public and other agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be used to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Identify potential issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identify major issues to be analyzed in depth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Eliminate minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as the Idaho Panhandle Forest Plan EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., cumulative effects). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some public comments have already been used during the initial interdisciplinary review of the original project proposal. The comments that we have received so far relate to the following elements of the BlueGrass Bound landscape: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive plant and animal species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Watershed and Fisheries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Roadless. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Visual Quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This list will be verified, expanded, or modified based on additional public scoping and interdisciplinary review of this proposal. Most of the above comments received so far have been more categorically in nature than site specific. Site specific comments are the most useful information that we can have for improving the design and implementation of this project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  City of Angoon <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of those court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day scoping comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in developing issues and alternatives in the final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues on the proposed action, comments on this notice or the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of this notice or the draft EIS. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I am the responsible official for this environmental impact statement.

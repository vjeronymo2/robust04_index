			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cristina Indio do Brasil] </F>   [Text] Voting on the Social Emergency Fund [FSE] has been  postponed until 7 February. During the final congressional  session of the week, congressmen approved just one amendment;  which grants more power to legislators.    Congress will probably vote on the amendment that creates  the  FSE on 7 February. Yesterday congressmen approved a proposal to  invert the agenda and vote on this amendment before others. For  lack of quorum, however, everything was postponed until next  week. Only an amendment that grants more power to Congress was  approved yesterday. As a result of this amendment, congressmen  can now summon for questioning by the Congressional  Investigation Committees not only ministers but also  second-echelon officials and directors of state-owned companies.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Observer: Euro-yawn Britons were made to look thoroughly second-rate Euro-citizens by reports that, whereas the UK's Stationery Office won't even be selling the 350-page Maastricht treaty on European Union until after the election, the Danish government is freely distributing 300,000 copies of the full text. But it turns out that the Danes are nowhere near such Euro-goodies as the reports implied. The reason for the printing marathon is not popular interest in the treaty, but that a referendum on it will be held on it on June 2, and the result will be binding on the legislature. Current signs are that the supply of the copies, one for every nine households, is doing more good for opponents of Maastricht than for supporters including five of the eight parties represented in Denmark's parliament, the Folketing. Even a glance at the text, written in lawyerese, is enough to turn off the Dane-in-the-street. 'All it means is more power to Brussels, and I'm not going to vote for that' is the typical answer to opinion polls.</p>

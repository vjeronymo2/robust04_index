			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants should address the development of an infrastructure that includes the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Relationships with or a plan to build relationships with a variety of other non-HIV/AIDS health, mental health, and support service providers such as, State Mental Health or Substance Abuse Block Grant Programs, maternal and child health services, primary health care services, financial and other resource supports, legal services, spiritual services, and governmental and private programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Relationships with or a plan to build relationships with other programs for people with HIV/AIDS, such as, the CDC Counseling and Testing Program, the HRSA Ryan White C.A.R.E. Act Program (Title I EMAs, Title II States and their consortia, Title III Early Intervention providers, and Title IV Pediatric Projects), NIH-supported treatment and research programs, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An appropriate system for determining the eligibility of people with HIV/AIDS for financial or other resource assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reimbursement for mental health services provided through Federal, State, local, or nongovernmental programs of support, e.g., Medicaid reimbursement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Training for individuals providing the services described in the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funding preference will be given to services demonstration project applicants that are based at, or have relationships with, entities providing comprehensive health services to people who are infected with HIV. For the purposes of this program, comprehensive health services include services such as those described above in the ``Specific Mental Health Services'' and ``Additional Project Elements'' sections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The evaluation should include collection of both process and outcome data that will document the extent to which the objectives set forth in the application have been met by the project. Process evaluations examine the extent to which the project has been implemented as designed. Outcome evaluations assess the extent to which the projects have achieved the desired effects at the individual level as well as the group and community level. The evaluation should examine: the implementation of HIV/AIDS specific mental health services and additional project elements at the project and client levels; the type and frequency of services provided to the individual clients; the characteristics and needs of recipients of the services; and the outcome of services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services demonstration projects will be expected to participate in the development of an overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program that would be implemented by the coordinating center. The services demonstration project plans may have to be refined in light of the overall program evaluation plan. The services demonstration projects must agree to cooperate with CMHS and the coordinating center on the design and implementation of the overall program evaluation plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants should budget 15&hyph;20 percent for the evaluation activities, and include travel for at least two participants to attend up to four meetings in the Washington, D.C. area or at a services demonstration project site for each year of the project period (4 years). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Applications for the Coordinating Center Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The coordinating center, in conjunction with CMHS and the services demonstration projects, will, using input from the services demonstration projects, design and implement the overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program including: 1) A description and evaluation of the various models created under this program in an effort to determine which models might be replicated and integrated into HIV/AIDS health care delivery systems nationally; and 2) an analysis of changes in client outcomes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinating center will assist the services demonstration projects by providing overall evaluation coordination, including data management and analysis, training in common procedures, and distribution of necessary materials to all projects. Specifically, the coordinating center will work with CMHS and the services demonstration projects in the planning phase to: 1) Provide advice regarding the evaluation personnel needs at the services demonstration project level; 2) develop criteria for compatible computer equipment; 3) recommend to the steering committee common outcome measures; and 4) develop common data collection elements. It is anticipated that these tasks will be coordinated through a series of meetings of the steering committee to commence immediately following issuance of the Notices of Grant Award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinating center will develop and maintain a common data repository, containing common data files needed by the services demonstration projects. It is the intention of CMHS that the data be made available to the larger mental health and HIV/AIDS community as soon as feasible, in accordance with steering committee recommendations and in accordance with participant protection policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinating center will also provide ongoing technical assistance on the data collection and evaluation issues to the services demonstration projects as needed. The coordinating center budget should be consistent with the purpose of the program, and should reflect the level of effort anticipated to carry out the proposed tasks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The steering committee, working with the coordinating center, will prepare reports for submission to the project officer. An annual progress report will be prepared by the steering committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

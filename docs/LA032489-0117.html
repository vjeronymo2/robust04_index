			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX;  </P> <P> VIDEO FAST-FORWARDS JAPAN'S TV SHOWS  </P> <P> Many of Los Angeles' Japanese immigrants love TV shows from back home so much  that they can't wait for them to be aired here on TV or cable. They go instead  where they can find them faster: at their local gray-market video store.  </P> <P> The widespread practice of renting and selling taped TV shows from Japan is  accepted by a community hungry for the latest episodes. Older customers and  middle-aged women head straight for the Japanese soap operas. Middle-aged men  like drama or ninja-type movies. And the younger crowd goes for suspense, quiz  and action shows, according to one video store operator. Customers don't seem  to be bothered by lack of proper licensing -- or even by low-quality  duplication.  </P> <P> A Little Tokyo video store owner whose shelves were stuffed with Japanese TV  shows taped off the air -- and who didn't want himself or his shop identified  -- said his customers include many homesick for their native country, college  exchange students here for three months and Japanese women married to Caucasian  men for 15-20 years who still don't understand English well enough to feel  comfortable here.  </P> <P> The owner has a contact in Japan who tapes TV shows off the air and sends the  "master" to a tape-duplicating service in Los Angeles. Customers can see the  programs within two weeks of broadcast in Japan -- a much shorter delay for  viewers who would otherwise have to wait as long as six months to see those  same shows here on only a few channels and in limited time periods.  </P> <P> Scott Toyomitsu, manager of the Cinema Club-L.A. video store in Gardena,  however, refuses to go along with this practice. He claims that his is the only  store in the mainland United States that doesn't rent taped Japanese TV shows.  He rents and sells only Japanese and Japanese-subtitled movies -- all authentic  copies from the manufacturer.  </P> <P> Why not handle TV shows, which would unquestionably boost profits? "For one  thing," he says with a laugh, "it is illegal. Everybody knows that it is."  Toyomitsu, 33, who immigrated to the United States when he was 11, opened his  shop late last year and now carries about 3,000 tapes, including many films  from Europe.  </P> <P> When he first started his business here, he didn't know what kinds of tapes  would be popular. "So we took what was popular in Japan and just brought (the  equivalent of a typical Japanese video) store into the United States." But  Toyomitsu soon found that tastes here are a little different.  </P> <P> In Japan, for instance, he estimates that American movie titles out-rent  Japanese ones, 8-to-1. Here, it's about 50-50. Gore titles, popular in Japan,  didn't do well here, and they are now among many of his red-tag specials. He  researches which titles are popular in Japan and tries to bring them here  within a month after their release in Japan.  </P> <P> Most of his customers keep abreast of new releases through return trips to  Japan and imported Japanese magazines.  </P> <P> "They're asking for it before I even have it in the store," Toyomitsu said. "By  word of mouth, they find out what movies are really hot in Japan right now. But  most of the time, they're asking for the American movies like 'The Last  Emperor.' "  </P> <P> Cinema Club's 1,200 members (mainly Japanese businessmen and their families who  have come for a temporary stay of two to three years) pay $4 to rent each title  for one day. Toyomitsu said he only sells about one or two tapes per month (the  average cost is about $80).  </P> <P> He also said he copies Japanese movies but doesn't dare rent pirated copies of  American ones -- his customers know the quality of his tapes won't be as good  as the originals, but "they don't mind. The customer understands. The customer  just wants to see the (movie)."  </P> <P> Cinema Club L.A., 15468 S. Western Ave., Gardena; (213) 719-1722.  </P></p>

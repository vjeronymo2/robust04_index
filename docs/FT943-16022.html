			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: New equity issuance in Canada falls 12.5% The value of new Canadian equity issued in North American markets in the first half of this year was CDollars 12.37bn (USDollars 8.92bn), down 12.5 per cent from CDollars 13.95bn a year earlier, in spite of a surge in initial public offers early in the year. The decline was blamed mainly on the sharp fall-off in new preferred stock issues, which dropped to CDollars 723m from CDollars 1.83bn a year earlier. New equity issues reached a record CDollars 25.4bn in 1993, and 1994 started out strongly, said the Financial Post DataGroup. The first-quarter total was CDollars 7.5bn, but rising interest rates and a faltering stock market led to a setback in the second quarter, for which the total was CDollars 5.33bn. IPOs were again the big factor during the first half of this year, led by a CDollars 750m issue by Falconbridge, the nickel producer. New issue activity is likely to remain slow until September, said Mr Fred Ketchen, director of equity trading at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto. 'More volatile stock markets and higher interest rates tend to push investors towards fixed-income investments, and we expect the second half to trail the first half,' said Ms Rocca d'Angelo, economist with the Investment Dealers' Association of Canada.</p>

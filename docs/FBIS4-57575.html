			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Larios] </F>   [Text] Last week in Washington, the government concluded  negotiations on the agreements known as ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility] and ERC-II [expansion unknown],  after succesfully obtaining $27.5 million in loans on top of  those that the World Bank and the IMF had already approved for a  total of $259 million. Finance Minister Emilio Pereira reported  this yesterday at a news conference.    Given that the negotiations concluded last week, Pereira  described as "extraordinary" the fact that the first  disbursements "will not come from originally budgeted resources,  but from those that were allocated to four African countries  that failed to implement their economic programs and left intact  the $120 million the World Bank had budgeted for the next three  years."    The first loan disbursement -- about $67 million in support  of the balance of payments -- will be made on 24 June. The  agreements will be ratified at board of directors meetings at  the World Bank on 21 June and at the IMF between 22 and 30 June.    Pereira reported that besides reviewing the loan contracts,  the Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington has been authorized to  sign the loan contracts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Government  as soon as the board meetings end. These loans will be used  immediately to pay for imports made since January. The Central  Bank is already lining up import bills, up to a maximum of $20  million, in order to pay them as soon as the loans are disbursed.    The IMF and the World Bank "gave their full approval" to the  letters of intent sent by the government, Pereira added. He  said that the World Bank's Nicaragua Consultative Group will  meet on 16 June in Paris. The meeting will focus exclusively on  Nicaragua. The discussion on Honduras and Guatemala has been  suspended "because those countries failed to implement their  economic programs on schedule," the minister said.  <H5>  Consultative Group's Agenda </H5>   The agenda approved for the Consultative Group's meeting  includes a review of the progress thus far and a review of the  1994 plan. The second session will analyze the medium-term  agenda, 1995-96, when Nicaragua will try to secure additional  development resources.    Finally, at the closing session, "before the countries say  how much they will contribute to support us, we will discuss the  government's priority programs and will focus on social programs  to ease poverty and on a program to reform the public sector,"  Pereira added. The minister said that World Bank President Dr.  Preston and the President for Latin America Dr. Burky will visit  Nicaragua in September.    The government committed itself to continue implementing the  ESAF and to immediately issue three decrees, the first  eliminating ministers' discretionary power to issue fiscal  decrees, the second requiring the government to publish such  decrees in the official newspaper LA GACETA, and the third  abolishing taxes on luxury goods and on selective consumption,  replacing them with a temporary protection tariff and a specific  consumption tax.    The government also committed itself to "fully promote" the  privatization of Nicaraguan Telecomunications and Postal  Services Institute. This process is expected to conclude in  September. A bill will be introduced in the National Assembly  for this purpose.  <H5>  2,000 Take Advantage of the PML [Job Mobility Plan] </H5>   Pereira reported that 2,000 state workers have taken  advantage of the PML since last September; 260 new applications  were filed in the past two months. The minister said: "We see no  problem in reaching our goal" of having about 5,000 citizens  take advantage of this plan. In fact, "there is actually  competition among the unions, which are asking us to "apply it  here first." [quotation marks as published]    Pereira denied reports that he will be transferred to the  Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington. "This ministry has been the  target of many attacks since 1990, including media campaigns to  discredit us, reports that I am sick, threats against my mother  telling her to pick me up at a place known as Cuesta del Plomo  at midnight, and obscene phone calls to my wife," he added.    The minister said such reports are part of a campaign to  destabilize the government. "I am here to stay. I am a father,  I have seven children and one of them has undergone seven  open-heart operations. I returned to Nicaragua, never to leave  again," Pereira added.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: Results are in, investors unsure of the score - Wall Street THE FIRST quarter reporting season is in full swing, and stock market investors are not sure what to make of it. A week ago, the markets looked happy with the early earnings reports. Share prices were advancing to record levels, and by the start of this week the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 3,478.61, an all-time high. Yet this week, the mood darkened, and shares fell on four consecutive days. By midday yesterday, the Dow was struggling to keep its head above 3,400. The Dow's 2.3 per cent decline was mirrored by similar losses in the broader market. As of midday yesterday, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was down 2.4 per cent on the week. Yet, anyone assuming that the markets' poor performance must have mirrored a poor first quarter performance from Corporate America would be mistaken. If anything, this week's raft of quarterly earnings were better, on average, than analysts and investors had been expecting. Chrysler, for example, posted earnings (excluding an accounting charge) of Dollars 530m in the first quarter, a substantial turnaround from the Dollars 13m loss the car maker suffered at the same stage of 1992. Another corporate giant, the retailer Sears Roebuck, also looked good in the opening quarter, making record profits of Dollars 435m as performance improved in almost all of its divisions. Among other large companies to announce improved, or better-than-expected earnings in the January-March period, were several banks (Citicorp, Chemical, and Bankers Trust), the heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, the telecommunications giant AT &amp; T, and the financial services group American Express. Even some companies operating in hostile business environments put on a good showing - aerospace and defence manufacturers McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Northrop all did well, while most unlikely of all, airline group AMR (parent of American Airlines) offered a pleasant surprise in its first quarter report. True, there was some bad news. IBM's results were in line with forecasts (a Dollars 285m loss) and the computer manufacturer warned that the outlook remained cloudy, while United Technologies, Chemical Waste Management and Delta Air Lines all disappointed. Overall, however, the first quarter reports were mostly on the positive side. So why did share prices fall? In a word, valuations. The S &amp; P 500 is trading at about 23 times reported earnings, expensive by any standards. Even when measured by prospective earnings, shares look overpriced. The prospective price-earnings ratio of stocks, according to Value Line, the investment analysts, is currently around 16. As Value Line pointed out in its latest investment survey, the last time the markets peaked before a big fall, in late August 1987, the prospective p/e ratio on its stocks was 16.9. In other words, stocks are coming close to the sorts of valuations that in the past have warranted correcting, and correcting in a substantial fashion. Prices have climbed so high partly because of the billions of dollars flooding into equities from low-yielding short term assets such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. Yet stocks also look overvalued because in the past year investors built up their expectations of improved profitability so high, perhaps too high. This explains why stocks fell this week in spite of news of stronger earnings. Sure, profits have improved, but not enough to justify prices at these levels. Equally important, investors are beginning to get the jitters about what will happen to earnings over the rest of the year. They worry that, like the economy, the upturn in corporate profitability over the last two quarters may prove to be only temporary. Economic growth hit a peak of 4.7 per cent in the final quarter of 1992. It will certainly fall when first quarter 1993 growth is reported. Moreover, growth could slow even more in the second quarter if the pattern of March's economic numbers (retail sales, employment, industrial production and durable goods orders were all weak last month) continues. If the pace of the economic recovery is slowing, then growth in corporate profits will slow too. That makes stock market valuations even more difficult to justify at current levels. Which is why a growing number of investors and analysts are feeling uncomfortable about equities. As the Astrologers Fund, those analysts who forecast stock prices by the movements of the moon and the stars, put it at the top of their leaflet this week: 'The Sky Is Falling'.  ------------------------------- Monday      3466.99 - 11.62 Tuesday     3443.49 - 23.50 Wednesday   3439.44 -  4.05 Thursday    3429.17 - 10.27 Friday      3413.77 - 15.40  -------------------------------</p>

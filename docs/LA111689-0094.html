			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERCUTT SHOWS HIS METTLE AS GOALIE HELPS HARVARD SINK MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> This is how Larry Bercutt spends his time after classes let out at Harvard  High: He hurries to the school's pool, leaps into about 10 feet of water and  then lets all of his buddies slam hard, wet volleyballs off the bridge of his  nose.  </P> <P> Bercutt does it during the summer too. And sometimes before school.  </P> <P> In fact, Bercutt has gotten so good at this activity -- as goalie for Harvard's  water polo team -- that he was named the Southern Section 2-A Division Player  of the Year last season. This season, the senior All-American is impressing the  3-A Division.  </P> <P> "Bercutt's definitely one of the best goalies around. He makes a difference out  there," Mission Viejo Coach Ron Osumi said after fourth-seeded Harvard had  defeated the Diablos, 9-5, in Wednesday's Southern Section 3-A quarterfinal  match at Harvard. "On a couple of our shots, under the same circumstances with  a different goalie, we would have had goals."  </P> <P> Bercutt, who had 10 saves, is the last line of defense for Harvard, which  killed eight of the nine situations in which the Diablos had an extra-man  advantage. And Bercutt rules the defense with an aggressive style rare among  high school goalies.  </P> <P> "You have really got to come out there and direct the defense," Bercutt said.  "If the defense does what I want them to, we can set a trap."  </P> <P> Said Harvard Coach Rich Corso: "Larry is now starting to realize he has to come  in and out. That it really screws up the timing of the two-meter man."  </P> <P> With Bercutt providing stout defense, Harvard attacked Mission Viejo (14-11) on  offense. After a scoreless first quarter, the Saracens scored four times in the  second quarter to take a 4-1 lead. Brian Border poked in a rebound early in the  quarter, and, one minute later, Ryan Crosbie scored from close range after a  length-of-the-pool assist from Bercutt. Hasan Yardimci added a goal on a  penalty shot before Crosbie's second score of the quarter finished the 4-0  outburst.  </P> <P> Harvard's spree was especially impressive given the nature of the scoring. The  Saracens continually outraced Mission Viejo -- winner of 14 of the past 15 4-A  Division swimming titles -- to its defensive end.  </P> <P> "We fast-breaked them into the ground," Corso said.  </P> <P> Crosbie, Border, Yardimci and freshman Jim Toring each scored twice. Mission  Viejo closed to within three goals twice in the third quarter at 6-3 and 7-4,  but late fourth-quarter goals by Yardimci and Ryan Salceda meant a date in the  semifinals for the third consecutive season.  </P> <P> Harvard (26-4) won the 2-A championship last season and lost in the division  final in 1987. The Saracens will face top-seeded El Toro on Saturday at a  neutral site to be determined.  </P> <P> Corso, as usual, is not intimidated.  </P> <P> "I'm happy with what they've done," he said of his team. "(But) they know I'm  not going to be satisfied and that I have high expectations of them and the  program."  </P></p>

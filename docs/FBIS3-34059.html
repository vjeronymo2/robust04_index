Jallaluddin Haqani, a respected mojahedin commander from  eastern Paktiya province, had arrived in the capital to attempt  to bring an end to the Afghan factional fighting, now in its  34th consecutive day, they said.    Foreign Ministry officials said Haqani, who has set up a  base  at a military installation near Pul-e Charkhi, some five  kilometres (three miles) east of here, sent a represenative to  meet Rabbani but other sources say he came in person.    It is understood that Haqani has already met with Rabbani's  rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, who is allied with  former communist militia General Abdol Rashid Dostum.    Hekmatyar is demanding the resignation of Rabbani and the  setting up of an interim government to administer general  elections, while Rabbani has so far refused talks with Hekmatyar  so long as he continues his alliance with Dostum.    The talks here were not marred by shelling as both sides by  and large held their fire Thursday, allowing civilians to move  in large numbers on the streets.    A brief burst of small-arms fire in the old city Jadayi  Maiwand bazaar sent civlians running for cover just before noon  but in the adjacent Mandayi bazaar, which is the main depot for  consumer supplies for all minor Kabul markets, there was a brisk  trade in items like tea, sugar, dried fruits, batteries and  cigarettes.    Meanwhile a five-truck relief convoy of the International  Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) arrived in the capital  carrying nearly 17 tonnes of wheat-flour for distribution to the  homeless on both sides of the eastern Kabul frontlines.</p>

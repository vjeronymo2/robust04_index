			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (2): Review is eagerly awaited - The British Market WITHIN the next few weeks, HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue are to publish a consultative document on changes to the car pricing, engine capacity and possibly business mileage bands which currently determine how much tax executives must pay on the private benefit of their company cars. Unless there has been a big change of heart since the review was first announced in Chancellor Norman Lamont's budget in March, it is expected that both engine capacity bands and the Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 thresholds above which individual tax charges rise sharply will be abandoned in favour of a simplified scale related merely to vehicle price. The review is awaited eagerly by manufacturers and dealers for it is likely to have considerable effect on the type of specification of the executive cars they make and sell. And for business car users, it should lead to considerably greater freedom of choice. At the upper end of the market such a revised system should greatly benefit companies such as Jaguar, which has only two models below the Pounds 29,000 threshold and which has therefore traditionally been severely disadvantaged by the tax scale system. Abolition of the much more important - at least for the larger manufacturers  -Pounds 19,250 threshold would free the car companies from having to produce 'threshold specials' aimed at just creeping into the lower tax band. It would allow them to create a more coherent range of products, with resultant greater choice for the company car buyers who - at this level of the market - accounts for at least three-quarters of all such cars sold. Significant as the review is, it represents only one of a number of changes which this year are transforming the landscape of the business car market. For a start, there is the cut in special car tax, also announced in the budget, to 5 per cent from 10 per cent. The cut does not mean a straightforward 5 per cent reduction on pre-budget prices, because it is computed on the pre-tax price less the discount allowed to the dealer and nets out at just over 4 per cent. But it still amounts to a worthwhile Pounds 1,100 off a Pounds 27,000 executive car or more than Pounds 3,000 off a Rolls-Royce. Potentially just as significant, at least for businesses and car-using executives, was a clarification of VAT rules by the Chancellor, who gave an assurance that companies which want to offer employees a cash alternative to a car, and there are signs that a growing number do, will not have to pay VAT on any salary foregone by employees who choose to keep their cars. Until the clarification, that is exactly what Customs and Excise had been insisting. And the issue is no minor one because, for example, a company running 500 cars but offering employees Pounds 3,000 a year cash instead risked landing itself with a VAT bill for nearly Pounds 250,000, even if only one employee opted for the cash. It is the main reason why companies have been frightened away from pursuing cars-for-cash schemes, even though many have begun investigating them because of last year's introduction of National Insurance charges on company cars and higher VAT which, uniquely among business goods, cannot be reclaimed on car purchases. For car manufacturers already suffering from the steepest UK new car market recession since the Second World War, this is a matter of considerable anxiety. In Britain, executive cars, bought or leased with corporate cash, traditionally have been specified with lots of 'extras' and have provided their makers with high profit per unit. Executives, depending on their status, have tended to be allocated a choice of car within a given price band and, not unnaturally, have sought to have their cars specified as close to their price 'ceiling' as possible. The worry of the car makers is that, given a cash alternative, uncomfortably large numbers of executives might decide that a smaller, cheaper car is adequate for their needs. The manufacturers already have enough to worry about No sooner did they feel mostly exonerated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission early this year from consumer group charges that UK cars were over-priced than, last month, another report ordered by EC competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan reached another conclusion: In extreme cases, it said, UK car prices could be 40 per cent or more above those in continental Europe. It has suggested that, if the industry wants to keep its system of exclusively franchised dealers, it is time to put its house in order. The prices controversy had already been rumbling on throughout the recession which has seen UK new car sales plunge from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 1.6m last year and, some industry leaders such as Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain's chairman, fear, a 'worst case' 1.5m this year. Against this highly charged background, there were inevitable pressures for a discounting war. At the executive level, Ford began offering big discounts on its Granada range, and the other big producers hit back in similar vein. The trouble is, very little has worked. UK business, almost irrespective of sector, has become rather more interested in the problems of survival than in what cars to buy for its executives. With the old argument in favour of executive 'perk' cars - that they are a necessary weapon to attract high calibre staff - now just a mocking memory, for many companies the issue has become for how long they can put off buying any replacement cars at all. Suspicions about the whole car pricing debate have simply added to the propensity to 'wait and see'. While there is little to relieve the gloom at the moment, by the end of this year the long hiatus could be coming to the rescue of the manufacturers, for the simple reason that tens of thousands of cars normally replaced at two- or three-year intervals are still soldiering on after four years or even longer. Repair bills have been climbing rapidly - and embarrassing incidents proliferating. As just one example, one executive of a nationally-known UK concern had to cancel a business meeting when, a few hours before, his car failed its MOT test. Evidence that a wave of replacements cannot be long delayed is also starting to mount. Auctions houses are starting to report a glut of high-mileage executive cars coming through their compounds. According to Mr John Bailey, managing director of Independent Car Auctions: 'The market is starting to become swamped with high-mileage executive cars'. Until now, he suggests, the glut has had only a slight impact on their resale values. But there are now so many, he warns, that they are likely to become difficult to sell.</p>

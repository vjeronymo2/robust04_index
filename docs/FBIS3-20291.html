			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, March 29 (BTA) -- President Zhelyu Zhelev  today delivered a lecture on Bulgaria's European policy at the  Royal Institute of International Affairs today. That was the  centerpiece of Dr. Zhelev's visit to London which began  yesterday.    Recalling that in the years of the communist regime,  Bulgaria's foreign policy was entirely subordinated to the  former Soviet Union, the Bulgarian head of state stressed  Bulgaria's foreign policy orientation in the last four years.  "For the first time in quite some years, Bulgaria has had a  chance to implement an independent foreign policy on the basis  of its national interests and the European values, consistent  with the principles and standards of international law," Dr.  Zhelev said.    He listed the achievements which Bulgaria owes to this new  policy: membership of the Council of Europe, the Europe  agreement with the EU [European Union], the free-trade pact with  EFTA, joining the Partnership for Peace initiative and the  almost completed negotiations on accession to GATT. Dr. Zhelev  also noted another area of Bulgaria's European policy: The  vigorous promotion of bilateral contacts with the key European  states. He cited the bilateral treaties signed with Germany,  France, Italy and Spain and the joint declaration on the  principles of cooperation with the United Kingdom.    Bulgaria's Balkan policy also has European dimensions,  President Zhelev stressed. He recalled that in the last three  years Bulgaria has signed bilateral treaties with all Balkan  countries with the exception of ex-Yugoslavia's successor  states. The president singled out Bulgaria's position on the  Yugocrisis as a most eloquent proof of Bulgaria's modern foreign  policy: Restraint and military noninvolvement in the open or  dormant conflicts within the former Yugoslavia. Dr. Zhelev  stressed that Bulgaria is applying the Yugosanctions in good  faith despite the enormous losses it sustains.    "Bulgaria's policy towards Russia and the other former  Soviet  Republics is just as European in its spirit," the Bulgarian head  of state observed. He recalled that in the last few years  Bulgaria has signed bilateral treaties with Russia, Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, Belarus and Moldova based on equality and mutual  benefit.    Earlier in the day Dr. Zhelev addressed the Confederation of  British Industry. Discussing the difficulties which Bulgaria is  experiencing in its transition from command to market economy,  he emphasized that Bulgaria now needs foreign investment, modern  infrastructure and access to Western markets. Citing Bulgaria's  liberal investment regulations and the efficient system of  guarantees of the rights and interests of foreign investors, Dr.  Zhelev said that for all that Bulgaria is still seen as a high  risk country by foreign businessmen. Despite this, however, 55  British companies already operate in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian  president said, expressing confidence that the inflow of capital  will increase substantially this year and in the coming years.    Dr. Zhelev thanked Britain for its assistance in the  negotiations on Bulgaria's association to the European Union.  Most of the negotiations were held at the time when Britain  held the EC presidency, he recalled.    Later in the day today, the Bulgarian president opened an  exhibition of Bulgarian artist Atanas Kunchev in London and  visited the Liberal Club. Tomorrow [30 March] Dr. Zhelev is  scheduled to confer with British Prime Minister John Major and  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.</p>

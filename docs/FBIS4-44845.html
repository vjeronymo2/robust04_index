The leading European rocket engine manufacturers--German  Aerospace (DASA), Fiat Avio, SEP (European Propellant Company),  Techspace Aero, and Volvo Aircraft Engines, Inc.--have signed an  agreement that is expected to ensure the development of  high-performance engine systems beyond the year 2015. The  regular workforce of experienced workers is expected to continue  to be motivated and their valuable know-how to be safeguarded.    Before the German-French Society for Science and Technology  in Bonn, Roger Vignelles, the chief executive officer of SEP,  and Werner Inden, a member of the board of DASA/Erno Space  Technology, Ltd., in Bremen, seemed to be optimistic that  Europe's space industry could hold its own against the  competition from the United States, Russia, China, and Japan in  future as well.    Rocket engines are a specific branch of the high-tech  industry. This is why the experiences amassed and top  performance obtained in this field over the past 20 years could  not have been preserved and developed with activities in other  fields. Moreover, while it takes a very long time to develop  rockets and their core, the propulsion system, they also have a  very long operational life. This is why we had to set our course  for need-oriented developments early on.    In the opinion of the five rocket engine manufacturers, we  can count on the following developments in the  economic-technical domain over the next 10 years: an increase in  rocket payloads for the purpose of transporting heavy  geostationary telecommunications satellites, intensification of  earth observation, more science satellites, the development of  satellites weighing from 0.5 to 1 ton for low orbits, a demand  for military reconnaissance satellites in Europe too, and a  European contribution to the development of a manned space  station. In the additional 10 years until 2015 we may count on  Europe's participation in the operation of a space station and,  furthermore, on manned space transportation as well as round  trips to the moon.    In the field of telecommunications the number of satellite  positionings will, to be sure, stagnate, but the payload of a  carrier will increase every seven years by from 800 to 1,000 kg  and this will happen despite the huge increase in carrier  capacities as a result of further miniaturization.    After 2015 we can count on drastic cost reductions in space  transport with completely new fields of application to solve  mankind's global problems. The catchphrases with regard to this  are, among others: solar energy from space and (wireless)  transmission of same to the earth, the alleviation or solution  of the ozone problem, and the transporting of the rare gas,  helium, from the moon to the earth. A solar station in outer  space with an output of 10 gigawatts (as muchas eight  Biblis-type nuclear power plants produce) will also presuppose  an entirely new infrastructure on the earth. Furthermore,  reusable rocket engines will have to be developed. But first the  development of large (lightweight) structures will also still  have to be mastered. The development of closed life (survival)  systems for longer space missions will be an enormous task.    In the opinion of the rocket engine makers, the Ariane 5,  the  basic development program for which will be completed in 1995,  still absolutely has the potential for improvement as concerns  cost reduction, only, however, to a maximum of about 10 percent.  Greater savings beyond this can only be achieved through new,  reusable equipment. Moreover, the U.S. shuttle is not de facto a  really reusable piece of equipment.    At the present time the engine manufacturers are thinking of  developing a small engine for a reusable "demonstrator" weighing  from 10 to 15 tons in order to "familiarize themselves with the  technological requirements." In connection with this, the  Europeans are said to have negotiated with the Russians to let  them have the appropriate (very advanced) know-how for the  attractive price of 40 million German marks.    In the industry's opinion, the competition in the commercial  space industry--especially for the positioning of  telecommunications satellites--will be tougher in the near  future than up to now between the European Ariane, the American  Atlas 2AS, possibly a new U.S. development, and, furthermore,  the Chinese "Long March," the Japanese H2, and the Russian  Proton. However, the experts acknowledge that the design for the  Ariane 5 presented in 1984 represents the best combination of  performance, cost, and reliability.</p>

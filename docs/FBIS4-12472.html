			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kuwait, 10 Apr -- Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first  deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said today that the  aim of the ministers' decision to tender their resignations to  His Highness Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah Al-Salim al-Sabah, heir  apparent and prime minister, was to give him the opportunity to  re-form the government as he sees fit.    Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad pointed out in an exclusive statement  to KUNA that this step followed the address the heir apparent  and prime minister delivered to the Kuwaiti people on Monday  last.    He added that the ministers decided "to give Shaykh Sa'd the  opportunity to choose whomever he wants to cooperate with, and  this is his right." [passage omitted]    With reference to the National Assembly's call yesterday to  maintain the presence of six deputies in the forthcoming  ministerial formation, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said "this is an  issue for the prime minister."    Concerning his assessment of the experience of having six  National Assembly members participating in the present  government, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said it was "not an experience  inasmuch as the Constitution stipulates the presence of at least  one member from the National Assembly in the ministerial  formation."    He went on to say: "Therefore, the inclusion of the National  Assembly was a necessity, as otherwise there would be no  government from the constitutional point of view." [passage  omitted]</p>

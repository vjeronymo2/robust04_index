			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Emap sets sights on European purchase: Publishing group lifts interim profits 34% to Pounds 22m Emap, the newspaper, magazine and exhibitions group, is 'seriously interested' in the European publishing operations of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian media group. Emap, which yesterday announced a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.2m for the six months to October 1, is believed to be one of five groups bidding for the Maclean Hunter business titles in the UK and continental Europe. Rogers Communications, which recently acquired Maclean, is selling the assets which are expected to raise more than Pounds 50m. Mr David Arculus, managing director of Emap, said the company regards the Maclean titles, which include UK Press Gazette, as a 'bolt-on' to its existing business titles. 'Our next tranche of deals will be bolt-on deals and we are looking at quite a number of them,' he said. During the first half, Emap spent Pounds 197m on acquisitions including Pounds 106m acquiring 28 magazines from the French publishers Editions Mondiales and a further 10 consumer titles from companies within the Hersant group of France. The company also spent Pounds 50m on Trans World Communications with commercial radio stations in Manchester, Preston, Leeds and Cardiff. Emap is the second-largest player in commercial radio in the UK after Capital with about 12 per cent of the market. Emap said the French purchases had cost about 75p-77p for every Pounds 1 in turnover. Margins were about 5 per cent compared with 17 per cent for its UK consumer magazines. The company hopes that rationalisation and better margins on distribution will lift margins to 10 per cent within the next two to three years. Underlying growth was 24 per cent. Turnover was 38 per cent up at Pounds 234.2m. Earnings per share rose by 31 per cent to 7.9p and the intermim at 2.5p was up by 13 per cent. Mr Richard Dale, media analyst from stockbrokers Smith New Court, upgraded his forecast for Emap's full-year pre-tax figure from Pounds 59m to Pounds 61m and from Pounds 76m to Pounds 79m for the 1995-96 financial year. On the consumer magazine side, Emap said the successes were More, the magazine for young women which put on 17 per cent in sales to 400,000, and Match Weekly, a football magazine which increased sales by 21 per cent to 137,000. Computer games magazines were the poor performers with circulation falls of around 30 per cent. Mr Robin Miller, Emap chief executive, said newspaper advertising revenue rose 11 per cent. Employment advertising rose 42 per cent, but local retail advertising was still hit by consumer caution.</p>

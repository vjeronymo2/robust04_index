Authoritative Syrian sources  told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Washington negotiations have so  far inspired no hope of achieving success in the peace process.  And that the Israeli delegation continues to avoid providing  clear and frank answers with regard to the issue of complete  withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories,  which is the basis for a just and comprehensive peace.    The sources added that the round to be held between the  Syrian and Israeli delegations will be crucial in determining  the fate and future of the negotiation process, especially as  the United States has decided to assume the task of imparting  the necessary impetus to the political peace process on all  tracks and renewed before the world in Geneva its commitment to  achieving a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts.    The sources went on: Thus Rabin and his government will be  subjected to a test with regard to their willingness to respond  to the will of the international community and Washington.    The Syrian sources urged the international community to  shoulder the responsibility for salvaging and implementing its  legitimacy and putting an end to Israeli evasion. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Homestake agrees merger with International Corona HOMESTAKE Mining of San Francisco is to merge with Canada's International Corona to create one of the biggest gold producers outside South Africa. The two companies said yesterday that they had agreed in principle to a 'business combination' in which Homestake would offer Corona shareholders 0.35 of a Homestake share for each of Corona's 83m common shares. The merger values Corona at about USDollars 400m, with Homestake shares trading yesterday at USDollars 14 (down Dollars 1) on the New York Stock Exchange following the announcement of the deal. Corona's shares jumped 85 cents to CDollars 5 (USDollars 4.23) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Dundee Bancorp, Corona's controlling shareholder, has agreed to tender its shares to Homestake. The combined company expects to produce 1.8m ounces of gold this year from mines in the US, Canada and Australia. Its reserves will total about 20m ounces. Corona's main assets are its low-cost mines in the Hemlo gold field in north-western Ontario and the recently discovered Eskay Creek deposit in British Columbia. In spite of its valuable properties, Corona has been strained in recent years by the sliding gold price and its heavy debt. It suffered a loss of CDollars 13.3m in the first nine months of last year. Corona also requires financing to develop the Eskay Creek property. In addition, Homestake has gained both technical and environmental experience at its operations in California which will be useful in the Eskay Creek project. On the other hand, Homestake has lacked the long-life, low-cost mines which Corona will bring to the deal. Prior to the deal with Homestake, Corona was in the midst of plans to restructure its CDollars 323m debt, including proposals for a share issue.</p>

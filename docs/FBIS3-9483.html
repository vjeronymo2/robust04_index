			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Viktor Boban reports from the Press Center of the  Bosna Operations Group that the fierce shelling by the aggressor  killed one and wounded two civilians.    [Boban] The enemy is still trying to breach the defense  lines on the Rujnica front. All their attempts hitherto have  been thwarted. In some sectors the defenders launched attacks  themselves. In the fighting, which is still in progress, the  Serbian aggressor has suffered significant losses in manpower,  more than 15 were killed and many more put out of action.    Considering the ferocity of the chetnik attacks, new  attempts  to breach the defense lines should be expected. The soldiers  and officers of the Bosna Operations Group are ready to protect  their positions.</p>

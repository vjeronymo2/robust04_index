Some members of  the delegation that traveled to Washington to draft this plan  are ready to return to Washington, according to Deputy Antoine  Joseph. Commenting on the statements of the UN secretary  general, who expressed the desire to pursue negotiations in  order to achieve a new plan in conformity with the Governors  Island agreement, Deputy Joseph revealed that he was ready to  undertake the political pilgrimage if that effort can help solve  the crisis. The legislators are reportedly willing to sit down  with the president-in-exile this time to listen to his  reservations and viewpoint. Deputy Joseph answers Edner Jean's  questions:    [Begin recording]    [Joseph, in Creole] I do not believe that the latest  statement made by the UN secretary general is ambiguous at all.  On the contrary, it is one more way to support the plan of the  parliamentary delegation. When he said that he had opened a  space for dialogue and negotiation, he also said that he was  waiting for the Senate to make a decision and, most probably, he  is expecting the Senate to ratify the plan, meaning that he is  referring to a document.    Certainly, President Aristide has some reservations on the  plan, and those points, without modifying the plan, are  essentially guarantees that President Aristide requires. The  parliamentary delegation, the UN secretary general, the Clinton  administration, and President Aristide are going to sit down to  offer President Aristide the guarantees that he needs so that he  understands the reason for the plan, the applicability of the  plan, and the reason we say that the plan is efficient,  realistic, and peaceful.    [Jean] Does that mean, Deputy Joseph, that the delegation  will be willing to go back to Washington to renegotiate the plan  if President Aristide and the UN secretary general ask them to  do so?    [Joseph, in Creole] I have said many times that I was  willing  to take my pilgrim's staff, go to Washington, and meet with all  concerned sectors -- I started doing so, why not continue -- all  the more so if there is a plan today and this plan, for us,  constitutes a good springboard for a solution to the Haitian  crisis. I must tell you that those who are against the plan,  until now, have never said what they have against the plan and  have never defined their reservations toward the plan, which  would allow us legislators to engage them in a debate to help  clarify those reservations.    We must ask ourselves the question: Today, what is the  alternative? Not necessarily a presidium, not necessarily the  reactivation of Article 149, not necessarily Joseph Nerette, not  necessarily casting aside the 30 September family, but a  realistic plan which takes into account the position of the  international community, the position of President Aristide, and  the position of the Army.    [Jean] But the Army is still mute on the plan, while Father  Aristide's stance is known. Does the Army's silence constitute  another element of blockade?    [Joseph, in Creole] You can interpret this silence in two  ways. I know that the military have not felt that they can take  a stand until now. Perhaps they also feel that they do not have  the guarantees to accept the plan. What I can say to the Army is  that I think the Army has already committed a major mistake in  rejecting the Washington protocol. Is the Army going to repeat  that mistake? I would hope not, because in this plan there is a  way for the military to reinforce the military institution. [end  recording]</p>

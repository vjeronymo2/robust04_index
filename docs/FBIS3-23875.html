			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Likhachev, vice president of the </F> Republic of Tatarstan, doctor of juridical sciences, and a  corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic  of Tatarstan: "Respect, Equality of Rights, Cooperation"]    [Text] The Russian Federation and Republic of  Tatarstan treaty "On the Demarcation of Subjects for Conducting  and Mutually Delegating Powers Between Organs of State Authority  of the Russian Federation and Organs of State Authority of the  Republic of Tatarstan," was signed on 15 February 1994 in Moscow  in a festive atmosphere by Russian Federation President B.  Yeltsin and Republic of Tatarstan President M. Shaymiyev.    An event took place that was long awaited and that has no  precedents. Expressing the will of the multiethnic people of  Tatarstan and of the whole Russian Federation, the treaty makes  a significant contribution to the revival of Russia and to the  construction of a democratic federation. On the other hand, it  performs a kind of summing up of the legal-state development of  the Republic of Tatarstan under contemporary conditions from the  moment of the adoption of the Declaration of the State  Sovereignty of Tatarstan to the adoption of its new constitution  of 1992.    The concluded treaty, undoubtedly, is of a reformative  nature. With respect to it, the term "for the first time" can be  used repeatedly. For the first time, it is bilateral; for the  first time, it is in two languages (Tatar and Russian), and for  the first time, it is signed at the highest level. The treaty  was created in controversy, in a search for compromises, and in  the resolution of difficult questions, ready answers to which  simply did not exist in nature. The accumulated negotiating  experience has political significance, and it is a new word in  diplomacy.    But it also affirmed the value of such generally accepted  categories in the civilized world as mutual respect, equality of  rights, and cooperation. This is why, contrary to the aspiration  of some political forces to belittle the fact of the signing of  this historic document, it is possible to say with full  confidence: There are no losers here. But there are winners.  They are people of various nationalities, common sense, and  courage. This, finally, is the common future of Russia and  Tatarstan.    A detailed analysis of the treaty lies ahead, but it is very  important today to emphasize its legitimacy. The treaty rests  upon the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the  Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, and, of course, upon  the international legal obligations of the Russian Federation,  in particular those that result from the generally accepted  rights of people to self-determination and equality of rights.    The treaty opens with a preamble that sets forth the  principles of unification of the Republic of Tatarstan as a  state with the Russian Federation. Among these are  voluntariness, territorial integrity, unity of the economic  space, and preservation and development of historical and  national traditions, cultures, and languages, and the priority  of human rights and freedoms...    The subsequent articles disclose the exclusive powers of the  Republic of Tatarstan, the Russian Federation, their organs, and  also the joint powers. They encompass the political,  socioeconomic, and spiritual spheres. The sides also coordinated  the mechanisms for implementing these powers. The main ones  among them will be intergovernmental agreements, other  understandings, and joint commissions and structures. Already  today, 11 agreements that regulate various questions (from  environmental protection to coordination of the fight against  crime) have begun to function.    The treaty is going into effect. In greeting all of the  newspaper's readers with the holiday, we want to call on them to  actively participate in the process of its implementation, and  there is enough work for everyone. And as the ancient  philosophers said, when you see great work ahead, you experience  enormous joy. Especially since this work is for the people and  for our children.</p>

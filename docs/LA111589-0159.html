			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CO-STARS GOT DOLLY GIGGLING  </P> <P> The other actresses performed risque, off-camera gags to make Dolly Parton  laugh during a scene in "Steel Magnolias," according to Sally Field.  </P> <P> "There was one scene where Dolly was by herself, and she was supposed to be  looking off-camera and giggling," Field said in December's Redbook.  </P> <P> "To help her laugh, we did things that would have caused us to be blackmailed  forever! . . . They should have filmed us and released the footage to porno  shops. The crew crawled away in mortification," she said.  </P> <P> Parton said the director, Herbert Ross, seemed to have a hard time adjusting to  the predominantly female cast, which also includes Shirley MacLaine, Olympia  Dukakis and Daryl Hannah.  </P> <P> "I think he was really scared working with all these women -- scared that we'd  all have PMS (premenstrual syndrome) at the same time!" Parton said. "Herbert  was hard on me because I wasn't as skilled in acting as the others. He told me  I couldn't act."  </P> <P> Parton, characteristically, handled the criticism with aplomb.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Well, hell, I know I can't act. It's your job to teach me how. You  hired me to make money for you.' "  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> GETTING IT IN BLACK AND WHITE UP FRONT  </P> <P> In the 1980s, heyday of prenuptial agreements, California passed a law to clear  up consumer confusion. The Uniform Premarital Agreement Act covers the  requirements and enforceability of prenuptial agreements signed on or after  Jan. 1, 1986. Among its major provisions are:  </P> <P> * Only people who are planning to marry -- not merely living together -- may  enter premarital agreements. They take effect when the couple marry.  </P> <P> * Both partners must sign a written agreement. They may revoke or amend it  after they marry, as long as the changes are in writing and signed by both  spouses.  </P> <P> * The agreement may cover property rights of each spouse, as well as what will  happen to their property if they separate, divorce or die. If they wish, the  couple may define their personal rights and marital obligations.  </P> <P> Prenuptial agreements meeting these legal requirements are binding contracts,  as long as they were entered fairly and do not violate public policy.  </P> <P> Either of these situations make an agreement unenforceable:  </P> <P> * A person contesting the agreement did not enter it "voluntarily." A classic  example of this is when one party signs an agreement shortly before the wedding  at their partner's insistence. ("Sign this or I won't marry you!") Such  pressured situations raise the legal issue of "duress."  </P> <P> * The agreement was "unconscionable" when signed -- it was so one-sided that  the disadvantaged spouse effectively had no meaningful choice; the terms were  unreasonably favorable to the other spouse. ("I get everything; you get  nothing.") Disadvantaged spouses also must prove that they: did not know their  partners assets and debts; their partners did not fully disclose them, and that  they voluntarily did not sign away their rights to the financial information.  </P> <P> A prenuptial agreement that seems "too good to be true" for one spouse may turn  out to be just that. "If someone came to me and said 'Draw up an agreement that  says I get everything and my spouse gets nothing,' I would not be interested,"  said Stuart Walzer of Century City, a nationally known family law specialist.  </P> <P> The best insurance for a valid premarital agreement is to negotiate fair,  reasonable terms far in advance of the wedding, under unpressured  circumstances. Family law specialists in Los Angeles offer these tips:  </P> <P> * If your attorney drafted the agreement, be sure your spouse-to-be consults  his or her own lawyer before signing it. "The presence of an independent lawyer  tends to really make a big difference," said Los Angeles County Superior Court  Commissioner Robert Schnider.  </P> <P> * Allow your attorney to engage in negotiations as long as necessary with your  fiance's attorney. Daniel Jaffe, a prominent Beverly Hills family law  specialist, recently spent eight months negotiating a premarital agreement for  a client whose annual income exceeds $10 million. The more extensive the  negotiations, the more likely the agreement will be upheld.  </P> <P> * Give full disclosure of your assets to your spouse-to be. Jaffe's standard  agreement includes a complete financial statement, and a clause that the  disclosure is being made for courtesy only -- not to induce the other party to  sign.  </P> <P> * Be sure the agreement is fair to your intended. "If the agreement provides  that your spouse gets no property, the judge will probably see how unfair that  is, even if he upholds the agreement," Jaffe said. "The judge may make up for  that in nine different ways." * Do not misrepresent the legal effect of the  agreement to your intended. A common claim Schnider hears in his courtroom is:  "I didn't listen to my lawyer because my fiance said this was just a piece of  paper and we'd rip it up in two years anyway, so I should just sign it." This  may invalidate the agreement on grounds of fraud.  </P> <P> * Conduct a proper signing ceremony, with witnesses, a notary, both attorneys  and the couple present. Record it by audio and videotape, if possible.  "Typically a party will contend, 'I didn't read the agreement, I didn't  understand it, I was crying hysterically, I didn't want the agreement, the  lawyer never told me I was waiving my rights,' " Jaffe said. "But the video may  show a vastly different story."  </P> <P> * Abide by the agreement's terms. "People get sloppy," Jaffe said. DARLENE  SORDILLO  </P></p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: Prince - Wembley Stadium Oh dear: Prince has shrunk - in imagination, in impact, in showmanship. The attraction of the world's greatest one-man disco was that, although knee high to Wayne Sleep, he thought big. At a Prince show you could relax in the presence of gilt beds that hovered above the audience, space pods to ferry in the star, cartwheeling dancers and plenty of them, mighty voiced backing singers, giant screens, and lashings of innuendo. It was the night club of your dreams. On this tour Prince is thinking small, a terrible mistake at Wembley Stadium which is only kind to megalomaniacs. Even his opening number is a joke against the audience. Some fireworks explode fitfully, and a harness descends to the stage bearing a figure shielded in a gold mask singing 'My name is Prince'. On reaching landfall there is a quick strip and instead of the man himself there is a convulsive girl dancer. Prince actually walks on to the stage. It doesn't take long to realise that Prince had to keep moving because his songs are very sedentary. Even the hits from the past - and the act contained most things from 'Purple rain' to 'Sign 'o' the times' - would scarcely make 'Your Hundred Best Tunes', and the recent stuff is doubtful re-treads. So its all down to the sizzle. The lone dancer does her best, ululating through a dozen costume changes, but the band seemed in bolshie mood, often trying to drown out the boss rather than to back up his piercing voice. It was almost inevitable that the stage was so arranged that sitting in one of the more privileged seats I never actually saw the musicians live, only conveyed through the side screens. Of course there were moments to draw in the breath - a thousand streamers raining on the crowds; a light show to dazzle the most jaded eyes, turning the stage to oven red or incandescent white; plenty of Roman candles - but this seemed a melancholic Prince. You actually felt he could have meant it at the finale when, as part of an interminably boring 'joke' about what he calls himself these days (he prefers to be known as a symbol) he cries out 'What's my name: take my name, I don't want it.' Were we witnessing one of the most public breakdowns in entertainment history? Its a pity this moment of self doubt should be mixed up in a tedious routine in which the audience has to shout out the word, and the word is 'come'. It was time to go.</p>

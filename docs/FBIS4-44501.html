			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Reducing the Budget Deficit"] </F>   [Text] A few days ago, the Legislative Yuan passed in three  readings the "Regulations on the Central Government's  Construction Bonds and State Loans," raising the uppermost  proportion of the outstanding balance of government bonds and  state loans in the annual budget and special budget from 95  percent to 113 percent, and thereby providing a basis for the  legally correct passage of the general 1995 fiscal year budget  bill of the central government, which is now being debated. As  we understand, the executive intends at the same time to present  a law on public indebtedness, to replace the current regulations  on government bonds and state loans, to prevent further  supplemental resolutions by the Legislative Yuan, so that the  upper ceiling for the proportion of borrowing may not again be  raised in the coming year, but it will on that occasion further  raise the ceiling for indebtedness in order to increase the  latitude for borrowing in the future.    However, regardless of whether the government bond and state  loan regulations will be changed or whether a separate law on  public indebtedness will be promulgated, these kinds of actions  can only solve the legality question of state borrowing, but  cannot erase the financial deficit. Legislative modifications  may for a time, but not in the long run prevent the inflation of  the financial deficit. Not only that, but allowing the financial  deficit to further inflate is bound to incur disaster for state  and society for a long period of time. Is this situation not  cause for anxiety?    Referring again to statistical data: At the end of fiscal  year 1989, the outstanding balance of bonds issued by the  central government was still less than 200 billion yuan, while  at that time the government's surplus accumulated over the years  was as high as over 230 billion yuan. In other words, the  central government has had no net indebtedness at all, but  rather a fiscal surplus, while in only five, six years not only  was the surplus accumulated over the years completely wiped out,  but the outstanding balance of indebtedness in the 1995 fiscal  year budget was allowed to rise to as high as around 1,200  billion yuan. These specific figures are indeed frightening and  startling by revealing the urgency and seriousness of the  problem of how to balance fiscal income and expenditure.    Be that as it may, the executive sector is apparently  without  power to control the expansionist trend in the government  budget. Even though the Executive Yuan says that the scale of  the 1995 fiscal year budget shows negative growth when compared  with fiscal year 1994, so that the expansionist trend in  expenditures seems to have been controlled, the result of this  control is nothing but a presentation of fictitious figures.  That is so because at the start of fiscal year 1995, the  Executive Yuan decided to no more include the transfer of  capital increases of government enterprises in the general  budget, thereby omitting 160 billion yuan from the budget of the  said year. If that amount would be included, there would still  be over 10 percent growth in budget expansion. This shows that  the problem of the central government's increasing fiscal  deficits is not a problem of insufficient tax revenue, but a  problem of too fast a growth of expenditure. During the last few  years, the increase in tax revenue has on the average been still  higher than the economic growth rate, so that proposals for  further tax increases to balance out the fiscal deficit will not  at all truly solve the problem. The only realistic way is to  reduce public expenditure.    How can public expenditure be reduced and the financial  crisis that will follow on the continuously expanding budgetary  deficit be averted? The answer is very simple, let us just look  at the many European and U.S. states that are saddled with  financial deficits, then we will know. The method to reduce  public expenditure is extremely common, it is only that there  are no tricky shortcuts to it. It requires paying a painful  price, and that is all that is needed for success. The problem  with it is therefore only whether there is strong enough  determination; it is not a matter whether the method is or is  not appropriate to the time.    Judging by Taiwan's present condition, how much of a  determination is necessary and how much hardship is there to be  faced in reducing public expenditure? First, we have to face the  social pain of government departments adopting zero-based  budgets, cutting down and merging organizations, and canceling  certain operations. Second, in the privatization of public  enterprises we have to face the social pain caused by public  enterprises no more being allowed to shift investments, having  to meet open competition in the market, and staff and workers  having to transfer to other work places. Third, government  should remove its controls, allowing civilian participation in  the free development of education and the development of  communications, and in such activities as investments in the  information industry, in transportation, and in public  utilities, thus creating the "pain" of reducing investment  possibilities for government departments. Beyond that, after  establishing a system of assessing public investment plans, we  shall have to face the pain of not being able to voluntarily put  forward further construction plans. Furthermore, in order to  establish the system of intermediate-range and long-range  capital budgeting, organs and units engaged in public investment  will have to face the pain of having to submit in advance  detailed plans by year, by periods, and for the whole range of  public investments, as they could otherwise not be included in  the budget. Finally, to reduce the wasteful expenditure of  subsidies from the central government to the local governments,  it will also be necessary to establish a system of subsidies to  local governments that is based on law, and thereby having to  face the pain of reducing administrative intervention by the  central government in local governments.    All these social pains are related to the renovation of the  governmental system. For a long time, government departments  have not been able to keep up with the economic progress in the  private sector and have not been able to pursue the  modernization of the system. These are in particular the main  reasons that have created the present situation of inefficiency  of government administration and inflated public expenditure. To  resolve the inherent danger of the fiscal deficits, we therefore  fervently hope that the authorities in charge of policy  decisions will take due note, will also show firm determination,  and by starting out with a reform of the system, be also able to  tackle the problem of effectively reducing the increase in  public expenditures.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The '94 Shanghai  spring fair for the real estate business opened here today.    Sources said that housing with a collective total floor  space  of about 10 million square meters is on sale at the fair.    In recent years, the Shanghai real estate market has been  going along healthily, under the macro control policies of the  central government and since Shanghai Municipal Government  decided to accelerate construction of commodity housing.    According to city government officials, this year will see a  boom in residential housing construction.    There are also medium and low grade -- that is, cheaper --  commodity houses on sale to residents, at the fair.    The relevant departments have also set up consultancy  counters to serve citizens on housing policies and guide them on  buying and selling housing.</p>

He was seen off at  Ankara's Esenboga Airport by President Suleyman Demirel.  General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; State Minister  Cemil Erhan; Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin; and Veysel Atasoy,  energy and natural resources minister, were also at the airport.    Mubarak and Demirel made statements to the media at Esenboga  Airport and answered questions. In his statement, Mubarak said  that bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields were  discussed during the talks. Noting that regional and  international issues were also assessed, the Egyptian president  remarked that Bosnia-Herzegovina and other topics, especially  the Middle East, were the subjects of discussion. Turkey and  Egypt reached agreement on all issues of focus, Mubarak  announced. He stressed that Egypt also shares Turkey's  long-standing views regarding the protection of Iraq's  territorial integrity. From now on, Mubarak explained, the  visits between Turkey and Egypt can be held naturally, without  adherence to rules of protocol.    In reply to a question on whether Turkey was asked to play a  special role concerning Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, Mubarak  said that Egypt has diplomatic relations with Israel and did not  submit any demands to Turkey in this regard. Mubarak remarked:  There is no problem between Egypt and Israel that needs  mediation. The Egyptian president declared that if necessary  consultations can be conducted with Turkey on any subject.    In his statement, Demirel declared that the talks conducted  during Mubarak's visit demonstrated the great scope of the  potential for the development of Turkish-Egyptian relations.  This visit also showed what can be squeezed into one day,  Demirel noted. The president went on: If peace prevails in our  region, this will benefit everyone. To achieve this, Turkey and  Egypt -- the two big countries in the region -- will exert every  possible effort. In actual fact, as the two big countries in  the region, we hold ourselves responsible for the establishment  of peace in this area as soon as possible. We hold ourselves  morally responsible. Therefore, we will certainly exert joint  efforts for the successful outcome of the Middle East peace  conference. Actually, Mr. Mubarak has played an immense role in  this regard and will continue to do so. We hope that this  matter will yield results this year and new horizons will be  opened for the region.    Pointing out that Mubarak's visit created new horizons for  the relations between the two countries, Demirel pledged that  Turkey and Egypt will continue to make contributions both to  their own people and to the people in the region.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Reinsurers reeling from red-line entries US PRODUCT liability laws lie behind virtually all the financial troubles at present faced by the London and Lloyd's insurance markets, one of the UK's leading insurance lawyers says. Mr David MacIntosh, senior partner of City solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper, told the International Bar Association meeting in New Orleans yesterday that the debris created by the US system was tangible. Over 400 insurers in the US were subject to insurance company supervisions, conservatorships, rehabilitations and liquidations. Giant US corporations such as John Mansville, the asbestos manufacturer, and AH Robins, the pharmaceutical group, had been forced into Chapter 11 protection and insurers and reinsurers around the world were 'reeling from red-line entries'. Too often, the goalposts of liability had been moved to the disadvantage of the insurance industry long after the risk was rated and the premium, now seen to be inadequate, had been paid. But it was possible that over-regulation and over-protectiveness had backfired on US consumers, making the practice of medicine too defensive, closing municipal facilities which could not afford to insure, discouraging production of life-saving vaccines and wiping out so many insurance companies and Lloyd's names. These concerns were echoed by Mr Victor Schwartz, a leading US product liability lawyer. A strong case existed for saying the US system, far from keeping bad products off the market, merely stopped development of good ones. Attempts to pass federal legislation to curb excessive awards of punitive damages and rationalise the system had been bogged down in Congress for 12 years, he said. The all-powerful plaintiffs' bar had blocked reform during the Republican years. Whereas former President George Bush and his vice-president Dan Quayle were too closely aligned to business for reform to pass, signs were that under the Clinton administration, Congress was moving closer to acting on the issue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Excerpts] The IRA bomb blast only 16 minutes after the end  of their 72-hour Christmas "cease-fire" shattered hopes today of  an early end to violence in Ulster.    The explosion, condemned by politicians, came as Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd, in an interview conducted before the  Christmas break, appealed to the IRA to stop prevaricating over  the British-Irish joint declaration -- and to lay down their  arms forever. Mr Hurd warned that if the Provisionals refused  to accept the Downing Street Declaration, then security measures  would be stepped up against them. You can expect no let-up and  no quarter on that front," he told them bluntly during the BBC  Radio 4 Today programme.    The blast, within the compound of the police station in the  remote Co Tyrone village of Fintona, injured a man and a women  and caused widespread damage to the base and surrounding homes.    It came in clear defiance of appeals by the Queen,  politicians and churchmen for the violence to end, and it  destroyed the hopes of war-weary Ulster people that the  "ceasefire" would continue as a truce while the IRA considered  its response to the declaration.    But hopes were not completely dashed either in London or  Dublin where it was always realised that the IRA high command  had a tough job on its hands to convince followers of the need  to end the violence. Nevertheless, there is growing irritation  in both governments that the Provisionals have given not the  slightest indication yet that they will cooperate and enable  Sinn Fein eventually to take part in talks about the future of  the Province. [passage omitted]    The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist  Party,  said after the bombing the "IRA killing monster" would not be  appeased by the declaration. [passage omitted]</p>

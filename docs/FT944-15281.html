			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Observer: Now you see it At 8.39 yesterday morning Charles Hochman, who retired as chief executive of media-buying Aegis group on October 15, found himself the happy beneficiary of 500,000 share options. The happiness was short-lived. By 14.22 the options had vanished, cancelled after Aegis was bombarded by City types saying that share options, after all, were meant to motivate management, not cushion pensioners. 'It's all highly eccentric,' said a City expert on corporate governance. What was in the mind of Aegis' remuneration committee, which decides such matters? The committee is composed of Frank Law, the (non-executive) chairman; John Vogelstein of Warburg Pincus, a major shareholder; and Sir Kit McMahon, a non-executive director. By way of elucidation, Law said yesterday that Hochman's options 'were automatically triggered by (Hochman's) service contract dating from 1992', adding that the afternoon cancellation had Hochman's 'full agreement'. Funnily enough, Aegis' latest annual report states that in February this year Law was given 500,000 shares - as was his wife, who is not a director nor even an employee of the company.</p>

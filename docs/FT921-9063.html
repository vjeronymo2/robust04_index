			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Vnesheconombank to be split into three THE TOP executives of the bankrupt Soviet Vnesheconombank (Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs) have been suspended and replaced by Mr Yuri Ponomaryev, former vice-president of the Paris-based, Soviet-owned Eurobank and former head of the monetary department of the Soviet State Bank, writes John Lloyd. Mr Ponomaryev's main task wll be to divide the bank into three parts: one to merge with the Vneshtorgbank, or Russian trade bank; the second to launch itself as an independent commercial bank; the third to strive to continue acting as a conduit for the repayment of Soviet debt. No principal on the debt - estimated at Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn - is being paid, by agreement with creditors, and interest payments have slipped in recent weeks for 'technical' reasons. Vnesheconombank has refused to issue cash to its customers and appears to have used hard currency deposits of its Soviet customers to pay off debt. Its inability to guarantee deposits has helped stimulate a massive flight of capital to foreign bank accounts.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Backbenchers try to block last Thatcherite reform - Ivo Dawnay on the fight by a Tory force against reforms to leasehold law THE LAST of the great Thatcherite reforms or a fiendishly interventionist meddling? Take your pick. But what is now abundantly clear, as the leasehold reform provisions in the Housing and Urban Development Bill pass through the Commons committee stage, is that they will be approved largely intact. Having lost the war, the landlord champions of a 'third way' between freehold and rental property are now fighting rearguard actions to ensure they hang on to something of what they now hold. For some Tory backbenchers, the concept of the right-to-buy for leaseholders should be anathema to a party, in part, founded on its determination to defend property ownership rights. Yet they appear to be a minority. Others, such as Mr Dudley Fishburn, Conservative MP for Kensington and himself a lessee of Grosvenor Estates, say the issue is really about extending right-to-buy principles to the private sector. His view appears to be prevailing. In spite of lobbying by the landlords, Sir George Young, the housing minister, looks set to favour a further tilt towards the leaseholder. Under the legislation as drafted, leaseholders with leases of more than 21 years will be entitled to buy the freehold of their properties from their landlords so long as certain criteria are met. But even some of those are now under concerted attack. Among them are what is known as the 'low rent' requirement which insists that, to qualify, ground rents are Pounds 1,000 or less - a figure that is aimed at ensuring properties that are arguably part of the rental market are not included. Further, another let-out clause - exempting properties where more than 10 per cent of the building is used for commercial purposes - is also under attack. Pointing out that many blocks of flats include ground-floor shops, the leaseholders' lobby says thousands of properties could unjustifiably slip through the net. This week rebellions by Tory backbenchers backed by Labour have attempted to ease the rules on both those points to ensure that the right to buy is extended to the maximum number of people. Sir George has appeared more than ready to adopt changes on both points, promising to review the relevant clauses. For the landlords, the fallback issues now increasingly centre on other arrangements including the criteria by which 'principal primary residence' qualifications are established. They are determined that primary-residence qualifications, as written in the bill, are not altered. That would mean that the right to buy would not apply to many central London properties which are the second homes of UK citizens or where lessees are companies or foreigners. Instead, leaseholders who technically qualified would retain the right to indefinite renenwal of their leases. That viewpoint, underwritten in the bill, may well prevail. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the case, the pure politics of the leasehold reforms is that the landlords and their formidable lobbying power are outgunned by a bi-partisan consensus. With the government standing to the left of some backbenchers on the issues, Labour can be counted on to ensure the measure is passed. Many more cynical Tory MPs argue simply that there are more votes to be won by establishing the right to buy across swathes of London and the south-east than by maintaining a landlord's right to own. When the Duke of Westminster, owner of the Grosvenor estate in central London, took his case to the European Court of Human Rights, it ruled that 'compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another might constitute a legitimate means for promoting the public interest'. Mr John Major's Conservative government clearly believes that interest dovetails neatly with its own.</p>

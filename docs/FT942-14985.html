			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poor excuse for not balloting members Sir, Your editorial 'Paying for parties' (April 14) supports the recommendations in Labour's minority report on the funding of political parties that shareholders should be balloted on company donations. When your reporter pressed Sir Ivan Lawrence at the launch of both Conservative majority and Labour minority reports as to why this measure was not included in the majority report, he pooh-poohed the idea, suggesting it was not necessary and would be far too complicated for companies to administer. This is a poor excuse. Our minority report calls for exactly the same regulations which apply to political donations from trade unions to be applied to companies. In other words, that companies wishing to make political donations should establish a political fund approved by shareholders every 10 years, and that provision should be made for shareholders who do not wish to contribute to opt out. Unless such a recommendation was implemented in law the position is clearly not going to change. A recent survey by Pensions and Investment Research Consultants found boards defending their decisions not to consult shareholders by claiming donations are 'falling within the remit the management, not the shareholders' (Smith Kline Beecham) and 'a matter for the board' (Glaxo). Where shareholders are 'consulted' the methods are often not a model of democracy: Allied Lyons told the survey that the 'mood' of the annual meeting was in favour of a donation, 'judging from the applause which met the chairman's comments'. This is an issue around which democrats in all parties should unite. It is a pity that Conservative members of the home affairs select committee have shown so little regard for democracy and openness. Barbara Roche, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite market interventions by currency  authorities from Japan, Europe, and the United States, the  dollar's value continued to drop against the yen and the  Deutsche mark. As a result, the government and the Bank of  Japan [BOJ] are ready to intervene in the market, beginning 27  June, if the yen's appreciation continues, by selling the yen  [Y] and buying the dollar at the Tokyo foreign exchange market.  The government and the BOJ are worried the rapid rise in the  yen's value may reduce profits from export-oriented industries  and have negative impacts on the domestic economy, which is  beginning to recover. While there is a rumor the United States  may increase its interest rate, it is likely Japan will study  the possibility of acting in harmony with the United States in  the financial policy field by introducing such measures as  keeping short-term interest rates low.    Joint market interventions on 24 June did not have enough  effect because speculators, including U.S.-affiliated companies,  sold the dollars they had at a scale exceeding the amount of  money Japan and the United States spent in the market  interventions. After the dollar-yen rate dropped to the Y99  level at the New York market on 21 June, the BOJ launched a  major intervention in the Tokyo market and pushed the dollar  back to the Y101 level. Therefore, the BOJ still has confidence  in market intervention.    However, due to the huge surplus in Japan's current account  balance, investors have a strong feeling there are surplus  dollar funds at the Tokyo foreign exchange market. Moreover, on  24 June, President Clinton criticized Japan for its trade  surplus. Therefore, the government and the BOJ are worried about  the possibility that pressure, which calls for further  appreciation of the yen, may become strong in the money markets  after 27 June.    When the dollar's value dropped in May, there were some  movements in the financial field to push it up. The BOJ  increased its funds supply in the short-term financial market  because an increase in funds supply is expected to widen  differences in interest rates between Japan and the United  States and thereby increase demands for the dollar. It is  possible the BOJ may be forced to introduce such a financial  measure if the recent interventions in the Tokyo market fails to  produce results.    The government plans to promote measures, including  deregulation, and plans to review as much as possible,  fundamental public investment plans in accordance with an  initial schedule to show its stance at home and abroad that it  aims at realizing economic recovery, led mainly by domestic  demands that exist even after the cabinet's resignation.  Moreover, the government also wants to make some progress in  Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks before the developed  countries' summit meeting (Naples summit) to improve Japan-U.S.  relations.</p>

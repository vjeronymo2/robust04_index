			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Daniel Riegger report: "`Every Bit of Independence Is Wiped </F> Out'"]    [Text] The fact that the Serb authorities have now put  deaf-mutes in the Kosovo Academy of Arts and Sciences that they  had forced to close down is not regarded as a coincidence by  Adem Demaci. Belgrade is systematically "Serbianizing" the  Albanian province of Kosovo. Writer Adem Demaci considers the  fact that deaf-mutes are now living in the building where the  freedom of the Albanian word used to be fought for as "cynicism,  a way of humiliating the Albanians."    For his conviction, Demaci spent 28 years in prisons and  work  camps. He is a symbol of the Kosovo Albanians' resistance to  Serb oppression, and he is a winner of the Sakharov Prize for  Human Rights awarded by the European Parliament. Demaci, who  came to Frankfurt at the invitation of the International Society  for Human Rights, talked to FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU about the  situation of the oppressed province of Kosovo, whose population  includes 2 million Albanians and 200,000 Serbs.    "Anything that looks a bit like independence, individual  spirit, and initiative, is wiped out." As the latest link in a  long chain, the Institute for Albanology in the province's  capital Pristina was closed this week and the scientists beaten  up. The oppression is getting increasingly comprehensive,  arrests and interrogations with torture are the order of the day.    Demaci complains that Europe does not care enough for the  situation of the Kosovo Albanians. "The Serbs can tell the  Albanians, look, we can do with you whatever we want, the world  does not react, does not protect you."    For Demaci, the fact that the German Government and the  laender want to send Kosovo Albanians back to their country in  the planned mass deportations is "as if you throw somebody out  of a train speeding through the country at 100 kilometers per  hour." All those deported are likely to be interrogated by  Serbian police in Kosovo, who quite often beat and torture them  to get supposed confessions out of them. The human rights  activist: "If they flee Kosovo because they were politically  persecuted, prison is waiting for them; if they flee recruitment  into the army, the court-martial awaits them; and if they flee  because they had nothing to eat, death from starvation awaits  them." Kosovo very much suffers from the embargo on the FRY;  there is no fuel, no food, and medical supplies are very poor.    If the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina ends with Serbia being  allowed to keep its occupied territories, oppression in Kosovo  will become even more brutal, "then Serbia can play the master  of the entire Balkans," Demaci fears.</p>

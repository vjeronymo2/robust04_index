			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / The world's no-win zones The jury is still out over what exactly was achieved by last week's air strike against military installations in Iraq. Taking out only half the targets does not seem a particularly impressive achievement. The more important question is, what did it achieve in strategic terms; or even, what was it meant to achieve in strategic terms? The 'new world order', which was supposed to be coming soon after the Gulf war two years ago, is still obviously a long way off. Released from the icy grip of the cold war, the international community is trying to do more than in the past about some of the wrongs of the world. The problem is that world-ordering is just as intractable as ever. In Iraq, the west seems to be stuck with an ambiguous strategy that fails to reconcile conflicting objectives. In the former Yugoslavia, it is hoping against hope that the civil war can be brought to an end through trade sanctions and diplomatic negotiations, because no one wants to accept the alternative of military intervention on the ground. Last week's air strike against Iraq was ostensibly to enforce the no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel. Yet the reasons for this no-fly zone have by now become blurred. It was originally imposed to hamper Saddam Hussein's repression of the Shias in the south. In reality such repression would mainly be carried out by land forces; an air exclusion zone could not have much effect. So is it now really being maintained to limit Baghdad's ability to threaten Kuwait and the rest of the Gulf? To weaken his position at home? Or what? In any case, Saddam showed last week that he can easily stick the outside world with the inherent contradiction between the UN's no-fly zone and its need for freedom to fly its arms inspectors anywhere. Since the air attack, he has said he would stop obstructing the arms inspectors; but it is obvious that this bombing raid, as with other bombing raids, is not a durable solution to anything, because it cannot be. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is much worse. An apparent change of heart by the Bosnian Serbs last Tuesday gave an unexpected reprieve to the peace talks in Geneva; Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said he accepted the constitutional plan put forward by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and undertook to try to sell it to his own supporters. Having conquered so much of the territory of Bosnia, many Bosnian Serbs will want to reject the plan. But if their answer is yes, then we shall face the moment of truth. For the next stage in the negotiations would be the allocation of territory to the various warring factions - Serbs, Moslems and Croatians - and that is where the briar patch gets really thorny. The patchwork of 10 quasi-autonomous provinces, proposed by Mr Vance and Lord Owen, is an inherently bizarre recipe of contradictory principles. Poised uneasily on the cusp between autonomy for the (ethnically-based) provinces and the legitimacy of the state, it can hardly avoid rolling one way or another, almost certainly towards disintegration and the effective expansion of greater Serbia. In principle, the plan concedes far too much to ethnic cleansing and territorial conquest, which are widely condemned. An even more serious problem in practice is that the Vance-Owen map would require the Bosnian Serbs to surrender a substantial proportion of the territory that they now effectively control. If the Serbs do not agree to surrender the territory, the west will have an interesting choice: either to let them keep what they have conquered, in which case these negotiations will merely have served to endorse the Serbian aggression and savagery; or else to make them conform to the Vance-Owen map, which would mean a credible threat to deploy substantial international forces on the ground. No prizes are offered for guessing the likely outcome, since western governments are horrified at the idea of getting involved in this dirty civil war. Aspirations for a better world order will not disappear. The Gulf war was a one-off event, unique in its black-and-white simplicity, unsatisfactory in its political outcome and irrelevant to other situations. Yet that UN performance set a precedent which continues to influence the mind-sets of the members of the Security Council. It may be exceedingly difficult to reproduce that precedent, however. First, the US may be less politically inclined to take on the essential leadership role. We do not yet know just how President Clinton will respond to the latest spasm in the Iraqi crisis. But his election platform, with its clear priority for domestic issues, suggests that he would be less likely than Mr Bush to play the role of the global policeman. In any case, the Gulf war already showed that the US can no longer afford to exercise this role alone. The shrinking of US finances, and then of US forces, mean that the growing demands for UN peacekeeping can only be met in future if the Europeans are prepared to share the leadership and the costs. In this context 'Europeans' means more than just Britain and France: it means the Germans must play their part as well. The fact that the German Social Democrats have blocked any easing of the limitation on the use of German military force is a serious setback for the prospect of UN peacekeeping.</p>

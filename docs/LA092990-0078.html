			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Catholic collegiate officials were relieved this week when Pope John Paul II  issued a document on Catholic universities that appears to respect academic  freedom even as it challenges them to adhere to church teachings.  </P> <P> "I'm delighted," said Sister Magdalen Coughlin, provost of Mt. St. Mary's  College in Los Angeles and for many years its president. "The language tends to  be non-legal, non-judgmental. It seems to be a responsive and responsible  document."  </P> <P> American Catholic university presidents had reacted strongly against the first  draft produced in 1985, saying they felt that the U.S. traditions of academic  freedom and autonomy from church interference were endangered.  </P> <P> Coughlin was one of 18 U.S. delegates who conferred in April, 1989, in Rome  with Vatican officials on the document. The changes suggested by delegates from  various countries were well-received at the time, she said.  </P> <P> "Whereas the original draft had spelled out hundreds of norms, now there are  only seven," she said.  </P> <P> The 11,000-word work is titled "Apostolic Constitution of the Supreme Pontiff  John Paul II on Catholic Universities."  </P> <P> Jesuit Father Thomas Rausch, professor of theology at Loyola Marymount  University in Los Angeles, cautioned that the constitution's statement  guaranteeing academic freedom for members of the university was qualified by  the phrase "within the confines of truth," a phrase he said was not in last  year's draft.  </P> <P> "A theologian would want to raise the question of who determines what is truth,  especially in theology. That is the area of recent controversies on dissent and  Catholic scholarship," Rausch said. He added that much depends on how key  sentences are interpreted.  </P> <P> However, Rausch indicated he was pleased with the document's "vagueness" on a  debated question of whether theologians at all Catholic universities need to  have formal, licensed mandates from Rome. Most in this country do not, although  such a procedure is required by the church's canon law.  </P> <P> Rausch said the papal writing also shows the enthusiasm for Catholic education  that might be expected from a former university professor. Rausch also said he  was pleased by the "ecumenical sensitivity" in the constitution's respect for  the religious rights and beliefs of many non-Catholics teaching at Catholic  institutions.  </P> <P> AUTHOR  </P> <P> Father Joseph F. Girzone, a retired priest whose self-published "Joshua" and  its sequel, "Joshua and the Children," have together sold 1 million copies,  will speak at St. Timothy's Catholic Church in Laguna Niguel at 7:15 p.m.  Sunday and 7 p.m. Monday. "The Shepherd," a third novel in the Joshua series by  the Altamont, N.Y., author, will be published by Macmillan Publishing Co. next  month. In the story, Joshua, a Jesuslike figure, befriends a young bishop who  is challenging his diocese on matters of celibacy, married priests and the  ordination of women.  </P> <P> MEETINGS  </P> <P> Auxiliary Bishop Sylvester Ryan of Los Angeles will address as many as 2,000  people expected to attend the 43rd annual conference of the Los Angeles  Archdiocesan Council of Women on Monday, starting at 8:30 a.m., at the Westin  Bonaventure Hotel.  </P> <P> More than 3,300 members of the Worldwide Church of God will convene Wednesday  evening at Ambassador Auditorium for the fall festival of the Pasadena-based  church body. Through a television satellite link, members celebrating in 50  other countries will simultaneously hear an address the next day by Joseph W.  Tkach, pastor general of the denomination founded by the late Herbert W.  Armstrong. JOHN DART  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa told business leaders Monday [4 April] he hopes that  debates on the 1994 fiscal budget up for Diet approval will be  expedited, his aides said. Hosokawa made the remark during a  morning meeting with business leaders, including Eiji Suzuki,  former head of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations  (Nikkeiren), they said.    The executives expressed concern that a delay in debates on  the budget will affect economic recovery, the officials said.    The business leaders also urged Hosokawa to make clear the  government's stance [on] macroeconomic measures, such as tax  cuts in years beyond fiscal 1994, which began Friday, and an  additional appropriation for public works projects, they said.    Other business representatives at the meeting included  Shoichiro Toyoda, next president of the Federation of Economic  Organizations, Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of  Commerce and Industry, Nikkeiren Chairman Takeshi Nagano and  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Federation of Corporate  Executives.</p>

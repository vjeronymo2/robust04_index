			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading GOOD two-way business was reported in the futures market yesterday as the September contract fought hard against profit-taking to end the session lower, writes Chris Price. After Wednesday's powerful surge, which saw the future reach a record high, the first hour's trading was directionless. However, buyers soon decided to test the market range again and the slow rise in September started to gather momentum. It hit 3,030 in the late morning, which turned out to be the high of the day. The unemployment statistics and manufacturing output figures had little impact and a weaker gilts market saw sellers move in and a gradual decline in the contract began. A softer opening on Wall Street in the afternoon session also undermined support. September closed at 3,016, around three points premium to its fair value level of three. Volume was a healthy 13,000 contracts. British Gas was again prominent in the traded options market, heading the list of stocks. It traded 2,727 contracts and was followed by British Steel on 1,200, Barclays on 822 and Rolls-Royce with 773. The total of 30,000 contracts compared well with the previous session's figure which was boosted by the last expiry date. FT-SE volume was over 8,000, while the Euro-FTSE was half that amount.</p>

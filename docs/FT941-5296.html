			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Clinton defends wife over Whitewater allegations President Bill Clinton coupled a stirring defence of his wife's integrity with a blistering attack on the Republican party yesterday in his first public comments since White House handling of the Whitewater affair forced the resignation of his legal counsel last weekend. 'I have never known a person with a stronger sense of right and wrong than my wife - ever,' he told a press conference held jointly with Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader. 'She has unfailingly always done the right thing. People can ask whatever questions they want, and we will do our best to comply. But I'm just telling you, the American people can worry about something else. 'Her moral compass is as strong as anybody's in the country, and they will see that.' He was responding, with controlled anger, to questions about a press report that Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton had ordered in 1992 the shredding of documents at her former law firm in Arkansas. Also several US newspapers and magazines have in the last 48 hours run critical articles focusing on the First Lady's uniquely influential role. Mr Clinton committed himself, his wife and his administration to full co-operation with Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel investigating their complex land and financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s. 'We are not covering up, we're opening up,' he declared. He said he knew nothing in advance about two meetings between White House and Treasury officials concerning investigations into the Arkansas savings and loan institution alleged to have funnelled money to his 1984 re-election campaign. He had been apprised only after the event about a third meeting. Equally striking was his attack on the Republican party, some of whose leading lights, such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, have begun to speak of the president being forced from office because of Whitewater. Comparisons with Watergate, which brought down President Richard Nixon in 1974, were the product of 'blatantly partisan' Republican 'hysteria'. Yesterday, Republicans in congress continued to demand hearings on Whitewater. But it emerged last night that Mr Fiske had told congressional leaders that hearings might complicate his own investigations. Mr Clinton warned the opposition: 'What they do today, as Republicans, as a party, may look good today. It may not look good when the independent counsel finishes his work. I think they ought to think long and hard about whether this sort of partisan clamour and careless use of language is really not only in the best interests of the American people but in the best interests of their party.'</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Doubts over legal challenge to Maastricht THE GOVERNMENT'S claim that it could press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty despite its embarrassing climbdown over the social chapter won the backing of legal experts last night. The retreat marks the start of a legal wrangle that could overshadow the rest of the bill's parliamentary passage. Legal experts said there were no obvious constitutional objections to use of the royal prerogative to ratify the treaty's social protocol. Lawyers also indicated that anti-treaty campaigners appeared to have no grounds for seeking a judicial review at this stage and that the courts would be very reluctant to interfere. The acceptance yesterday by the government of an amendment to the bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty that calls for the deletion of the protocol on the social chapter has led Conservative Euro-sceptics to claim the government cannot legally ratify the treaty. The Euro-sceptics argue the amendment means legislation approved by parliament could prove insufficient for the government to sign the Maastricht treaty. They will seek a judicial review of ministers' use of the royal prerogative. Specifically, Tory Euro-sceptics believe that the government will not have the power to contribute to the administrative costs of the social chapter. The government argues that, even though the protocol will be excluded from domestic law, it still stands in the treaty. Britain can ratify the treaty because the protocol imposed no burdens on the country that required domestic legislation. The social chapter opt-out remains. Labour agrees broadly with the government that ratification has not been stopped. But Mr George Robertson, Europe spokesman, says a 'series of minefields' have been created that can only be solved by accepting the social chapter. As Britain has opted out of the social chapter, the protocol does not require changes to be made to UK employment legislation. Mr David Vaughan QC, a European law expert, said great play was made by those who believed parliamentary ratification was required for the social protocol of the terms of the 1978 European Assembly Elections Act. Section 6(2) of that act provides that no effect can be given to any protocol or treaty which results in any increase in the powers of the European parliament without the approval of the UK parliament. But Mr Vaughan said that it was clear from Hansard that at the time the 1978 act was passed, parliament was not so much concerned with preventing extra powers being given to the European parliament as with preventing any decrease in the powers of Westminster. Parliamentary approval would therefore have been required for opting-in to the social chapter but not for opting out, because opting out has no effect on Westminster's social or employment powers. Lawyers also believe Euro-sceptics may face insurmountable problems in trying to persuade the courts to hear a legal challenge. Sir William Goodhart QC said it was difficult to see who would have the necessary standing to bring an application for judicial review. Mr Vaughan agreed. 'There are limits to judicial review,' he said, adding that a legal challenge could only happen once the Maastricht bill was in force, but even then, he said, it was difficult to see how the courts could intervene. A challenge by a taxpayer on the grounds that the government has no parliamentary authority to spend taxpayers' money on contributions towards the expenses incurred by EC institutions might get off the ground. But the Crown clearly had power to spend money on treaty obligations, and the courts would be very reluctant to say the government could not, he said. None of this could happen until the Maastricht bill was in force and even then it was not clear that one taxpayer would have sufficient standing to mount a legal challenge nor what his remedy would be.</p>

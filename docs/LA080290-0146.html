			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBE OF PARKING STRUCTURE A 'WASTE OF TIME AND DOLLARS'  </P> <P> To ask the Los Angeles County Grand Jury to investigate the Garfield Medical  Center parking structure (Times, Letters, July 29) is a waste of time, energy  and taxpayer dollars as well as establishing a new high in the art of  buck-passing by Monterey Park's officials.  </P> <P> My reasons are as follows:  </P> <P> 1.  </P> <P> The plans for the parking structure have remained unchanged since the day they  were submitted to the Planning Department and the structure was built to the  plan.  </P> <P> 2. The plans were available to the public at all times.  </P> <P> 3. Prior to approval, testimony was given at every public meeting regarding the  number of parking spaces and tiers in the structure.  </P> <P> 4. The Monterey Park zoning code defines stories, but does not define levels.  </P> <P> 5. A parking structure is defined by the Uniform Building Code.  </P> <P> 6. The Garfield Medical Center parking structure meets the requirements of the  Uniform Building Code.  </P> <P> 7. The parking structure conforms to the height limit as set forth in the  Monterey Park zoning code.  </P> <P> 8. Although allegations of improprieties and specifically bribe-taking by the  staff and/or City Council member(s) have been made during public meetings, a  thorough investigation of the charges has revealed no wrongdoing by anyone.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, an often-heard cry at the Monterey Park City Council meetings  is: "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!" And that is too bad because it  prevents the real problems of the community from getting solved.  </P> <P> IRV GILMAN  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

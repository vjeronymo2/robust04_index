The accord includes fielding single candidates of the  parties  in the next general election, the sources said.    Chief Cabinet Secretary and Sakigake leader Masayoshi  Takemura, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and Hokkaido  Governor Takahiro Yokomichi, a member of the SDP and its  expected future leader, reached the agreement at a meeting in  Tokyo on February 12, they said.    The three leaders made the move to promote cooperation  between the SDP and Sakigake, two of the seven coalition  government partners.    The move was also designed to counter a potential alliance  of  Shinseito and Komeito, two other coalition parties, the sources  said.    Yokomichi confirmed the three-way meeting on Saturday.    The SDP and Sakigake are in favor of a new multiparty  system.  But Shinseito and Komeito are trying to develop a two-party  system, saying the seven governing parties must unite to  maintain power against the largest opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP).    On Thursday, Takemura met with Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP) leader Keigo Ouchi and they confirmed the party would  cooperate with the SDP-Sakigake camp, the sources said. Ouchi  is also health and welfare minister.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Takemura are at  loggerheads as the premier reportedly wants to drop Takemura  from his cabinet, sources close to the coalition parties said.    Hosokawa and Takemura played key roles last year in  establishing the first non-LDP government in 38 years.    In a related development, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the  SDP's  Diet Administration Committee, told reporters in Tottori that he  favors a "drastic" reshuffle of the Hosokawa cabinet after the  Diet approves the fiscal 1994 budget.</p>

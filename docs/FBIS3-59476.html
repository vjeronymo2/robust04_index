			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 31 December issue of the Belgrade  weekly NIN in Serbo-Croatian on page 14 carries a report on a 27  December Belgrade NTV [Independent Television] Studio B program  that showed exercises by a military police unit of Yugoslav Army  Special Corps forces. NIN reports that the program showed  special unit soldiers practicing responding to street  disturbances and their actions against the demonstrators. NIN  observes that the television pictures reminded viewers of recent  unpleasant events in the streets of Belgrade but that this time  Yugoslav Army soldiers rather than regular policemen clad in  blue uniforms were involved. The weekly reports that, according  to the TV program, Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Momcilo Perisic  tried to explain the preparation of the special units for  possible conflict with "their own people" by citing Article 133  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] Constitution, which  states that "the FRY has an Army that defends its sovereignty,  territory, independence, and constitutional order." NIN states  that Perisic explained the meaning of "constitutional order" by  criticizing "some parties that understand their role in the  political life of the country in a distorted way and are trying  to overthrow the government."    The constitutional order of the country cannot be equated  with the activities of the political parties and their struggles  for power, NIN remarks, adding that it is the Army's duty to  defend the constitutional order, which is defined in the FRY  Constitution by regulations that, for example, refer to  Yugoslavia as a "sovereign federal state founded on the equality  of citizens and member republics...." Discussing the high cost  of financing the Army at the expense of the people, who "are  literally starving," NIN asks whether the special Army police  unit will now go on to attack the "hungry and impoverished  people when they take to the streets to rightly protest the  situation in which they find themselves without being  responsible for it."</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Severe cuts in services feared LOCAL authority associations reacted with dismay to the rate support grant settlement and tight capping rules announced yesterday, claiming that they would lead to severe cuts in local services. Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Newcastle upon Tyne council and chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said the 'unrealistic' spending targets plus capping would leave 'local government services in the worst state I've known them in my 25 years in local government'. The Association of County Councils pointed to the government's inconsistency in allowing central government spending to rise by 6.6 per cent over this year's actual expenditure, while local spending is to be restricted to a 0.4 per cent increase. The government's failure to provide additional relief for business ratepayers - who face a 3.5 per cent increase - was criticised by the Federation of Small Businesses. 'All government help and rebates are aimed at council-tax payers, yet the uniform business rate will raise twice as much as council tax,' it said. A warning of severe cuts in vital public services and of job losses even if there was a public-sector pay freeze came from Labour MPs listening to Mr Howard's statement, while Tory backbenchers complained about the 'inefficiencies' of Labour councils. There were cross-party complaints about the way the government calculates how much it thinks each local authority needs to spend. Though MPs generally welcomed the government's move to incorporate some 1991 census data in drawing up its standard spending assessments, Tory and Labour backbenchers were seriously concerned about the way these worked in practice. Mr Howard emphasised that the precise mechanism of distributing the grant was still provisional, and undertook to look carefully at further representations from councils about the way they were affected by the system.</p>

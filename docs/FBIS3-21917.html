			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] After four months of  investigation, local Narcotics Division agents arrested a  Mandeville man on Friday on charges of possession of ganja,  dealing in ganja and taking steps preparatory to exporting ganja.    He is Carlton "Carly" Dunkley, 37, businessman and former  policeman of Westwood Apartments, Mandeville, Manchester, police  sources say.    The offences were alleged to have been committed in  September  when two drums of what was manifested as limestone, were taken  to the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston to be  air-freighted to Miami, Florida.    However when the drums were opened they were found to  contain  600 lbs. of compressed ganja, wrapped in several packages.  Friday morning, Narcotics Division agents raided Mr. Dunkley's  apartment and arrested him on the three charges. He is being  held in custody to be taken before the Kingston RM Court at  Sutton Street tomorrow.</p>

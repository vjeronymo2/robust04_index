			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Car-boot sale move 'a crooks' charter' Government plans to remove restrictions on organisers of markets, fairs and car-boot sales could cost millions of pounds and push up council tax bills, according to the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, John Willman and David Owen write. They could also amount to a 'crooks' charter', according to the Labour party, making it harder to restrict car-boot sales. 'It is now widely recognised that a lot of burglars use car-boot sales as a means of reselling what they steal,' said Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local government minister. Currently, local authorities which run franchise markets or fairs can stop competitors holding events within a radius of 6 2/3 miles of their own market. The de-regulation bill includes clauses to abolish these common-law market franchise rights, which produce Pounds 110m a year in gross rental for local authorities.</p>

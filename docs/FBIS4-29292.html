			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Democratic Kampuchea Delegation on the </F> Cease-fire;" dated 15 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] I. The entire Cambodian nation and people,  including the people in Phnom Penh and in rural areas and  abroad, are very tired of the longer than two-decade war. The  Cambodian nation and people do not want war. They yearn for  peace and want all Cambodian parties to reconcile, in genuine  national unity and peace so that every Cambodian has a chance to  live normally.    His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk thought about the  roundtable meeting and the meeting of the roundtable commission  to reconcile the nation and for peace. This represents his  lofty desire to see all sides hold successive meetings, and to  show increased mutual understanding until full national  reconciliation and national concord are achieved.    The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] as a nationalist  force has fought with the entire Cambodian nation and people for  the survival of the Cambodian nation, people, and race for over  15 years. It does not want to seek or seize power and is not  greedy. As the victim, the PDK, like the Cambodian nation and  people, want to quickly end the war and reconcile the nation.  It wants to rally all national forces so that the Cambodian  motherland has peace and national union again with independence  and territorial integrity.    II. Now, in the past and future, the PDK has been happy to  have a cease-fire. The PDK does not want war and fighting. We  only want the war to end quickly and to achieve national  reconciliation and peace quickly. The PDK holds that the  cease-fire should be within the framework of a solution to  achieve genuine national reconciliation and peace. Therefore,  it is necessary to have a permanent cease-fire that is effective  nationwide, with proper and adequate control by a commission or  technical group to be set up to deal with this issue. We  believe it is imperative to avoid using the cease-fire as a  trick to cheat one another and the local and foreign public in  order to continue fighting. In this case, it would not be a  genuine cease-fire and fighting would continue. This would be  against the will and aspiration of our nation and people who  want to restore genuine national reconciliation and peace.    The Cambodian situation is very complex with the issues of  war and national and social problems. Problems related to the  war in Cambodia for over two decades have not been created by  Cambodians and are not problems among Cambodians. These  problems have been created by direct foreign interference and  aggression. Fueling the war does not respond to the interest of  the Cambodian nation and people. People are aware of the great  suffering and destruction of the country during the over  20-year-long war. Continuing the war only serves the interest  of foreigners whose aim and strategy are to annex Cambodia and  place it in their orbit. This is particularly true for the  communist Vietnamese who want the war in Cambodia to continue.  They have pushed Cambodians into fighting and killing  nationalist Cambodians so that communist Vietnam has a chance to  bring in Vietnamese nationals to annex Cambodia.    With this aim and strategy in mind, foreigners do not want  national reconciliation, national union, and peace in Cambodia.  They only want to fuel the war so that they have a pretext and a  chance to interfere in Cambodia in every way. Therefore, the  cease-fire is not in the hands of Cambodians. The fact is that  the cease-fire is an old issue the communist Vietnamese had  raised a long time ago. It is one of three conditions raised by  the communist Vietnamese to eliminate the PDK and the Cambodian  people's resistance forces. People are aware of this.    It should be recalled that the three conditions were:    1. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to implement a cease-fire;    2. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to hand over all its zones  to the former State of Cambodia of the communist Vietnamese, and  now to the two-headed government; and    3. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to demobilize all its  troops.    III. Despite all this, the PDK holds that as long as  Cambodians strive to meet, talk, compromise, and make mutual  concessions, we will eventually and gradually solve all these  problems and move toward national reconciliation. Talking about  the cease-fire and national reconciliation without concrete  evidence is like the present situation following the election of  UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]. People are aware  of how bitter this has been.    This is the issue we have to discuss, now and in the future,  until full national reconciliation and peace are achieved. The  entire Cambodian nation and people are waiting to see a genuine  cease-fire that is vital to them.    [Dated] 15 June 1994</p>

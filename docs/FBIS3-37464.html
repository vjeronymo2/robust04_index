			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] One of the main subjects discussed at the talks  between Boris Yeltsin and John Major was the Bosnian problem.  The Russian president and the British prime minister reiterated  that it should be resolved peacefully above all. Responding to  journalists' questions after the signing at the Kremlin of the  Russo-British declaration on strategic missiles, Boris Yeltsin  said: Certain people are trying to decide Bosnian questions  without Russia's participation. We will not allow this to  happen. Russia will be an active participant in the talks, so  that a peaceful end is found to the war in Yugoslavia.    On Monday the UN Forces Command in former Yugoslavia ordered  the Russian battalion stationed in eastern Croatia to send 400  men to Bosnia. RIA Novosti correspondent Sergey Gryzunov  reports on the situation in former Yugoslavia:    [Begin Gryzunov recording] Russian diplomatic sources in  Belgrade confirmed that the UN Command in former Yugoslavia had  ordered the Russian battalion stationed in the Vukovar region of  eastern Croatia to send a reinforced company to Bosnia and  deploy it on the demarcation line between Serbs and Muslims.  Unconfirmed reports say that after consultations with Moscow  the battalion commander was instructed to stay put. According  to unconfirmed reports, the Russian battalion did not receive a  categorical order from the UN Command, but an inquiry about the  possibility of transferring part of the battalion. In this  instance the Russian paratroopers, who number 1,200, are  subordinate to the peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia, not  to the command of Russia's airborne assault forces.    Today, 16 February, Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's  special representative at the talks on former Yugoslavia,  changed his travel plans and made an urgent flight to Belgrade  from Zagreb. He will probably hold a fresh round of meetings,  his second during the last three days, with the Serbian  leadership. The question of participation by Russian soldiers  in the Bosnian conflict is bound to come up at these talks.  Yesterday in Zagreb Churkin said that as long as the West makes  decisions about Bosnia-Herzegovina without Russian  participation, there could be absolutely no question of using  the Russian army in operations on the territory of the present  conflict.    A former criminal nicknamed Arkan, who set up his own Party  of Serbian Unity and became a member of parliament, called on  the Serbs to rally to the defense of the motherland if air  strikes go ahead. Arkan, whose extradition is being  unsuccessfully sought by Interpol, has said he is using Russian  secret weapons that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy gave to him. Thus,  one can say that attempts are being made to draw Russia into the  Bosnian conflict under any pretext. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday morning three trucks from Trade for  Aid, the Salzburg relief organization, set out for Split [in  Croatia]. However, the transport of 20 tonnes of donated  foodstuffs, medicine, and winter clothing was halted at the  Slovene border. Trade for Aid was not able to pay the 137,000  schillings Slovenia wanted for the 100-km passage. [passage  omitted]    The Salzburg relief organization had all the necessary  documentation for the aid shipment to the refugee campaigns.  International relief organizations such as the Red Cross or  Caritas, and thus the Neighbor in Need campaign, are not  affected by these Slovene charges.</p>

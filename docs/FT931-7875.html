			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (1): Lure of a buyer's market - For UK carmakers, fleet sales are vital. But the new tax regime may lead more companies to offer employees a cash alternative to a car IN THEORY at least, the savagery of the current recession has provided an opportunity for vehicle fleet managers to adopt the mantle of heroes  - slayers of waste on behalf of a corporate sector in distress. Reality, in an unnerving number of cases, is somewhat different. According to one influential annual survey of the fleet policies of nearly 600 UK companies, the harsher economic climate has had no noticeable effect in terms of tightening the financial disciplines applied to company fleets, in particular those where cars are provided primarily as 'perks'. Nearly one in three companies is still not even monitoring the operating costs of its car fleet, according to the current Company Secretary's Review of Company Car schemes*. Only 54 per cent of companies surveyed kept detailed records of the running cost of each vehicle. As might be expected, there is a considerable difference between the controls exercised by small companies, with their limited resources, and large ones: 69 per cent of companies running a fleet of 100-plus vehicles kept detailed records on each vehicle. But if the survey's findings reflect approximately the UK picture overall - and there is no reason to suppose that they do not - that still means that nearly one in three of these larger companies has no proper idea of its fleet costs. There is evidence, however, that the sector as a whole has started to become more sensitive to fleet costs, even if in some cases its attempts to control them have proved counter-productive. In that category, for example, comes the retention of vehicles to an age and mileage where maintenance and repair costs become excessive and where their unreliability potentially impairs the effectiveness of employees. There has been no lack of initiatives from vehicle makers to persuade business car users to sign fresh orders. With most large continental new car markets turning down, Ford, Rover, and General Motors through its Vauxhall subsidiary, as well as other key players such as Peugeot, have been doing their utmost to encourage and capitalise on faint stirrings of recovery in the UK economy. The UK business car sector is exceptionally important to them. Britain rivals Germany as Europe's leading market in terms of the number of business-funded cars on the road - more than 3m - but it outranks Germany in terms of company car sales as a proportion of the total. 'Fleet' sales - defined as sales made to companies operating 25 cars or more  -accounted for nearly 42 per cent of total new car sales in the UK last year. Add on sales to smaller fleets and cars bought for business but registered in the name of individuals, such as architects and lawyers, and most estimates put the total at between 65 and 70 per cent. For UK market leader Ford, even though it substantially reduced its unprofitable sales to the big car rental companies last year, fleet sales alone accounted for more than half its total. Two out of every three Vauxhalls sold went to the 25-plus fleets. Even so, after several 'false dawns' of sales recovery last year, the total new car market reached only 1.59m units - 700,000 less than in the record year of 1989. That was after the removal, in two stages, of the 10 per cent Special Car Tax against which manufacturers had lobbied for more than a decade. Against that background - with car plants on short-time working, tens of thousands of jobs lost and the collapse of Leyland DAF and AWD in the commercial vehicle sector - fleet managers may justly consider themselves in a buyer's market. Indeed, the competitive screw is about to tighten further. At the end of last year, the first cars began emerging from Toyota's new car plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, and from Honda's at Swindon in Wiltshire. By the mid- to late 1990s, these plants will be adding at least 300,000 units to UK car output, in addition to well over 200,000 a year from Nissan's plant at Sunderland. All three Japanese manufacturers know that to achieve long-term success in the UK they must establish a firm fleet presence, and have set up marketing divisions specifically to cater to the sector. For Nissan, which last year took over its UK distribution operations following the rupture of its ties with Mr Octav Botnar, the efforts have already begun to bear fruit: nearly 11,000 of its sales last year were to the 25-plus fleet sector, or nearly 15 per cent of its total. Surveys of companies' fleet policies show that what was once an entrenched hostility by British companies towards putting Japanese-badged cars on their fleets is now rapidly crumbling. According to this year's Monks Partnership guide to company car policies**, 65 per cent of the 200 companies it surveyed (72 of them with Pounds 500m-plus turnover) now have Japanese cars manufactured in the UK on their 'approved' company car lists. Even cars produced in Japan or elsewhere outside Europe are approved by 47 per cent of such companies. The figures are only slightly less - 50 per cent and 38 per cent respectively - among smaller companies. Thus when the Mondeo, the medium car range replacing the Sierra, on which Ford claims to have spent Pounds 4bn, hits the marketplace next month as its first 'world' car, even Mr Ian McAllister, the Ford of Britain chairman, acknowledges that the days when a new product from Ford would sweep all before it are now over. Nevertheless, the Mondeo stands a good chance of becoming the market leader in its sector. However, it will be fighting for a place in the market among many more rivals than when the Sierra was launched more than a decade ago, and rival manufacturers will not meekly give way. Thus there is little prospect of an end to the deep discounting that is now endemic in the motor trade. The scope of this discounting is also apparent in the Company Secretary's Review. Fleet managers report mean discounts of around 15 per cent on mainstream fleet cars, and even the executive sector 'specialist' companies like BMW and Mercedes are not immune, with the survey finding mean discounts of 5-10 per cent, depending on model. Despite such discounts, and the seemingly contradictory lack of effective monitoring of operating costs by many companies, all the signs are of continuing caution by fleet managers towards new car purchases. Thus Mr McAllister expects at best a 10 per cent recovery this year, a view shared by most other industry leaders. Yet there are special reasons why the outlook for the fleet sector is uncertain. Not least, many fleet managers want to know the final form of the revised taxation regime for company cars and their users. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to shed more light on its detail and the timing for its introduction in his budget speech next month. It is expected closely to follow outline proposals unveiled late last year, and to equate taxation levels solely to new vehicle price. Once the detail is known, companies will have a much better idea whether the time is appropriate, as a growing number appear to think, to offer their employees a cash alternative to a car, thus allowing them to disengage from the risks and complexities of running a fleet. An obstacle to such a switch was removed last year, when the courts ruled that no VAT should be levied on cash offered in lieu of a car - for uncertainty on that point had acted as a brake on 'cash-for-car schemes'. Overcoming another brake on such schemes - that surveys show a strong desire by most employees to keep their company cars at almost any price  - is another matter altogether. *The Company Secretary's Review, Survey of Company Car Schemes 1992-93.

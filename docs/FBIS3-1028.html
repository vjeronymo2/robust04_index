The chief of general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo  Diya, gave the pledge today in Abuja when he received an Iraqi  delegation led by Dr. (al-Bara) [as transliterated]. Gen. Diya  said Nigeria would support any action that would facilitate the  lifting of the sanctions, particularly in the areas of food  supply and health care. He expressed the belief that Iraq had  made genuine efforts and complied with UN resolutions. The  chief of general staff commended Iraq for the understanding it  had shown toward Nigeria's current political problems.    Earlier, Dr. ('Ali al-Bara) had briefed the chief of general  staff on efforts Iraq had made so far to fully comply with the  UN resolutions. He disclosed that virtually, all Iraqi nuclear,  chemical, and biological warfare programs had been destroyed  under the close supervision of UN experts.</p>

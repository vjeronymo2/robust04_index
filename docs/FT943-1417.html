			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Portsmouth Water fights price curb Portsmouth Water is to take its dispute with Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, over the recent price review to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Earlier this week South West Water became the first water company to call on the MMC to review Ofwat's findings. Portsmouth, which has the lowest domestic water charges in England, an annual average of Pounds 69, has been ordered to hold price rises to 1.5 percentage points below inflation - the third lowest increase among water supply companies.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Cut in VAT seen as best stimulant for growth A TEMPORARY cut in value added tax would be a more effective way of stimulating economic growth in Britain than a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax, according to Oxford Economic Forecasting, an independent research group. But, in its latest quarterly analysis of UK economic prospects, the group expects Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to cut the basic income-tax rate to 24p from 25p in his Budget on March 10. It says a 1p cut in income tax (or an equivalent increase in tax allowances) would raise UK gross domestic product by just 0.1 per cent this year. By contrast, a cut in the VAT rate to 12.5 per cent from 17.5 per cent for six months from April to November could raise output this year by 0.5 per cent. The report forecasts UK economic growth of 1.5 per cent this year, with unemployment reaching a peak of 2.9m in the second quarter.

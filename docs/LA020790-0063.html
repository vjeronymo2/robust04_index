			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Home Again: Kitty Dukakis, wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, has completed  medical treatment and returned to their Brookline, Mass., home. Dukakis was  hospitalized in November after drinking a small amount of rubbing alcohol.  </P> <P> The governor's spokeswoman, Mindy Lubber, said Monday night that Dukakis  probably would write a book on her husband's presidential campaign.  </P> <P> * Taxing Work: Debra Murphree, the former prostitute who reportedly had a  liaison with preacher Jimmy Swaggart, will not get to spend most of the  $210,000 that Penthouse reportedly paid for her story. Murphree will receive  about $54,000, and her agents, attorneys and the IRS will get the rest, said  her attorney, Louis H. Schultz. "She's happy. I talked with her on the  telephone," Schultz said Monday in New Orleans. Murphree claimed in the  magazine in 1988 that the TV evangelist paid her $20 a visit in 1987 to strike  prurient poses and perform sexual acts. Swaggart had tearfully confessed in  February, 1988, to an unspecified "moral failure" and was subsequently  defrocked by his church.  </P> <P> * A Loss They Can Afford: Philadelphia Eagles football coach Buddy Ryan fired  the first volley in a friendly weight-loss competition among six of pro  football's heavier coaches. "Art Shell can afford to lose about three people,"  Ryan said Monday in New York of the Los Angeles Raiders' head coach. The  coaches -- Shell (338 pounds), Bill Parcells, New York Giants (265); Ryan  (258); Joe Gibbs, Washington Redskins (240); Chuck Knox, Seattle Seahawks  (236), and Dan Henning, San Diego Chargers (222) -- are in a diet program to  raise money for research to combat paralysis. The program is sponsored by a  diet plan that will contribute $500 for every pound lost.  </P></p>

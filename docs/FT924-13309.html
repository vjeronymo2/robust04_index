			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House Trafalgar's recent defence document was carefully drafted - and just as well. Referring to discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel it said any consequential amendments to its accounting policies and practices should not affect the aggregate of shareholders' funds. That subtle qualification was important. In the light of the panel's damning findings yesterday Trafalgar announced that it was revising its policy on advance corporation tax and that this would result in a Pounds 20m write off in the 1991 accounts. It seems strange that just 10 days ago the Trafalgar directors were so ignorant of what was about to hit them. Shareholders may be less surprised at the panel's order to Trafalgar to reverse the way it reclassified certain current assets into fixed assets. There was, after all, an outcry in the City and the press at the time because the new classification flattered the profit and loss account. Nevertheless the whole episode - not least the unprecedented way in which the accounting watchdog threatened to go to court to force the company's compliance - casts a further cloud over Trafalgar's boardroom judgment. Hongkong Land may be a bit cheeky to demand two representatives for its 15 per cent stake - but it appears that they are needed. Yesterday's developments, though, will encourage those in the UK trying to improve the quality of financial reporting. The panel is lucky that it was adjudicating on Trafalgar - one of its most high profile victims - at such a vulnerable stage in its history. The result should bolster its authority.</p>

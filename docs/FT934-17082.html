			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: What it means to be the best - Serious Money Hold thou the good: define it well: For fear divine Philosophy Should push beyond her mark, and be Procuress to the Lords of Hell  - Tennyson, In Memoriam DEFINING an absolute is not simple and financial services regulators have not found it easy to say what they mean by the superlative 'best' in the context of giving good financial advice. The Financial Services Act, implemented in 1988, ushered in a system designed to give investors increased protection. One of its requirements was that financial advisers should give 'best' advice to their clients. The reason why investors need such protection is because their advisers are not advisers at all but salesmen paid by commission. Independent financial advisers earn commission from sales of life office or investment house products - unless they are fee-charging advisers - while tied agents earn their commission from the single life company they represent. Best advice was meant to protect investors against being sold products which simply brought in the largest amount of commission for the 'adviser' at the expense of the needs of the client. The term does not appear in the Financial Services Act or in the Core Conduct of Business Rules issued by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator. Instead they refer to giving 'suitable' advice. Although giving a client best advice would seem simple defining it has been such a problem that the word 'best' was abandoned by Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for IFAs in February. Its Guidelines on Best Advice were replaced by guidelines called Giving Investment Advice. IFAs complained that in the world of packaged products there is no superlative, no 'best' product. The unit trust with the best performance today might be at the bottom of the tables next month. But equating best advice with best product has been at the heart of the problem of abuse, particularly with tied agents. Many have conveniently taken best advice to mean selling the most suitable product that the life company to which they are tied, has. No matter that this product might not have a good performance record. No matter that the life company might not have a suitable product in its range at all - the agent may sell the closest thing to it. It is worrying to think that regulators could have allowed this concept of best advice to go on for as long as it has. Examples of these abuses were provided by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation. This week Lautro issued a guide for sales agents spelling out their duty to recommend a product only if it is suitable to a client's circumstances. Lautro has found it easier to define what is suitable in the negative. Its list of examples of cases where suitable advice was not given makes depressing reading. In one case, a 21-year-old chef in the Royal Navy, who had life cover through his work, expressed a desire to accumulate savings. Without asking him when he wanted the savings, the agent sold him a whole-of-life policy. Another young man in temporary employment was sold a long-term savings plan even though he would be unlikely to maintain payments and had not indicated a desire to save for a long period. A couple with a young child wanted to save to pay for the child's education. They were sold a whole-of-life plan on the grounds that this could be used for education in the child's later life. The couple complained pointing out they wanted to fund the child's primary education fees. 'It was noted that there was a question of affordability even for the purpose of funding secondary education but considered in any event that the whole of life policy was not a reasonable solution for the intended needs,' said Lautro. In another case, a couple who had taken out a five-year interest-free loan wanted to be in a position to pay it off when it fell due. They were sold a 10-year savings policy as the most suitable product on the grounds that the life company did not have a five-year plan. In its guidelines, Lautro says that its Monitoring Committee 'does not regard suitability as synonymous with the closest match.' If the life office does not have a product suitable for the clients need, 'it should not, of course, be recommended to the investor.' By defining more narrowly the kind of products which can be recommended in certain circumstances, the Lautro guidelines are welcome but they also highlight worryingly widespread evidence of abuse. It will now be up to Lautro to enforce with vigour what it has overlooked for so long. Those most likely to sell the least suitable products are agents tied to companies which do not have a wide variety of products. Most people who go to a tied agent - eight out of the 10 largest building societies are tied agents - are unlikely to know whether the life company the agent represents has a wide or narrow product range. The assurance by Lautro that it will look 'particularly closely at queries about best advice which arise in the context of such members' provides scant comfort. Consumers should be aware of the risks of going to a tied agent for financial 'advice' and should continue to demand that regulators ensure the availability of the seemingly impossible - best advice.</p>

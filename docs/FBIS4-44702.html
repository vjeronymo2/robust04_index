			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger  (CDU) [Christian Democratic Union], speaking in Bonn on Tuesday,  the federal government intends to increase the funding for  genetic engineering research and to turn research results more  rapidly into practice.    Krueger said there are already signs that important  competitive positions of industrial companies could also change  over the next few years due to the results of genetic  engineering research. To ensure that Germany's advantages  achieved in basic research are now turned into products and  applications, Bonn intends to extend its funding.    As an important step in this direction, Krueger cited the  new  funding project, "Techniques for Deciphering and Using  Biological Structures," which will put genome research on an  efficient methodological basis. The Federal government intends  to provide 100 million German marks for this research program  over the next five years. The program, which takes an  interdisciplinary approach, will intensify biomedical research  and help to fight to date incurable diseases.    When presenting the new program, Krueger called for the  public to pay more attention to the "important and sensitive  area" of genetic engineering and genome research. It was  definitely unfortunate for the Federal Republic that, for  example, authorization procedures for the application of  research results in this field took six to eight years, but only  a few months in the U.S. This discrepancy should be removed.    For the Research Minister, genome research sets the basis  for  progress in bioengineering and medicine. In spite of all the  ground yet to be made up, genome research has also developed in  Germany over the past five years to become an innovative core  area of modern biology. At the center lay questions of  deciphering and using the biological structures present in  molecular form as genetic information in cells. With the aid of  genome research it would be possible to put medicine, industry  (particularly the pharmaceutical industry) and agriculture on a  "new scientific and technological basis."    The Research Minister made it clear that further development  of genome research in Germany would be accompanied by legal  framework conditions. One area requiring particular protection  is that of data on the genetic structure of individuals. Legal  regulations guaranteeing effective data protection and  preventing any misuse are of prime importance. There would be  no "see-through man," a concern often warned against in this  respect. Appropriate government bills to amend the Code of  Criminal Procedure or the skeleton law on employment protection  have already been prepared.    Experts at the German Internists' Congress have spoken in  favor of increasing the use of genetic engineering in medicine.  The cancer specialist, Volker Diehl, from Cologne stated in  Wiesbaden on Tuesday that numerous promising treatments  involving genetic engineering methods were about to be tested in  clinical tests. Genetic engineering therapy was often the last  possibility for helping incurably ill patients.    Medicine had a "missionary zeal" to advance, said Diehl.  However, science had made an error in not having made the goals  of genetic engineering sufficiently clear to the public at  large. The sole aim was to treat diseases with genetically  improved substances or cells. Dr. Hermann Heimpel from Ulm said  that genetic manipulations on human genetic material were  prohibited throughout the world and were taboo amongst  scientists, although it remained to be seen whether this  consensus would still exist in 20 years' time.</p>

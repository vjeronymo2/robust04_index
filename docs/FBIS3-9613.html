Joint units of the Seven-South operational zone are liberating  the hitherto occupied territories of the Teslic municipality and  linking up with the units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 3d  Corps in a triumphant operation. Hajrudin Reidzovic reports:    At the time of this report strategic front lines were pushed  forward by the capture of a piece of territory 6 km long and  1.5-2 km deep. Important facilities [objekti], which have  served as the most important strongholds of the Serb aggressors  since the beginning of the war, have been captured: Kuzno  Groblje PT 675, Vis Plane PT 677, hill 655, Tresnjev Panj and  [name indistinct], name] or hill 497. [sentence as heard] Husar  and Omerovo Guvno, notorious chetnik strongholds for the past 22  months, from which they have killed civilians, especially  children, are also about to fall.    At this moment our units are advancing relentlessly toward  the south and the southwest. This is the collapse of the  strategy of war criminal General Mladic. The number of dead  aggressor soldiers exceeds 50, and twice as many have been  injured and thus taken out of action. A substantial amount of  arms and ammunition and military equipment has been seized.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / CSFB struggles to tame its personalities: A case of banking turmoil The powerful personalities of its top executives have always been both one of the biggest strengths and one of the biggest weaknesses of CS First Boston, the New York-based investment banking group. Both Mr Archie Cox, appointed head of its First Boston subsidiary in the US three years ago, and Mr Hans-Joerg Rudloff, who turned its London-based Credit Suisse First Boston arm into one of the top houses in the international capital markets during the 1980s, had a high profile at their respective firms. Yet personality clashes and business rivalries, particularly between New York and London, have held back CS First Boston at a time when rivals like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have extended their reach into the international investment banking business. CS First Boston has made various attempts to overcome the divisiveness. Last month, for instance, it announced a reorganisation based on product lines rather than geographic regions. Mr Cox's sudden resignation on Tuesday, following Mr Rudloff's similarly abrupt departure in March, strengthens the impression that the group is trying to slough off its image as a collection of rival personal fiefdoms. The precise disagreement that sparked Mr Cox's resignation - officially for 'personal reasons' - remains unclear, but it was not hard to see the tensions building. The management reorganisation, begun earlier this year, had eaten into Mr Cox's control over First Boston, making him one among a small group of new senior managers, albeit the most powerful. He had been named worldwide head of equities and co-head of investment banking. Alongside him in the latter sat Mr David Mulford, a former US Treasury secretary and Mr Rudloff's successor in London. Two other rising stars were also grabbing at his coat-tails: Mr Bob Diamond and Mr Allen Wheat, joint heads of fixed income. The shake-up had coincided with a move by Mr Jack Hennessy, chief executive of CS First Boston Group and a former head of the US subsidiary, to assert greater control over the business. Insiders report that Mr Hennesey has taken a more prominent role since the upheaval began. He will take on Mr Cox's duties until a replacement is found. The relationship between Mr Cox and Mr Hennessy was reportedly a turbulent one. If the shake-up had increased the pressure on Mr Cox, then so had a near rebellion in New York over the disappointing level of 1992 bonuses. While competitors have been raking in record profits amid the biggest bull market the securities industry has seen, CS First Boston's earnings have proved disappointing. Last year, the group reported net income of Dollars 175m, down 19 per cent from the Dollars 215m earned in 1991. In the US markets, First Boston has been struggling to stem a decline in its share of the profitable securities underwriting business. Although First Boston's share of all corporate debt and equity underwritten in the US held steady at 9.6 per cent in the first half of this year, its share of investment grade bond issues - a traditional strength at the firm - fell from 9.2 per cent to 8 per cent, dropping the firm one place to sixth in the league table of Wall Street underwriters. The group has also been hampered by a poorly performing European operation. Analysts in London have estimated that earnings from CSFB's UK unit fell 20 per cent last year to a meagre Dollars 20m. The high cost of its move to new offices and heavy investment in Eastern Europe, together with a poor trading performance in the last part of 1992, accounted for the fall. London's decline led bonuses in New York to be pared back, prompting disatisfaction there and a number of senior defections among traders. This mirrored a similar wave of disaffection that swept through London three years ago, when poor results in New York meant that London-based executives were unable to reap the rewards of a bumper year. The shake-up at the top is far from over. CS First Boston's new crop of senior managers are as powerful as their predecessors, and it is as yet unclear which of them will rise to the top. The ambitious Mr Mulford was seen within the firm as a pretender to the top investment banking job even before Mr Cox's departure. Mr Wheat, meanwhile, has created the group's biggest profit earner in its derivatives unit, Credit Suisse Financial Products, and brushed off any suggestions that he was about to be sidelined by Mr Mulford's arrival. The question is who will replace Mr Cox in the New York job. According to one observer, Mr Hennessy is a 'hard-driving taskmaster' who is not easy to work with. It may be that someone other than him will be needed to run the US operation, possibly an outsider who does not have 'any IOUs at the firm'. The appointment will be the most important yet in a year of big change. Lex, Page 20</p>

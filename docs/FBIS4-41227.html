			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun (BUSINESS-TASS) -- Russian Central  Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko believes that one should not  expect an upsurge in inflation in Russia during the second  quarter of this year.    A rough analysis of the economic situation, he said today,  shows that the government guidelines on money supply for the  second quarter will be observed. According to available  information, over the first four months of this year, the  average monthly growth rate of the money supply was 10 percent  while growth in cash supply was 13 percent, which is within the  established targets.    Viktor Gerashchenko was giving a report on the results of  the  Russian Bank in 1993 and current tasks at a conference with  heads of the main territorial directorates (national banks).  The main aim of the conference, in which representatives of the  State Duma and of the staffs of the president and government of  the Russian Federation are also taking part, is to discover the  main problems in the work of the Central Bank system and to  define solutions to them.</p>

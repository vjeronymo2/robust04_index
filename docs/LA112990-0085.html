			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS' SANTA MONICA VIEW PREVAILS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: NEIGHBORS STOP AN ADELAIDE DRIVE REMODELING PROJECT THAT WOULD HAVE  BLOCKED THEIR VISTA.  </P> <P> After nearly four years, a group of homeowners can officially declare victory  in their fight to stop a neighbor's remodeling project that would have blocked  ocean and canyon views on scenic Adelaide Drive on the Santa Monica-Los Angeles  border.  </P> <P> A Santa Monica Superior Court judge earlier this month released a $55,000 bond  put up by the Adelaide Drive Homeowners Assn. in 1986, when it filed suit to  stop Peter Olmstead from remodeling his home at 345 Adelaide Drive. The group  was required to post the bond to cover damages in case it lost the suit.  </P> <P> The release of the money was the last legal step in the fight, which began Dec.  10, 1986.  </P> <P> Roger Jon Diamond, an attorney representing the homeowners, said the successful  fight was significant because if Olmstead had been allowed to enlarge his house  so as to block his neighbors' views, it may have opened the way for others to  do it.  </P> <P> The house is next to a public stairway of nearly 200 steps connecting Adelaide  Drive to Entrada Drive, and both the stairway and Adelaide Drive are used by  many joggers in the area because of the panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean and  Santa Monica Canyon.  </P> <P> "The big worry was that if one house went up above what is now considered one  of the most beautiful streets in Los Angeles -- not only for residents but for  visitors -- this scenic drive would have turned into an alley," Diamond said.  "Residents would have had to face the rear portions of people's houses, and it  would have ruined the street."  </P> <P> Olmstead received building permits from the city of Los Angeles on Oct. 1,  1986. Neighbors complained when they realized that he planned to build above  the street level, which they said was prohibited by a 1961 zoning ruling that  limited the height of some hillside houses to no more than five feet below  Adelaide Drive.  </P> <P> The frame of Olmstead's house is built into the hillside between Adelaide Drive  and Entrada Drive. Although most of the wood frame is below Adelaide Drive, a  steel girder rises about 20 feet above the street.  </P> <P> City officials issued a stop-work order on Oct. 21, 1986, but Olmstead ignored  it. Residents filed suit, and the courts issued a temporary restraining order  blocking construction until a city zoning adminstrator heard the case.  </P> <P> The hearing was held Dec. 16, 1986, and on Jan. 8, 1987, the administrator  ruled that the height limit was valid. Olmstead appealed the decision to the  city Board of Zoning Appeals, and the neighbors received a preliminary  injunction to prevent Olmstead from going forward with the remodeling during  his appeals, all of which he lost.  </P> <P> Olmstead, who could not be reached for comment, was also fighting a separate  lawsuit filed by a couple who live next-door to the house. Terry Sanders and  his wife, Freida Mock, had filed suit in August, 1986, charging Olmstead with  encroaching on a driveway easement they needed to get to their home.  </P> <P> In 1987, the court ruled in favor of Sanders and Mock. Olmstead appealed the  decision, but lost. Trial for damages was scheduled for October of this year,  but a settlement was reached in September.  </P> <P> As part of the settlement, Olmstead agreed to sell his unfinished house to his  neighbors. According to property records, the unfinished house sold for  $900,000.  </P> <P> "I feel great," said Sanders. "This is like recovering from an affliction."  </P> <P> Sanders said he plans to finish the house and sell it, but has agreed not to  build above street level.  </P></p>

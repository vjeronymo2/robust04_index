			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 04, BNS -- Participants in a picket in  front of Russia's naval headquarters in Tallinn today urged that  the country's delegation for talks with Russia must not go to  any political or moral concessions at the upcoming round of  talks, due to begin Tuesday [5 April].    The picketers addressed an appeal to the delegation.    The Estonian people have enough strength and patience to  wait  until the Russian army leaves Estonia. "Go back to your homeland  so you will at least be able to watch Ostankino," said Viktor  Niitsoo, head of the National Independence Party faction in the  Estonian parliament, referring to protests by Russians about  Estonia's decision to finish airing the broadcasts of the major  Russian TV station in Estonia.    Ulo Ojatalu, a former political prisoner, spoke about the  remaining Russian army units' alleged connections with organized  crime in Estonia. "Army in a foreign country turns into a den of  thieves," he said.    Pickets in protest against the presence of Russian troops in  Estonia are held in front of the Russian naval headquarters a  few hundred meters from the Estonian parliament and government  building each Monday. The Estonian National Independence Party  has called on people to continue the weekly pickets until the  last Russian soldier has left the country's soil.</p>

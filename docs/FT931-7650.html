			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Premier moves into SA dairy products PREMIER Group, one of South Africa's largest food companies, is to acquire a foothold in the country's dairy industry by paying about R150m (Dollars 48m) for a strategic stake in Bonnita Holdings, the Cape-based milk products group. Mr Peter Wrighton, Premier chairman, said it had been attracted by the quality of Bonnita's management, products and facilities. Dairy products was also an area of the food market where Premier was not represented. Bonnita processes approximately 25 per cent of South Africa's total milk production, operates the largest milk powder and cheese factories in southern Africa, and is responsible for one-third of the country's total gouda and cheddar cheese production. Bonnita Holdings is controlled by Cape Dairy Co-operative. It was formed in June 1992 to hold the entire share capital of Bonnita, the operating company, which is an amalgamation of a number of long-established dairy co-operatives in the eastern, southern and western Cape. The purpose of the restructuring was to provide a means of raising capital from outside the agricultural sector. Bonnita has experienced rapid growth in recent years that would have been curtailed without new finance. Negotiations have been concluded for Premier to inject R100m in new capital into Bonnita, thereby acquiring a 28.6 per cent stake. After a cash offer to existing members, Premier estimates it will hold 35 to 40 per cent of the restructured company, at a cost of about R150m. Premier intends to raise its stake in Bonnita, with a listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange planned within the next three years. Bonnita's annual sales are about R650m, while Premier's annual turnover is about R11bn.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: EMS requires change - but not burial Sir, the EMS certainly failed to provide a universal panacea for the accumulated economic mismanagement of some countries. This does not mean that the system or the more important aim of monetary union should be declared dead. Austria has been able effectively to fix the schilling to the D-Mark for decades, and the Netherlands for years. Some countries joined the EMS without the reforms and track record the unleashed capital markets demanded. The markets maintained their belief in the inability of governments to fight inflation. It is against the interests of these huge borrowers. It is only with monetary union that the curtain of exchange rates can be lifted and local competitiveness can show in local prices. Politicians would no longer be able to hide their mistakes behind brave speeches of evil speculators. The voter/consumer could see the effectiveness of government in the prices they have to pay week in, week out. It would be a great shame to let incompetence win again.

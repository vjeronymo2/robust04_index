			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert </F> Monde by correspondent Edner Jean in Port-au-Prince; date not  given; Monde and Jean speak in Creole; first paragraph  announcer-read introduction -- recorded]    [Text] Some new diplomatic steps are being taken to solve  the political crisis. Two Haitian deputies, including  legislators from the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary  Party of Haiti and from the socialist group contacted by the  Heritage Foundation, arrived in Washington on 19 June to meet  U.S. democratic and republican congressmen. Haitian Deputies  Duly Brutus and Datus Milcent will return to Port-au-Prince on  23 June. A Chamber of Deputies Office press release asks other  legislators not to travel abroad in the interest of reserving,  for the legislature, those decisions that only the legislature  can make. It should be noted that recently, legislators  denounced the authorities banning about 15 deputies from leaving  Port-au-Prince airport, which the Chamber Office has denied.  Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde explains:    [Monde] The Heritage Foundation invited me and Deputy Duly  Brutus to Washington for a five-day visit to improve their view  and assessment of the Haitian crisis. My departure alarmed some  deputies and politicians, so I stayed and sent Deputy Datus  Milcent in my place. The meetings began this morning. Meetings  with the Heritage Foundation and with democratic and republican  legislators have been fruitful.    [Jean] What is the Heritage Foundation?    [Monde] A very conservative group, along the lines of the  Center for Democracy. The Heritage Foundation is conservative  and oriented toward the Republicans, while the Center for  Democracy is oriented toward the Democrats. The Foundation has  a very solid U.S. foreign policy reputation. It supports a  better approach to the Haitian crisis.    [Jean] So you think that the Chamber of Deputies has been  represented fairly? Do you think that this delegation  represents all of the factions? It does not include any  National Front for Change and Democracy members.    [Monde] The Chamber sends delegations for different reasons.  The Chamber would normally send a delegation representing the  various factions. In this case, Deputies Frantz Robert Monde  and Duly Brutus received personal invitations. There is a big  difference. It would not have been diplomatic for me to receive  an invitation and then invite someone else. The deputies know  this for they encounter the same thing. If they invite one  deputy, another cannot tag along. That is not done.    [Jean] What do you expect from these negotiations? Do you  think they can influence the political juncture?    [Monde] They are meeting high-level people. They will meet  three former U.S. secretaries of state, people at Warren  Christopher's level. They will meet some current and former  U.S. congressmen. It is best to wait for the two deputies to  return. We will not find a solution on the streets. The two  deputies are competent and able. They are of good faith. They  want to solve the crisis and to find an honorable solution for  all the parties in the crisis. That is why they went. In  particular, they will defend against those Americans who think  they can intervene in Haiti.</p>

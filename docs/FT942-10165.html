			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Hata seeks restart of US trade talks Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's newly appointed prime minister, has told President Bill Clinton that the Tokyo government wants to resume the interrupted negotiations with the US on a framework agreement for their bilateral trade relationship. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said in an interview that Mr Hata had given his assurances when Mr Clinton telephoned on Monday to congratulate him on taking office. 'Mr Hata said we should seek ways to re-engage, and the president agreed,' Mr Kantor said. This came amid growing optimism in the Clinton administration that Japan is ready to re-start the talks, which broke down in February when Mr Morohiro Hosokawa, then the Japanese prime minister, met the US president in Washington. A senior administration official said he believed there was now 'a real possibility' of resuming preparatory talks with Japan before the meeting of Group of Seven government leaders at Naples in July. US officials believe Mr Clinton and Mr Hata will discuss some of the issues in Naples but they doubt substantive negotiations will be possible until after the summit. Mr Kantor emphasised that the US was being 'sensitive and careful' in its dealings with Japan and had already succeeded in opening Japanese markets to a variety of foreign products. However, he said, 'we will enforce our trade laws' if no agreement is reached by September 30, the date by which the US must, under recently revived Super 301 trade legislation, designate for possible sanctions the biggest barriers to US exports around the world. Mr Kantor conceded that, while the US would seek resolution of more disputes multilaterally after the Uruguay Round trade agreement comes into effect next year, 'a number' was not covered by the Gatt. In these areas, the US remained free to apply unilateral trade sanctions. He cited as an example cases where countries' failure to enforce national competition laws allowed anti-competitive practices to pose a barrier to foreign imports. Senior US officials partly attribute their renewed optimism about an agreement with Tokyo to Mr Hata's pragmatic attitude and to their belief that Japan is no longer opposing US demands as a matter of principle.</p>

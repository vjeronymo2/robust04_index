			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Agreement signalled on Ulster peace framework Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, are set to meet in the Irish Republic on Monday amid signs of a breakthrough in efforts to agree a joint document on the province's future. This emerged as the Irish government yesterday sought to play down its plans for the early release of IRA prisoners, announced on Monday, after an angry response from unionist politicians and warnings that they could derail the peace process. The meeting, expected to be informal, follows the postponement of talks due last week. It will come after a meeting between British and Irish officials this Friday to resume detailed work on the so-called framework document. Expectations are mounting that the document could be completed by mid-December. A meeting on it last week is understood to have resulted in progress on the issue of north-south relations, one of the sticking points that has impeded progress since the summer. There are also long-standing differences over constitutional issues, in particular Dublin's territorial claim over Northern Ireland enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution. A completion date next month would coincide with the first anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 1993. Downing Street said yesterday that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would launch an international investment conference in Belfast, two days before the anniversary. Irish officials said yesterday the release of IRA prisoners did not have an immediate bearing on the framework document. The issue is not controversial in Dublin and Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minister, and other government officials had signalled the prospect of an early release of IRA prisoners several times since the IRA ceasefire on August 31. The Irish government's move was attacked by the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, and some mainland British politicians. Mr Paisley claimed the British government had a secret agenda and was working on plans of its own for prisoner releases. Mr Andrew Hunter, leader of the Commons back-bench committee on Northern Ireland and Tory MP for Basingstoke, said: 'It is a very serious miscalculation on the part of Dublin, the sort of miscalculation which can undermine confidence in the peace process.' An IRA commander was jailed for 25 years yesterday. English-born Dr Feilim O'Hadhmaill, 36, a lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, was sentenced for spearheading an IRA bomb plot on mainland UK before the August ceasefire.

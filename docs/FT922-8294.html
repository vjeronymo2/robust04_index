			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Carbon tax faces Europe with steep cost rises YESTERDAY'S decision by the EC Commission to back a carbon tax could lead to big rises in the price of fuels most commonly used by Europe's industry. But it addresses what is widely seen as the most pressing environmental issue of the day: the growth in 'greenhouse gases' which threaten to change the world's climate through global warming. EC figures show that a Dollars 10 tax per barrel-of-oil-equivalent by 2000 would have the biggest impact on industry and power station operators. They would have to pay 58 per cent more for hard coal, 45 per cent more for heavy fuel oil and 34 per cent more for natural gas. The prices of petrol and diesel fuel would have to rise by 6 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. For households, the impact of the tax would be equivalent to a 16 per cent increase in light fuel oil prices, while natural gas prices would rise by 14 per cent. Although scientists disagree on the scale of the threat, many bodies, including the EC Commission, have adopted a 'no regrets' policy of curbing carbon emissions because of the other benefits it brings, such as energy conservation. The EC has also set itself the target of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. However a big attack on global carbon emissions will need the co-operation of the US which, as the chart shows, is the worst offender among the large industrial nations. The Bush administration has refused to set specific targets and deadlines, arguing that it is more important to draw up appropriate measures and follow them through. It also has doubts that the EC can meet the targets it has set itself. Last week, the US forced a compromise on a proposed treaty on global warming which is to be signed at next month's Earth Summit in Rio. This will not contain the binding commitments which were originally proposed. Instead, the developed countries will be required to draw up plans to curb emissions. Yesterday's resolution by the Commission also requires Japan to back the tax before it can be adopted. However Japan's record on emissions is among the best of the industrial countries, and so far, Tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for adding a tax to the already long list of regulatory measures it has taken to clean its air.</p>

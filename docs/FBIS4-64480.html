			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Extra Tax for Next Five Years"] </F>   [Text] According to Minister Friedrich Bohl (CDU)  [Christian-Democratic Union], the 7.5-percent solidarity  surcharge on income and corporate tax, to come into effect at  the beginning of 1995, is to last at least five years, and  probably even longer.    Bohl told SUEDWESTFUNK [Southwest Radio] yesterday that the  income generated by this surcharge had already been taken into  account in planned budget spending over the next five years, but  it looks as if the surcharge might have to be kept longer. Bohl  pointed out that between 135 and 140 billion marks have to be  paid to the new laender every year. "No one can say how much  longer we are going to live with the heritage of socialism,"  said Bohl. "Anyone who attempts to set a time limit to this is  merely deceiving others." But the government would also like to  abolish this surcharge as soon as possible, Bohl said.    FDP [Free Democratic Party] chairman Klaus Kinkel welcomed  the fact that the "CDU seems prepared to accept our demand that  the solidarity surcharge be reexamined after three years,"  something which Bohl had categorically denied on behalf of the  government. Kinkel added that this was not by any means a  condition for continued FDP cooperation with the CDU.    Acting SPD [Social Democratic Party] chairman Lafontaine  accused the chancellor of having approved the solidarity  surcharge without knowing how prices and incomes would develop  in future.</p>

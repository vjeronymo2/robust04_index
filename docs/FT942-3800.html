			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Apple Computer director resigns Apple Computer announced that Mr Paul Stern had resigned from its board of directors, just six months after joining, 'to avoid any perception of conflict of interest'. Mr Stern, a former chief executive of Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecoms group, is now a limited partner with Forstmann Little, a private investment firm. He is also a member of the board of directors of General Instruments, an electronics manufacturer active in the market for cable television set-top boxes. Apple plans to enter that market through an alliance, announced last month, with IBM and Scientific Atlantic, one of GI's main competitors.</p>

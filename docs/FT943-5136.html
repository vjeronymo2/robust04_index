			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / One strike and still out]: The US baseball dispute shows no sign of ending It was Labour Day yesterday in the US, as in 'Thou shalt not'. Professional baseball players were taking the injunction seriously. For the first time since this public holiday was established in the US a hundred years ago, there was no major league baseball to watch on the holiday that, by tradition, marks the end of summer. The players' strike was into week four. Hopes are fading that the deadlock between the players and the team owners might be broken in time for a truncated championship play-off at least. Mr Bud Selig, acting baseball commissioner - he is one of the team owners standing in for the last commissioner, who was fired for showing too much interest in the game and not enough in the owners' balance sheets - said this week that he would cancel the entire season if there were no movement by Friday. Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, has offered to mediate between the two sides, but he said yesterday that there was no point in mediating unless both sides want to negotiate. The owners insist that the players must agree to a salary cap. The players insist that there can be no serious talks until that has been dropped. On a Labour Day when New York City's more traditional trade unions could not muster enough support for their parade, the doggedness of the players' union, on its eighth strike in 23 years, stands in contrast to the weakness of the rest of the union movement. Today, only 11 per cent of the private sector US workforce is represented by a union, and only the public sector unions show anything like the tenacity of the professional games players. Sofa sports fans, who have had to content themselves with Little League baseball during the strike, now at least have the new American football season, which began on Sunday. In that game, the players agreed to a salary limit per team, and many have had to agree in the last few weeks to a pay cut.</p>

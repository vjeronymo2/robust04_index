			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Thailand may ban visit Thailand may cancel a visit next month by an Australian parliamentary delegation because of a claim by Mr Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, that Cambodia's Khmer Rouge rebels were getting unacceptable assistance from Thailand. 'It is most likely the visit will have to be cancelled,' a Thai foreign ministry official said. On Sunday, Mr Evans said he would urge the Thai government to stop its businessmen and soldiers supplying Khmer Rouge guerrillas. He was not accusing senior levels of the Thai government of directly helping the Cambodian guerrillas, he added.</p>

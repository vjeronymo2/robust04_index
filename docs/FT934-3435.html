			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / P&amp;O chief rejects cartel claims Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, the British transport and shipping group, yesterday hit back at allegations that a group of 15 shipping lines was abusing its dominant position on routes between Europe and north America. The European Commission yesterday lodged a formal statement of objections to the Trans-Atlantic Agreement, which was signed by 15 large shipowners last year to cut losses and fight over-capacity. Exporters have complained that the TAA is an illegal cartel which has limited capacity and forced them to pay more for exporting goods to the US. But Lord Sterling, speaking on behalf of TAA members, including P&amp;O, said yesterday that the agreement was essential to the health of the industry. 'The whole point is that there's no way we can give them (the exporters) the service they expect or want, without getting a realistic return on the capital investment employed,' Lord Sterling said. Lines involved in the TAA had lost a total of Dollars 650m (Pounds 436.2m) over the last four years, he said. Lord Sterling also denied that the Commission would be able to fine the TAA if the agreement was ruled illegal, because the shipping lines had kept Brussels fully informed of its existence. The lines believe the TAA is a shipping 'conference', which should be exempt from competition rules. But the Commission said yesterday that even though the TAA had been notified to the competition directorate, the Commission could impose fines if it decided the lines were abusing their dominant position in the market. Last year, the Commission levied heavy fines on two illegal cartels operating between Europe and west Africa, to the profound irritation of the shipowners involved. The Commission is now calling for negotiations with the shipowners and other interested parties in an attempt to amend the TAA so that it will be compatible with competition rules. Brussels officials say that although the TAA is aimed at alleviating over-capacity on the transatlantic routes, it has not led to real restructuring. The TAA is likely to have two to three months to respond to the allegations from Brussels. Mr Karel Van Miert, the commissioner responsible for competition laws, has already decided that exporters' complaints do not justify temporary measures against the TAA and Lord Sterling said yesterday that he believed the Commission would not need to take further action.</p>

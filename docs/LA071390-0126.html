			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BUSH TREE? Will the President take time to plant a tree for the local  environment? . . . Maybe, says Tom Larson, founder of the local Tree Society.  </P> <P> Bush's advance planners "tell me he wants to do it, but the location is up in  the air." . . . It won't be in Little Saigon. The White House considered a side  trip but says there's no time. Larson recommends the Cal State Fullerton  arboretum and says it ought to be a California live oak. "It's stately, and  it's California history." Dave Lesher and Mary Helen Berg  </P></p>

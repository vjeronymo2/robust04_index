			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK backs Virgin-Delta pact on transatlantic route Britain yesterday said it was ready to approve the transatlantic airline partnership between Virgin Atlantic Airways and Delta Air Lines to encourage greater competition and consumer choice on flights from London's Heathrow airport to the US market. A formal announcement from the department of transport is expected on Tuesday. Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said he was pressing Mr Federico Pena, his US counterpart, to approve a Virgin-Delta deal as soon as possible. During a meeting of European transport ministers at Annecy, which Mr Pena attended as an observer, Mr MacGregor said he was prepared to offer US airlines greater access to UK regional airports as well as London's Stanstead airport as part of a package on air transport liberalisation, including US approval of the Virgin-Delta deal. It was the first face to face meeting between the two transport secretaries since last September. In December, the US walked away from negotiations on liberalisation following the UK's refusal to open up immediately London's Heathrow airport to all US carriers. Instead, the UK has proposed a gradual approach to open skies between the two countries and has become increasingly frustrated at the US refusal to return to the negotiating table with constructive counter-proposals. Mr Pena is facing conflicting pressures from US airlines which have made his negotiating position difficult. American Airlines, one of the two largest US carriers, has been pressing Washington to block negotiations unless the UK opens up Heathrow, the world's largest airport, immediately. TWA has also opposed the Virgin-Delta partnership, while Delta this week urged the US government to approve the pact. The two companies' partnership includes a ticket code-sharing deal which would give the US airline access into Heathrow. Under the current aviation agreement only American Airlines and United Airlines can fly into Heathrow. Mr MacGregor said the Virgin-Delta partnership would increase competition on transatlantic routes from London. It would also provide more consumer choice without putting additional pressure on scarce landing slots at Heathrow since Delta would be buying about Pounds 100m-worth of seats a year on Virgin transatlantic flights to Heathrow. The UK has seen the partnership as a lever to reopen talks on a wider open-skies agreement with the US. Mr MacGregor said approval of a Virgin-Delta deal would demonstrate 'in a practical and constructive way that the UK was trying to make progress in its efforts to liberalise air services between the two countries.' Mr Pena was unable to give Mr MacGregor any assurances on the Virgin-Delta deal because the US administration was still receiving representations on the partnership from other US carriers.</p>

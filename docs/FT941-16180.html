			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World News in Brief: Duchess of Kent to become a Catholic The Duchess of Kent is to join the Roman Catholic Church - the first member of the British royal family to do so since legislation in 1688 and 1700. She is to be received into the Church at a private ceremony on Friday after years of close thought on the matter. The Archbishop of Canterbury Dr George Carey already knew of the Duchess's decision.</p>

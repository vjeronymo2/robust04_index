			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Ukraine's budget sets tight deficit target THE Ukrainian government yesterday unveiled a budget with an ambitious deficit target of just 2 per cent of gross national product this year in an attempt to meet stringent International Monetary Fund requirements. Mr Hryhori Piatachenko, the republic's finance minister, is trying to bring Ukraine's rising deficit under control by slashing social welfare spending and subsidies to enterprises and by raising taxes. The budget deficit overran its target by five times last year. The sight of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster demonstrating outside the parliament against a cut in the generous government aid to which they are entitled showed the IMF medicine will be a bitter pill for the Ukrainian public. But government officials were confident parliament would approve the budget this week. It calls for spending of Rbs458.4bn and revenue of Rbs441.3bn. Subsidies to state enterprises account for 25 per cent of expenditure. The army, numbering more than half a million and of growing political importance as tensions between Ukraine and Russia increase, is the next biggest cost, accounting for nearly 16 per cent of the budget. Social welfare takes 14.5 per cent, with an additional 10 per cent earmarked for cleaning up the effects of Chernobyl and compensating its victims. Value added tax will provide 52 per cent of the money raised by the state this year. A tax on enterprise revenues, which the Finance Ministry hopes to raise from its current level of 18 to 24 per cent, is to account for an extra 25.6 per cent of government revenue. The main criticism in parliament yesterday was that the budget was still too lenient with state enterprises. Mr Boris Markov, deputy chairman of the national bank, said: 'This is the best budget we have yet produced, but it is still necessary to create more powerful stimuli to develop a market economy.' He supported a proposal from parliament's budget commission to keep taxes down by reducing subsidies to state enterprises. 'The money should be left with the population. . . . The people can decide for themselves what to buy.' Ukrainian officials hope the budget will receive 'high marks' from the IMF. Ukraine must now obtain the Fund's approval for the republic's economic reform plan, which officials hope to achieve when a high-level IMF team comes to Kiev later this month. Spain is to grant Ukraine a Dollars 250m credit line to encourage trade between the two countries, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the foreign minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Madrid. He was speaking at Madrid airport en route to Russia and Ukraine for an official visit.</p>

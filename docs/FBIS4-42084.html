			<p>BFN     [Text] Bill Clinton has been interviewed on France Inter  and France Info. This morning we offer an excerpt of the  interview given by the U.S. President to Pascal Delannoy. The  whole interview will be broadcast next Wednesday [1 June] on our  station. On that day, Bill Clinton will fly to Europe, where he  will take part in the ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of  the landing in Normandy. This morning's excerpt concerns Bosnia  and the possible withdrawal of French troops. What is the  position of the U.S. President?    [Begin Clinton recording in English with superimposed French  translation] The question is: Do you stay, and would a peace  agreement be reached if you stayed? I think the French -- and  this is quite understandable -- do not want to stay and risk  being caught in crossfire. I say you could stay at least until  we have exhausted all possibilities of achieving peace, because  I think there is a chance for us to succeed, and a chance that  both sides will admit that they are unable to continue fighting  until the next century and must find a political solution. [end  recording]    Bill Clinton was translated by Pascal Delannoy who, on  behalf  of France Inter and France Info, went to Washington to interview  the U.S. President with three other journalists from  French-language radio stations -- the Belgian radio RTBF, the  French-language Swiss radio, and Radio Canada. The interview  will be broadcast in full next Wednesday on all these radio  stations.</p>

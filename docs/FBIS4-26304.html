			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Connie Law] </F>   [Text] A delay in the completion of the formalities for  some amendments to the Letter Patents and Royal Instructions has  made no impact on the validity of the laws passed since February  last year the Government said.    The SUNDAY MORNING POST reported yesterday that, as a result  of a clerical error in the Foreign Office, changes allowing John  Swaine to replace the Governor as President of the Legislative  Council [Legco] last year had not undergone the essential steps  of becoming law -- believed to include being signed by the Queen  -- when they were gazetted on February 18 and 19, 1993.  Constitutional experts said this suggested the gazettal was  invalid and would mean that Mr Swaine lacked the legal authority  to preside over Legco, raising doubts about the validity of the  125 laws passed since then.    The laws include the two Budgets, the first part of the  1994/95 electoral reforms, the Western Harbour Crossing  Ordinance and the Boundary and Election Commission Ordinance.    But a Government spokesman said yesterday the amendments  were  "approved by Her Majesty at the Privy Council meeting on  December 19, 1992". It is understood that the Queen approved  the amendments in draft form only.    The spokesman said: "Although the two sets of amendments  were published in the Hong Kong Gazette before the residual  formalities were completed, Her Majesty's Government was  satisfied that this would have no effect on the validity of any  acts by the Hong Kong Legislative Council."    A legal source said the issue was about "the legal meaning  of  an amendment being made to the Letters Patent and the Royal  Instructions".    The British Government's position was that it accepted the  Queen's signature on the draft as sufficient.    The source said it remained to be seen whether this was a  correct statement of the law and it was unacceptable for doubts  to linger over the effectiveness of amendments to the Letters  Patents.    Legislators are set to query officials of the Constitutional  Affairs Branch on the issue today.    United Democrat chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming said he wanted  a  clarification from the administration. He noted that anyone  with an interest in one of the 125 laws could challenge their  validity which would be disastrous.    His colleague Simon Ip Sik-on said they had to get the full  details first.    "I don't think it is a simple issue," he said, adding that  it  was unwise to rush to conclusions.</p>

In  talks with the British minister for overseas development, Lynda  Chalker, held today at State House in Dar es Salaam, President  Mwinyi said Tanzania wanted to assure the world that it was  capable of taking essential measures in tax collection by means  of firm steps and of controlling expenditure.    For her part, the British minister said she was encouraged  by  the measures taken by the government aimed at consolidating the  country's economy, but said the results of these decisions were  being awaited. She said the British Government wanted to extend  technical assistance to Tanzania in the major sectors of customs  duty and tax collection as an indication of cooperation, and to  support measures which the government was determined to  undertake.    Minister Chalker commended President Mwinyi and his  leadership for peacefully undertaking steps towards a multiparty  system. She said the international community was pleased with  the successes of Tanzania in the political field, and that it  was a good example, worthy of being emulated by other African  states.</p>

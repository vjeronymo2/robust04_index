			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria, 10 May (PL) -- The Cuban and South African  presidents, Fidel Castro and Nelson Mandela, respectively, will  meet in Pretoria tomorrow. It will be Mandela's first act  following the inaugural of the new South African Government.    The Cuban chief of state confirmed the news to the Cuban  journalists who are covering the official activities of  Mandela's investiture. Castro said "insofar as we work to  develop fraternal and affectionate ties between the two  peoples," there probably is no other nation that could have a  possible broad collaboration as South Africa and Cuba.</p>

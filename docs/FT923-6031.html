			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Man is charged over tunnel contract A MAN appeared at Bow Street magistrates court yesterday charged by the Serious Fraud Office with corruption in connection with a contract tender to provide pipes for the Channel tunnel, Raymond Hughes writes. Mr Thomas East, former procurement supervisor with H and G Engineering, a UK process engineering and management contractor, was remanded on conditional bail until September 23. He was ordered to be held in custody until he could produce sureties totalling Pounds 400,000. The charge against Mr East alleges that, on a day before June 25 1991, he corruptly agreed to accept a gift or consideration as an inducement or reward 'for doing an act or showing favour in relation to his principal's affairs, namely, providing information or assistance for the benefit of Hoesch Export AG in relation to a contract tender for pipes on the Channel Tunnel project'. H and G Engineering is part of the engineering and construction division of Enserch Corporation, a diversified energy, engineering and construction company. In January 1990 it was awarded a design contract worth about Pounds 2m by Transmanche Link for permanent tunnel pipework.</p>

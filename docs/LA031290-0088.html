			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> MAN CRITICALLY HURT IN SHOOTING AT LOT  </P> <P> A man was shot and seriously wounded Sunday in a crowded Target store parking  lot where he was involved in a fight with two assailants, police said.  </P> <P> The man, who had not been identified Sunday evening, underwent surgery at UCI  Medical Center in Orange for a gunshot wound in his chest and was in critical  condition, police said.  </P> <P> The attackers are still at large, Garden Grove Police Sgt. Dale Farley said.  </P> <P> The victim had been standing beside his car in Target's parking lot on  Brookhurst Street when he got in a fight with two other men, said Sgt. Michael  Walker. During the brawl, which took place about 2:30 p.m., one man shot him  once in the chest, Walker said.  </P> <P> Walker said that the victim then got into his car and started to drive toward  the parking lot exit. After driving about half a block, he lost control of the  vehicle, ran into a curb and slammed into a three-foot-high cinder-block wall,  which separates the lot from a sidewalk on Brookhurst Street.  </P> <P> The driver was transported by helicopter to UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> One 18-year-old witness, who declined to be identified, fearing reprisals from  area gangs, said he was in the lot when he heard the shot. He said he saw a  slender, long-haired man running away behind Target's lawn and garden  department.  </P> <P> Another 18-year-old witness, who gave his name only as "Chuy," said that he  heard one shot and saw the man running but at first "didn't think anything of  it."  </P> <P> "It sounded like (the victim) ran over something," Chuy said.  </P> <P> He said he started walking into the store because no one in the lot was in any  panic. "No one was screaming," he said. "No one was saying 'Someone's been  shot.' "  </P> <P> But then he saw that the victim's car had slammed into the wall.  </P> <P> Police are so far unsure whether the incident was gang-related, Farley said.  TED JOHNSON  </P></p>

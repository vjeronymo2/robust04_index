			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> FACTS SURFACE ABOUT U-BOAT THREAT TO U.S.  </P> <P> OPERATION DRUMBEAT The Dramatic True Story of Germany's First U-Boat Attacks  Along the American Coast in World War II by Michael Gannon Harper &amp; Row  $24.95, 490 pages  </P> <P> "Men, I have opened our Operation Order," says the intrepid young submarine  commander to his eager crew in Michael Gannon's "Operation Drumbeat." "We are  going against America. Our first destination is New York."  </P> <P> At such moments, "Operation Drumbeat" presents itself as a kind of  retro-techno-thriller, a World War II version of "The Hunt for Red October."  Like that best-selling novel, "Operation Drumbeat" is a ripping good yarn of  submarine warfare, espionage and geopolitics. The difference is that "Operation  Drumbeat" is not a novel -- it is a work of revisionist history that strips  away nearly 50 years of official propaganda and popular misconception about the  strategy and tactics of Nazi submarine warfare in World War II.  </P> <P> Michael Gannon reveals the truth about Nazi Germany's first submarine campaign  against the United States in the days and weeks after America finally entered  the war -- "a series of U-boat attacks on the United States so severe and  extensive, and so appallingly undefended," the author writes, "that . . . they  constituted an 'Atlantic Pearl Harbor.' " Five U-boats penetrated American  waters, sank 25 ships and sailed in triumph back to their bases in occupied  Europe.  </P> <P> Gannon tells the larger story of "Operation Drumbeat" by focusing on the  exploits of a single German submarine, the U-123, and its 28-year-old captain,  Reinhard Hardegen, on the first patrol by a Nazi submarine flotilla in the  coastal waters of North America. Supplied only with tourist brochures hastily  obtained from local libraries, the five U-boats in "Operation Drumbeat" managed  to reach within a few hundred yards of the American coast -- Hardegen gazed at  the Ferris wheel at Coney Island from the tower of his submarine while his crew  was treated to the local broadcast of an episode of "The Goldbergs."  </P> <P> According to Gannon, the scandal behind Operation Drumbeat is that British  intelligence, which had broken the German naval codes, was tracking the  progress of U-123 and the other submarines across the Atlantic: "Perhaps more  no more telling attack warning, in unmistakable language and numbers, had ever  come to the military forces of the United States," Gannon writes. But the U.S.  Navy did not manage to do anything about it. And, in any event, the author  suggests that the "dented shields and virgin swords" of American coastal  defense were unequal to the task of defending against Hardegen and what Gannon  is moved to call "a proud and daring war machine."  </P> <P> Gannon is a professor of history at the University of Florida -- and, more  important, a war buff -- and he has clearly engaged in long, meticulous and  fruitful research into original (and, in some cases, unexamined) sources. He  demonstrates a mastery of obscure points of military history and technology;  for instance, he writes with expertise and enthusiasm on the superiority of  Captain Hardegen's M IV/1T Carl Zeiss 7x50 binoculars over equivalent equipment  supplied to Allied naval officers.  </P> <P> Indeed, "Operation Drumbeat" is packed tight with facts that will come as a  surprise to most readers. Despite what we've seen in countless war movies, for  example, World War II-era submarines did not spend much time under water: The  U-boats ran and fought on the surface, where their diesel engines were able to  operate and their deck guns could be brought to bear, saving the battery-driven  electric motors for the rare occasions when they were forced to dive to avoid  attack.  </P> <P> Best of all is Gannon's narrative of submarine warfare as it was experienced by  the men of U-123 and the sailors who were their victims. Gannon is a  high-spirited story teller who is not afraid to make noises in print:  "Dacca-dacca-dacca-dacca" is how he renders the sound of a machine gun. And he  has a love of language that sometimes overwhelms his careful scholarship -- for  example, at the opening of Chapter 7, the author succumbs to a persistent  lyrical impulse in a paragraph so ornate I had to stop to read it twice.  </P> <P> More troubling is the fact that Gannon is so smitten by his subject that he  cannot resist lionizing Hardegen and the crew of the U-123. The author  concedes, rather too delicately, that the German Navy was "an armed force in  service to objective evil" -- but he insists that it is wrong "to paint a swath  of guilt across the name of every German who went to sea." Gannon concludes:  "It would miss the truth that most officers and ratings went to sea for Navy,  not for Nazi, reasons."  </P> <P> I am afraid this distinction is too subtle for me, and I found myself a little  horrified at how the author urges us, almost subliminally, to cheer the  successes of U-123 against Allied merchant ships and their crews. But it is  proof of Gannon's power as a writer that I came so close to joining him in  these unwholesome cheers.  </P></p>

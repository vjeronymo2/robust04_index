			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Jubilant Names hail 'justice and salvation' For Mr Michael Deeny, the chairman of the Gooda Walker Action group, yesterday's High Court verdict was a triumph of justice that 'represents salvation' for many distressed Lloyd's Names. For Mr Derek Ritchie, who stood to lose 'in excess of half a million pounds' on Gooda Walker syndicates, yesterday's judgment was, less grandiloquently, an 'enormous relief'. Mr Ritchie of West Sussex, who is semi-retired but still works as a chartered surveyor, professed himself 'absolutely delighted'. He was introduced to the world of the Lloyd's insurance market while playing golf in 1973. He is aware that many substantial points remain to be sorted out between plaintiffs and defendants before any compensation payments are made, but the verdict gave him hope that he might be able to avoid having to sell his home. 'There is a light at the end of the tunnel,' he said. Mr Ritchie said he would wait for a detailed appraisal of the 146-page judgment before making any decisions about his future. Other Names were similarly cautious about assuming that the action group would ever actually reclaim the Pounds 504m to which it estimates it is entitled. Mr Richard Platts, who owes Lloyd's a total of Pounds 800,000, with most of his debts incurred on Gooda Walker syndicates, said: 'It's an excellent victory - but it is the first step in the proceedings.' Mr Platts, 60, was a university academic teaching economics before taking early retirement in 1988. 'I taught economics but it does not have anything to do with insurance.' His link with the international insurance market was through friends and family - his grandfather and two uncles were Lloyd's Names. 'All my capital has gone. I am living in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, but I don't own a property. 'These are not like any other bills in life. You can't just pull out a cheque book. Imagine getting a polite little letter asking for Pounds 800,000. I just have a file for unpaid Lloyd's bills . . . You just have to get on with life - compartmentalise it. I don't know if I will ever wipe the slate clean. This is a start.' Mr Basil Payne, a Gooda Walker Name, was an insurance broker at Lloyd's for 40 years. He said that while the judgment was 'as good as I could have hoped for . . . in effect my working life will have been for nothing.' Mr Payne, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, said he had watched the news at noon on the television: 'I jumped about when I heard,' he said. He said that in spite of working at Lloyd's he felt that the institution was 'an absolute disgrace' and that those who were to blame for the situation would escape personal loss. Mr Paul Powis was a chartered accountant who worked with the insurance market before investigating the risks and becoming a Name himself. He now owes Pounds 40,000 on Gooda Walker business and Pounds 600,000 in total to Lloyd's. He was having a cup of coffee at home in rural Kent with his wife when he heard the news. 'I had been given a pretty good indication a few days earlier but I was elated. I am enormously pleased,' he said. The Gooda Walker court case has set new records for being both the biggest civil action ever brought before an English court and for winning the largest amount in damages. The award, estimated by the Names at Pounds 504m, is expected to far exceed the Pounds 172m paid last year by merchant bankers Samuel Montagu to the liquidators of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings.</p>

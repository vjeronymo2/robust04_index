			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic by </F> Dusko Petrovic in Krusevac on 23 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Petrovic] At the end of Prime Minister  Marjanovic's tour to the (Rasen) region, we asked him for an  exclusive statement for the "Dnevnik" program of Radio  Television Serbia. Mr. Prime Minister, it has been exactly four  months since the program for the economic recovery of the  country was implemented. What do you think of the results?    [Marjanovic] They are impressive. What happened over the  last four months? The exchange rate of the dinar has been  maintained and stabilized -- that is, the dinar is stable.  There is hardly any inflation; it has been reduced to zero.  Production has increased by almost 14 percent, prices have been  reduced, and they are now 0.6 lower in comparison with prices  before the implementation of the program, since January. The  further upward trend in production has been successful.  [sentence as heard] Therefore, these are the basic elements  that speak in favor of the fact that the implementation of the  program over the first four months has been very successful.    The most important thing is how the future implementation of  the program will proceed in the third and fourth quarters. I am  an optimist. Considering what I have seen during my visit to  the Krusevac basin, I am even more of an optimist.    [Petrovic] What are you impressions after what you have seen  and heard from the Krusevac economists?    [Marjanovic] The results that have been achieved over the  first four months of the implementation of this program are such  that they give us more optimism concerning the future  realization of this program. Why? First, because production in  general in the Krusevac region is on the increase. Second,  because the profit of the companies is also on the rise.  Salaries are increasing, prices are stable, and there are no  indications that would suggest that prices could go up.    The program that certain companies are applying now is such  that companies are finding ways of reprogramming their  production because of the sanctions since not all production  will work. Products have to have a market, they have to have  further solutions. [sentence as heard] The solution is not in  mere production while amassing stocks. Seeing these positive  tendencies in production in the Krusevac basin, I am really an  optimist, since the Krusevac basin is one of the most important  segments in the future development of the Serbian economy.</p>

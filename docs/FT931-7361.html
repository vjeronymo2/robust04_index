			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / 'Franc fort' takes toll on economy THE fragile state of the French economy was highlighted yesterday by news that gross domestic product fell 0.5 per cent in real terms in the final quarter of last year against the previous quarter, according to Insee, the state statistics institute. The figures, which reveal the first quarterly fall in GDP since the Gulf war, come at a sensitive time for France's socialist government, which is heading for defeat in next month's parliamentary elections. Until recently the French economy had escaped the problems elsewhere in Europe. The domestic market was sluggish throughout last year - due to the impact of high interest rates on consumer spending and industrial investment - but exports remained buoyant until the autumn. However, the French government's franc fort policy of defending the franc during the autumn currency crisis has made it difficult for French companies to compete in markets with weaker currencies, such as Italy and the UK. This problem was aggravated by the slowdown in Germany. A number of large French companies, including Michelin and Renault, have reported that exports came under pressure after the currency crisis. Insee estimated that exports fell by 1.4 per cent in the final three months of last year. As a result GDP growth in 1992 slipped to 1.6 per cent, according to Insee. This was an improvement on the 0.6 per cent increase in 1991, but below the government's original forecast of more than 2 per cent. The French economy is now at a critical stage. Activity is still affected by the strong franc and high interest rates, raising the risk of another real fall in GDP in the first quarter of this year and meaning that France would technically be in recession. 'The outlook is very uncertain,' said Mr Didier Maillard, chief economist at Paribas. 'We're forecasting static GDP for the first quarter and we don't expect to see a recovery until the second half of the year.'</p>

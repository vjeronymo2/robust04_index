			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / EC bid to close enlargement gap: Brussels working on formulas to allay applicants' doubts THE European Commission has started to produce what may prove workable solutions to bridge the political gap between the 12 and the four Nordic and Alpine countries seeking to join the EC, abating growing pessimism about plans for completing enlargement by 1995. The enlargement talks, begun in February with Austria, Sweden and Finland and two months later with Norway, must be completed by early spring at the latest to meet the January 1995 target. Yet the real differences between the EC and the applicants - all of which will put accession to a referendum among increasingly Euro-sceptical populations - remain to be resolved. But Brussels is now evolving formulas in sensitive areas such as environmental and health and safety standards, and agricultural and regional subsidies, which could herald a psychological breakthrough in what risked becoming a dead-end process. By the October 29 EC summit, substantial progress is expected on aligning health and safety and veterinary standards, indirect taxation, and making candidate countries' legislation compatible with the EC's single market. At an extra ministerial meeting in Brussels on November 9, talks will start on bringing the four - all except Norway formally neutral - into the Maastricht treaty's common foreign and security arrangements, and into co-operation on such issues as terrorism, drugs and immigration. Senior EC negotiators expect compromise packages on the environment and the single market by Christmas, and on agriculture and regional policy by the end of February. The environment - where all four applicants feel their deep green populations will reject entry if the EC is seen to be lowering what they consider higher standards in order to remove impediments to border-free trade - 'may prove to be decisive for the successful conclusion of the enlargement exercise', an internal Commission document says. Brussels is advocating a three-pronged approach: refusing to budge, for example on car emission standards, where standards are equivalent if different; offering transitional exemptions where the EC has decided to raise standards but not yet (for example on safety belts); and to deal with the most difficult issues (such as health labelling on products or certain pesticides) by granting transitional exemptions with a review after three years - by when applicants which had persuaded their electorates would be inside the EC. Entrants would have a full voice and vote in the review, a mechanism designed 'to keep everybody's aspirations alive' a senior Commission official told the FT. In the interim they would not be allowed to use border controls to keep EC products out. Border controls, abolished by the EC's single market, loom large in the crucial agriculture debate, where the four applicants want to continue subsidising farmers at between 25 per cent (Austria) and 100 per cent (Norway) above an already high EC average.</p>

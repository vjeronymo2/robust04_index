			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Managers 'block flexible working' Old-fashioned management culture is a far more significant obstacle to the introduction of flexible working time than employee resistance, says a survey of 1,000 personnel executives for Group 4, the security company, and the magazine Personnel Today. Nearly half the managers cited management culture as blocking flexible working and only 24 per cent employee resistance. Almost all respondents said they would maintain or increase the number of staff they employed under non-standard contracts. Increasing part-time working was favoured by 47 per cent of respondents, 46 per cent favoured flexible working, 43 per cent job-sharing, 30 per cent annualised hours and 26 per cent tele-commuting. The managers said the recession had made it easier to introduce flexible working, and 64 per cent said it had increased productivity.</p>

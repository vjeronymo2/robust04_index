			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Fears of over-supply are expected to weigh on Japanese government bond prices. In spite of underlying concern over fiscal expansion funded by government bonds, corporate borrowers continue to tap into the straight bond market for funds. This week, Tokyo Electric Power, the leading electric utility, is expected to launch a Y150bn domestic straight bond with a maturity of 20 years. Meanwhile, the increase in foreign borrowers on the samurai market is also causing anxiety among market participants. The Greek government last week issued Y110bn in samurai bonds, and Greek Telecom is planning to offer its first samurai issue next month. Without a clear indication of the state of economic recovery, traders expect the bond market to move within a narrow range this week. While the rise in consumer spending, due to the hot summer weather, and income tax cuts and supply worries continue to undermine confidence, the strong yen, the steady buying of bonds by Japanese institutional investors and expectations of a weak recovery are supporting the bond market. Life and non-life insurance companies in June were net buyers of bonds for the third consecutive month, and traders expect further buying by the institutions if yields rise back to 4.5 per cent.</p>

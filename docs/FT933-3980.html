			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ICD attacks rival firm's vote buy-up A SMALL marketing services company yesterday hit back at a rival which has bought the voting rights of 23 per cent of its equity, saying the deal breaches takeover panel rules. USM-quoted International Communications and Data, which expects to announce a pre-tax loss for the year to May 31 of Pounds 5m in the next two weeks following a reorganisation, said the investment was unwelcome. Its shares closed up 1 1/2 p at 13p yesterday. ICD said that an investor group led by PSB Group, a direct marketing company, had paid Pounds 100,000 for 2 per cent of ICD's equity at 5p a share and the voting rights for six months on a further 21 per cent of the equity. Of those shares, it has an option to buy for 14p each share representing 13 per cent of the equity. Mr David Cicurel, ICD's chairman, said: 'They have a lot of votes for very little money risk and I would jolly well hope they have the interests of all shareholders at heart.' PSB got its new interests from Mr Nigel Balcombe and Mr John Apthorp, a former ICD chairman and director.</p>

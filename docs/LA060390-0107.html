			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN PLANS MAJOR EXPANSION;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: THE UNIVERSITY BEGINS A $30-MILLION EFFORT TO ENLARGE ITS CAMPUS  AND JOIN THE RANKS OF THE CLAREMONT COLLEGES AND OTHER PREMIER PRIVATE SCHOOLS.  </P> <P> California Lutheran University, the only four-year college in Ventura County,  is launching a $30-million campaign to hoist the institution into the ranks of  such private-school powerhouses as Redlands University and the Claremont  Colleges.  </P> <P> During the next 10 years, university officials want to nearly double the size  of the campus by building a new creative-arts center, a physical education  complex, an educational technology center and residence halls on 180 vacant  acres north of the university in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Officials also plan to increase enrollment by 25%, to 2,000. And they seek to  boost minority enrollment -- now about 17% -- to about 25%. They hope that by  offering better salaries they will attract more nationally recognized faculty  members, offer more student scholarships and start a campus radio station.  </P> <P> "We're at the point now where we want to make California Lutheran University a  major institution in Southern California," said Karsten Lundring, an alumnus  who is a member of the university's fund-raising committee.  </P> <P> Officials and alumni of the relatively young university -- founded in 1959 --  will meet June 12 to outline ways of raising $30 million during the next four  years, the first part of a massive fund-raising effort, Lundring said.  </P> <P> He said most of the money is expected to come from alumni and corporate  donations. About half of the funds will be used for new buildings and capital  improvements. The remaining $15 million will be added to the university's  $5-million endowment, which generates income to pay for scholarships and  faculty salaries, officials said.  </P> <P> By contrast, Redlands has an endowment of $24 million and Pomona, a  103-year-old institution that is one of the Claremont Colleges, has $285  million.  </P> <P> Although alumni, community officials and educators have reacted favorably to  California Lutheran's expansion, a few traditionalists have expressed concerns.  </P> <P> "Some wonder how much emphasis will be placed on Lutheran enrollment," said  Mark Zanlandingham, an alumnus and former member of the university's Board of  Regents. "Can we still be a vital Christian institution and serve all  cross-sections of people? We're at a critical stage and we have to make some  hard decisions on what we want to be."  </P> <P> University President Jerry H. Miller said he believes that the university can  find a balance. Although the number of Lutheran students at the university is  about 40% and dropping, Christian values continue to be emphasized, Miller  said.  </P> <P> At the same time, the university is strengthening its reputation as a place  where local government and business can turn for advice and assistance, Miller  said.  </P> <P> Next year, California Lutheran business students will be working at the World  Trade Center in Oxnard. And educators will be meeting with officials at the new  Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley to coordinate history and government  programs. School officials are considering starting a presidential studies  program using the library's resources, Miller said.  </P> <P> The university also is trying to improve the quality of matriculating students.  Students wanting to attend the university this fall will have to have taken  more college preparatory classes, such as two years of a foreign language and  four years of English. Last year the grade point average of the typical  entering freshman was 3.1. Officials hope to raise that to 3.25.  </P> <P> Currently, about 80% of the students come from California, and about 22%  percent of those students are from Ventura County.  </P> <P> Next year, it will cost $9,450, an increase of about $900 annually, to attend  the school. (By comparison, it will cost nearly $13,000 to attend Redlands  University.)  </P> <P> Educators outside the community say they have been carefully watching the  changes at California Lutheran. One California State University administrator  said it is difficult to accomplish the goals California Lutheran has set.  </P> <P> "Any institution can achieve greatness if that's its goal and it has the  wherewithal to do it," said David Leveille, the director of institutional  relations for the Cal State system.  </P> <P> But Leveille added: "You need a broad base of support from your alumni and you  have to attract the best faculty." And most important, small universities must  be able to draw outstanding students away from the larger institutions, he  said.  </P> <P> Officials at California Lutheran believe the university can offer students  something that larger state schools cannot: more personal attention. The  average class size at California Lutheran is about 20, compared to 40 at Cal  State Northridge. Some classes at Cal State Northridge have more than 100  students.  </P> <P> "We're an institution where relationships are important," said Chris Munoz,  California Lutheran's vice president for enrollment.  </P> <P> But the small-university environment has drawbacks, said student Heather  McClure, a sociology major from Utah. Sometimes classes fill up quickly, and  the curriculum is limited, McClure said. For example there are no engineering  or architecture classes at California Lutheran.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons I came to this university is because it is small," McClure  said. "But sometimes it feels too small."  </P> <P> University officials say they are looking at ways of enlarging the curriculum  and adding more classes as part of the expansion, but admit they cannot offer  the variety that larger institutions can.  </P> <P> "That's the downside," Munoz said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he said: "Cal Lutheran aspires to achieve a level of prominence .  . . and quality" as a liberal arts institution.  </P> <P> California Lutheran was incorporated in the late 1950s by the Norwegian  immigrants who farmed the area. At first, few outside the church knew about the  institution, which was called California Lutheran College until graduate  programs were added in 1983.  </P> <P> Slowly, the institution gained a reputation as a good liberal arts university.  The graduate schools of business and education also became popular with many  Ventura County professionals.  </P> <P> In 1988, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked the university as one of the best  small comprehensive colleges in the country. The magazine ranked California  Lutheran 18th out of 167 American institutions with 1,500 to 2,500 students.  </P> <P> Miller, a theologian, attributed the rating to the quality of the university's  instructors, a low faculty-to-student ratio (1 to 15) and a "flagship" program  that promotes writing and verbal communication skills.  </P> <P> Through a $13-million fund-raising campaign in the 1980s, the university built  a new library and science center and started work on a new chapel.  </P> <P> Hoping that a successful sports program would play an important part in fund  raising, officials also switched the university's athletic division so it could  play ball with the prestigious Los Angeles-area private schools, something that  caused considerable controversy.  </P> <P> The change came after several losing seasons in National Collegiate Athletic  Assn. Division II, which includes Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Santa Clara  University. California Lutheran officials decided that the university was  outranked by the larger schools. As a result, officials suggested switching the  university into Division III, which includes Redlands University and the  Claremont Colleges, about a year and a half ago.  </P> <P> Most California Lutheran head coaches opposed the move. They said they did not  want to lose athletic scholarships, which are prohibited by Division III rules.  </P> <P> But university officials went ahead with the move and gave up the scholarships.  As a result, football coach Bob Shoup stepped down after last season.  </P> <P> Despite the university's expansion, behavior that might be acceptable at larger  institutions is still frowned upon.  </P> <P> "There are some people who would like to see this college exactly as it was 30  years ago," Zanlandingham said. For example, the college administration  recently canceled a one-hour program on safe sex after student posters  advertised it as National Outdoor Intercourse Day, an attention-getting device  that riled some conservative alumni and neighbors.  </P> <P> "We strongly support safe-sex awareness," Miller said. "But there are certain  lines that are crossed at times that are inappropriate."  </P> <P> Student body President Stacey Reuss said students support the university's  direction. "The changes are good," Reuss said.  </P> <P> Munoz added: "On one hand, it's a most exciting time for us. But on the other  hand, it is a taxing and draining time. Change and introspection always bring a  mixed bag of feelings and emotions."  </P></p>

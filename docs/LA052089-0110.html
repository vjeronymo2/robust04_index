			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAITING FOR THE STRIKE'S WINDFALL;  </P> <P> SOME STUDENTS MAY BE SHOPPING BUT MERCHANTS SAY SALES AREN'T UP.  </P> <P> In her spare time, 16-year-old Monae Holman usually hangs out with her buddies  -- buying clothes and snacking at malls. But as the Los Angeles teachers strike  reached week's end, Holman was at home with her mother, working the phone in  search of a summer job.  </P> <P> "A lot of kids are looking for jobs and are more concerned about grades than  shopping," said Holman, a junior at Hamilton High. "Most of my friends want to  come back to school."  </P> <P> Los Angeles merchants may have hoped that the teachers strike, by freeing  crowds of usually free-spending students, would bring them a windfall. But when  the week's receipts were tallied, many said sales were not appreciably up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Customers Up but Not Sales  </P> <P> For one thing, jobless students -- preoccupied with final grades and apparently  short of cash -- stayed close to school and home. Those who did venture during  school hours to such favorite after-school haunts as shopping malls, video-game  parlors and fast-food restaurants were keeping whatever money they had deep  down in their pockets.  </P> <P> "I'll serve a drink to one, and six kids will spend all day sipping it," said  Jeff Hoffman, manager of Cable Car Pizza in Eagle Rock Mall. The number of  customers is up about 15%, Hoffman said, but not sales.  </P> <P> Nor were the students flocking to the movies, said Mark McDonald, western  division manager for AMC Theaters, which has 19 locations in the greater Los  Angeles area. Matinees still drew their typical weekday audiences of "senior  citizens . . . and people playing hooky from work," he said. "There hasn't been  a big increase in business."  </P> <P> In short, many out-of-school visitors were just hanging out, creating more  anxiety than anticipation for mall operators.  </P> <P> "We have seen an influx of children," said Jonathan Alpert, general manager of  the Sherman Oaks Galleria. "But we are (mostly) concerned that they don't  loiter in the center because they aren't buying an awful lot."  </P> <P> Similarly, Fox Hills Mall was keeping a close watch on students rather than  rolling out any welcome mats. With more idle students on hand, officials  rearranged schedules to put more security guards on duty during weekday  afternoons when most of the young crowd began streaming in, said general  manager Joanne Brosi.  </P> <P> Notably lacking was the out-of-school teen's usual devil-may-care attitude, and  some mall visitors were even studying.  </P> <P> "I've seen a few of them come in here with their schoolbooks," said Hoffman of  Cable Car Pizza. "Some are even with their parents."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Beach Crowd Friday  </P> <P> Indeed, many parents seem to be keeping a close rein on their offspring during  the strike. Debora Morisette, who heads her own management consulting firm in  the San Fernando Valley, took time off to tutor her 9-year-old son, who  normally attends Noble Avenue Elementary School.  </P> <P> "He tells me I'm a great teacher," she said.  </P> <P> Other favorite student weekend hangouts, such as the beaches, also reported few  additional weekday visitors during the strike -- at least until Friday.  </P> <P> Along Ocean Front Walk bordering Venice Beach, where peddlers usually hawk  wares ranging from cheap T-shirts to sunglasses, sausages and lemonade, few  shoppers were visible. And cloudy skies and cool temperatures also kept the  beach crowd sparse for most of the week, lifeguards said.  </P> <P> But by Friday the temperature hovered around a sunny 65 degrees at Santa Monica  Pier, drawing what a lifeguard described as "a pretty good crowd."  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Bruce Keppel contributed to this report.  </P></p>

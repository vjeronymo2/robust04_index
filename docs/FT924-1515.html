			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC ministers strive to tie up farm reform package EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers were striving last night to tie up a package of 'loose-ends' from this year's reform of the common agricultural policy, combined with a series of measures which have to be in place for the internal market starting on January 1. The complex, end-of-year compromise package - which in parts reads like a letter to Santa Claus from ministers seeking presents for farmers unhappy about CAP reform and cuts being agreed under the Uruguay Round world trade reform - was last night the subject of intense bilateral negotiations between the member states, and the European Commission and current UK presidency of the EC. Decisions looked unlikely until today at the earliest, but two developments may inject some urgency into the farm ministers' habitually drawn-out horse-trading. According to senior commission officials, proposals on banana tariffs, the 'green currency' regime, and compensation to Spain and Portugal for giving up transitional protection they won for their farmers when they joined the EC in 1986, could be put to other ministers for decision if the farm council procrastinates further. The 12 meet today to finalise Single Market rules, and on Monday EC foreign ministers are due to meet. In this extreme case, the extensive list of unsettled national demands - seen by some agriculture ministers as a vital sop to farmers for accepting internal and internationally agreed cutbacks on price, output and exports - would be put aside and lose purchase on future negotiations. Second, the undertakings the EC agreed last month with the US within the farm trade chapter of the Uruguay Round were yesterday handed in to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. France had on Tuesday made a further attempt to hold up the Geneva negotiations to conclude the Uruguay Round, and its failure was underlined by delivery of these 'schedules'. The Uruguay Round talks in the 14 other trade sectors earmarked for liberalisation are now expected to gather momentum, locking in the farm deal. Moreover, senior EC officials say there is an emerging majority behind the EC-US farm trade deal. They say that more than half the 12 are willing to defend it, lest the EC be forced into further concessions by the other 95 signatories to the Gatt. Among the most problematic issues in dispute last night was bananas. A common regime on bananas is required to complete the single market. But Gatt also requires that the EC replaces blanket protection for banana growers in outlying community territories and former European colonies by tariffs. The commission originally wanted to put a quota on far cheaper Central American, or 'dollar' bananas, to protect these growers. The 'dollar' zone already supplies 60 per cent of the 3.4m tonnes of the fruit consumed in the EC, and too free a market would wipe out high-cost EC suppliers from the Canary Islands to the Caribbean. The compromise fixes a 1.9m tonnes annual quota for the Latin suppliers, with a 20 per cent tariff of Ecu100 per tonne. Above this quota - part of which they would have to share with EC suppliers - they would have to pay an Ecu700 (Pounds 560) tariff per tonne. The 12 were polarised last night between France, which wants the low tariff quota limited to 1.4m tonnes with an Ecu800 surcharge on each extra tonne, and Germany, the EC's main banana consumer, almost entirely from the dollar area, which was holding out for a 2.4m tonnes annual quota, with a maximum tariff of Ecu250 on additional imports.</p>

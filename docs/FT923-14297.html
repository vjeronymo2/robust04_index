			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine pushes energy reforms THE UK will use its presidency of the European Community to push for urgent liberalisation of Europe's energy market, Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, said yesterday. Speaking at the Financial Times conference on North Sea Oil and Gas - New Investment Challenges, Mr Heseltine said the segregated energy market was a 'major anomaly within the new Europe.' If the aim of a genuine single European market was to be achieved, he said, 'It is self-evident that nation states cannot simply pick and choose which single-market measures they are prepared to adopt.' He said the UK would urge: The removal of statutory monopolies across Europe, so that other players could enter the market. Greater transparency between production, transportation and supply, to eliminate cross-subsidies and allow new market entrants clearly to assess the challenges. Open access to pipeline and transmission infrastructures for new suppliers. Mr Heseltine warned that the segregated energy market led to significant disparities between energy prices in member countries. That might harm the competitiveness of industry in some countries, and that of Europe as a whole. He also warned that he expected to meet vigorous opposition from monopolistic elements in the European electricity and gas industry. Mr Heseltine said the UK government had struck the right balance between the risks of operators, and revenue to the exchequer, and the present regime was sufficiently responsive to changes in oil prices. Mr Ron Probert, managing director of gas supply and strategy at British Gas, warned the conference the deregulation of the UK gas market was an 'unprecedented industrial economic experiment on a massive scale', whose outcome was uncertain.</p>

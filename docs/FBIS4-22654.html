			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Vasylchenko, chief engineer and </F> director general of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, by DER  SPIEGEL; place and date not given: "I Am Not Afraid"]    [Text]    [DER SPIEGEL] Eight years after the Chernobyl catastrophe,  two of the four reactors are still in operation. When will you  switch the nuclear power plant off?    [Vasylchenko] I think that the excitement is not justified.  Chernobyl is working more reliably than all other nuclear power  plants in Ukraine.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) attests to numerous safety faults...    [Vasylchenko] ...only in a press statement that was not, as  promised, conveyed to us in advance. However, apart from the  known problems, the IAEA inspection team that visited us in  March did not ascertain any new faults in the basic design of  this reactor in its report.    [DER SPIEGEL] The inspectors are warning against difficult  working conditions.    [Vasylchenko] What is meant by that? I do not know any.    [DER SPIEGEL] Last year alone, 150 specialists left the  plant, many went to Russia. Your predecessor, a Russian,  abandoned his post under mysterious circumstances and  disappeared into a sanatorium.    [Vasylchenko] We replaced the persons who had left by  no-less qualified employees.    [DER SPIEGEL] Many experts doubt this. You depend on  Russia's spare part deliveries.    [Vasylchenko] This is no problem for the power plant. The  Russian enterprises would supply everything if only the money  were available for it.    [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have it.    [Vasylchenko] The safety standard is not lower than in other  reactors of the same type in Russia and it is even higher in  several respects. In no other reactor has so comprehensive work  been done to increase safety.    [DER SPIEGEL] Nevertheless, compared to other nuclear  reactor types, Chernobyl continues to be extremely dangerous.    [Vasylchenko] The United States and Germany can afford  higher safety standards, while Ukraine can only afford a lower  one. This was also laid down in the IAEA documents. If it were  switched off, my people would become even poorer.    [DER SPIEGEL] The fear of a new catastrophe is unfounded?    [Vasylchenko] Those who are alarmed only show that they are  not familiar enough with the matter. I worked in Chernobyl  before the accident, I have worked there after it from the first  day onward, and I am not afraid.    [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds very cynical; 2,500 of the workers  who were employed there after the melting of the core died; more  than 50,000 people have fallen ill. Now IAEA inspectors are  fearing a new catastrophe because the sarcophagus has cracks and  is in danger of collapsing.    [Vasylchenko] According to my assessment, the sarcophagus is  no less stable than at the time of its construction.    [DER SPIEGEL] Chernobyl covers only 7 percent of the  national power demand. Could Ukraine not do without Chernobyl  by savings, for example, the installation of counters in  apartments and a slight electricity price increase, which is  very cheap?    [Vasylchenko] If one talks of closing down Chernobyl, one  has to talk about closing down all RBMK reactors in Russia and  Lithuania. I myself would be very glad if further reactor  blocks were built in my city. They would probably be even safer.</p>

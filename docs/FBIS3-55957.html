			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry press service  reports: Despite suffering considerable losses in men and  material in recent days, Armenia's Army units are not giving up  their unsuccessful attempts to attack Azerbaijani territory.    The enemy launched several futile attacks against our  positions in Fizulinskiy and Terterskiy rayons through the day  on 10 January and the morning of 11 January. Our troops bravely  halted the attacks and inflicted crushing blows on the enemy.    According to information obtained from the occupied lands,  the Armenian troops are abandoning their positions in panic and  are fleeing toward Armenia. Clashes are taking place between  those fleeing in disarray and fighters coming from Armenia. It  appears that Armenia's military command has been left with no  choice but to institute punishment measures to prevent the mass  desertions.</p>

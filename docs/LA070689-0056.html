			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMUG, AGGRESSIVE IGNORANCE LIVES ON  </P> <P> Reading Ginger Bremberg's description of the homeless in Glendale as people  "who urinate on news racks and yell obscenities in the streets" (Glendale  Section, June 22) is an infuriating reminder that the Reagan legacy of smug and  aggressive ignorance in the face of society's problems lives on. It is shameful  and personally embarrassing to see that Glendale's once and future mayor is  shallow enough to believe anyone with any intelligence will buy the offensive  argument that the homeless are that way by choice. If she did more than drive  by them with her windows closed, she'd see how pathetically unenlightened her  statement is.  </P> <P> Or would she? She and the majority of the Glendale City Council seem pretty  content to absolve themselves of any responsibility, moral or otherwise, to the  homeless of their city. Their attitude that "someone ought to do something  about this, as long as it's not me" is self-defeating and insulting.  Personally, I wish we didn't have any homeless in Glendale too, but I'm aware  and logical enough to realize that since we do, simply shutting my door and  hoping someone else does something about them isn't the answer. It's time for  the City Council to roll down their windows and open their eyes.  </P> <P> CHARLES GRANT CRAIG  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'REFORMS' THAT AREN'T;  </P> <P> POLITICS: SOME PROPOSALS WOULD JUST MAKE CAMPAIGNS MORE BORING, WHEN AMERICANS  ARE BUSIER THAN EVER.  </P> <P> This campaign autumn is justifiably called a "silly season" for two reasons.  One is the traditional surfeit of posturing, distortion and outright lies by  candidates for office. The second reason, more evident than usual, is the  abundance of campaign reform ideas that are just plain dumb.  </P> <P> One would think, from the fevered cries of Common Cause and various members of  Congress, that our electoral system had hit new depths of corruption that no  sensible citizen could tolerate. Such gross exaggerations win headlines for  lobbyists and lawmakers but ignore the real reasons why steadily fewer people  bother to vote.  </P> <P> The simple fact is that citizens are busier and more distracted from politics  than at any previous time in the history of the republic. As two-paycheck  marriages become the norm, mom and dad have less time for the children and  perhaps none at all for politics. The same applies, double, to ever-increasing  single-parent households.  </P> <P> Of course, Americans in the past worked hard, but for our forebears politics  was often a raucous spectator sport. No more. Why bother with the droning of  candidates when cable television, professional sports and Nintendo are at hand?  The simple fact is that Americans have at their disposal more immediate  entertainment. Is it any wonder that politics seems less important,  particularly to the young, who wallow in electronic distraction?  </P> <P> Given this situation, proposals to restrict political commercials to a "talking  head" format or to ban the notorious 30-second spots would only reinforce mass  indifference. The solution to electronic politics is not to make it more  boring, though certainly that is what many prim reformers have in mind when  they ask for more "serious discussion of the issues."  </P> <P> Many reformers also claim that too much money is spent in election campaigns.  The recently passed Senate campaign reform bill operates on that premise by  establishing spending limits. But why, when electoral politics is already  crowded out by distractions, try to limit its ability to reach people through  the media? Unless candidates are granted big blocks of time to use as they  wish, less spending on TV will mean that even fewer voters will learn anything  about who is running and why.  </P> <P> Certainly some reforms are needed. Access to money for competing candidates  needs to be made more equal, and political consultants need to chastise  miscreants in their trade more severely. But keep the race lively and very much  on television, or voters will keep deserting the polls.  </P> <P> The elite interest groups and politicians dominating the debate on campaign  reform have forgotten the circumstances of the average voter. Unless campaigns  touch more people where they live -- by the television -- in a engaging way,  our polling booths will gather dust.  </P></p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BICC to form joint venture in China BICC, the cables and construction group, has signed a letter of intent with Shanghai Cable Works, one of China's leading cable manufacturers, to form an equity joint venture. Shanghai Cable produces a range of power, communication and specialist cables - including optical fibre cables - and achieved sales of about Pounds 70m n 1993. The letter of intent envisages that BICC will take 51 per cent of the equity in the new joint venture. This will be set up following a feasibility study which is expected to be completed by the end of May. In a separate move, Metrotect Industries, the pipeline protection products maker which went public in June 1993, is setting up a Chinese joint venture for the purpose of producing coal tar enamel, one of Metrotect's key products. Production will be used for anti-corrosion coatings in the fast-growing Chinese pipeline market. The Chinese partners are the Pipeline Bureau of Langfang, Hebei province, part of the China National Petroleum Corporation.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> Puppets are coming to the Manhattan Village Shopping Center this afternoon to  give children and their harried parents an entertaining respite from mall  madness.  </P> <P> Puppeteer Valerie Leonardi and her large cast of elves, assorted animals, an  orphan boy and a kindly piano teacher will perform free musical shows at 1 and  3 p.m. in the Center Court of the Manhattan Beach center, which is located at  Sepulveda Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue.  </P> <P> "Kids are so restless at this time. We want to give them a little diversion and  make it easier for Mom and Dad," said Margo Heltzel, mall marketing director.  </P> <P> Leonardi, a one-woman puppet show who operates all of the hand puppets and  creates the various voices, said her shows make moral points as well as  entertain. In "The Selfish Elf," one of Santa's helpers, who likes to keep  children's presents for himself, learns that the true joy of Christmas is in  giving. And in "Miss Julie's Christmas Surprise," a piano teacher adopts an  orphan boy after realizing that he is the best present of all. Leonardi says:  "I'm trying to put something (alongside) the materialism of buying presents."  </P> <P> But her first aim is to capture children's imaginations, and she fills the  shows with fast action. "It has to be fun. If it's not, the kids get up and  walk away," she said. At the end of each show, she comes from behind the stage  and talks to the children about puppetry "just to make sure the 3-year-olds  don't think the wolf is under their beds or that puppets can move on their  own."

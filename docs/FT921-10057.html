			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Route to offering Continental car prices to motorists in UK Sir, There is a simple measure which would, overnight, enable the British motorist to buy the car of his or her choice at the lowest prevailing Continental price. It is to change to driving on the right, in vehicles with the steering wheel on the left. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report mentions that the Wilson government reviewed this situation in 1966, and again in 1969. On both occasions, they decided that the change would cost the Treasury too much. The MMC seems to think that a policy decision by a government whose place in history is by no means certain and whose equivocal stance on membership of the European Community is a matter of record must stand for all time. Today, in the age (if it lasts) of the Consumer's Charter, can we not move to a policy which is consumer-driven rather than Treasury-driven - and make the obvious, overdue change to driving in cars which are inherently cheaper because they follow a common European standard?

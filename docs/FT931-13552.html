			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Rise in house sales reported HOUSE sales agreed in December jumped by more than 18 per cent compared with the corresponding month last year, according to a survey of 30 of the country's largest estate agency chains. The survey by the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agency provides the clearest evidence yet of a revival in sales which housebuilders say has continued during the first few weeks of this year. The agents, which handle about half of all UK house transactions, agreed more than 27,000 sales last month compared with just under 23,000 in December 1991. An agreed sale is only recorded if finance has been arranged, solicitors have been instructed and no chain is involved. It is the first time that agents' sales have been disclosed on this scale. Some of the December improvement is likely to be due to buyers reviving purchases which they had delayed or postponed during the autumn sterling crisis. The number of contracts exchanged during December, reflecting a sharp drop in sales agreed during September, fell to 20,400 last month compared with 24,400 in December 1991. Mr Peter Constable, chairman, says the rise in new sales 'indicates some increase in confidence although volumes remain low'. Estate agents and builders have been cautious about interpreting the recent rise in sales as the beginning of a more sustained recovery in the housing market. They warn that fears of rising unemployment together with the estimated 200,000 empty properties still on the market waiting to be sold may inhibit a recovery.</p>

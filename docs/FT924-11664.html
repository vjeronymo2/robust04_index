			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Finding the right profile - Sponsorship / Companies must target the right market FOR English Estates, going into arts sponsorship a decade ago was a simple business decision. Tony Fender, chief executive, had been impressed by the community projects of some local managers, and saw considerable scope. 'Our creed is to develop the valuable hearts of communities by industrial and commercial development where private developers will not venture,' said Ron Parsons, English Estates' sponsorship manager. 'But we believe that it isn't just by property development that you improve standards of living. Improving quality of life is just as important.' English Estates, based in Gateshead, in northern England, was founded in 1936 as the government's response to persistent unemployment in the north east. Over the years it has spread its interests to the rest of the UK as industrial changes have struck different communities. That has also been the pattern of its full-scale arts sponsorship. It began with support for Northern Sinfonia, the rapidly growing orchestra of the north east, and then the Royal Shakespeare Company's Newcastle season of five to six weeks. Five years ago it ventured out of the region to support the South Bank Centre's touring of the Arts Council paintings collection, 'Introducing With Pleasure', in which a series of celebrities - from footballer Pat Nevin to opera star Dame Janet Baker - picked their favourite pictures. The exhibition toured to Plymouth, Leeds, Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester. The idea was to take art into the communities where the company had capital projects, adding an extra dimension and putting into practice the theory of cultural regeneration. In urban areas it calls the programme 'creative partnerships', and it has won two of the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA) awards so far. 'English Estates has forged a path for sponsors in the north east to follow,' said Chris Pulleine of ABSA North. 'There's a strong element of the arts in its overall programme, and they have made an enormous difference in the region as a whole.' It was Tony Pender who founded the Sponsors' Club in the north east, a group of nine businesses to date which is already committed to arts sponsorship but which also puts money into a kitty to match the funding of first-time arts sponsors. Outside the region, the English Estates patronage has been varied. There has been the partnership with the Arts Council for the Young Conductors scheme, by which talented young musicians get a year's bursary to conduct with a leading orchestra. In the former naval dockyard at Chatham the company has built a housing estate. 'The local people never believed we could bring big companies there, so we've done it for them,' said Parsons. 'We had the LSO brass ensemble in July, and the RSC is going, too.' The latest venture is English Classics, a Pounds 100,000 programme in which four regional repertory theatres get to present a big production. The first has just finished at the West Yorkshire Playhouse where J B Priestley's When We Were Married was on for five weeks. Marlowe's Dr Faustus opens at the Nottingham Playhouse on November 5 for three weeks, followed by Ben Travers's Plunder at Liverpool Playhouse in February and Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband at Plymouth Theatre Royal in March. 'We realised the companies were falling between two stools,' said Parsons. 'They couldn't get the kind of support that national companies could attract, and the production costs were too great for local sponsors.' While the arts-saturated south east has been worst hit by the recession, the north east has so far been relatively unscathed after a bad battering eight years ago. So while English Estates is responding to the government's suggestion of selling some of its property portfolio to raise development capital, it is able to maintain its sponsorship, which has risen from Pounds 100,000 five years ago to almost Pounds 250,000, a plateau for the present. 'We need to be seen as an active part of the community in the north east, and there is a a great feeling for the artist in the region which has helped us establish sponsorship as a normal activity,' Parsons said. 'But we also need to do it in other parts of the UK now, and keep our profile up in London.'</p>

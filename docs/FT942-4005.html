			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: A flush of new London galleries - Some art dealers now consider the capital to be the greatest bazaar of the world At a time when art dealers are tending to give up their galleries in favour of dealing privately from home, or by appointment from an office, London is host to an unexpected flush of new galleries. Tuesday evening saw the leading Italian auctioneers Finarte SA open new London premises with an exhibition of 34 works by Giorgio de Chirico. Finarte, which has operations in Milan, Rome and Lugano, has acquired the Matthiesen building in Mason's Yard, off Duke Street, St James's. While Old Master dealer Patrick Matthiesen retains the building's two upper floors, Finarte takes on the street level gallery. It seems that the Italian auction house, which has 40-50 per cent of the local market but, like everyone else, had a poor year in 1993, has larger designs on the international art market. Alessandro Porro, whose grandfather founded the business in Milan in 1959, intends to use the London space to stage exhibitions of Italian art; to preview works of art in forthcoming Finarte auctions; and to begin trading in the Italian paintings that the firm has accumulated over the last 30 years - and buying more. The Finarte pictures range from 14th century Old Masters to modern masters like de Chirico. Betraying the Muse: De Chirico and the Surrealists, a slightly smaller version of a revealing polemical exhibition staged at the Paolo Balducci Gallery in New York last month, continues at 7/8 Mason's Yard, SW1, until July 8. A show of Italian views by Edward Lear is planned for October. On Wednesday, Oriental art dealer Nicholas Grindley opened the doors of his new gallery at 13 Old Burlington Street, W1. Grindley, a private dealer who acquired the long-established Barling of Mount Street in 1989 and fell victim to the recession two years ago, resurfaces in his original guise of Nicholas Grindley Ltd. His inaugural show of 16th-19th century Chinese furniture continues until June 17. And on Thursday, the well-known Milanese dealer Johnny Eskenazi celebrated his move to London and the opening of a gallery at 15 Old Bond Street. Eskenazi's Milan gallery, founded by father Victor in 1925, recently moved to smaller premises at Via Borgonuovo 5 where it will continue to deal in collector's rugs, textiles and Oriental art, to stage scholarly exhibitions, and to offer its textile conservation services. In London, the emphasis will be on the sculpture of the Buddhist world, ranging from Afghanistan to China. 'I have come to the point where I buy 100 per cent of my stock and sell most of my best things outside Italy,' explains Eskenazi. 'London is the great bazaar of the world. It has the largest concentration of knowledgeable and ethical dealers, museums, scholars, auction houses, framers, shippers, runners . . . It's the perfect machine. It is also a civilised and culturally stimulating city.' Perhaps most remarkable of all are the plans for the old Heim Gallery in Jermyn Street. Daniel Katz, one of the world's few serious European sculpture dealers, is opening that even rarer phenomenon: a substantial sculpture gallery that also embraces other works of art - maiolica, ivories, enamels, furniture - and Old Master paintings. It is appropriate that he should claim the Heim space. There, in the 1960s and '70s, Andrew Ciechanowiecki effectively re-introduced Baroque sculpture to the shopping lists of the American museums and encouraged a new generation of sculpture collectors. It was Katz, however, who by selling Giambologna's marble 'Bathsheba' to the Getty in 1982 for seven-figure sum, was responsible for partially redressing the huge imbalance between the market value of sculpture and painting. Nevertheless, he is one of the few dealers who probably derives as much pleasure selling something for Pounds 5,000 as a few million. For Katz, a private dealer for over 20 years, the gallery is a challenge and something of a mission. He hopes to communicate his passion for works of art to as wide an audience as possible. The gallery, scheduled to open in September, will also be used for loan exhibitions, seminars and concerts.</p>

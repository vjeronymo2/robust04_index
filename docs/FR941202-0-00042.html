			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters state that the cost impact does not take into account the expense of maintaining the temp tab indicators and the costs of troubleshooting false indications, and that, therefore, the total cost estimate for compliance with the AD should be increased to reflect these indirect costs. The FAA does not concur. The economic analysis reflects the direct cost of compliance with the requirements of the AD actions that the FAA has determined are necessary to correct an unsafe condition likely to exist on engines of this type design. The FAA has determined that adherence to the temp tab indicator installation instructions provided in PW SB No. 5944 will allow for reliable installation of the indicators. Once installed correctly, the temp tab indicators will provide warning of potentially catastrophic and costly abnormal engine conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the temp tab indicator part numbers should not be stated in the AD. The commenter maintains that the AD would then still be applicable for improved indicators with new part numbers when they are introduced. The FAA does not concur. A new revision to PW SB No. 5944 would be required to introduce new part numbers for new temp tab indicators, and the FAA may approve the new revision and installation of these new temp tab indicators as an alternative method of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that utilizing oil system condition monitoring and checks should allow for an increased temp tab indicator inspection interval. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that the temp tab indicators are the most effective indicator of No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment overtemperature conditions. However, other oil system checks, such as oil consumption monitoring, breather pressure, and oil pressure, can be used to assist in the troubleshooting process and help identify bearing compartment overtemperature conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter agrees with the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 2,432 PW JT8D&hyph;200 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,044 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1.5 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $85,883.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

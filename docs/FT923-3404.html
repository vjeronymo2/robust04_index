			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures dip again STERLING futures dipped again yesterday as a new wave of nervousness hit the market in the run up to next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Dealers continued to be worried about sterling's poor performance on the foreign exchanges and the possibility that the UK government will have to defend the currency with an interest rate rise. Few will have wanted to leave themselves exposed before the weekend, which brings fears of currency realignments and dramatic headlines in the Sunday press. Futures prices were affected by the slightest rumour. One clearing bank dealer said that the December contract lost 3 basis points after a news agency report suggested that the Bank of Spain was not averse to a devaluation of the peseta - a suggestion that could not be substantiated. Other dealers claimed that the December contract was being heavily sold by a single bank dealer, and that nobody in the market could work out what his strategy was. By the day's end, the December contract had closed 13 basis points down from its previous opening at 89.22. The September contract, which expires next week, closed 12 basis points below its opening level at 89.38. Both prices discount a 1/2 percentage point rise in base rates, at least. Rates in the sterling cash market remained firm, even though the Bank of England's Pounds 950m shortage was nearly all removed in the early round. Three-month money again closed at 10 1/2 per cent on the offered side, while the 1 month rate remained at 10 1/4 per cent. One dealer said that the clearing banks would be able to live with 1 month money up to  1/2 a per cent higher than base rates, as long the overnight rate remained soft. Yesterday, overnight money fell as low as 8 3/4 per cent following the Bank's early assistance. The Bank could come under pressure to raise base rates if the 1 month rate goes higher next week. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 408m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 51m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 5m of Band 4 Treasury bills and Pounds 90m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent and Pounds 353m for resale to the market at 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.25bn and there was late assistance of Pounds 100m.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Fraud team freezes hundreds of BT3 share applications INVESTIGATORS have frozen the allocation of British Telecom shares to several hundred individuals suspected of making illegal multiple applications in the recent BT3 offer. Fraud auditors at accountants Price Waterhouse are gathering more information from prospective shareholders to determine whether they had made more than one application each. Some of those identified have not made multiple applications or have done so as a result of honest mistakes, but others appear to have wilfully committed offences which could lead to fines or imprisonment, the auditors said. Investigators have traced multiple applicants through signs such as parents applying on behalf of large numbers of children, individuals giving a variant of the same name from different addresses, and apparently unconnected applications supported by cheques from the same person. The auditors' work has been based so far on manual inspection of tens of thousands of application forms in the offices of the banks handling the share offer. This will be supplemented by computer analysis once the database containing the amended BT share register has been delivered to Price Waterhouse. Mr Keith Tilson, a privatisation partner at the firm, is co-ordinating the fraud detection work. He said he felt instinctively that the proportion of fraudulent applications was lower than in previous public share offerings. He said this reflected factors including the smaller profits to be made on 'stagging' (selling the shares on immediately), than in earlier privatisations and the end of the 1980s boom. Others have been deterred by prosecutions and investigations against those who made multiple applications for previous offers, and by the fact that BT3 applicants were pre-registered, giving time to filter out false identities. Price Waterhouse does not expect to conclude its fraud audit until the end of the year, when evidence will be passed to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

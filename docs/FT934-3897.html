			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Euro-plug plan would be dangerous Sir, In your UK News 'Inventor scorns worries about cost of Euro-plug' (November 29) you quote the views of an individual called Mr Simon Hossack who, it appears, is in disagreement with the whole of the UK electrical industry and many truly independent organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The plain facts are: 1. The proposed harmonised standard is dangerously compatible with the British 13 amp system, which after nearly 50 years is now installed in virtually all buildings in the UK; a system which, incidentally, is widely recognised as probably the safest in the world. 2. British manufacturing industry would be severely disadvantaged by the adoption of the Euro proposal because, unlike the French, German, Spanish, Italians and so on, we would be faced with massive retooling and plant replacement costs. 3. The British consumer will face an astronomic bill for replacing all plugs and sockets and, in due course, wiring, or have a house full of adaptors for no reason and no benefit. My company is generally in favour of harmonisation of standards where a rational case exists for change - indeed, many of my colleagues who are technical experts in these matters are actively involved in numerous European and international committees pursuing worth-while product standard-ising. However, we will actively oppose harmonisation for its own sake, especially when lives and purses of British consumers can be proved to be at great risk and the employment of 20,000 UK citizens is in question.

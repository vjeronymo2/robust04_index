			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE MOVIES;  </P> <P> A WRAP-UP OF THE REST OF THE WEEK'S NEW AND NOTEWORTHY FILMS  </P> <P> John Hughes' "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (NBC, Sunday at 9 p.m.) offers a  tantalizing fantasy for adults, as well as kids: What if you could fool your  parents and teachers (or your boss) into thinking you were sick, earning  yourself a 24-hour free ride from the boredom and responsibilities of real  life? Unfortunately, Matthew Broderick, in the title role, is so smug and  invincible that he doesn't give us any chance to root for him.  </P> <P> "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" (ABC, Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a rollicking,  allegorical super-space opera directed by Leonard Nimoy with an irresistibly  sure touch.  </P> <P> "Cool Hand Luke," that solid but often antic 1967 prison film with Paul Newman  and an Oscar-winning George Kennedy, returns on KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Rick Schroder stars in the new TV movie "A Son's Promise" (ABC, Monday at 9  p.m.) as a small-town Southern teen-ager who promises his dying mother that he  will take care of his six younger brothers.  </P> <P> "Inside Moves" (KTLA, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a mild, overly theatrical  Saroyanesque tale in which all of life seems to be concentrated in one seedy  neighborhood saloon, whose habitues form a sort of extended family. John Savage  stars in the 1980 film.  </P> <P> The lively 1984 "Runaway" (CBS, Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a Michael Crichton  'science-fact" adventure, stars Tom Selleck and imagines the worst possible  kind of handgun, one that shoots microelectronic bullets that are all but  impossible to escape.  </P> <P> In 1975's "Drowning Pool" (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Paul Newman returns as  Harper, the tough detective that he first played in the 1966 film of the same  name, but this film is not nearly as engaging as the original.  </P> <P> John Huston's 1973 "The Mackintosh Man" (KCOP, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a  handsome, mellow spy thriller whose end unfortunately is almost as confusing as  its beginning. Paul Newman stars.  </P> <P> "Night of the Comet" (KTTV, Friday at 8 p.m.) is an amusing and imaginative  1984 doomsday sci-fi thriller that finds Catherine Mary Stewart gamely fighting  off zombies.  </P> <P> "Fatal Vision," the suspenseful 1984 film of Joe McGinniss' best-seller about a  Green Beret doctor (Gary Cole) convicted of killing his pregnant wife and two  children, airs on KCAL in two parts, Saturday and Sunday (March 11) at 8 p.m.  </P></p>

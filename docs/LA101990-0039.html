			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: 'EVERY DAY IS FOLLOWED BY ONE THAT'S EVEN  WORSE'  </P> <P> Great conflict often produces great art. Intimations of mortality evoking  intimations of morality, and all that stuff.  </P> <P> Regard: "The Aeneid." "Troilus and Criseyde." "Man's Fate." "V Letter and Other  Poems." "Francis the Talking Mule Joins the Navy."  </P> <P> To this canon now welcome "Saudi Marines Lament," provided by Mark Billing, 75,  a retired Marine captain living in Vista.  </P> <P> Billing says he's merely the vessel, not the author. He says he discovered the  10-quatrain poem of irregular meter and unruly rhyme while working as a  civilian in the Saudi oil fields in the 1970s.  </P> <P> "Saudi Marines Lament" is an elegy of heat, flies, strange customs and  unfulfilled longings. Sample verses:  </P> <P>  Somewhere in the Arabia Desert  </P> <P>  Where the sun is like a curse  </P> <P>  And every day is followed  </P> <P>  By one that's even worse.  </P> <P>  Somewhere near the Gulf of Persia  </P> <P>  Where a woman is never seen  </P> <P>  Where the skies are never cloudy  </P> <P>  And the grass is never green.  </P> <P>  Where the drinking water is colored  </P> <P>  Like the drainage from the sink  </P> <P>  And a man can't drown his sorrows  </P> <P>  'Cause there's not a beer to drink.  </P> <P>  Where the camels are all crummy  </P> <P>  And the donkeys slightly worse  </P> <P>  An' we really must be crazy  </P> <P>  When we start to writing verse.  </P> <P>  Billing caused "Saudi Marines Lament" to be published in the Camp Pendleton  newspaper. He wants the home front to appreciate the hardships the troops are  facing (See Literature as Morale Booster, "Henry V").  </P> <P> He retired in 1961 after 25 years in the Corps. He says he'd go to Saudi Arabia  in a flash, but he's a bit slowed up recently.  </P> <P> He survived Guadalcanal just fine, but competing on the senior tennis circuit  is playing havoc with his arthritis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unanswered Questions  </P> <P> It passed largely unnoticed Tuesday when a 33-year-old prostitute named Helena  Klarissa Mueller-Beilschmidt pleaded guilty in San Diego Municipal Court to  being an accessory to pandering.  </P> <P> But, if the case had gone to trial, it could have been big news.  </P> <P> Among the witnesses called by the prosecution: Richard T. Silberman, now at the  Metropolitan Correctional Center awaiting assignment to a full-time federal  pokey.  </P> <P> Prosecutors won't say what they wanted to ask Silberman about  Mueller-Beilschmidt, who reportedly once worked for Rolodex madam Karen  Wilkening.  </P> <P> Eugene Iredale, attorney for Mueller-Beilschmidt, insists his client does not  know Silberman except through news coverage:  </P> <P> "Helena has told me that she does not know the man and was not involved with  him. He has suffered enough."  </P> <P> Iredale says Silberman's name arose only when his client's boyfriend told  prosecutors a bunch of wild stories about an international ring of prostitutes,  in an effort to strike a bargain in an assault case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Biting Courtroom Scene  </P> <P> High and mighty.  </P> <P> * The courtroom for the Betty Broderick murder trial was dusted for fleas  Thursday.  </P> <P> The parasites keep biting the court reporter on the legs. It's a common problem  at the sagging courthouse in downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> * North County video stores are putting some slash-and-gore videos off limits  to customers under age 17.  </P> <P>  * Sheriff John Duffy, nearing retirement, was quoted here Wednesday about his  rules for job offers: No government work, no full-time work, no working with  the media.  </P> <P> Wise guys are now suggesting that those rules also guided Duffy's erratic  approach to being sheriff in recent years.  </P></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Romeo in Bristol THE BRISTOL Old Vic's Romeo and Juliet puts Renaissance Italy in a recreated Georgian Theatre and subjects it to a 20th-century interpretation. The result is a pacey, open performance of one of Shakespeare's most claustrophobic plays. For their first season at the Old Vic, director Andrew Hay and designer Mick Bearwish have followed the theatre's 1766 seating layout. This places some spectators to the sides and rear of the stage. This moves a lyrical play, already near the inwardness of Venus and Adonis and the Sonnets, towards closet drama: quiet, intimate and complex. The set and design are simple and integrated. Verona's brawling families are colour-coded by faction, the young bloods in vivid reds or yellows, their elders in mellowed autumnals. An arched courtyard and balcony give on to an open courtyard. The lighting is static, establishing either the bright 'public haunt of men' or the gloomy horrors of the Capulet monument. There are no props. Sword fights are effected by mime and a meticulously-timed soundtrack. The most distinctive aspect of the characterisation is the prominence which Hay rightly gives to the Nurse (Caroline Bliss) and Friar Lawrence (Dave Bond); the former is a gap-toothed West-Country woman who deserves Juliet's curse 'ancient damnation', and the latter is an unpredictable meddler. Hay presents them as consistent entities, and this helps explain Juliet's scepticism about them both. Romeo (Clarence Smith) starts 'in likeness of a sigh' and finds enough stamina in the part to turn 'drivelling love' into firm arguments when he meets resistance from Friar Lawrence. Juliet is superbly played by Geraldine Somerville; she controls the disparate emotions brought together in Juliet and made manifest by the plot. She is by turns bold, shy, feckless and deliberate. She speaks her soliloquies frankly; and the balcony scenes with Romeo are a tender and witty delight. Elsewhere, Nigel Betts is an ursine Montague and Stewart Porter an irascible Capulet. Between them, Simon Day plays both Tybalt and Paris. Suzanne Packer as Mercutio is all energy. This uncluttered production, along with the two recent RSC stagings (Terry Hands in 1989 and David Leveaux in 1991) witnesses the welcome view of Romeo and Juliet as a tense, pared-down drama which needs no trappings if the director trusts the author. Perhaps a new Shakespearean minimalism is afoot.</p>

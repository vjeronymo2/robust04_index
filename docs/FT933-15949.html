			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US smelters face energy cost rise THE HUGE government-owned electric utility that provides power to half of the US's Pacific north-west has proposed a power rate increase that could dent the region's faltering economy, and is expected to trim output at some of the area's ten big aluminum smelters. Rates for municipalities will go up an average of 15.7 per cent on October 1, but Mr Stuart Clarke, spokesman for the Bonneville Power Administration, said aluminium companies will see an increase of about 17 per cent. The BPA had earlier suggested the rise could be as high as 24 per cent. The agency said that a two-year drought had reduced power production at its big hydro-electric projects, cutting revenues and contributing to the rate increase. Growing demands on the utility to protect fish and wildlife in its vast operating regions had also taxed the agency's budget. The BPA delivers power to Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and several other western states. Ironically, the BPA said low aluminium prices contributed to the decision to hike power rates. The utility pegs the power rates it charges aluminium smelters to the world price of aluminum. With aluminium prices at historic lows, smelters have been receiving the cheapest power available from the BPA, reducing the agency's revenues. Analysts say the area's aluminum producers already pay 20 per cent more for power than competitors in other countries. Nine of the region's biggest smelters trimmed output by about 25 per cent in March, when the drought forced the BPA to reduce power delivery.</p>

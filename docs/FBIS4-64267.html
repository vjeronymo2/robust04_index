			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ludwig Greven: "Herzog on the Road to Victory"] </F>   [Text] It was meant to be an exciting election, an  unprecedented open race for the highest office in the state.  Yet, things seem to be clear now. Roman Herzog can get ready  to move to Berlin. After the Free Democratic Party [FDP]  promised to continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and after recent  statements from among FDP ranks, it is as good as certain that  the CDU candidate will be elected as successor to Federal  President Richard von Weizsaecker on 23 May. Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] candidate Johannes Rau has hardly any  hope. Even Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the North  Rhine-Westphalian FDP group, has recognized the signs of the  time. At his party's land congress he was reelected, but  punished with a humiliating score as a result of his open  sympathy for the SPD candidate. He announced that he would give  in to the FDP majority and, if necessary, even against his own  conviction, vote for the CDU man. So the chances for Herzog are  excellent.    In the Federal Assembly, which will elect the head of state  on 23 May in Berlin, the majority situation is obvious. The  CDU/CSU is by far the strongest group. Of the 1,324 delegates,  half of which will be nominated by the Bundestag and half by the  laender, the CDU and CSU alone can count on 619 votes, thus only  being 44 votes short of the absolute majority. The SPD has to  rely on the help of others. Even if Jens Reich, former GDR civil  rights activist, were to withdraw his candidacy after the  initial rounds of votes, and if all members of the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS] and the Alliance 90/Greens were then  to vote for Rau, the SPD would still have to be backed by a  majority of the FDP for the victory of its candidate. Yet, at  the moment very little speaks for this. After all, it has been  said that there is agreement within the FDP to strictly follow  the party's recommendation in the Federal Assembly. A split in  the party is not likely. Nobody in Bonn expects the FDP to vote  for Rau, thus risking a major dispute with the CDU in the  coalition only a few months before the Bundestag election,  considering its intention to continue to stay in power after 16  October in Bonn along with the CDU/CSU. After all, the majority  of the 111 FDP members in the Federal Assembly, 78, come from  the Bundestag group, where the atmosphere is clearly in favor of  the CDU candidate.    So Herzog is going to make it. What is also clear is that  the FDP will do everything to prove how independent and  indispensable it is. "The FDP decides on who will become  federal president -- nobody else," was the slogan Hermann Otto  Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag group, proclaimed with  self-assurance: "The FDP is once more in its favorite role of  being able to tip the scales." This is why the final decision  should not be made before the individual ballots.    Apart from the support for Herzog, the FDP parliamentarians  will discuss a second alternative, which is considered by FDP  Secretary General Werner Hoyer as "absolutely plausible": The  FDP's own candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher would not only run  in the first two ballots, which require an absolute majority,  but also in the decisive third round, in which a simple majority  will suffice. Even then, the FDP would indirectly support the  CDU/CSU without having to openly back the candidate that does  not have a great popular appeal: The SPD would then lack the  necessary votes; the CDU/CSU could ensure the victory of its man  with its relative majority -- peace in the coalition would be  saved; and the FDP could celebrate itself as an independent,  decisive force.    However, there are still some imponderabilities. Within the  CDU/CSU support for Herzog is not quite that undivided. There  are reservations among deputies from eastern Germany against the  conservative candidate from the west. Saxon Environment  Minister Arnold Vaatz would rather vote for eastern contender  Reich. Yet the FDP has made its behavior dependent on the  solidarity of the CDU/CSU. Things might become unpleasant if  Republikaner Chairman Schoenhuber were to commit his partisans  to Herzog. Should Herzog then come off with only a narrow lead,  he would have to step down because he said he would not be made  president with the decisive votes of the Republikaner.    The Social Democrats might also thwart the CDU's plans. If,  after the first two ballots, they were to decide to withdraw the  candidacy of Rau in favor of the highly appreciated  social-liberal Hamm-Bruecher, the FDP would be maneuvered into a  most embarrassing situation. If it were then still to vote in  favor of Herzog, it would let down its own candidate. Yet, if  it were to stick to Hamm-Bruecher, the FRG would get its first  female president -- and the sensation would be perfect.</p>

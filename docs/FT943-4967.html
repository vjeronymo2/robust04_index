			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cash call from Asian consortium Bangkok Expressway, the construction consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan and financed by Thai and foreign banks, is to be floated on the Thai stock market. The company, which is building an elevated motorway for Bangkok, plans to raise about Bt3.4bn (Dollars 136m) by floating 129m new shares, or 25 per cent of the company. This suggests the initial public offer (IPO) price will be around Bt26 per share. The company has projected return on equity of 16 per cent a year. The IPO will put the shares on a prospective price/earnings ratio of around 35. Total earnings at the company are forecast to rise from Bt816m in 1993 to Bt2.75bn this year. The operating cash flow is forecast to grow strongly after this year, when a Bt15.7bn loan repayment is made. Net income is forecast to rise from Bt34m in 1993 to Bt327m this year. Solid increases in income should be supported when a second arm to the motorway opens in the next few months.</p>

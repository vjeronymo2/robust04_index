Major General Andrej Sabol was appointed Defense  Ministry state secretary and Colonel Rudolf Zidek was appointed  head of the Defense Ministry Office. In his speech, the prime  minister emphasized that the Slovak Republic requires  high-quality and advanced Army and patriotic soldiers, who will  fulfill their tasks regardless of which political grouping is in  power. In expressing his appreciation, Minister Kanis said,  among other things, that, in the coming weeks, it will be  necessary to prepare a thorough analysis of the Slovak Army's  first year. It is essential to improve the style and method of  managerial work at the Defense Ministry and the Slovak Army  Command "because the current system in many ways still resembles  the old bipolar system," emphasized Kanis.</p>

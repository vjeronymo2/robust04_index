			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTOYA SAYS UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT SET HIM UP  </P> <P> State Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, continuing to defend himself on corruption  charges, contended Thursday he was set up by a federal undercover agent who  gave him a $3,000 check at a videotaped breakfast meeting.  </P> <P> Undergoing a second day of grueling cross-examination, Montoya also testified  that he proposed the $3,000 figure in order "to put a little bit of a  limitation" on the amount he would receive from the undercover agent, who was  posing as a Southern businessman.  </P> <P> And the Whittier Democrat denied ever seeing a "schedule of fees" sent by his  office to then-sports agent Michael Trope spelling out how he could pay the  senator $10,000 in campaign contributions and honorariums.  </P> <P> Montoya acknowledged signing a letter to Trope that referred to the payment  schedule but said, "I've indicated that this schedule of fees is not anything I  saw or that I approved."  </P> <P> Montoya is on trial in federal court on 10 counts of extortion, racketeering  and money laundering arising from a four-year investigation of political  corruption in the state Capitol. Until now, the defense has not contended that  the senator was entrapped by federal agents, who set up a phony shrimp company  and pushed legislation to benefit it. But Montoya, adopting a combative tone  Thursday, suggested that the federal government had unfairly snared him.  </P> <P> In sharp questioning, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Panneton called on the senator  to explain crucial parts of the videotaped conversation in which Montoya  received the $3,000 check from undercover agent George Murray.  </P> <P> Moments after handing Montoya the check, according to the videotape, Murray  told the senator that his action in getting the bogus FBI legislation out of a  Senate committee was "worth about 10 times" the $3,000 payment.  </P> <P> "Isn't it clear you were getting paid for your vote?" Panneton asked Montoya.  </P> <P> The senator replied: "What is clear to me is this is very much a part of the  set-up. . . ."  </P> <P> In an earlier tape-recorded meeting with undercover informant John Shahabian,  Montoya had discussed the amount of the honorarium he would receive. After  learning that other lawmakers were getting payments of $5,000 and $7,500,  Montoya said, "I wouldn't want to do more than three," adding, "You don't want  to appear ridiculous."  </P> <P> Panneton asked Montoya whether he had picked a lesser amount in order to avoid  media scrutiny.  </P> <P> "I was trying to put a little bit of a limitation on what he was saying,"  Montoya said.  </P> <P> Panneton also pounded away at Montoya on other bills involved in the senator's  alleged extortion efforts, including measures that would have affected both the  National Football League Players' Assn. and Trope.  </P> <P> In 1985, players' representative David Meggysey sent the senator a letter  thanking him for siding with the union. Montoya acknowledged that he wrote a  notation to one of his aides on the letter, saying, "Bug me. I still have to  get them rolling." Prosecutors contend this was a reference to raising money,  but Montoya denied that.  </P> <P> Prosecutors charge that Montoya turned his back on the union after it refused  to contribute and that the senator began promoting legislation to benefit  Trope, an adversary of the association. Montoya acknowledged Trope was angered  by the schedule of fees but eventually gave him a total of $8,100 in campaign  contributions.  </P> <P> Montoya repeatedly denied that he pressured Trope to give him the money.  "Absolutely not. He was a friend," the senator said.  </P> <P> Montoya acknowledged giving Trope a book with the handwritten inscription,  "Mike, when can we do business together again?" But he said the message was a  reference to sports videos Trope was producing, not campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Montoya and his attorneys have attempted to portray him as a reformer who  co-authored Proposition 73, a campaign finance measure approved by voters in  1988.  </P> <P> But that contention was undercut Thursday when Montoya acknowledged that there  were "loopholes" in the measure and that he staged a "last-chance" fund-raiser  for his campaign only weeks before the ballot measure was passed. He  acknowledged that at least one special-interest group, the California Medical  Assn., had provided financial backing for it.  </P> <P> Proposition 73, sponsored by Montoya and two other legislators, was a rival  measure to Proposition 68, designed to clean up corruption in politics by  providing for public financing of campaigns.  </P> <P> Montoya refused to concede specific flaws in his initiative, including a  contention by Panneton that a purported $1,000 limit on honorariums can easily  be circumvented.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure there is any initiative you can put together where you can't find  loopholes," Montoya told the jury.  </P></p>

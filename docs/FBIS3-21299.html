			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hayim Fiqarsh] </F>   [Text] With each side seeking to impose its position,  management and the employees of Israeli Aircraft Industries  [IAI] have quarreled for months on end over how to carry out the  recovery plan. Rounds of talks between the sides have been  accompanied by angry demonstrations by workers and, at times, by  outbreaks of violence in which employees vented their rage on  factory machinery and management offices. The moment of truth,  however, has arrived--and IAI's recovery plan, which was  submitted yesterday for the government's approval, is going into  effect.    In practical terms, the plan means dismissal of 2,900  workers  at a cost to the government of more than $400 million. The  workers' committees, as well as the Histadrut, have now given  their consent to the plan, a "verdict" that some of those  subject to dismissal do not accept. Not in vain did candidates  for layoffs recently hold a number of demonstrations against  members of the committees, but it seems that everyone has become  reconciled to the need for dismissals to give IAI's recovery  plan a chance.    The recovery plan was hammered out jointly by the  government,  IAI's management, the Histadrut, and the workers themselves. It  went into effect with the Histadrut's signing of the agreement  last weekend. The key clauses of the plan provide for worker  layoffs with limited compensation to be paid by Mavtakhim, the  Histadrut's insurance company.    As if the sweeping dismissals were not enough, the workers  have stated their willingness to take pay cuts of 15 percent by  giving up the salary raises and cost of living increases that  every Israeli employee is to receive this year. Another clause,  which is considered essential to the recovery plan, grants IAI's  management greater authority to transfer workers according to  production needs among the various factories as they arise. This  employee transfer clause was one of the main sticking points  during the contacts and negotiations between the sides.    People are now wondering whether the plan will save Israel's  aircraft industry or give it some breathing room in the  continuing world crisis that is putting red ink on the account  books of most of the world's aircraft corporations. The threat  presented by the crisis still hangs over IAI's skies. The  industry's good times lie in the past; those days, when more  than 24,000 workers were employed, will not return. The workers,  too, know that; that is why they are willing to give up some of  their take-home pay. More than a few of the workers who were  destined to receive pink slips have already left the country,  many of settling in South Africa or America's Silicon Valley.  Others, who still have years to go before they can leave on  pension, have taken early retirement on the promise of modest  compensation. Yet there exists among the workers laid-off a  segment that does not want to accept the judgment; it is a good  bet that the "workshop quiet" will be shattered. As a general  matter, however, the recovery plan for this major industry is  becoming a concrete fact on the hope that IAI will learn to get  back on its feet, and even open its doors to new markets, or  adopt modern work techniques with new market shares both here  and abroad.    The success of IAI's recovery plan is of major importance  for  other Israeli businesses, including the military industry, that  have sunk into crisis. As the upheaval in them persists, more  than a few of those leading the fight for employees seek to rely  on facets of IAI's recovery plan. Even so, the government has  poured in more than 800 million shekels in recent months, to  make possible the dismissals of close to 2,500 workers even  within such a framework. Now it is arranging for the release of  still another 300 workers and even the shutdown of an additional  two or three "unprofitable" installations.    There is concern at military plants, too, over an unclear  future. In the past, Israel could take real pride in its  military factories, which employed more than 18,000 workers;  today, that number is estimated at just 5,000. The military  recovery plan also included testing production lines for the  civilian market as well as shifting plants in the center of the  country to regions of the Negev. That idea made sense, because  the explosions occurring in those installations endangered  residential areas; the compensation that had to be paid for  damages to homes and businesses could have sped up the  transition to the Negev. Finance Minister Avraham "Beiga" Shohat  now insists that these plants must not be moved because the  costs involved amount to more than 300 million shekels.    Overall, production cutbacks in military plants are placing  their economic future in doubt. A business such as Rafa'el,  which is in a crisis, also raises grave concerns regarding  Israel's future security because of further reductions in arms  production. It looks like the government will not be able to  evade this problem; it will soon have to give its attention to  the future of these installations, perhaps on the basis of IAI's  recovery plan.</p>

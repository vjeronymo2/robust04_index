			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: John Tams declines to Pounds 1.45m John Tams Group, the USM-quoted china and earthenware manufacturer, reported lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.45m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 1.71m, on turnover up 12 per cent from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 25.7m. The company blamed pressure on margins at Duchess and an operating loss at Royal Grafton. Changes to the design of the Grafton range are being made as well as to its coffee mugs in an effort to regain market share. The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 213,000 (Pounds 359,000). Gearing over the year rose from 29 to 33 per cent. Earnings per share were 3.89p (4.94p) and a maintained proposed final dividend of 2.41p makes 4.01p (4p) for the year.</p>

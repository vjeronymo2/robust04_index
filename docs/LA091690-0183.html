			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SPRINTER IS STRIDING TOWARD FAME  </P> <P> In an event that produces superstars, sprinter Mark Witherspoon sees himself as  an unknown quantity.  </P> <P> "I'm the Unknown Sprinter," Witherspoon said Saturday after beating Leroy  Burrell in the 100-meter dash in an international track and field meet at  Shizuoka, Japan.  </P> <P> "I don't like being unknown, but I have no say in the matter," Witherspoon  said. "I guess I just have to run faster more often."  </P> <P> A one week ago, Witherspoon beat Burrell and Carl Lewis at Rieti, Italy. His  best time this year of 10.05 seconds is one of the top five for the season.  </P> <P> Saturday's 100 was split into heats, with Burrell and Witherspoon starting  first on the rain-soaked track. Witherspoon (10.21) beat Burrell (10.23) by  about one meter. Lewis (10.23) had to rally in the final 20 meters to beat  Dennis Mitchell (10.25) in the second heat.  </P> <P> Although some of the best athletes in the world competed, times were hampered  by the wet track.  </P> <P> "The track was really soaked and hard to run on," said Butch Reynolds,  400-meter world record-holder. "And the humidity was also a problem."  </P> <P> Reynolds rallied in the final meters to edge Danny Everett and Cuba's Roberto  Hernandez. Reynolds' time was 44.77.  </P> <P> Roger Kingdom, the world record-holder and two-time Olympic gold medalist, led  an American sweep in the 110-meter high hurdles, winning in 13.28. Courtney  Hawkins was second in 13.38 and Tonie Campbell third in 13.59.  </P></p>

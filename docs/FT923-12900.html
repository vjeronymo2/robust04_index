			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Big three weigh in for HK container port / A look at the contenders for Kwai Chung's four-berth dock contract THE right to build Hong Kong's ninth container terminal is developing into one of the biggest commercial issues the Hong Kong government has to face this year. This week, the three consortiums presented their proposals to the government. They expect to attempt to qualify as bidders for a four-berth dock costing an estimated HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 67.5m) at the colony's Kwai Chung container port. The debate centres on the perceived need for more competition in the port to hold down costs to shippers and the need to ensure that existing operators remain profitable enough to fund current and future expansion plans. Underlying these arguments is the bidders' desire to increase control of a facility that has been growing by 20 per cent a year and does not look like slowing down. The potential of the colony's port was underlined by plans announced by the Wharf group to build a major distribution hub in Wuhan, Hubei Province, central China. In 1998 a dual-track railway will be completed, linking Beijing to Shenzhen. As the east-west transportation links in China are poor, a distribution centre linked to the railway has the potential to feed manufactures and farm produce from the heartland of China to the south China coast. The contest between the prospective bidders includes not only the big operators of the port - the Hutchison Whampoa subsidiary Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT) and Modern Terminals Limited (MTL) - but also the Jardine Matheson group, and Evergreen, the Taiwanese shipping group. The three consortiums are all strong. HIT and MTL have joined forces and, if successful, will rationalise their existing ownership of berths which they claim will lead to efficiencies and higher container throughput. The Jardine consortium - known as the Tsing Yi Container Terminal Consortium  -includes Jardine , Sea-Land Orient Terminals - which already operates one berth at the port - Sun Hung Kai Properties, New World Development, Sinotrans of China, and Hanjin of South Korea. Jardine group members are expected to take a 30 per cent share of the consortium. The third group bidding for the right to operate the new terminal is led by Evergreen, and goes by the name United Terminal Consortium. It includes Genstart Container Corp., Guangdong Enterprise Holdings, Henderson Land Development, and three Japanese trading houses - Marubeni, C. Itoh and Nissho Iwai. The current operators of the port, HIT, have been promoting themselves as the most efficient operator of Hong Kong's port facilities. They have also let it be known that failure to win Terminal 9 will diminish their interest in further planned container development - Terminals 10 and beyond on Lantau Island. MTL and HIT have also threatened to invest in southern Chinese port development if they fail to win their bid for Terminal 9. Sea-Land, which already has container facilities at the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung, has said its position in Hong Kong would be under question if its bid fails. Calls for more competition have come from the Hongkong Liner Shipping Association and the Hong Kong Shippers Council, which represents exporters. They believe a greater diversity of ownership of the port will lead to lower costs of moving cargo across the docks. In the aggressive public relations campaign, the Jardine consortium is trumpeting the efficiencies of Sea-Land, its operator. Sea-Land with just one berth, or 6 per cent of the Kwai Chung port, directly handles 11.5 per cent of the TEU's (20 ft-equivalent) containers which pass through it. Sea-Land also boasts a faster load/unload time than its competitors, shifting, on average, 22.5 TEUs an hour, compared with an average at the port of 18. It says that this is an important consideration when ship owners have to pay between Dollars 25,000 and Dollars 30,000 a day in port. Moreover, the Jardine group has produced figures showing terminal handling charges, paid to shippers by importers and exporters, are higher at Kwai Chung than at any other port in the region. But more than 60 per cent of Sea-Land's terminal business is conducted with ships owned by Sea-Land or in a Sea-Land consortium; they too pay a terminal handling charge in spite of the claimed efficiencies. HIT/MTL so far have rested on their record of investment in the port. HIT has spent HKDollars 21bn over the past 20 years and feels this 'commitment' entitles it to a say in its future. It denies claims of high charges, pointing out that HIT's charges have risen 3.5 times over the past 15 years, while the capital cost of berth construction has risen almost 15 times. HIT also points out that any new operator will face higher costs than an existing one in constructing Terminal 9 and that these higher costs will feed through to higher handling charges. Existing operators have the advantage of being able to spread the cost over existing facilities. It has also taken up the issue of competition. Efficiency is best served, HIT contends, not by increasing internal competition but by maintaining co-operation between operators.  -----------------------------------------------       TERMINAL DEVELOPMENT AT KWAI CHUNG  ----------------------------------------------- MTL                         1976 PTG                         HK Dollars 31m  ----------------------------------------------- MTL                         1970 Private Tender              HK Dollars 14m  ----------------------------------------------- MTL                         1970 Private Tender              HK Dollars 25m  ----------------------------------------------- Sea-Land                    1970 Private Tender              HK Dollars 11m  ----------------------------------------------- HIT                         1976 PTG                         HK Dollars 19.5m  ----------------------------------------------- HIT                         1985 PTG                         HK Dollars 110m  ----------------------------------------------- HIT                         1988 Tender                      HK Dollars 4.4bn  ----------------------------------------------- HIT/MTL                     1991 PTG                         HK Dollars 2bn  -----------------------------------------------</p>

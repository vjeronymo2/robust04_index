Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation </F> minister of environmental protection and natural resources:  ``One-Third of Russia's Territory Is the Most Valuable of What  Remains on Earth as the Basis for Its Ecological Revival'']    [Text] In this article, at the request of ZELENYY  MIR's editors, Professor V. I. Danilov-Danilyan, Russian  Federation minister of environmental protection and natural  resources, analyzes the problems of Russia's international  cooperation in the field of protection of the environment, the  disastrous state of which--typical for all Russia's industrial  regions--is arousing profound concern throughout the world,  especially in the developed countries.    Russia's present environmental condition stems from the  deformed structure of the economy, the obsolescence and physical  deterioration of most enterprises' fixed assets, and the lag in  development of the infrastructure. A fundamental improvement is  inconceivable without huge investments--in the amount of at  least $1 trillion in order to attain the most modest normative  indices of environmental impact.    Without precedent? Absolutely not! Thirty years ago a  similar  situation was observed in almost all the industrial states. But  three decades of the development and consistent implementation  of purposeful environmental policies have resulted in a  fundamental improvement of the condition of the environment in  the postindustrial countries--something, however, which cannot  be said about the global environment situation. In practically  all the developing states, it is steadily deteriorating, partly  because the change for the better in the developed countries has  been brought about by their export of polluting production  facilities to the developing countries.    What is unprecedented, however, is the socioeconomic and  political situation in Russia: in the past 30 or even 40 years  not a single country with a developed market economy has  experienced such an investment crisis. The traditional means of  actualizing Russia's economic potential--by expanding the volume  of resources drawn into production--is, nonetheless,  unacceptable from both global and national viewpoints and is  fundamentally contrary not only to environmental interests and  restrictions, but also to economically sound principles of  development under present conditions.    At the same time, more than one-third of Russia's vast  territory is practically untouched by economic activity, and  those lands represent the most valuable of what remains on the  planet as the basis for its ecological revival. It can be  considered to have been firmly established that in order to  prevent the irreversible degradation of the biosphere we must  not only preserve but increase the territories left without  economic utilization.    The problems of the environment are confidently moving to  occupy the highest place in international relations. The UN  Conference on the Environment and Development that was held in  Brazil last year was devoted to them; it defined the basic  principles of economic development that does not destroy its own  natural foundation (``Agenda for the 21st Century'') and founded  a new UN agency--the Commission on Sustainable Development,  which held its first session in June 1993. At the conference in  Rio, the special status of countries with a transitional economy  was established for the first time in official UN documents.    For the standpoint of the Rio documents, one must note that  the necessary foundations for implementing an  environmental-protection policy have been laid in Russia: There  is a network for monitoring the condition of the environment, a  system of agencies for environmental protection and regulation  of the use of natural resources has been developed (both  vertically and horizontally), an environmental expert review  board is in operation, a legislative basis for  environmental-protection activities is being created,  environmental programs are being drawn up, a system of specially  protected territories is being developed (nature preserves,  national parks, nature reserves, etc.), reports are regularly  published on the state of the environment, a ``red book'' is  maintained, and so forth.    The existence of such a foundation, in the first place, and  the specific features of the structure of Russia's economy, in  the second place, account for an extremely important  circumstance: in terms of environmental impact, investments in  the reconstruction of Russia's economy (and that of certain  other countries with a transitional economy) surpass any other  areas of capital investments. Along with recognition of the  environmental danger that our economy represents, this  circumstance determines the interest of the developed countries,  especially the Group of Seven, in the question of  environmentally oriented investments in Russia, and in credits  and technical assistance for the purposes of developing the  environmental-protection system and implementing environmental  programs and measures to enhance ecological security.    At present this interest has been manifested (on the level  of  preliminary negotiations, or of agreements that are being  drafted or have been signed, or of projects that have begun to  be carried out) with respect to five chiefly concrete forms of  cooperation.    1. The writing off of part of Russia's foreign debts in the  event of our implementation of environmental-protection measures  that are of general interest (the construction of an enterprise  to process radioactive waste--especially in the Far East, is in  Japan's interests, for example, while the development of a  system for monitoring environmentally hazardous facilities based  on satellite communications with access for other countries'  environmental-protection services, and other such projects are  in the interests of the entire world community).    2. Credits and technical assistance for the development and  implementation of such projects (this pertains especially to  nuclear power engineering--the early shutdown of  first-generation reactors and the bringing of newer ones up to  standards, the implementation of energy-conservation measures  that will provide for corresponding transformations in nuclear  power engineering).    3. The development of a project for a World Bank  ``ecological  loan,'' which is a top priority for Russia--a project which is  being completed this September through the efforts of a special  mission of the World Bank and the Russian Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources.    4. Numerous questions of multilateral and bilateral  cooperation--Russia participates in 16 multilateral and 27  bilateral environmental agreements.    5. The stepping up of cooperation with the European  Community  to address the most acute environmental problems in Europe and  the according of the highest priority to those problems.    It is in Russia's interests at the present time to strive  for  the conclusion of agreements on repaying part of its foreign  debt by carrying out environmental measures for their full value  and, in the case of investments in projects partially aimed at  environmental goals (the shift to technologies reducing the  discharge of greenhouse gases, etc.)--for a corresponding part  of their value.    Russia should try to obtain both credits on favorable terms  and technical assistance for carrying out projects related to  the reconstruction of environmentally hazardous production  facilities, the reduction of resource consumption, and removal  of the barriers to the penetration of environmentally friendly  products of Russian enterprises into the world market (space  probing and mapping, environmental monitoring devices, etc.).    The announcement that an ``ecological loan'' in the World  Bank was of high priority for the Russian Federation would  strengthen Russia's position on all other issues and demonstrate  our responsible attitude toward Russia's environmental problems  that are of concern to the whole world.    In the course of various talks, we should push the idea of  the need to develop, in conjunction with the Commission of the  European Communities, a special environmentally oriented program  of technical assistance to Russia, and should explain that the  decisions of the UN Conference on the Environment and  Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the Environment for Europe  Conference (Lucerne, 1993), and the first session of the UN  Commission on Sustainable Development (New York, 1993) are being  consistently implemented in Russia, and that the necessary  foundation has been created in Russia for the consistent pursuit  of policy in the area of environmental protection and resource  conservation. And that not only reducing the negative impact of  Russia's economy on the environment and reconstructing  (eliminating) environmentally hazardous production facilities,  but keeping vast territories of the country untouched by  economic activity are essential to averting planetary  environmental disaster.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Min (3769 2549)] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen, 3 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Despite the  difficulties caused by the obstacles resulting from the British  side's uncooperative attitude and confrontation in the course of  China resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, we have a powerful  motherland backing us and enjoy the concerted efforts of the  Hong Kong compatriots. There are no difficulties or dangers  which cannot be overcome, and there are no obstacles which  cannot be removed. Lu Ping, director of the State Council's  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, made these remarks today at  a ceremony to present certificates for the continuation of  service of the first group of Hong Kong affairs advisers.    Lu Ping thanked the Hong Kong affairs advisers for raising a  large number of valuable opinions and suggestions through  various forms and channels on a number of issues relating to  Hong Kong's power transfer and steady transition since their  appointment. Lu Ping said: On one hand, the appointment of the  Hong Kong affairs advisers manifests their sense of  responsibility for materializing "one country, two systems" and  Hong Kong's steady transition in 1997 as well as for preserving  Hong Kong's stability and prosperity; on the other, it also  gives expression to the Chinese Government's determination to  ensure the implementation of the policy of "Hong Kong people  administering Hong Kong" and to practice a high degree of  autonomy in Hong Kong.    Lu Ping continued: Several days ago, the British Hong Kong  Legislative Council ratified parts of the draft legislation  formulated according to Chris Patten's "constitutional reform  package," and the British Government published a White Paper on  the substance of the Sino-British talks on the constitutional  structure. These unilateral moves -- which undermine cooperation  -- suggest that the British side will willfully continue to  pursue a policy of confrontation during the transitional period  of a little more than three years. This behavior will only  drive all kindhearted people to heighten their vigilance and  abandon any illusions about the British side's empty promise of  so-called "cooperation."    Lu Ping also cited Deng Xiaoping's remarks from 10 years  ago:  "We should believe that the Hong Kong Chinese can properly  administer Hong Kong. The disbelief that Chinese people can  properly administer Hong Kong was inherited from the old  colonialist school of thought." "The prosperity of Hong Kong  was created by the Hong Kong people, who are primarily Chinese."  "The Hong Kong people are able to administer Hong Kong  properly, and we must have this confidence."    In conclusion, Lu Ping said: In the near future, we will  invite a third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers, who will  come from all social levels and fields in Hong Kong. The ranks  of the Hong Kong affairs advisers are growing, and they will  play a more important role in bringing about the recovery of  Hong Kong's sovereignty.</p>

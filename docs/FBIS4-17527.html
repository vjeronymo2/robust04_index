			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- Russia's decision to  integrate its monetary system with Belarussia's should not have  any effect on the inflation rate of the rouble until at least  this summer, announced Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin in  an interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday. He was commenting on an  International Monetary Fund statement that a new "spiral of  inflation" was to be expected in Russia.    Only the trade and economic integration of the two states  has  begun at present, in accordance with the recently-signed  agreement on monetary union, Shokhin said. The circulation of  the rouble on Belarussian territory needs to be approved by the  parliament since it requires changes in that country's  constitution, and that takes time, he noted.    The vice-premier said that the agreement on monetary union  was only "partly" signed on April 12. The deal is, he  explained, that the agreement's articles which were connected  with commercial and economic cooperation were to go in effect  immediately after preparation was completed. These concerned,  in particular, the removal of customs barriers and the  conclusion of a transit agreement. But it was decided that the  other, monetary part of the document was to become effective  only after its legalization in Belarus, since the creation of a  single centre of emission in Russia contradicts the Belarussian  Constitution.    If the Belarussian legislation is changed in accordance with  the documents signed in Moscow, then it will be the Russian  State Duma's turn to examine the benefits of monetary union with  Belarus.    If Belarus is not willing to accept a single emission centre  in Russia, then there are no chances that Russia will agree to a  one- to-one exchange of Belarussian notes for Russian roubles,  Shokhin explained. In that case, Russia will have to follow a  different unification scheme, by extending credit to Belarus on  the same grounds as it was given to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan at  the end of 1993.</p>

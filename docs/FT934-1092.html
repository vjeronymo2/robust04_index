			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher moves into office supplies stores Kingfisher, the UK retail group, and joint venture partner Staples of the US will announce this week that they plan to launch nationally the office supplies superstore concept they have been testing in four locations. The pilot Staples stores in Swansea, Cambridge, Leeds, and Staples Corner, north London, have performed above expectations, and the partners have agreed to invest an undisclosed amount in expanding the chain across the UK. The 20,000 square feet stores are aimed primarily at small businesses, and stock 5,000 items of office equipment from cleaning materials and ballpoint pens through to personal computers and laser printers, at prices up to 50 per cent below traditional dealers. About half the customers at the pilot stores have been small businesses, and the other half individuals. Mr Roger Paffard, UK managing director, claims a small business could save up to 40 per cent a year on office equipment by buying from Staples. The chain will open its next store in Birmingham in March, with a further 8 likely next year, and up to 30 in 1995. Staples of the US pioneered the discount office equipment format opening its first store in Massachusetts in 1986. It has since opened 175 stores. It joined forces with Kingfisher to attack the estimated Pounds 1.5bn office equipment market in the UK last year. It also has joint ventures in Canada and with Germany's office superstore chain Maxi-Papier-Markt, in which Kingfisher took a 33 per cent stake this month. Staples is the latest example to arrive in the UK of a US-style 'category killer' - an outlet which aims to offer both a wider range and lower prices than any competitors in a particular product area. Other examples include Toys R Us and PC World. It also borrows some elements, such as a membership scheme - free in this case - and its focus on small businesses, from the warehouse club concept like Costco, which opened in Thurrock at the end of last month.</p>

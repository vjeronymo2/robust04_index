			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Hopes for Brazil reforms BRAZIL'S review of its constitution was set to begin yesterday following the overthrow of a controversial ruling by a Supreme Court judge which had threatened to delay the process for several weeks. The ruling, which had frustrated attempts to begin the review on Wednesday, was overturned by a full meeting of the Supreme Court convened in emergency session. The judge's ruling, which was highly technical, was determined to be in error. The constitutional review was due to be opened during a session of Congress last night. Over the next few weeks the combined two houses of Congress are expected to discuss procedural rules and the agenda to be reviewed. The process is likely to last until at least the end of the year. The review is seen as important in helping to solve Brazil's economic problems, some of which stem from constitutional rules.</p>

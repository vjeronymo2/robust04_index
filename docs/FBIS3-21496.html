			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Few Ideas"] </F>   [Text] The new president, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, defense  minister since July 1993, has spoken to the Algerian people only  twice: on 24 October 1993, in an interview with the Algerian  press agency, and on 16 January 1994, in a televised interview.  The moment chosen for the latter event was rather significant.  It coincided with the anniversary of the late President  Boudiaf's return to Algeria.    The tenor of the defense minister's words was reminiscent of  the assassinated president and seemed to connect up with the  latter's vision of the path, which the country needs to take to  end the crisis.    His speech, broadcast in prime time, offered a highly  critical assessment--one such as Boudiaf himself never hesitated  to give--of the country's plight and the behavior of the  political class (the parties and the political authorities).  Observers noted that no one was spared, not even the de facto  regime, starting with the HCE [Higher State Council].    His analysis did not lead into the issues of security and  reestablishment of order and thus implied the answer to the  country's problems must be sought elsewhere. According to Mr.  Zeroual, the solution lies in "establishment of a new national  system that enshrines real democracy, guarantees all individual  and social freedoms, and puts a definitive end to political,  economic, cultural, and ideological monopolies."    Implantation of this new system will entail "a real break  with the practices and administrative methods of the past at  every political, economic, and social level," the defense  minister said.    "The break that we believe so essential and we hope to  realize," he continued, "must bring about radical change in the  machinery of the state, and its components must respect new  parameters."    Nor should the human factor be ignored, according to the  defense minister, because "this new system will permit the  emergence of new people capable of making changes and taking  concrete steps to realize the nation's aspirations toward peace,  progress, brotherhood, and Algeria's rehabilitation as a member  of the family of nations."    Mr. Zeroual laid out a veritable political program,  enumerating the diverse aspects of the crisis and advocating the  remedial measures needed for a return to political, economic,  and social stability.    The interview published on 24 October 1993 offers further  clues to the thinking of the man who just became the country's  top leader. He asserts, for example, that "the ANP [People's  National Army] is a republican army that believes in democratic  institutions, political alternation, multiparty pluralism, and a  state of law."    The army's current political involvement: "is solely for the  purpose of preserving national unity, reestablishing civil  peace, and opening up new prospects for our country, thanks to  which resort to violence as a means of political expression--and  all forms of political, ideological, and economic  monopolies--will be abolished forever."    But it must be understood, Mr. Zeroual cautions, "and no one  should lose sight of the fact, that the ANP cannot remain  indifferent toward anything that might be of critical importance  for the country's future." He thus condemns, unequivocally and  categorically, the religious extremism shown by fundamentalists  who have opted for armed and destructive action. "We cannot  think of an example anywhere else in the world," he said, "where  an extremist movement, whatever its credo, has made such vicious  attacks on the people's property, their factories, their  schools, and even sought the physical elimination of cadres and  ordinary citizens."    Freedom of the press "is a fundamental right and an  essential  condition in a society that aspires for transparency," Mr.  Zeroual said in October 1993, adding that he would "certainly  expect to be available to the media and improve relations with  the press."    "We support the people's right to truly informative and  edifying news about doings and events. But we are against  slanted `revelations' in the media," he said.</p>

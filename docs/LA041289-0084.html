			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the U.N. secretary general that Israel does  not need its help for now in advancing the ideas of Mideast peace. At a meeting  in New York initiated by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Shamir said  he is still against convening a U.N.-backed international peace conference on  the Middle East. An Israeli spokesman said Perez de Cuellar took a great  interest in Shamir's proposal for Palestinian elections in Israeli-occupied  territories. Meanwhile, Zehdi Terzi, the Palestine Liberation Organization's  observer at the United Nations, said the secretary general would meet with PLO  Chairman Yasser Arafat later this month in Europe.  </P></p>

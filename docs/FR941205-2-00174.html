This project would assist all other projects funded under this program in increasing their efforts in these areas and in better meeting the interpreting needs of different cultures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interpreter service needs of minority group individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing is an issue that has been raised nationally. An RSA-funded evaluation study reported that approximately 90 percent of graduates from the interpreter training programs around the country are White, while 4 percent are African-American and 5 percent are Hispanic. The National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf reported that, in a given year, of 2,057 interpreters certified by their registry, only 20 were non-White persons. A Health Interview Survey, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics in 1990&hyph;91, reported that of the 20 million individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, 1.2 million are Afro-American and 900,000 are Hispanic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A national project is needed to concentrate on curriculum that will improve the skills of interpreters working with minority group members. Strategies for the recruitment of minority interpreters also need to be developed and made available to the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This project must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Be of national scope;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide technical assistance to the regional interpreter training projects supported under this program in recruiting and training interpreters to meet the communication needs of culturally diverse populations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop curriculum to improve the knowledge of interpreters with respect to social and cultural concepts of interpreting, such as body language, spatial considerations, and communication between individuals from different cultures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establish cooperative relationships with the regional projects to be funded by the Secretary during fiscal year 1995 by conducting workshops and seminars to improve curriculum development, classroom training of interpreters, preparation of interpreter trainers, recruitment outreach to members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and other activities that will increase the number and skills of interpreters to help meet the communication needs of individuals from different cultures; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In carrying out project activities, address at a minimum the needs of the minority populations referred to in section 21 of the Rehabilitation Act, including African-Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian-Americans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicable Program Regulations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  34 CFR Part 396. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  29 U.S.C. 771a(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Intergovernmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These programs are subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79.

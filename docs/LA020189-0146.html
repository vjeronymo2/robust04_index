			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Duff &amp; Phelps has upgraded its ratings on the long-term and short-term  securities of BankAmerica in response to the San Francisco banking company's  financial performance in 1988 and high expectations for the current year. The  Chicago-based ratings agency said the improved ratings reflected "significant  improvement in operating profitability, continued progress in asset quality and  further enhancement of the capital base" at the parent company of Bank of  America, California's largest bank. Senior debt was raised a notch to  D&amp;P-7, equivalent to low single A, and short-term certificates of deposit  went up to Duff 1-.  </P></p>

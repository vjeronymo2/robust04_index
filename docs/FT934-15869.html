			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Ford to streamline stock distribution FORD is planning to introduce a new car distribution system in the UK intended to reduce stocks held at dealers' premises and to significantly cut the total number of vehicles in its supply pipeline. The company is being forced to revamp its distribution methods in order to catch up with radical changes already announced by Rover and Vauxhall in the last 18 months. Both maintain that the changes will save them and their dealers tens of millions of pounds a year. Ford said yesterday that it planned to introduce a pilot scheme during the first half of next year. The Ford system is expected to follow the Rover and Vauxhall patterns, whereby dealers will draw their cars from a network of large regional storage facilities, each linked strategically to either a Ford assembly plant in the UK or, in the case of imported vehicles, to their port of entry. More than half of all new cars sold by some leading carmakers are transferred be-tween dealerships to satisfy customer orders, rather than going directly to the dealer. Traditionally main dealers have had to hold six weeks or more of stocks.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazil's stock market hopes ride on the real - The Emerging Investor The long-awaited arrival of Brazil's new currency, the real, could prove the launching pad for a soaring stock market. Inflation is expected to fall dramatically, helping the financial markets' preferred presidential candidate, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and possibly paving the way for longer-term economic reforms. But the continuing political uncertainties surrounding the October elections and an overvaluation of the new currency have so far prevented a large capital inflow. The real, which is linked to Brazil's foreign exchange reserves of nearly Dollars 40bn, was introduced on July 1 and should result in a fall in monthly inflation from 50 per cent in June to less than 10 per cent this month. Local investors are betting that the real, which is part of a government anti-inflation plan, will lead to the election of Mr Cardoso, the former finance minister who negotiated the plan through Congress. Mr Cardoso, who is regarded by the financial markets as a modernist, has been trailing Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers Party in the opinion polls, although the gap has narrowed significantly since the real was introduced. 'A lot of investors are not afraid of Lula but of the reaction to him,' says Mr George Rexing, a director at the Brazilian bank Banco Indusval, referring to estimates that the market could suffer a short-term fall of 50 per cent or more if Mr da Silva were to win. Nevertheless, the relatively smooth introduction of the real, coupled with a stronger showing in the polls for Mr Cardoso, has lifted Sao Paulo's volatile stock market index by about 11 per cent so far this month. The bullish scenario sees a huge fall in monthly inflation, to between 2 and 5 per cent from August onwards, and a grateful electorate voting for Mr Cardoso in a second ballot in mid-November. If Mr Cardoso were to carry out radical reforms to public finances, analysts believe shares could more than triple in value during his presidency. They base the prediction on equities' growth in other countries where fiscal reforms have been made such as Mexico, Argentina and Chile. Currently, Brazil's stock market capitalisation represents about 25 per cent of gross domestic product compared with about 50 per cent for Mexico. Even without reforms the Brazilian market has shown impressive, if volatile, growth in the past. Last year the main Sao Paulo index doubled in dollar terms, partly fuelled by a net overseas inflow of Dollars 5.5bn to the capital markets. The potential for Brazilian equities has attracted the interest of many foreign investors, but most have not yet decided to take the plunge because of the political uncertainty. According to Mr Julius Buchenrode, head of investments at Chase Manhattan's Brazilian subsidiary, there has been a big increase in recent months in registrations with the bank from foreign, mainly US, mutual funds, pension funds and trusts. Another worry among foreigners has been an overvaluation of the new currency. The central bank, which has not intervened at all in the foreign exchange market since the first day of the real, has let the currency appreciate on the open market by 7 to 8 per cent, roughly reflecting the interest rate differential between Brazil and international markets. The result of the overvaluation has been that shares are now more expensive in dollar terms and there is some exchange rate risk for foreign investors entering the market as most analysts expect the dollar to revalue as Brazilian interest rates fall. Before the real, the central bank devalued the cruzeiro on a daily basis in line with inflation. The exchange rate risk has contributed to keeping overseas investors out of the market and the climb in equities this month has been caused almost entirely by local investors, brokers say. The overvaluation could hit exporters. Most of the big exporters closed contracts before the real but smaller companies will suffer, according to Mr Ricardo Gallo, a director at Bank of Boston's Sao Paulo office. Another sector that could come under pressure is the banks. They could suffer reduced third-quarter results as they will no longer be able to make easy profits from interest-free floats. However, the fall in inflation should be partly offset by the introduction of charges for many services. Shares that could prove attractive are those related to consumer spending. Purchasing power among the poor, who did not have access to inflation-linked savings accounts, is expected to increase substantially and could boost profits in the food, drink and clothing sectors. If a Cardoso election victory appeared probable, investors could start to bring more dollars into the market. But this would spark central bank concerns about money supply targets as the bank would have to issue reals in exchange for dollars, putting pressure on the monetary base, widely regarded as the key to the success of the real. If it got out of hand, the government could attempt to deter a large inflow of foreign capital by a financial operations tax on foreign investment in equities. Currently there is just a 15 per cent withholding tax on dividends.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    22/7/94        Week on week change Stock                  Country     Dollars close     Dollars   %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Guoco Holdings Phillipines            Philippines    0.1727          0.0252   17.11 Phillipine National Bank                   Philippines   17.2676          2.3337   15.63 Southern               Peru           4.3488          0.5447   14.32 Banco Do Brasil (Pfd)  Brazil         0.0224          0.0027   13.52 Minsur                 Peru           7.7960          0.9103   13.22 Kordosa                Turkey         0.4269          0.0472   12.44 Ayala Land (B)         Philippines    1.1006          0.1176   11.96 Banco Bradesco (Pfd)   Brazil         0.0074          0.0007   10.70 Buenaventura (C)       Peru           3.2559          0.2946    9.95 Telefonos              Peru           3.8707          0.3387    9.59  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

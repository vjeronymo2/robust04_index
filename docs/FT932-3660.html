			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Property: House price stability continues - Cadogan's Place HOUSE PRICES continue to stabilise. At the bottom end of the market, the Nationwide index of the average price of houses - for which the building society give mortgages - shows a slight rise in May of 1 per cent, for the third month in a row. The Halifax index shows a 1.2 per cent decline. The figures are still 5.5 and 3.3 per cent down on May 1992, underscoring the point that any property must be reasonably priced - in 1993 terms - to sell. Buyers at the top end 'still want to be predatory', says Savills' Justin Marking. They must feel there is some 'give' in the price. A house priced too highly will deter viewers. Vendors are starting to offer houses, he finds, two months later than usual in the annual cycle. It took until until spring for confidence to pick up and may mean that the early summer buying season will continue through the August lull. Another market indicator is the purchase by an overseas buyer of 4 St James's Square in Mayfair, London, at close to the guide price of Pounds 6.5m freehold. Conversion from business use to a house will cost another hefty sum. The agents were Wetherell and Herring Baker Harris. Built in 1725, the property was the home of Nancy Astor, Britain's first woman MP, and then of the Arts Council, before becoming temporary law courts and finally the seat of the Employment Appeals Tribunal. It comes with garden and mews. In the mews are three cells and a slaughterhouse. Green-minded readers looking for a place that is undeniably different should visit what is virtually Britain's southern mainland limit, the Lizard, in Cornwall. The National Trust in Cornwall (0208-74281) is offering a 99-year lease on the old signal station on Bass Point at over Pounds 85,000 (but no ground rent) to buyers who will pay for the repairs. Shaped like a Norman castle keep, Signal House looks out to sea on three sides and was built in 1872 for spotting ships and communicating with them by semaphore as they entered the Western Approaches. Telegraph operators sent details of the vessels to Falmouth; from there, they were forwarded to Lloyd's in London and to the owners, who could send back their orders. This meant the ships did not have to put in at Falmouth. By 1877, the station was dealing with more than 1,000 a month. As a residence, it has four bedrooms, an observatory-landing and a rooftop sundeck with complete privacy. But attitude is as important as price; the Trust has battled to conserve the Cornish coast for many years and wants buyers of like mind. Attitude matters also at The Cottage in Charlton, near Banbury, a village house which is being offered as a furnished let. It has 10 bedrooms, three tennis courts and a panelled dining room modelled on the senior common room of Merton College, Oxford, all put together by a noted barrister and politician, Frederick Smith, who became the first Lord Birkenhead. The tenants must cooperate with his family on using the tennis courts and holding the annual village fete in the garden. The guide rent on an assured shorthold of three to five years is Pounds 30,000, to include some daily help, a gardener and access to the estate. Grazing, stabling and full livery for horses, a kitchen garden and rent of a cottage are negotiable extras. Details from Lane Fox in Banbury (0295-273592). Across the road from Hampstead Heath in north London, Schreiber Developments has just completed Temple Heath Lodge in Templewood Avenue; there are four well-planned apartments on 125-year leases at around Pounds 1m (through Goldschmidt &amp; Howland, 071-435-4404, and Savills, 071-431-4844). The joinery of rare quality is right for a firm that began by making furniture. The flats look over to the heath and the rich, red brickscape of Hampstead's roofs. Next door are Schreiber's offices, designed by James Gowan 30 years ago and rated one of London's best post-war buildings. Another distinctive 1960s building is Capel Manor House near Tunbridge Wells in Kent, designed by Michael Manser for the site of a demolished Victorian pile. The house is a glass pavilion and sits on the arched terrace of the old house, surrounded by a large, terraced garden of 3.5 acres brought back from wilderness by landscape architect Bodfan Gruffydd. The rhododendrons and azaleas are splendid. Jackson-Stops (071-499-6291) offers it at a guide price of Pounds 385,000. Clearly, one for gardeners. Tom Fort on fishing property, Page XVII</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Critical Decision on Baghdad"] </F>   [Text] Turkey has arrived at the point where it must make  two critical decisions on its foreign policy. The first is  related to Iraq.    An Iraqi delegation headed by an under secretary visited  Turkey at the end of December 1993. It invited Ozdem Sanberk,  under secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, to visit  Baghdad before it returned to Iraq. The Turkish Foreign  Ministry is presently considering the way it will respond to  that invitation. Until last night, the high-ranking officials  were inclined to agree that Sanberk should visit Baghdad.  However, the final decision will be adopted in the next few  days. The decision is critical to Turkey because Ozdem  Sanberk's arrival in Baghdad would be the first high-level visit  by a Turkish official to Iraq since the Gulf War. Furthermore,  it will pave the way for intensified relations between Turkey  and Iraq.    However, Turkey's allies do not favor the establishment of  high-level relations with Baghdad at this stage. Nevertheless,  they are gradually becoming aware that Turkey's situation is  different.    The current talks between Ankara and Baghdad seem only to be  on the question of the oil pipeline between the two countries.  Nevertheless, the question of northern Iraq continues to be a  serious problem. Turkey wishes to convince Baghdad to adopt a  more moderate approach on matters related to its citizens in  northern Iraq. In short, Ozdem Sanberk's probable visit will be  an important development.  <H5>  Message to Denktas for a Solution </H5>   In accordance with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's circular in  January, a committee has been established to assess Turkey's  foreign policy. Several ambassadors have been appointed as  committee members. The committee will work under Prime Minister  Ciller. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin and Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin are among its members. It plans to hold  its first meeting on Turkey's policy on Cyprus at the beginning  of the week. It will be recalled that in the United States some  time ago Ciller promised to do whatever she could to contribute  toward the solution of the Cyprus problem after the elections in  north Cyprus. The elections have been held and a new government  has been established in north Cyprus. In view of that, the time  has come for Turkey to design its policy on the matter.  President Demirel has invited President Rauf Denktas to visit  Ankara. He will arrive on Tuesday, 22 February.  <H5>  Time To Solve the Problem </H5>   The committee met to assess Turkey's foreign policy at the  beginning of the week. It decided that Rauf Denktas should be  asked the following: "We have to adopt a decision on the policy  we should maintain. Should we maintain the policy of  no-solution or move to seek a solution to the problem?"    A high-ranking Turkish Foreign Ministry official said: "The  no-solution situation is a solution. However, we have to  decide." Turkey is convinced that a solution has to be found to  the Cyprus problem. In fact, Deputy Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary Bilgin Unan's visit to Nicosia in January to initiate  backstage activities for the acceptance of UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposals was the first indication of  Turkey's approach in that direction.    The Turkish Cypriot side has recently taken positive steps.  However, world public opinion is convinced that it is opposed to  a solution of the problem. Obviously, several other steps must  be taken to remove that impression. So, Denktas' visit may be  an important turning point. Turkey is now convinced that  concrete steps must be taken to resolve the Cyprus problem.  That will be explained to Denktas in detail on Tuesday.    The question of Syria is the third point in Turkey's foreign  policy that has aroused concern. Developments in domestic  politics have overshadowed that problem. In view of that,  little attention has been focused on whether or not President  Clinton was able to influence President al-Asad when they met  some time ago. A high-ranking official has said that President  Clinton was able to do so. Intelligence reports Turkey has  recently received indicate that Syria has seriously restricted  Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan's activities  in that country.  <H5>  Restrictions on Ocalan </H5>   There are various rumors about Ocalan's whereabouts. He is  reported to be living in a village between Syria and Lebanon.  He has been informed that he must remain indoors during the day  and avoid holding political talks. There are reports that the  PKK camps in Syria have been closed down and the movement of PKK  militants has been restricted. In short, Turkey's pressure  seems to have achieved a certain degree of success.    Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry is worried that  Turkey may be subjected to intensive pressure by Western  countries on matters related to the Kurdish problem. It seems  that the first signs of that pressure have come from the United  States.    In Germany, a motion on the Kurdish problem has recently  been  blocked in the Bundestag. Undoubtedly, it will be looked at  again if a message is received from the United States.    All this indicates that Turkey has to concentrate more  seriously not only on the question of Iraq and the Cyprus  problem but also on the Kurdish problem in southeastern Anatolia.</p>

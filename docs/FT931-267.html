			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Malaysia expects 7.6% growth BANK Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has forecast a 7.6 per cent growth in the country's GDP for this year, slightly below earlier government projections. Presenting its annual report, Mr Jaafar Hussein, the bank's governor, said 1992 real GDP growth had been 8 per cent, again slightly below earlier estimates, amainly due to slower expansion of manufacturing and mining output. Despite the slowdown, Malaysian growth had outperformed all other Asean countries and the newly-industrialising countries in Asia. This slight easing was a blessing in disguise, letting the economy 'consolidate to a more sustainable growth path, consistent with price stability'. The bank said the balance of payments position had significantly improved in 1992, with the merchandise account recording a MDollars 7.3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) surplus against a MDollars 461m deficit in 1991, an improvement mainly due to zero import growth. But efforts must continue to narrow the services account deficit, which at MDollars 12bn last year, led to an overall current-account deficit of MDollars 4.4bn. Other areas of concern were inflation, up from 4.1 per cent in 1991 to 4.7 per cent in 1992, and continuing excess liquidity. Manufactured goods exports, now accounting for about 70 per cent of total exports, would grow 16.5 per cent this year, against 17 per cent in 1992.</p>

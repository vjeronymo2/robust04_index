			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SHIMOYAMA TRANSFERS TO N. HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Suzi Shimoyama, the most valuable player last season for the Louisville High  girls' basketball team, has transferred to North Hollywood High as a  participant in the school's newly established highly gifted student magnet  program.  </P> <P> Shimoyama, who was an All-San Fernando Valley League selection last year as a  freshman, will team with highly regarded Jacinda Sweet, a junior guard.  </P> <P> "This should really help take some of the heat off of Sweet," North Hollywood  Coach Rich Allen said. "She's been getting double- and triple-teamed all  summer. They worked real well together in the (summer) games where both of them  have been there. They should be one of the best guard combinations around."  </P> <P> Shimoyama (5-foot-7, 125 pounds) averaged 6.5 points, 7.2 assists and five  rebounds a game at Louisville. North Hollywood was the Valley Pac-8 Conference  co-champion last season.  </P> <P> Right-hander Bill Scheffles pitched the first five innings to earn a win, had  four hits and scored six runs as Santa Susana defeated Richmond, Calif., 27-6,  in an elimination game of the U. S. Western Zone Pony baseball championships at  Pleasant Valley Park in Camarillo on Friday.  </P> <P> Santa Susana (9-2 in postseason play) will play the winner of Friday night's  game between Camarillo and Cache Valley today at 1:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Ryan Briggs was three for three with a three-run home run and Ryan Hankins had  a grand slam for Santa Susana.  </P> <P> Scheffles had four hits in his first four at-bats and scored six runs.  </P> <P> Encino, which did not play Friday, will play Rialto today at 4 p.m. in a  winners'-bracket game.  </P> <P> Union City, Calif., rallied for four runs in the bottom of the seventh inning  to defeat Conejo Valley, 5-4, in the Senior League Western regional tournament  at Hadland Park in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Trailing, 4-1, Union City scored three runs on Chris Dean's two-out double.  Dean scored on consecutive singles.  </P> <P> Jeff Naster threw a five-hitter in a losing effort for Conejo Valley (14-4).  Teammate Ryan Kritscher was two for three and drove in a run and Cory Bowen  added two hits.  </P> <P> Had Conejo Valley won, it would have faced Union City today for the title.  </P> <P> Tommy Kendall, a 22-year-old UCLA student from La Canada, qualified 17th on  Friday for the NASCAR Budweiser at the Glen road race in Watkins Glen, N.Y.  </P> <P> Kendall, a former IMSA sports car champion who is making his first NASCAR  start, qualified with a speed of 118.463 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Morgan Shepherd of Conover, N.C., covered the 2.48-mile, six-turn Watkins Glen  International road course at 120.456 m.p.h. to earn the pole position for  Sunday's race. The purse is $170,000.  </P> <P> Emilee Klein of Studio City fired a final-round 80 on Friday to finish in a  two-way tie for 11th place in the Betsy Rawls Girls Junior Championship at  Hercules Country Club in Wilmington, Del.  </P> <P> Klein, a sophomore at Notre Dame High, had rounds of 74-80-80 -- 234 over the  6,015-yard, par-72 course. Tonya Blosser of Athens, Ohio, won with a six-over  222.  </P> <P> Zack Lee of Thousand Oaks, 13, won a bronze medal in the parallel bars  competition at the Pan American Cup, held last month in Victoria, Mexico.  </P> <P> Lee represented the U. S. national team in the event and also finished fourth  in pommel horse and fifth on rings. Lee trains at the Monarchs Olympic Training  Center in Agoura Hills.  </P> <P> Herm Sater of Encino won a silver medal in age-group tennis competition last  month in the Maccabiah Games in Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> Sater, 61, was defeated by Victor Israel of England, 6-4, 6-4, in the  55-and-over division final.  </P> <P> Left-hander Tony Dardin of UCLA threw a three-hitter, struck out 10 and walked  one in eight innings as the Woodland Hills Astros defeated L. A. Harbor, 2-1,  in the third round of pool play in the U.S. Open semipro baseball tournament at  Galvin Field in Ontario on Thursday night.  </P> <P> Mike Lieberthal of Westlake High drove in the winning run with a double in the  eighth inning and Jeff Bodeau, a 1988 graduate of Saugus High, pitched a  scoreless ninth to earn the save.  </P> <P> Woodland Hills (28-9) is 2-1 in pool play in the 18-team tournament and will  play today at 4 p.m. and again tonight at 7.  </P></p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: No case for central bank freedom Sir, Apart from the personal criticisms directed at ourselves, the three letters which our arguments (Personal View, January 22) provoked make only two counter-arguments. First, a non-political monetary authority would constrain the government in the field of taxation and expenditure (P W Bloomer, January 25); second, it would convince the markets that price stability would be maintained (Alan Beith, January 26). The first point has been demonstrated to be patently untrue in the case of the US, where fiscal deficits have run unchecked for a decade despite an independent Federal Reserve. But if the proposition were true, it implies that your correspondent thinks that it would be a good thing if the Bank of England indirectly controlled fiscal policy. This is an idea we have not previously encountered. The second point is equally unsupported by the evidence. It resembles the now-discredited argument that Britain's joining the EMS would convince the markets that price stability would be secured. Markets are impressed by experience rather than by the mere fact of institutional change. If we had a government whose policies revealed a lack of commitment to opposing inflation, the markets would not be comforted by an independent central bank, and if conflict ensued that would itself be bad for confidence and economic stability. Mr Beith also clearly believes that it is possible to defeat inflation without generating unemployment. This too flies in the face of recent experience. It may be that in the long run we shall be able to establish an environment of wage and price restraint in conditions of high employment, but that happy conjuncture does not obtain now, and it is difficult to see how the establishment of an independent central bank would bring it about.

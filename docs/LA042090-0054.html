			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> See You in Court, Pal: Actress-model Lauren Hutton has filed a lawsuit against  fellow actress and friend Beverly D'Angelo for breaking her leg in a car  accident last August.  </P> <P> The suit claims that D'Angelo, who was driving a rented vehicle, backed into  Hutton as she was waiting to get into the car on a Hollywood Hills street.  Hutton's attorney Richard Bisetti said the accident put Hutton in a cast for  eight weeks. He said the suit was just filed to "protect Miss Hutton's rights."  Hutton is seeking an unspecified amount for medical expenses and other damages  from D'Angelo and Budget Rent-A-Car. Bisetti said the actresses were still  "good friends." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

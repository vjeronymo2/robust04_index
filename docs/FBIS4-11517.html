			<p>BFN     [Text] A second British company will probably undertake oil  exploration projects in Cuba. This news was released today  during a news conference given by Michael Adda, head of the  delegation from Caritad, a group which promotes trade with the  Caribbean.    Talks will be held throughout the week among members of the  Caritad delegation and Cuban representatives, who will discuss  projects on ways to establish agreements in tourism,  agriculture, oil exploration, and maritime services.    During the news conference it was also reported that the  British secretary of state for trade and industry and a new  group of British businessmen will visit Cuba in September.    Adda said that some of the proposals submitted by investors  of this group will be confirmed by the end of this year. He  added that Great Britain must also contribute to the economic  recovery of Cuba; we are awaiting with great expectations the  measures that will probably be adopted by the special Cuban  legislative session that will be held this week, he said.    More than 100 contacts were held over the past few days  between British and Cuban businessmen.</p>

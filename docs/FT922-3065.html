			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Indian bank sets aside Dollars 250m STATE Bank of India, India's largest public investment bank, is to set aside Dollars 250m to cover possible losses in the fallout from the country's worst financial scandal, AP-DJ reports from Bombay. The government-owned State Bank has agreed to honour liabilities arising from illegal securities transactions with a leading Bombay stockbroker, bank officials said. The broker, Harshad Mehta, has been accused of illegally using bank money to manipulate stocks. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, ordered the State Bank two weeks ago to account for Dollars 250m that it had received in crossed cheques from the National Housing Bank. Both the State Bank and Housing Bank are subsidiaries of the central bank. According to police reports, the State Bank credited the money in securities to Mehta. Losses by at least nine banks, including Standard Chartered Bank Australia. and ANZ Grindlays, totalled an estimated Dollars 1.1bn. Except for two small Indian banks which went bankrupt, the banks were expected to shore up enough funds to protect their investors. The State Bank said it could bear the loss of Dollars 250m, even though that was more than six times the bank's 1990 profits.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Party official rejects Pounds 7m bill A LEADING Christian Democrat implicated in Italy's corruption scandals is refusing to accept financial responsibility for funds collected illicitly on behalf of the party. The outcome will determine whether individuals or parties are liable to repay illegally collected funds. Mr Maurizio Prada, long-time administrator for the Christian Democrats in Milan, is being asked by magistrates to hand back L16.9bn (Pounds 7m) which he admits illicitly collecting from local businessmen. c Mr Prada was arrested last year and has accepted the legal consequences for his actions, but is refusing to accept financial liability. He has threatened to sue the Christian Democrats if they fail to return the funds he collected for the party. He has detailed six sums of money, from L840m to L5.3bn, which he collected between 1984 and 1989 on behalf of the Milan party, the regional office or the national Christian Democrat treasury. He further alleges the party knew that declared contributions were tiny in relation to the expense of running a large party apparatus. The party itself, now under new administrative control, is expected to deny liability for past actions. At the same time the party's finances are so depleted it would have difficulty repaying Mr Prada. The problems of Mr Prada pall beside those of Mr Severino Citaristi, the Christian Democrat party treasurer, who faces more than 20 charges of receiving illicit funds totalling L100bn. Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the head of Olivetti, was yesterday released from house arrest. Last week Rome magistrates created a sensation by insisting on Mr De Benedetti's formal arrest and brief entry into prison before being interrogated for allegedly paying L10bn to obtain post office contracts for Olivetti teleprinters and telex machines.</p>

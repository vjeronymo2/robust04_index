			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHLORINE LEAK FORCED SIMI VALLEY EVACUATION;  </P> <P> DEFECTIVE ALARM ON GAS TANK SUSPECTED  </P> <P> Ventura County fire officials said they are investigating whether an alarm at a  Simi Valley textile plant was working when a cloud of poisonous gas leaked from  a 30-ton chlorine tank last Thursday, forcing the evacuation of more than  12,000 people.  </P> <P> Fire officials believe that the alarm may have been defective because they  first learned of the leak at the plant, Travelin' West Textiles, from a nearby  business owner who called to complain of chlorine odors, Battalion Chief Dan  Spykerman said Saturday.  </P> <P> There is no evidence that emission of the cloud of chlorine gas from Travelin'  West on Easy Street could have been prevented had firefighters learned of the  leak sooner, Spykerman said. But authorities should not have to depend on  citizens' complaints to learn of emergencies, he said.  </P> <P> Under state law, businesses that use chlorine and other hazardous materials  must install leak-detection systems equipped with alarms and maintain them in  good condition, Spykerman said. Violating the law is a misdemeanor offense  punishable by a maximum fine of $2,000 and up to two years in County Jail, he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bleaching Waste Water  </P> <P> Travelin' West, which uses chlorine to bleach waste water infused with dye  before discharging the water into the sewer, had an alarm attached to the  bottom of its outdoor chlorine tank, he said. However, it is unclear if the  alarm was activated last Thursday morning, he said.  </P> <P> Executives of Melody Knitting Mills, which owns the Travelin' West plant, could  not be reached for comment. Joe Lange, an attorney for the Travelin' West  plant, said Wednesday that "nobody in the company received any calls from the  alarm company."  </P> <P> If the device at the Travelin' West plant had been working, it would have  sounded at the dispatch center of a private alarm company, but not at any of  the county's fire stations, Spykerman said. Such alarms are not hooked up to  fire stations because firefighters often are out on calls and might not hear  them go off, he said.  </P> <P> If the device did go off, the alarm company would have called Richard Bates,  owner of the textile plant, or other company officials, Spykerman said. State  law does not require business owners to notify authorities in the event of  toxic leaks, although it does mandate that they report fires, he added.  </P> <P> "The law only implies that they must report toxic problems, but it's not  specifically spelled out like it should be," he said. "I think this will  eventually go the way of sprinklers in high-rises: It'll take a disaster to  strengthen the law, which is a shame."  </P> <P> Spykerman said officials are reviewing tapes of calls made to the Fire  Department last Thursday morning to see whether Bates, or anyone else connected  with the textile company, reported the leak. However, it appears that during  the hour that followed the 6:30 a.m. call from the nearby business owner, no  one telephoned authorities about the leak, Spykerman said. He declined to  identify the business owner.  </P> <P> "It is possible that the alarm failed to work until later in the morning, when  the gas built up, and that Mr. Bates called us when he was notified of the  leak," he said. "But the detection device should have worked from the  beginning."  </P> <P> Thursday morning was not the first time that the Fire Department received calls  about chlorine odors from the textile plant, Spykerman said.  </P> <P> During the past year, firefighters would arrive at the plant once or twice a  month, only to find that the odors were coming from the tank where the dyed  water and chlorine were mixed -- not from the chlorine tank itself, Spykerman  said. The odors were annoying, but not strong enough to be hazardous or to  violate pollution laws, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Offender  </P> <P> Chlorine, one of the most commonly produced chemicals in the United States, is  also one of the hazardous materials most commonly involved in industrial  accidents, officials said.  </P> <P> Between July, 1986, and December, 1987, chlorine was named in 43  hazardous-material incidents throughout California, according to a report by  the state Office of Emergency Services. Of the 200 chemicals listed in the  report, chlorine ranked 11th among those most often involved in industrial  accidents, said Fred Lecari, a spokesman for the state agency.  </P> <P> When inhaled, chlorine gas can cause choking and coughing. If breathed in  sufficient quantities, chlorine can cause pulmonary edema, or the buildup of  fluid in the lungs, which can be fatal.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, 20 people, including five Ventura County firefighters and a  sheriff's deputy, were injured after inhaling the toxic gas.  </P> <P> In September, a cloud containing a chlorine compound escaped from a southeast  Los Angeles manufacturer of chlorine tablets for swimming pools, forcing the  evacuation of about 28,000 residents from the cities of Commerce, Montebello,  Monterey Park and unincorporated areas of East Los Angeles.  </P></p>

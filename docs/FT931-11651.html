			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Mulroney damps rumours he will go PRIME MINISTER Brian Mulroney of Canada has damp down speculation that he will resign before the general election later this year. However, his message, delivered to members of his Progressive Conservative caucus and to several possible contenders for his job, falls short of a commitment to stay. Mr Mulroney is said to have told MPs that in the absence of an announcement that he is resigning, they should assume he is staying on. Some political observers still think it possible that the prime minister, who has held office since September 1984, will quit within the next month or two. The Tories continue to lag far behind the opposition Liberals in opinion polls, and Mr Mulroney's personal popularity is at rock-bottom. The latest Gallup poll gives Liberals the backing of 49 per cent of decided voters, compared to 19 per cent for the Tories. In preparation for the coming campaign, Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader, last week began a series of speeches in which he plans to outline the results of an exhaustive review of party policy. Mr Chretien pledged that a Liberal government would reduce the federal budget deficit both in absolute terms and relative to gross domestic product. The Liberals would 'seek to cancel' a CDollars 4.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) contract placed by the Canadian armed forces last year for European EH-101 anti-submarine helicopters. Mr Chretien has also promised to scrap the 7 per cent goods and services tax, introduced in 1991, which has proved one of the heaviest millstones around Mr Mulroney's neck. The Tories have challenged Liberals to specify how they would replace revenue generated by the GST. Meanwhile, the government said yesterday that Mr Mulroney would meet US President Bill Clinton in Washington later this week.</p>

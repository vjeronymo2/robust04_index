			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoran Petrov: "The Thorny Path Leading to </F> Self-Discovery"]    [Text] It is now clear that the Ministry of Internal  Affairs is still not free from a variety of political pressures.  What happened to the "eight" who were the main protagonists in  numerous affairs and subsequent police cases? We have a variety  of collages of police cases, scandals, and affairs.    One of the most disrupted institutions of the system, the  first to be hit by the so-called new democratic changes, was,  unquestionably, the police. Even the most superficial study of  the situation that has developed over the past three to four  years would reveal the existence of politics in all areas of  Macedonian governmental affairs. A look at the work of the  Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] would show that, once again, the  police were one of the most extensively discussed items on its  agenda, judging by the heat generated by the debates and various  accusations.    What is now clear is that the Ministry of Internal Affairs  (MVR) has still not attained the quality expected by the  Macedonian public. It should be nonpoliticized and  party-neutral, with the sole task of maintaining peace and order  in the state, protect the citizens and, naturally, their  property, and above all, treat equally all subjects of the  state, regardless of their party, political, or ideological  affiliation. Internal quarrels, power struggles, and, above all,  divisiveness unquestionably remained the main features of that  ministry. Even the latest actions taken by Pavle Trajanov, the  former deputy minister for operational activities of the MVR,  related to open charges that some government departments had  become involved with organized crime, and the cover-ups and  denials issued by his boss, Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, most  clearly indicate the insurmountable split within the Macedonian  police. Actually, one way or another, such relations are part of  the history of the MVR.  <H5>  As a Starter, the Eight </H5>   The first known police affair took place in 1989-90. It is  referred to as "the case of the eight." It was eight  high-ranking police officials who promoted the use of the  then-existing primary organization of the League of Communists  in settling matters with the Republic's internal affairs  secretariat, which brought to the surface a number of  machinations, abuses, and distortions in the work of the police  authorities. The group consisted of Pavle Trajanov, Slobodan  Bogoevski, Stanoja Bogev, Grozdan Cvetkovski, Aleksandar  Dinevski, Mile Ilievski, Bedjet Bedjeti, and Jovan Caminski.  Bearing in mind the fact that Aleksandar Andonovski, the former  secretary, reacted to their initiative with a repressive measure  (all of them were suspended), they made their demands and views  public. Initially the Belgrade media and, subsequently, the  Macedonian press actively discussed the arguments of the  initiators and, as we know, at that time the "case of the eight"  was also considered by the highest party and state Macedonian  bodies (the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and  the Central Committee of the Communist League of Macedonia).  Vasil Tupurkovski and Petar Gosev were actively involved in  dealing with that matter. They threw their full support to the  "rebels," as a result of which changes were made in the then  police leadership (Republic Secretary Andonovski and his deputy  Kompyanov were replaced). However, no real change occurred in  the structure of the service.    Quite interesting in this context is the subsequent fate of  the eight, for in a number of areas it was precisely they who  were the main protagonists in police investigations. They  achieved their real "rehabilitation" during the period of  pluralism, following the appointment of Jordan Mijalkov (who  tragically died in an accident on 19 December 1991) as minister  of internal affairs. Trajanov and Bogoevski were appointed to  the highest possible positions of under secretaries of public  and state security, respectively. Bedzet and Bogoev were given  deputy positions; Cvetkovski was appointed director of the  Security Cadre Training Center. Ilievski was made councilor,  while Dinevski and Caminski were given command positions.  Essentially, the first case was the suicide of Mile Ilnevski in  May 1992, which was caused, according to subsequent reports, by  emotional disturbance. Still, the unofficial version of the  event was that the reason for this nervous illness which led to  Ilnevski's suicide was triggered by his awareness that his home  telephone had been tapped on the instruction of his former  "fellow fighters," headed by Bogoevski, and suspicions that he  too had been involved in the then affair of the "bomb throwers"  in Veles.    The second case, which bore all the marks of a real  police-political scandal, took place in August of that same  year, under the "management" of Aleksandar Dinevski, the head of  the SDB [State Security Service]. The official police version  was that official documents were found in Dinevski's possession,  which he had passed on to the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian  National Unity]. At the news conference which took place on that  subject, he accused the MVR of illegal tapping of telephones,  including that of the VMRO-DPMNE. Subsequently, Dinevski became  a member of that party and today is member of its leadership in  the Cair township in Skopje. All that remained of this entire  scandal was the Duvlo case (repeatedly raised in the Macedonian  Parliament), and the frequent subject of party influences in the  police. Meanwhile, immediately after Dinevski, Jovan Caminski,  one of the "eight," left the police. He was transferred from  chief to private counsel. Today he is in private business. It is  believed that he is too has ties with the MVR, with one of the  former "eight," Pavle Trajanov.  <H5>  Are the Police Becoming Politicized? </H5>   Of the former compact group of "rebels," only Trajanov and  Bogoevski were left in leading MVR positions. They actually  controlled the entire police organization. That is precisely why  the public was quite surprised to learn that the public security  under secretary was made deputy minister for operative affairs  (November 1993). In the police hierarchy, this is a very high  rank. Trajanov himself said at that time that he was surprised  by the government's decision and that the reasons for this act,  in his view, lie elsewhere rather than the official statement of  the minister that it was a matter of routine cadre rotation in  anticipation of the reorganization of the MVR and the  elimination of the position of assistant secretary. It was  public knowledge that this was the result of reliable  information provided to the press concerning the then topical  affair of the "all-Albanian paramilitary force." Along with  this, the claim was made public that Trajanov was replaced  because of his closeness to Petar Gosev's Democratic Party.    The latter view became topical once again after Trajanov's  statement to NOVA MAKEDONIJA, dated 12 March 1994, to the effect  that some government ministries had become involved with  organized crime, which excited the public once again. The  government held a meeting on this subject and its views were  presented at a news conference by Minister Ljubomir Frckovski,  who distanced himself from the statements of his assistant and  asked the latter to back up his claims by citing criminal  charges within a "reasonable period" of about 10 days. The five  or six criminal activities described by the MVR Operative  Affairs Department apparently were not considered a sufficient  argument by Frckovski. On his suggestion, therefore, on 4 April  last, by removing Trajanov from the government, he was once  again transferred (without any explanation) from the function of  assistant minister to senior adviser, which, in terms of police  terminology (and practice) is the last position to be held prior  to retirement. What gives a political slant to this entire case  is the fact that Trajanov's statement according to which the  government was involved in organized crime, issued immediately  before the elections at district 103 in the Skopje area, was  exploited to the utmost by the Democratic Party in its electoral  campaign, while at the television duel on the A-1 television  channel between Aleksandar Tortevski (Democratic Party) and  Nikola Popovski (SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of  Macedonia]), the latter directly accused Trajanov of acting  together with Gosev by supplying his party with confidential  police data (unequivocally related to the Dinevski case).    The ex-assistant minister rejected this claim as groundless  and tendentious slander, emphasizing his initial statement that  organized crime has penetrated the executive branch. Regardless  of the final resolution of this case, it is obvious that  internal upheavals and disagreements within the MVR are  continuing, along with questions related to the involvement of  individual cadres in party affairs. The process of conversion of  that ministry is, obviously, not an easy one. This is quite  clearly taking place in connection with a variety of political  pressures and influences. Still, this phenomenon clearly stands  out among other numerous political-police affairs, scandals, and  events.  <H5>  From "Cavern" to "the Twenty" </H5>   The study of the case may lead to a general relative group  classification. The first group would include the purely  political police cases ("Tavern," "Blue Bird," and "Bulgarian  Tracks"), which were debated twice in the Assembly. In the first  case they were considered as specific agenda items; the second  time they were within the context of the question addressed at  Minister Frckovski. The second group of political scandals could  be described as "professional" or as a "criticism of MVR  actions." This includes the "Radolista," "Radovis," "Kuklis,"  "Bit Pazar," and "Djorce Petrov" cases, which were also  extensively and lengthily debated in the Macedonian Parliament  and about which one could stress as a characteristic feature the  fact that, one way or another, daily political activities were  the main actual reason. The third type of affairs, again  involving the MVR, could be described as one of "status" or  "interministerial." This includes, above all, the confrontation  between the ministry and the defense department (the "military  camps" case) and with the government's customs department on the  subject of levying some customs fees. Actually, the fourth group  consists of purely internal political scandals that pertain  mostly to the abuse of police professionalism, involving theft  and corruption among the police. Starting with October 1991,  with the "600,000 German marks case," as a result of which one  commanding officer and one chief of a political precinct were  suspended, and ending with the latest cases in Sveti Nikol,  Kocani, Tetovo, and Bitola, where, as a result of customs  dealings or engaging in black marketeering and resale, most  police chiefs were fired, the MVR has been a permanent topic of  discussion. The case of the December 1992 "twenty" which was  brought up in the first months of this year is special for not  belonging to any group but being something entirely separate. It  resembles the case of the "eight" not only because it is, once  again, a question of the work of state security personnel but  also the data submitted to the highest authorities in Macedonia  indicating major deformations and abuses in the statutory and  legal functions of the MVR. In this case, however, there was no  conclusion to this prototype, which ended only as a case that  did not result in major upheavals within the ministry.    In discussing the link between the police and politics, Dr.  Djoko Tozi, professor at the public security faculty in Skopje,  pointed out that this is a complex problem, after the system  essentially based on the political police, known in the past as  the "militia," broke down. According to him, this system favored  the police and the state authorities and institutions and  implemented its policy mainly with their help. With the  breakdown of socialism, Dr. Tozi points out, our police made a  serious attempt at changing itself. The way things are now,  however, it is totally unable to get rid of politics. Those in  power who openly claim that they absolutely oppose the  politicizing of the police are engaged in a political farce,  for, according to our interlocutor, the ruling party or class  cannot implement any one of its objectives without having any  influence on the police or in the army.    It is the general rule for countries in a state of  transition  that the first battle for power leads the parties to concentrate  on taking over the police. This is taking place in our country  as well, Tozi claims, in the course of which several scandals or  events emerge. This is a classical effort on the part of some  parties to take over the field of internal affairs. In his view,  one of the clearest examples of this was the conversion of a  high police official to the VMRO-DPMNE. We are familiar with  other types of deals and even with the skillfully created crisis  by the government among the coalition parties themselves in  putting their own people in leading positions in the police, as  was the case of the conflict between the LP and the SDSM. Some  parties insisted on having their own people in key positions  within the ministry, such as deputy secretary or assistant.    All of this, as Dr. Djoko Tozi insists, is the result of a  still undefined type of society and undefined relations within  the parties and their programs, and the fact that they are still  in the phase of structuring and developing their social base.  Within such an undefined status of the parties and an overall  lack of stability, it is normal to strengthen the role of the  police. That is why there is no scandal, affair, or case,  according to our interlocutor, in which the police are not  directly or indirectly involved. All it takes is to look at the  "Tavern," "Blue Bird," "Kuklis," "Radovis," and others,  according to Tozi, characterized by the fact that politics is  the most important of their features. These are, first of all,  political, and only then police cases, categorically claims the  professor at the security faculty. Considering that the purpose  of the MVR is, above all, to protect the interests of the  citizens, these examples clearly prove that they are working as  a function of politics. Most simply stated, we are facing a  political struggle for power within the police which, according  to Tozi, as a rule protects those who are in power.    Today the political police are not all that obvious, and it  cannot be as it was in the period when all had to think alike,  although, generally speaking, we cannot say that we have a  depoliticized police, Tozi stresses. Its framework from the past  remains and this is quite evident, Dr. Djoko Tozi and others  said.  <H5>  The Issue of Objective Factors </H5>   According to Dr. Borce Davitkovski, docent at the School of  Law in Skopje, several reasons contribute to the strengthening  of the authoritative or repressive agencies of the state, most  noteworthy among which are the police and the army. To begin  with, the aspects and trends of authoritarian and repressive  rule and behavior, familiar over the past 45 years of  development of Macedonia, have still not disappeared. According  to Davitkovski, in addition to these agencies this may be seen  in all other political factors, for there is a constant search  of traitors to the people and the state or else of enemies of  the Macedonian cause. These are recurrences of the old system  and in this case it is more a question of a mentality or a way  of behaving. I claim that in the next 50 years as well this will  be reflected also in the attitude of the administrative  authorities and the other activists, our interlocutor insists.    The second reason, according to Davitkovski, is the factor  that there is no true opposition in Macedonia, which in the  present parliamentary structure would be realistic, and would  act as a real shock absorber of the current political powers. On  the contrary, Davitkovski categorically claims that we have a  so-called double opposition: one within the parliament, which  itself holds an inferior position, and a second within the  government, which manifests itself only when it deems suitable.  Such major factors provide a particularly fertile soil for  strengthening the role of the police. The third and perhaps most  important reason is the fact that in Macedonia there still has  been no operational definition of the constitutional stipulation  governing the division of powers. No amortization instruments  between the legislative, executive, and judiciary have been  provided for. Even within the executive authorities, Dr.  Davitkovski says, no laws govern relations among its agencies.  Taking into consideration the fact that no law has yet been  passed on the administration of the state, the administrative  authorities and the police work on the basis of rules of the  past, based on the principle of the unity of power and not its  separation, the logical result of which is the domination of the  executive over the legislative authority and, within this  framework, the domination of the state organs, including the  police. Adding to this the fact that the judiciary, which relies  on the police, has still not been structured, that same police  assume a dominant position and objectively are in a position of  being in charge of matters outside their jurisdiction, Dr.  Davitkovski says.    The fourth major reason, in his view, which objectively  determines the superiority of the police over the other social  areas, is the process of their internal depoliticization. The  people who work in the MVR, Davitkovski stresses, have been  trained on the basis of a different system and a different way  of acting. Therefore, they cannot lose overnight their way of  thinking and acting. This will take a long time, along with the  democratic evolution of the entire society.    The fact in which the views of Dr. Djoko Tozi and Dr. Borce  Davitkovski coincide is the basic concept on the appearance,  organization, shape, and way of work of the depoliticized  police. This, according to them, means establishing the  principle of absolute professionalism in the work of that body.  <H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5> <H5>  Dr. Djoko Tozi, Professor at the Public Security Faculty in </H5> Skopje  <H5>  There Still Is Fear of the Police </H5>   A specific situation has developed in Macedonia. The police,  which at the time of the withdrawal of the former Yugoslav  People's Army were the only armed Macedonian component following  the independence of the state, were also one of the most  privileged institutions. As the only organized force during what  may have been the most critical period for Macedonia, the police  acquired great authority and a high reputation.    However, after the proclamation of independence of the state  and the restoration of pluralism, and the numerous  political-police affairs and scandals, once again the ordinary  people experienced the old fear and mistrust of the police. A  most common example is the following: Three weeks ago, in a  television debate with the minister of internal affairs, the  greatest number of viewers who asked questions insisted on  remaining anonymous. What does this prove? Is this not an  example of the reservation which the people still feel when it  comes to the police? That is why I claim that the restoration of  reciprocal trust is a duty, a historical process of the  depoliticization of the police.  <H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5> <H5>  Dr. Borce Davitkovski, Docent, Law School in Skopje </H5> <H5>  A Democratic Police Acts Automatically </H5>   Let us take France as an example. In that country the  minister of police may be a socialist, a communist, a Christian  Democrat, a fascist, or a neofascist. To the police itself this  is not all that important, for the police know their work: to  protect the constitutional and legal order in France and the  human rights and freedoms. Regardless of whether communists or  fascists are demonstrating, the police stand aside. However, the  moment the demonstrators threaten private property or the safety  of the citizens, break a shop window, or beat up a passerby, the  police act mercilessly. This is automatic. The police are not  interested in whether the demonstrators may be ideologically  supporters of their minister. That is precisely why we must see  to it that our police are properly trained, expert, and  professional with clearly defined obligations. Unfortunately, we  are still waiting for this.</p>

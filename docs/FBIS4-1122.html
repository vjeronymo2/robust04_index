			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front -- AVF] and the Conservative Party [CP] would  not participate in the elections, right-wing leader Ferdi  Hartzenberg told a press conference in Pretoria on Thursday [21  April]. He said the decision had been taken because the African  National Congress and the government would not give guarantees  that a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] would be created if the  right- wing obtained sufficient support in the elections. He  added that if the ANC and government reacted positively to the  right-wing's preconditions, the AVF and CP would be prepared to  negotiate about the matter.    Dr Hartzenberg said the ANC's Carl Niehaus had said the  rightwing would not be granted a volkstaat, whether it  participated in the elections or not, while Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer's stance had been that he was  not conversant with the content of possible agreements in this  regard.    Dr Hartzenberg said these developments came after Freedom  Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen asked the AVF and CP on  Wednesday to participate in the election on a provincial level  in order to prove support for the volkstaat. Dr Hartzenberg  said he had told Gen Viljoen that, with no constitutional  guarantee of a volkstaat and self-determination being granted if  sufficient support emerged, it would not be possible to  participate.    Dr Hartzenberg said the FF should boycott the elections if  these guarantees were not written into the constitution. The  FF, AVF and CP could then put pressure on the government and ANC  to grant the guarantees.    Gen Viljoen's decision to participate without these prior  guarantees meant that he was signing away his right to  self-determination and placed it in the hands of the SACP [South  African Communist Party]/ANC, Dr Hartzenberg said.    Gen Viljoen was invited to attend the news conference but  did  not.    Asked what action the AVF would now take, Dr Hartzenmberg  said they did not have specific plans, apart from following the  "route of resistance", because they were not revolutionary.  "That is why we formed the citizens councils to make our  demands clear and to force our will on the incoming government."    He was unaware of AWB [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging;  Afrikaner Resistance Movement] mobilisation plans to "secure"  the [Orange] Free State and Transvaal.    State President F W de Klerk told a separate news conference  in Pretoria it was too late for the rightwing to participate in  the elections unless they did so under the FF's banner. There  was no time for new constitutional negotiations.    Mr de Klerk understood that Dr Hartzenberg's requests were  subject to preconditions which required further negotiations and  this was logistically impossible.    The FF, in the meantime, said the following CP-controlled  town councils had declared their support for the FF in the  election: Ermelo, Middelburg, Secunda, Standerton, Witbank and  Meyerton. Other councils were expected to follow, the FF's chief  secretary, Joseph Chiole said.</p>

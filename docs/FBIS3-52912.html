Radio Pakistan's Peshawar correspondent reports that  about 5,000 Afghan nationals have crossed over to Pakistan since  the fighting erupted on New Year's Day. More than 60 diplomats  and UN mission personnel arrived in Peshawar before the latest  resumption of fighting. These diplomats belong to Saudi Arabia,  Iran, Libya, Turkey, India, Sudan, and Somalia. They have  temporarily closed their missions in Kabul. At least 15,000  have fled Kabul during the cease-fire to take shelter in  Jalalabad. The influx of more people into Jalalabad continues.    A spokesman of Afghanistan's Nigrar-e Jehad-e Shura told the  Radio Pakistan correspondent that arrangements are being made to  settle refugees in camps near Jalalabad. He said the Pakistan  Government has sent food and other items for the settlement. An  emergency meeting presided over by the UN High Commission for  Refugees was held in Peshawar, and reviewed the settlement  arrangements of the new refugees. The meeting was told that  teams have been sent to Jalalabad to assess the needs of the  refugees. The meeting, which was attended by officials of the UN  High Commission for Refugees, was told that the Pakistan  Government will extend all possible help to the non-governmental  agencies to send essential items to Jalalabad.    Meanwhile, reports from Kabul say Fort Bala Hissar and the  Microryan District are centers of the latest fighting. These  are the strongholds of the forces under General Abdul Rashid  Dostam. Two people were killed while fleeing Microryan on  bicycles when they tried to cross a bridge separating the  warring factions.</p>

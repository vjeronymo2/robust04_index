			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Swans designers win a reprieve Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, was given a last chance of survival yesterday when Price Waterhouse, the receivers, postponed making the yard's design team redundant, Chris Tighe writes. The remaining 103 team members were reprieved after more than two hours of hard negotiation between the receivers and union officials. Loss of the design team would have made it impossible for Swan Hunter to tender for more work, in effect ensuring its demise by ending prospects of its sale as a going concern. Nearly all the 103 will now go on September 30 unless, against great odds, a going-concern sale can be finalised. The decision to defer the redundancies will mean an additional wage bill of about Pounds 100,000. Previous deadlines of August 31 and September 9 were waived because of proposals, since withdrawn, for bids from Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 15 (CTK) -- Democratic Left Party  (SDL) Chairman Peter Weiss said in an interview for CTK today  that he appreciated the expression of trust in him expressed by  the party's Executive Committee last night in voting not to  remove him from office.    Weiss had offered to resign as chairman after inadvertently  voting for the government's 1994 budget proposal, which he had  strongly opposed from the beginning. The Executive Committee  decided last night not to accept his resignation.    "I especially appreciate that the SDL bodies are able to  discuss democratically, openly, and without raising of voices  "such personally and politically complex problems such as I  caused with my mistaken vote," he said.    Weiss said that the conditions under which the SDL would  agree to participate in the broader coalition government called  for by President Michal Kovac were defined by the limits of the  party's program. "The decisive thing for us would be the kind of  support such a government would be able to muster in parliament,  and how it would be composed," he said.    The development of the political situation hangs primarily  on  that part of the deputies group of the ruling Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which rejects confrontational and  uncooperative policies and recognizes its joint responsibility  for the deepening of the political crisis. "We can't make that  decision for them," Weiss said.    Weiss avoided answering directly the question whether or not  he would accept the present premier and HZDS leader, Vladimir  Meciar, as head of the broad coalition government. He mentioned  Meciar's statement on Friday [14 January] that he (Meciar) had  made serious offers to SDL regarding the creation of a  coalition, but said it was impossible to consider the offer  seriously, given Meciar's controversial statements after his  return from the United States in 1993, that "SDL participation  in the government was unacceptable abroad." On the other hand,  Meciar said another day that the SDL had missed a historical  chance when it passed up creating a coalition with the HZDS,  Weiss noted.    "The HZDS idea that the SDL will provide experts to push for  HZDS policies without any possibility of criticism is simply  naive. A coalition does not mean that the HZDS will be  exclusively in power, while the SDL would exclusively bear the  responsibility," Weiss stressed.    The SDL has not yet received any signals that the HZDS wants  to correct its policy, he added.    In 1994, the SDL wants to contribute to overcoming the  domestic political crisis, which the creation of the HZDS-SNS  coalition government had failed to do.    "We must be prepared for a situation when the ratio of  forces  in the parliament changes to an extent which makes power sharing  possible. We are a party not indifferent to the fate of our  homeland, but interested in building a prosperous state. We are  aware of our share of responsibility for Slovakia's direction,"  Weiss added.</p>

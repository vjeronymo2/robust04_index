			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK regulation The news that the Securities and Investments Board is looking again at regulation of the UK equity market is certainly welcome. After the controversy over market manipulation and the degree of control exercised by SG Warburg during the BT3 issue, some clear and widely accepted guidelines need to be established before further large equity issues come to market. Yet the SIB and the Stock Exchange seem to have retained the leisurely approach which led to the BT3 problem in the first place. Almost a year elapsed between the Wellcome and BT3 issues during which time little was agreed. Now the SIB has given itself until the turn of the year to produce a discussion document, while the secondary offer of the generators' shares may well take place in the spring. The Stock Exchange, which scarcely covered itself in glory over BT3, is now not prepared even to venture an opinion on the subject. The self-regulatory framework has attracted great criticism, and practitioners must now prove that they have something to add to the operation of the system. If some of the simpler problems cannot be quickly resolved, inefficiency may be added to the charge of ineffectiveness. Utility regulators work reasonably well without the presence of water or electricity company chief executives on their panels. The time is fast approaching when the financial services industry will have to demonstrate why it is so very different.</p>

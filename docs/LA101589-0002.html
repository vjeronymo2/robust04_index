			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELP! HIS BEST FRIEND IS TURNING INTO A SHEEP!;  </P> <P> A WILD SHEEP CHASE BY HARUKI MURAKAMI; TRANSLATED FROM THE JAPANESE BY ALFRED  BIRNBAUM(KODANSHA INTERNATIONAL: $18.95; 320 PP.)  </P> <P> I remember an afternoon picnic in Bel-Air that a motion-picture executive gave  to honor the visit of my husband. He warmly welcomed my two sons standing  beside me. Then, as if I were not there at all, he stepped forward to greet the  next incoming guests, ignoring me completely, assuming automatically that any  non-Caucasian accompanying children to their home was an au pair or a nanny,  hardly an invited guest.  </P> <P> So much for image and preconception -- and prejudice, appearance as opposed to  reality. And yet it is image, often self-conscious and self-deluding,  superficial and affected, that explains, I think, the phenomenal popularity of  the work of Haruki Murakami in Japan -- especially with the young, that  generation of Japan's postwar baby boom who began to come of age in the '60s  preaching revolution and has wound up reading manga -- comic books -- on  crowded commuter trains.  </P> <P> These are the people who have taken their places sheep-like on the conveyor  belt of Japanese society as salaried men and housewives, but still like to  harbor images of themselves as cool and hip and laid-back, sophisticated and  aware, and, yes, above all, Western. In their hierarchy of taste, a Burger King  hamburger and a piece of the Colonel's chicken rank higher than sushi. Phony is  the Western word that most easily comes to mind.  </P> <P> Murakami's two most recent novels, whose titles in Japanese are "Norwegian  Wood," as in the Beatles' song title, and "Dance, Dance, Dance," as in the  English expression, have sold about 5 million copies, cloth, in Japan. Young  Japanese readers are said to be as much taken with Murakami's own personal life  style as with his books themselves. After graduation from college, instead of  getting a corporate job, he ran his own coffee shop. He also embarked upon a  career as a translator, serving the work of American writers such as Raymond  Carver.  </P> <P> "A Wild Sheep Chase" is an earlier novel of Murakami's that evidences both his  celebrated flair and his characteristic weaknesses. First, he is immensely  readable, his pages as easily consumable as bar peanuts. In a staccato,  hard-boiled American style, he tattoos out short, snappy sentences of  world-weary deadpan. And he is as promiscuous in name-brand dropping as some of  the more notorious American brand-name novelists.  </P> <P> Here is a sample paragraph from "A Wild Sheep Chase":  </P> <P> "It was already dark out. I slipped some change, my cigarettes and a lighter  into my pocket, put on my tennis shoes, and stepped outside. At my neighborhood  dive, I drank a beer while listening to the latest Brothers Johnson record. I  ate my chicken cutlet while listening to a Bill Withers record. I had some  coffee while listening to Maynard Ferguson's Star Wars. After all that, I felt  as if I'd hardly eaten anything."  </P> <P> Does it not sound more like a black Raymond Carver or a recycled Raymond  Chandler or some new ghetto private eye than a contemporary Japanese novelist?  And if it were not for the next sentence -- "They cleared away my coffee cup  and I put three ten-yen coins into the pink public phone and rang up my  partner" -- the Martian reader could scarcely guess that the description  rendered is theoretically one of contemporary Japan.  </P> <P> I don't remember Murakami's plots as ever having been considered one of his  strong points as a writer. In fact, no one I know can quite recall any of them.  And after reading "A Wild Sheep Chase" in both English and Japanese I am still  hard put to sum it up. But let me at least try to give you a sense of the book.  Its basic structure is that of a mystery or suspense novel. Unfortunately, the  mystery and suspense do not begin until about halfway through. Up to that  point, it seems successively a meditation and memoir about the existential  generation of the '60s; an examination of an ear fetish which might be  interpreted either as a homage or a satire of Tanazaki's well known foot  fixation; and a chronicle of the dissolution of a marriage in which  communication has been so poor that it is not until the partners' final parting  that the idea of either possibly ever having wanted to have children comes up.  </P> <P> After the extended throat-clearing comes the kind of traditional ghost tale  that both children and manga readers might enjoy. This involves a power-hungry  sheep, with a peculiar star brand on its back, which, starting with Genghis  Khan himself, has entered into people, Dybbuk-like, and taken over their lives  until it decides to move on, self-exorcised, leaving the vacated human premises  tragically weak and helpless. One of the victims of the sheep is a right-wing  political boss, another is a sheep professor, and a third is a teen-age friend  of the hero. Which explains how the hero, himself a most passive ad-agency  co-owner, is drawn into the proceedings.  </P> <P> Finally, I must say I felt strange reading something so imitative and  derivative in tone from American writing in English translation. I am not sure  anyone in Japan ever has talked the way Murakami's characters do. Not that  Alfred Birnbaum's excellent translation has not gotten Murakami's sentences  down exactly right. But it is Murakami himself who seems more interested in  imitation than in substance, in appearance and image than in reality. And so,  too, do his millions of young readers, who evidently prefer browsing through  manufactured- product labels and borrowed images than in feeling the raw levels  inherent in genuine human emotion.  </P></p>

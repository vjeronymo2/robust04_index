			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE LEAF-BLOWER AS MIND-BLOWER  </P> <P> Minor as my complaint may be, it is nonetheless aggravating. It is the newest  infernal machine: the leaf-blower!  </P> <P> They are analogous to motorcycles that never move! They just rev and roar until  everyone within the infernal machine's noise zone is moved but mental  millimeters away from madness and mayhem.  </P> <P> I realize that brooms are passe, but at least broomsters would, at the end of  their sweepings, stoop to pick up what they had assembled. The leaf-blowers do  not remove what is being blown -- they but relocate it!  </P> <P> No doubt these monsters are here to stay but must they be made so powerful  that, even muffled, they are outrageously offensive? Please support the  legislation that is offered to tone down this pure pollution device!  </P> <P> DAN DELEHANT, La Habra  </P></p>

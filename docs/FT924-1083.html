			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Travel: A white, white Christmas - Skiing / Arnold Wilson reports on what looks like being a vintage year HOWITZER shells and dynamite exploded outside my hotel before dawn, rattling the windows and, in the darkness, conjuring up images of some war-torn trouble spot. But this was neither Bosnia nor Beirut, but the 'Bird'. And the enemy was snow: too much of it for comfort, but enough to make skiers ecstatic. Downstairs in the lobby of the huge, futuristic Cliff Lodge Hotel in Snowbird, Utah, was a sign with big red lettering reading: 'Danger of avalanches. It is illegal to leave the building'. Much to the delight of skiers on both sides of the Atlantic, December has turned out to be a vintage month for snow. Skiers were knee-deep in fresh powder during the traditional curtain-raiser to the season in Val d'Isere, the criterium de la premiere neige. Austria has had one of the best starts to the season for years, with good snow everywhere, to depths of 3.5 metres. Marion Telsnig at the Austrian Tourist Office says some skiers are already reporting the best skiing they have ever experienced. The Swiss are also confident of a good season but in Italy, the snow is a little patchy and so far no one is using superlatives. In California, where there is officially a drought, an unprecedented 38 inches of snow fell in a day in Kirkwood, south of Lake Tahoe. So much snow fell in Snowbird and neighbouring Alta that the road through Little Cottonwood Canyon down to Salt Lake City - notorious for avalanches - was closed all night until it was made safe by blasting. On the mountain, supplies of second world war shells for avalanche control are running low, so the resort is now using shells left over from the Korean war at Dollars 100 a go, and working on a new system using compressed air which will cost only Dollars 10 a blast. Even in Colorado, somewhat jealous of the major early snowstorms hitting California, Utah and even Vermont, snow was falling steadily during the party to celebrate the opening night (at last) of the town's biggest and most controversial hotel, the Ritz Carlton. A layer of fresh powder formed on the 12-ft tall bronze statue of a bull elk standing guard outside - nicknamed 'Fritzy' - which was officially unveiled before the celebrations began. Dawn revealed an Aspen mountain full of powder and few skiers, celebrities or otherwise, to take advantage of it. We were able to help ourselves to run after run, unhindered by the madding crowd, making fresh tracks almost at will. There is even enough snow left in New Zealand to enable skiing to continue here and there until Christmas. Many resorts in Europe and America are assured not only of a white Christmas but one of the best for skiing in years. The lure of the Rockies continues to entice some Europeans away from their own backyard. For a group of Belgian, German and Dutch ski club executives, the first taste of skiing this winter was in Colorado, where two more Europeans - Franz Klammer and Franz Weber - were holding a ski clinic in Copper Mountain. Weber, six times world speed skiing champion in the '80s, now lives in Reno. His fellow Austrian Klammer - the darling of Innsbruck and Kitzbuhel - is a regular visitor to Colorado. For those of us attending the clinic, it was fantasy time. The man skiing at more than 50 miles per hour in front of us down a trail called Oh No] - whom I was trying to keep in my sights like a Spitfire pilot on the tail of a Messerschmidt - is the most successful downhill racer of all time. I had waited for this moment since 1976, when the most celebrated of his 25 downhill victories at Igls in the Innsbruck Olympics astonished the skiing world. Right now, Klammer seemed to be trying to relive the experience, although he was putting in a few turns. Any other skier in any other resort would probably have had his lift pass taken away. 'Did you do as many turns as I did?' he asks at the bottom of the mountain. 'No Franz,' I replied wimpishly. 'Why not?' 'Because you are almost 10 years younger than me.' 'No excuses]' he says. Now approaching 40, Klammer looks as good as ever. He and Weber are helping us with race techniques. 'Even if you win, you should never be satisfied,' says Klammer. 'You should always want to have skied it faster. You should say to yourself: 'Dammit, that wasn't good enough.' Don't slide so much. You must carve your turns more. When you have crossed the fall line, you should be able to see your tracks behind you. If there are no tracks, your skis are sliding too much.' Klammer still races against other former champions. Recently, he was fighting it out in Utah against the likes of Bill Johnston (whom he called 'nose-picker' when he won the Olympic gold medal in Sarajevo in 1984.) 'Of course, I try to keep in touch with new skiing trends as I get older,' he says. 'But you know, skiing has not changed fundamentally since I learnt to ski with leather boots, cable bindings and no edges. When I was a boy, only racers had edges. But even today, you still have to stay on the middle of your skis. 'In the old days, it was more difficult. Soft leather boots didn't support you and you had to find your own middle. Nowadays the boot does it for you, and today's skis are built to turn on their own, once you apply pressure to your edges. That's why you get more knee injuries than you used to. If for some reason the ski failed to turn, the weakest part of your body will turn instead - your knees]' And with that he was off, steaming down the mountain as if his knees were bionic. Klammer will be home for Christmas. Colorado powder or not, he plans to enjoy some of the local variety in his native Carinthia.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUASAR MUST PAY $2.5 MILLION IN BIAS CASE  </P> <P> A subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has been ordered to pay  nearly $2.5 million in penalties and costs for discriminating against  non-Japanese staff in the United States, lawyers said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The ruling by federal Judge James Alesia stems from a jury verdict returned in  1988 against Quasar Corp. of Franklin Park, Ill.  </P> <P> Three former employees of Quasar sued the company alleging that they were fired  in 1986 during a cutback but that their Japanese counterparts in management  were not.  </P> <P> They also said non-Japanese managers were excluded from meetings where the  reductions were discussed and that the company maintained a different salary  and evaluation structure for its non-Japanese workers.  </P> <P> Matsushita, which recently agreed to buy entertainment giant MCA Inc. for $6.13  billion, distributes consumer electronic goods in the United States under the  Quasar, Panasonic and Technics brands.  </P> <P> A spate of purchases of major American properties by Japanese concerns has  raised fears that heavy foreign investment is compromising American  independence.  </P> <P> A court order telling Quasar to pay nearly $2.5 million in penalties, court  costs and legal fees was issued Friday and distributed Tuesday by the law firm  that represented the three former workers.  </P> <P> The court found that Quasar violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlaws  discrimination by employers on the basis of national origin.  </P> <P> Quasar issued a statement saying it was disappointed by the ruling and will  appeal.  </P></p>

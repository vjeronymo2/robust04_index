			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] delegation to the Lusaka peace talks is still in  Huambo for instructions. It is scheduled to return to Lusaka  tomorrow.    Rumors in Lusaka speak of a government document detailing  the  portfolios to be given to UNITA -- namely, the Provinces of  Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, and ambassadorial posts in  Cape Verde, Algeria, Mexico, and UNESCO. At the central level,  the rumors say UNITA would be given the portfolios of tourism  and hotel industry, and construction materials. There are other  portfolios, but unfortunately we have no details about them.    UNITA wishes to have the portfolios of territorial  administration and geology and mines. It also wants its deputy  ministers in the defense, information, and other ministries.  UNITA is scheduled to comment on the government offer tomorrow,  following Blondin Beye's meeting with Jonas Savimbi.    It has been report that the UN Security Council has  adjourned  its meeting on Angola for 16 March, pending UNITA's response to  the government offer. A UN Angola Verification Mission aircraft  will fly to Huambo tomorrow to fetch UNITA's Eugenio Manuvakola,  Jorge Valentim, and Isaias Samakuva and bring them to Lusaka.  They have been in Huambo since 12 March receiving instructions  from Jonas Savimbi.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yim Chun-ung from UN Headquarters in New York] </F>   [Text] According to information received from a UN source  on 25 March, while discussing the adoption of a resolution  urging North Korea to allow additional nuclear inspections, the  United States, Britain, France, and Russia -- permanent member  nations of the UN Security Council -- are now considering  demanding that North Korea allow additional inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] within one month.    The source said: "The draft of the resolution prepared by  friendly nations stipulates that 'the IAEA should report, within  a month after it adopts a resolution on North Korea, if North  Korea observes the Nuclear Safeguards Accord.'" It added:  "This means North Korea is urged to allow additional  inspections within one month."    The source also said: "If the UN Security Council decides to  adopt this draft, North Korea must have consultations with the  IAEA on the additional inspections within this period."    Prior to this, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix attended the  UN Security Council meeting held on 25 March and said: "In  order to maintain the continuity of nuclear inspections of North  Korea, an IAEA inspection team has to enter North Korea again in  six weeks to replace batteries and film."</p>

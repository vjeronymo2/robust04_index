			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] Continuing their fierce offensive on Gorazde, the  chetniks have since morning been launching extremely heavy  combined artillery and infantry attacks on (Borovo) from the  direction of Ustipraca, and on the right bank of the Drina River  from the direction of Cajnice. The aggressor has deployed very  strong forces, reinforced with newly arrived units from the  Uzice Corps, the Herzegovina Corps, and the Sarajevo-Mt.  Romanija Corps, and special units from Nis, which are equipped  with the most state-of-the-art weapons and the most lethal ones,  too.    The information from these areas indicates that extremely  heavy fighting is under way. The chetnik attacks on these  defense lines are continuing. The aggressor is pounding every  inch of these areas with mortars of the heaviest caliber. The  fighters of the Eastern Bosnia Operative Group of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, the unrelenting defenders of Gorazde,  are withholding all the attacks by these insane killers [word  indistinct] to enter Gorazde as soon as possible.    There is total chaos in the clinic and the Gorazde war  hospital. Screams, cries, and the wailing of children. Several  people have been killed today by shells that have landed on the  town. The exact number is still unknown, but the deaths of  three children and two women have been confirmed. Dozens of  civilians have also been wounded, three of them children and one  woman very seriously.    The chetniks are shelling the surrounding villages, but we  have no information about the casualties from these areas.  During the day the aggressor has also intensified attacks on  all the other defense lines. The chetniks are simultaneously  reinforcing their forces, and concentrating them from the  direction of Foca, (Medici), and the Praca River valley .    The general alarm has been in force in Gorazde since this  morning owing to the shelling of the residential areas in the  region. The Gorazde defenders are putting up strong resistance  to the aggressor despite the inadequacy of their weapons.</p>

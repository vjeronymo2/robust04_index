			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Sri Lankans vote in peace Elections for Sri Lanka's regional councils took place peacefully yesterday, within a month of the assassination of two political leaders, Reuter reports from Colombo. 'It was a clean, a fair poll and incident-free. There was no violence. . . nothing, nil,' said a spokesman for the Police Election Office. The campaign was soured by the murders of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, blown up by a suicide bomber on May 1, and opposition leader Lalith Athulathmudali, gunned down on April 23.</p>

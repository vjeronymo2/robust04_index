			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> POLICY ON GRADES, ACTIVITIES PROPOSED  </P> <P> The Irvine Unified School District tonight will consider a new policy under  which a failing grade in any class would keep students out of most  extracurricular activities -- except sports.  </P> <P> The board will consider adopting what it calls a "no F" rule for student  activities that require participation for the entire school year, including  serving on the student council, the cheerleading squad and the pep squad.  </P> <P> The new policy would also require students to earn a 2.5 grade-point average on  a 4.0 scale and avoid unsatisfactory citizenship citations.  </P> <P> The proposed districtwide policy follows complaints by a Woodbridge High School  cheerleader that cheerleader and pep squad members were discriminated against  since they were the only ones to whom the "no F" rule applied. The cheerleader  also objected to the academic rules being different at each of Irvine's three  full-time high schools.  </P> <P> "I see this as a starting point for the discussion," said board member Greg  Smith, who asked that the new policies be placed on the board agenda. "Quite  frankly, I'll be quite interested to see why rules applied to cheerleaders  don't apply for other activities as well."  </P> <P> Students participating in sports, however, which are considered partial-year  activities, would have to earn only a 2.0 grade-point average and pass four  classes under the new rules, according to the staff report. Those requirements  are consistent with policies of the California Interscholastic Federation and  making them more stringent could put Irvine athletes at a competitive  disadvantage, the report said.

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average tumbles 3% on economic worries Mounting pessimism over the economy pulled down the futures market, prompting index-linked arbitrage selling which left the Nikkei average down 3.1 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei lost 556.35 to 17,384.84, while the Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 45.76, or 3 per cent to 1,493.83, its first fall below 1,500 since April 1. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.70 to 1,208.42. The index opened at a day's high of 17,905.59 and fell to a low of 17,254.53 just before the close. Arbitrage-linked selling from dealers, margin unwinding by individuals and futures selling by institutional investors weighed on share prices throughout the day. Volume totaled 287.5m shares against 263m. Share prices lost ground across the board, with declines overwhelming advances by 1,049 to 42, with 49 issues unchanged. Investors were discouraged by the failure of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to give details of an anticipated income tax cut. Officials also did little to help sentiment by denying the possibility of stock market support by the government. The financial failure of TSD, a software development company listed on the over-the-counter market, also sent jitters through the market. Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit research agency, said TSD filed for voluntary bankruptcy with liabilities totaling Y8.5bn. Mr Keith Donaldson, strategist at Salomon Brothers, said the psychological support level for the Nikkei was around 17,000, but added that share prices were in the bottom of their range. East Japan Railway plunged Y16,000, or 3.5 per cent, to Y440,000 while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y20,000 to Y745,000. Daishowa Paper, the scandal ridden paper company, was one of the few bright spots of the day, rising Y100 to Y1,160. The issue had previously met heavy selling after recent reports of the chairman's alleged involvement in a bribery scandal. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 718.29 to 19,481.45 in volume of 16.6m shares. Roundup There were suggestions that overseas investors were switching their portfolios out of the region. HONG KONG fell back on a weak futures market. The Hang Seng index closed down 93.30 at 9,170.64. Turnover was HKDollars 5.3bn. On the futures market the November Hang Seng contract lost 200 to 9,085, while December contracts lost 185 to 9,095. SINGAPORE was slightly firmer, with the Straits Times Industrials index ending up 4.09 at 2,096.72. Turnover was SDollars 546.8m. SEOUL was lower on profit-taking: the composite index shed 11.89 to 834.58. Sammi Steel went limit-up by gaining Won400 to Won8,680 on hopes that its US and Canadian plants will gain from Nafta. TAIWAN fell back in active trading ahead of Saturday's local government elections. The weighted index shed 30.15 to 4,216.94 in turnover of TDollars 25.5bn. MANILA was boosted by a new commercial issue, but late profit-taking brought prices off the day's peaks. The composite index rose 15.23 to 2,418.13. KUALA LUMPUR saw Tenaga Nasional continuing to attract institutional demand on its inclusion in Morgan Stanley's Global Index from December 2. The shares rose 70 cents to MDollars 15.90, off a high of MDollars 16.30. The composite index gained 4.40 to 989.40. AUSTRALIA was driven lower by aggressive futures selling.

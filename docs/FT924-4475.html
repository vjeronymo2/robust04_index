			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: Rare musical treats from 'Tender is the North' / Review of Lindberg and Sandstrom With two weeks still to run, the Barbican's Scandinavian festival is already a hands-down success. The idea of mounting a month's worth of music (and much else besides) from the Northern lands was wildly risky: all music-lovers know Grieg and Sibelius, and some Nielsen, but only a tiny fraction know anything else. There is a great deal more, as Barbican audiences are happily discovering; but it has been a colossal feat of planning both to lay on all these rich, obscure menus and to persuade audiences to come and try them. Friday's concert by Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony was a bold test-case. Surely a Magnus Lindberg premiere and a new trombone concerto by Jan Sandstrom were fare for a few hundred devotees in the Queen Elizabeth Hall?  -and what about that second half, given over to a long Serenade by Wilhelm Stenhammar (1871-1927)? Yet it all drew a large, enthusiastic house, duly rewarded by performances as keen as could be. Lindberg's Corrente II, a BBC commission, owes its 'II' to having developed from a shorter Corrente for just 16 players. Though 'Corrente' is Italian for the old courante dance-form, it literally means 'running'; and indeed this piece races breathlessly through most of its 20-odd minutes. Oliver Knussen's Coursing offers a succinct parallel - and so do the quickest movements of Berg's Lyric Suite, the original models for every atonal moto perpetuo since. In tonal music, a virtuoso torrent of even-notes may be almost too swift to follow, but slower-moving harmony will pin it down for the ear. Atonalists have to contrive different aural markers for their audiences: dramatic eruptions along the way, or radical contrasts of colour and weight. Here Lindberg (Finnish, b. 1958) has opted for a tight range of recurring chords, elaborated but not 'developed' in the hectic instrumental flow. On this first hearing the result sounded purposeful and consistent enough, with a nice appreciation of orchestral colour, but not so gripping as to fill up its length with drama. When the race was momentarily suspended - for a cadence from Purcell's 'Funeral Music', for example - we heard mere pauses-for-breath, not shifts to a new level; and by the end we knew the basic chords excessively well. Further hearing may discern extra dimensions, but this time Corrente II seemed to present a flatter profile than other recent pieces by Lindberg, despite its elegant figurations. Sandstrom is four years older, and Swedish. His Concerto was most specifically conceived for the remarkable trombonist and performance-artist Christian Lindberg (no relation to Magnus, as far as I know), who led the pictorial journey from mythical Greece through the Florida Everglades and Provence to aboriginal Australia with lusty motorbike fanfares, and in a biker's well-worn red leathers. Mutatis mutandis, we were hearing a contemporary equivalent of Ferde Grofe's Grand Canyon Suite. Lindberg himself was grossly engaging; there were inventively funny episodes, and celestial white-note inserts in Hollywood style. The audience enjoyed it all hugely. Johan Jeverud's programme-note assured us that Sandstrom's concerto is less 'eclectic' than any of his other recent music. That may be true, but the real charm of the thing lay in its playing-out of the mysterious Scandinavian sense of humour: rigidly deadpan but deeply silly, with rude noises. One can warm to that. Andrew Davis lavished sympathetic care on both those works, and even more on the opening and closing pieces. Nielsen's Maskarade Overture sang and fizzed; those of us who missed Opera North's first British production of the opera, 80 years late, kicked ourselves yet again. The marvel of the evening, however, was Stenhammar's expansive Serenade (1914, revised 1919), a Northerner's idyllic vision of Italy. Were it not Scandinavian, we should all have known it by heart long ago. Each of its five movements is enchanting, lit up by eager, well-schooled imagination and by judicious orchestral hints from Berlioz and Wagner. Davis made it irresistibly fresh. For jaded critics, there are few pleasures to compare with discovering that a piece you expected to be efficient and period-bound actually sends up live, heartfelt sparks. It deserves to make a bestselling CD.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Euro-bank chief vowsto attack policies which threaten Emu MR ALEXANDRE Lamfalussy, president-elect of the European Monetary Institute, has promised to be a strong critic of 'unbalanced' economic policies which threaten the European Community's objective of monetary union. In the first public indication of how he sees his role - contained in written answers to members of the European Parliament - Mr Lamfalussy also cast doubt on a return to the old European exchange rate mechanism, saying he was not sure it was 'a realistic objective'. Mr Lamfalussy is due to appear tomorrow before the parliament's committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy. MEPs must deliver an opinion on his candidacy before he can be formally confirmed as president of the Frankfurt-based forerunner of a European central bank. He is currently general manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. His written replies to the committee's questions were obtained yesterday by the Financial Times. The EMI will supervise the second stage of Emu, beginning on January 1 1994, and advise EC members on monetary and exchange rate policy leading up to full currency union by 1999. In his reply to the parliament's questionnaire, Mr Lamfalussy said the EMI would be more than just a passive observer of EC economic and monetary policy. In particular, he said he would be prepared to highlight any imbalances between monetary and fiscal and other economic policies which could jeopardise the Emu aims. 'I shall make it my duty to draw attention to the risks arising from an unbalanced policy mix,' he said. He indicated he would be ready to act decisively if monetary and economic policies appeared to be contradictory, and make full use of the EMI's power to encourage dialogue between central banks and governments. 'At a certain point . . . if and when divergencies persist, public opinion should be made aware of potential conflicts and of their possible consequences,' he said. Referring to August's decision to allow ERM currencies to fluctuate more widely, Mr Lamfalussy said the currency crises of the past 18 months had removed the 'disciplinary framework' which had helped promote convergence of monetary policies. He said co-ordinating monetary policies effectively in such a situation would be one of the EMI's main challenges. The EMI 'should spare no effort' to prevent exchange rate fluctuations undermining the single market, he said. But he added: 'I am sure that it would not be advisable to set any precise timetable for re-establishing a more constraining exchange rate mechanism.' Member states should wait until the business cycle had improved and renewed progress could be made towards 'broadly based convergence'.</p>

This will be known as the Robins B&hyph;1B EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air National Guard also proposes to modify training airspace that services the Savannah Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) area. Existing charted airspace which includes the Quick Thrust Military Operations Areas (MOAs), Fort Stewart MOAs, Gator MOAs, would be modified and named Coastal MOA. Restricted Area R&hyph;3007 would also be modified. These proposed modifications are primarily designed to accommodate realistic training requirements for military fighter units including Air Force, Navy and Marines and would also satisfy realistic training requirements of the B&hyph;1B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed actions under consideration would address the conversion of the F&hyph;15 aircraft to B&hyph;1B aircraft and the resultant potential environmental impacts at both sites, the airspace training requirements for the B&hyph;1B in the region, and the modification of training airspace servicing the Savannah CRTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air Force and Air National Guard are planning to conduct a series of Scoping meetings on the following dates and times at the indicated locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Details of review start to emerge IN THE furore surrounding the government's climbdown over the pit closures yesterday, details were last night starting to emerge of how the two-pronged review of mines would be carried out. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced that he would re-introduce the statutory 90-day review period before redundancy notices were issued to miners from the 10 pits still scheduled to close, in accordance with the 1975 Employment Protection Act. This requirement had been suspended last week. The review gives the collieries and mining unions 90 days to make pit-by-pit cases. At the end of the period the cases will be reviewed by British Coal. While it would be theoretically possible for a pit to persuade British Coal it should remain open, the corporation said 'it would be wrong to raise any hope that the outcome of these consultations will be that any of these 10 pits continue working'. For the remaining 21 pits, the threat of closure has been lifted for a 'moratorium' period. Mr Heseltine said British Coal and the government would use this time to set out the case for closures, to conduct a further review of energy policy and the coal industry, and to 'consult widely'. It was unclear last night whether the consultations would include only the mining unions, British Coal and the government, or whether they would extend to power generators, regulators and other industries.</p>

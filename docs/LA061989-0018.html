			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUR COLD PEACE WITH JAPAN;  </P> <P> AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP IS DEVELOPING, TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH  </P> <P> Japan is rapidly becoming America's new Soviet Union. The Cold Peace with Japan  is replacing the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Economic policy is replacing  foreign policy as the most critical determinant of national security; political  allies are becoming economic adversaries. And this sudden new circumstance, so  unpleasant for economists and politicians on both sides of the Pacific, is  inevitable and beneficial for both the United States and Japan.  </P> <P> The collapse of the Soviet Union has shifted America's attention from  geopolitics to geoeconomics. In this realm, honest American observers recognize  a discontinuity of historic proportions: Economic power and world leadership  have come uncoupled. Japan's dynamic economy has seized the momentum and  propelled the nation into the first position of global wealth; but Japan has no  view of its role in the world, no mission or purpose for its new-found economic  power. Indeed, most Japanese leaders associate the idea of a mission with the  rise of nationalism and the rise of nationalism with militarism and the folly  of World War II.  </P> <P> America retains its sense of mission, its moral vision and global purpose. But  its weakened economic vitality undermines both its credibility and  effectiveness as hegemonic world leader. The United States and Japan today  divide the four functions of world leadership: The United States is providing  global security and the key currency; Japan is assuming technological  leadership and global financial dominance. The two functions that Japan has  assumed directly threaten U.S. economic interests, making the current tensions  inevitable.  </P> <P> But why are these tensions beneficial for each side and the long-term  relationship? First, it is clear that Japan needs to change and cannot without  gaiatsu -- external pressure from the United States. So rapid has been Japan's  advance from ashes to affluence that virtually every institutional dimension in  its way of life desperately needs reform, or risk ending up an anachronistic  victim of Japan's economic success. For example, the Recruit Scandal pointed  out the need for political reform, not only to purge "money-politicb" from the  system but also to deal with a democracy in which only one party holds power  and rural voters have four votes for every one urban vote.  </P> <P> Land reform is essential, particularly in light of the 200% increase in Tokyo  land prices in the last three years. This land bubble has financed much of  Japan's push into foreign direct investments and created a whole new class of  Japanese millionaires. But it has also doubled the cost of buying a home --  from the equivalent of 6 years of a worker's salary to 12 years.  </P> <P> Social reform is on the agenda, for women, immigrant workers, and other  minorities, as is the need for a new Japanese consumerism. The Japanese  themselves talk about educational reform, by which they mean less rote learning  and more academic creativity. But a far more essential educational reform would  be to break the rigid dominance of the elite universities -- Tokyo University  in particular -- as the key determinant of ultimate career success. A more  pluralistic Japan would accept diplomas from a diverse set of universities,  including non-Japanese schools. And there is the issue of regional economic  development. While Japan boasts the highest per-capita gross national product  in the world, the figure, as an average, is misleading. Tokyo is rich. But  there are major regions of Japan that the economic miracle has left behind.  </P> <P> The need for these basic reforms suggests that Japan's new wealth has created a  new question: What is the purpose of economic growth in the 21st Century for  Japan? For the past 40 years, the purpose has been clear: to catch up. Now  Japan has caught up -- and more. And so the purpose of economic growth today is  more economic growth. Adversarial pressure from the United States is the only  way to interrupt this circularity and help the Japanese bring about the reforms  that they need.  </P> <P> What about the United States? If the U.S.-Soviet contest teaches anything, it  is the importance to the United States of a clear adversary. For Americans to  mobilize as a nation, there must be an "enemy at the gates" -- whether in the  form of a challenge from a Soviet Sputnik or a Japanese semiconductor. The  kinds of changes that America must make are as fundamental and far-reaching as  those facing Japan: educational reform, particularly in elementary and high  schools; worker training and retraining; technological reinvestment;  restructuring the federal government, and more, including an honest effort to  address the twin deficits that continue to plague the American economy.  </P> <P> And just as Japan faces new questions about its future, so does the United  States: What is America for in the 21st Century? America needs a refresher  course in its own national values and purposes, and a rededication to those  values in the context of a new world order. In the past, when faced with a  clear external adversary, the United States has proved its capacity for  self-rediscovery. Japan now offers America a chance for a new rebirth.  </P> <P> Ironically, the worsening of U.S.-Japanese relations will also prove beneficial  to the long-term relationship between the two countries. In some respects, the  two nations are only now coming to discover each other. Gone is the false glow  of early romance, replaced by a harsher but more accurate perception of  reality. The United States is seeing Japan as it is -- not as a clone of  itself, but as a distinct country with its own systems where even such familiar  terms as "democracy" and "capitalism" are put into practice in wholly  unfamiliar ways. And Japan is seeing the frailties of the United States, also  for the first time. The United States is hardly the invulnerable hero that the  Japanese have so greatly admired for the past 45 years. Nor is it a bottomless  market, capable of absorbing virtually any volume of Japanese exports. The  benefit of the Cold Peace is the chance for each side to correct its false  impression of the other and emerge from a period of greater hostility with a  relationship based on greater understanding.  </P> <P> Undoubtedly the next 5 to 10 years will witness a worsening of U.S.-Japanese  relations. Competition for the high-tech, high value-added industries of the  future will escalate; the Japanese will move aggressively into basic research,  further threatening American interests; Japan's industrial structure will  facilitate techno-fusion, the joining of divergent technologies into whole new  industries. But what will necessarily emerge from this heightened conflict is a  U.S. strategy for its relationship with Japan -- the first time the United  States has had such a strategy since World War II. And just as America's  strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union provided a global framework for the  period between 1945 and 1990, so America's strategy for dealing with Japan will  create a new framework for geoeconomics in the 21st Century.  </P></p>

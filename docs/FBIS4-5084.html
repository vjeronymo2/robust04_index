			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hysterics of Dictator Under `Civilian' Mask" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- It is entirely  unjustifiable that the South Korean authorities inflicted  penalties upon the chairman of the General Student Council of  Kwangju University, the ex-director of the department for  solidarity of the general student council of Chonnam National  University and the ex-chairman of the national reunification  committee of the university on charges of exchanging letters  with students of Kim Il-song University and leading  demonstrations, says NODONG SINMUN today.    The reunification movement conducted by South Korean  students  to put a period to national division is a praiseworthy patriotic  act and it can by no means be incriminated, the news analyst  says, and goes on:    The criminal is none other than the Kim Yong-sam group  itself  which, seeking confrontation, not national unity, has broken up  inter-Korean dialogue which continued even under the military  dictatorship and has left no stone unturned in obstructing and  suppressing the pro-reunification patriotic movement of students  and people. It is a brutal act bereft of human nature, let  alone an iota of national conscience, for the Kim Yong-sam  traitor clique, the very criminal, to brandish the sword at the  students who conducted righteous activities.    This time the Kim Yong-sam group again invoked the notorious  "National Security Law" in imposing penalties upon the patriotic  students. The "National Security Law" is a most reactionary  anti-communist fascist law that violates all the freedom and  rights of the people and defines the fellow countrymen in the  North as an "enemy" and incriminates any contact with them. The  Kim Yong-sam group still keeps that kind of law and uses it as a  tool for maintaining "power", ignoring the unanimous opposition  of the people at home and abroad. This proves that it is a  group of human dregs and hooligans who are clean indifferent to  the desire of the nation and the trend of the times.    The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to find a way out in  bringing anti-reunification storm, following outside forces.  But it is a foolish dream.    The Kim Yong-sam group must stop anti-reunification  suppression at once.</p>

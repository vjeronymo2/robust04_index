			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: ERM to dominate DEBATE over how Belgium, and to a lesser extent France, will pull themselves out of their currency dilemmas is set to preoccupy the financial markets this week, writes Peter John. The Belgian government is due to release details of its much vaunted social pact, the blueprint for wage indexation and employment which is aimed at reducing the country's crippling national debt. Currency dealers remain sceptical of its immediate benefits and are expected to concentrate on the cleft-stick argument: they say that while currency support by the Belgian National Bank has failed to maintain the Belgian franc's strength against the D-Mark the ultimate weapon of higher interest rates might only depress the economy further. Belgium already has an official interest rate of 9.65 per cent and short term lending rates at around 10 per cent while the country's inflation is only 2.8 per cent. Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg, said: 'I can't see how Belgium can get out of this one alive without lower interest rates and a weaker currency.' Many believe that Belgium and France will have to follow the path taken by Spain over the past year. Spain devalued its currency to help its economy and has subsequently been able to lower interest rates to the benefit rather than the detriment of the currency. Last week it cut its key rate by half a percentage point and the peseta strengthened. Many investors have been looking at the fundamental benefits to the Belgian economy of cutting rates and abandoning its strong franc policy. US money has been pouring in to the Belgian stock and bond markets pushing the former to record highs. Elsewhere investors are looking towards German M3 growth figures this week.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nasdaq in trial reform of short sale regulations The second-biggest US stock market has changed its rules for a trial period to make companies less vulnerable to so-called 'bear raids', in which a company's share price is driven down by speculators seeking to make a quick profit. The National Association of Securities Dealers, the authority which runs the Nasdaq stock market, said yesterday it had received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the rule change. The reform would in effect prevent dealers from engaging in the sort of short sales that can force a company's share price into a downward spiral. A short sale involves a dealer selling shares it does not own in the hope of buying them later at a lower price. If several dealers all sell short a company whose shares are already under pressure, it can lead to a sharp fall in the price. Under the NASD's new rule, which will be in force for a trial period of 18 months, dealers will not be able to engage in a short sale at a lower price than the previous bid price quoted on Nasdaq screens. In effect, this echoes the 'down-tick' rule applied by the New York Stock Exchange for stocks traded on its market.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lower coffee consumption forecast Roaster Kraft Jacobs Suchard, part of the Philip Morris group, expects world demand for coffee to drop to 92m bags (60kg each) in 1995 from an estimated 95m this year as higher roasted coffee prices curtail consumption in both eastern and western Europe, reports Reuters from Paris. 'Eastern Europeans will suffer mainly in 1995 from the impact of current roasted coffee price hikes,' Mr Roland Monica, general manager for the group's beverage division, told a news conference here. Lower world demand should in turn allow for some rebalancing of the market and put pressure on prices, he said. Mr Monica said the group hoped prices could ease by the end of 1995. But he suggested that green coffee prices, which rose quickly after frost then drought hit the Brazilian crop, were unlikely to return to the low levels seen beforehand. 'Coffee prices cannot return to 50-60 cents a pound . . . Coffee producing countries must have decent living conditions,' he said. Only 'decent' prices would encourage planters to invest, he added. Kraft Jacobs Suchard predicts that roasted coffee consumption in Europe could decline 2.7 per cent in 1994 to 1.015m tonnes. It expects German consumption to fall 4 per cent but stabilise in 1995 because German roasters were prompt in passing on green coffee price rises to customers. But French consumption is expected to fall 6 per cent next year after easing by 0.5 per cent in 1994 because French roasters delayed most of their price rises until the end of the year. Consumption is seen dropping 3.3 per cent in Poland and 16.4 per cent in the former Czechoslovakia this year.</p>

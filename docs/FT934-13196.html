			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust soars to Dollars 310m AFTER-tax profits at Bankers Trust soared to Dollars 310m in the third quarter, nearly 25 per cent higher than the previous three months. The sharp rise was the result of continued volatility in international financial markets and the bank's strong position in the derivatives business. Earnings per share, at Dollars 3.71, exceeded market expectations and compared with Dollars 2.97 a share in the second quarter, when it earned Dollars 251m after tax, and Dollars 1.90 a share against Dollars 166m after tax a year ago. Trading revenue jumped by Dollars 187m, or 77 per cent, from Dollars 431m. The majority of this growth resulted from risk-management products sold to clients rather than proprietary trading, said Mr Charles Sanford, chairman. Trading-related profits were also behind the reported Dollars 52m increase in the bank's net interest income, which rose to Dollars 364m for the quarter. Most other operations also recorded solid gains. Income from fund management and custody services rose by Dollars 35m to Dollars 183m, while fee and commission income was up Dollars 33m to Dollars 198m. Higher bonuses stemming from the record results meant that Bankers Trust paid out twice as much under incentive schemes and other benefit arrangements during the period than it paid in normal salaries. Bonuses and other benefits paid to staff jumped to Dollars 326m, from Dollars 183m the year before. Normal salary payments rose only 8 per cent, to Dollars 176m, suggesting the bank's cost base remained flexible and would shrink in the event of falling trading income. Bankers Trust's trading results have remained more consistent during volatile market conditions than those of rivals such as Salomon Brothers, which depend more heavily on own-account trading to generate their profits. The bank's return on equity reached 30 per cent during the quarter at an annualised rate, up from 26 per cent in the previous three months. Salomon, by contrast, made a spectacular 40 per cent (on a fully diluted basis) in the second quarter before plunging to 0.1 per cent in the latest three months.</p>

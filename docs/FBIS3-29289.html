			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin does not  think the failure of talks between the United States and Japan,  which led to an appreciation of the yen, would affect Thailand.  He said it was a bilateral issue and part of a series of talks  under which the United States is trying to achieve concrete  results in reducing Japan's trade surplus. He said the two  countries adopt a common principle in trade.    A source at the Finance Ministry said that there could be a  short-term impact caused by speculation in the money market. He  suggested that one should wait and see when the Japanese  Government starts selling its holdings if the U.S. Federal  Reserve buys up the money in order to reduce the impact from the  yen appreciation. He does not think that there will be any  impact on Thailand. [passage omitted]</p>

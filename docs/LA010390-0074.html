			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL INDIAN AGENCY OFFICES IN RIVERSIDE DAMAGED BY BOMB BLAST  </P> <P> A bomb exploded just before dawn at the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs offices  here Tuesday, causing extensive property damage but no injuries.  </P> <P> No one had claimed responsibility for the bombing by Tuesday evening, and  Bureau of Indian Affairs officials said no threats or warnings of any kind had  been received in recent days.  </P> <P> "It's all a big mystery to us at this point," said Steve Gleason, an aide to  Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Eddie Brown in Washington. "Everyone is  just perplexed."  </P> <P> An FBI spokesman in Los Angeles confirmed that an investigation is under way by  that agency. The spokesman, Jim Neilson, added that investigators will examine  whether Tuesday's bombing is linked to the explosion of a pipe bomb last week  on the Morongo Indian Reservation near Banning.  </P> <P> Damage from the Morongo bombing, which occurred at 2 a.m. Friday outside the  reservation's administrative center, totaled about $4,000 and consisted mostly  of broken windows and punctured walls.  </P> <P> "At this time, we don't believe the two events are related," said Riverside  County Sheriff's Capt. Jake Bowser, who is leading the Morongo investigation.  </P> <P> Bowser said so far there are no suspects or known motives in the reservation  incident.  </P> <P> Tuesday's explosion at the Bureau of Indian Affairs offices occurred at about  5:20 a.m., a time when none of the agency's 40 employees was at work. The blast  was not discovered until about two hours later, when an employee arrived to  find the receptionist area and an adjacent office in the agency's second-story  suite nearly destroyed, Riverside police spokesman Pete Esquivel said.  </P> <P> Esquivel said police received numerous calls at 5:20 a.m. from residents who  reported hearing a loud boom.  </P> <P> All businesses in the two-story building, located next to the Riverside Freeway  at 3600 Lime St., were closed for the day as bomb experts with the Riverside  Police Department began the tedious job of sifting through broken glass and  other debris. No monetary estimate of the damage was provided.  </P> <P> Though the explosion caused no fire, walls were blown out, windows were  shattered and the floor had gaping holes, agency officials said. A business on  the building's ground floor also sustained moderate damage.  </P> <P> Police declined to specify the type or strength of device used in the attack.  But Bureau of Indian Affairs officials said they were told that the explosion  was caused by a pipe bomb placed outside the front door of the suite, where the  agency's Southern California field office, which serves 23 tribes, has been  located for five years.  </P> <P> Ron Jaeger, the agency's area director for California, said employees were  placed on administrative leave until their quarters can be repaired.  </P> <P> Jaeger said he saw no connection between Tuesday's incident and a recent spate  of mail and package bombings aimed at judges, courts, attorneys and civil  rights organizations in the South.  </P> <P> "I just don't see a link," Jaeger said.  </P></p>

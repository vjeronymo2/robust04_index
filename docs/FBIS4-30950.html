			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Christian Democratic Movement, by Jana Pankovcinova; place and  date not given: "The Law on Registers Could Serve as an Example  for Other States"]    [Text] Parliamentary deputies yesterday passed one of the  laws that the Slovak Republic pledged to adopt on its admission  into the Council of Europe -- the law on [birth, marriage, and  death] registers. We asked Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement Chairman Vojtech Bugar for his opinion on the law.    [Pankovcinova] Some Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] and Slovak National Party [SNS] deputies labelled the law  "anti-Slovak" and walked out of parliament as a sign of protest.  Could you explain the gist of this law?    [Bugar] They labelled as anti-Slovak articles 15 and 18,  which state that, if someone wishes to have his first name  entered in his mother tongue, the first change of the name in  the register is free. Likewise, if a woman wants to have her  surname entered in her documents in the mother tongue, without  the suffix -ova [characterizing female surnames in Slovak], this  law allows her to do so free of charge the first time. An  amendment specifying the usage of the first name and the surname  also passed in parliament. This means that the first name and  the surname in the mother tongue (that is, without the suffix  -ova) will be used in the spoken and written Slovak language  with the ending -ova and will be inflected according to Slovak  grammar rules. Therefore, it is absolutely okay when a Slovak  speaker will refer to my wife as Mrs. Bugarova. She will only  have the chance to have her surname entered in her identity  papers as Bugar.    [Pankovcinova] Are you satisfied with the adopted law?    [Bugar] Yes. Parliament adopted a very liberal law and  complied with the recommendation of the Council of Europe. The  present and future governments will be able to appear at  international forums with dignity because this law could serve  as an example also for other states in which there are ethnic  minorities.</p>

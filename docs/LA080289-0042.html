			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Despite announcing last month that it was suspending operations following  anti-Semitic remarks by a group associate, the New York rap unit Public Enemy  has continued to perform live and is now expected to resume full operations --  including recording. Spokesmen for the group said Tuesday that Public Enemy's  Chuck D., who denounced the anti-Semitic statements by the group's since-fired  "minister of information" Prof. Griff, is expected to clarify the band's plans  in a press conference sometime this month. Sources confirmed that the group has  appeared at several concerts since the "suspension" announcement, but only to  fulfill contractual obligations and without Griff. Public Enemy's latest  single, "Fight the Power," is featured prominently in the movie "Do the Right  Thing."  </P></p>

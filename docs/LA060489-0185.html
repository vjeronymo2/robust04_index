			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: SEEING THIS IS TOO MUCH, BY GEORGE  </P> <P> Overweight? Have trouble bending down to tie your shoes, do you? Clothes too  tight? Wheeze when you climb stairs? Hard to get in and out of cars? Feet hurt  from carrying around all that blubber?  </P> <P> Don't worry about it. Have another taco. Load up on chocolate. Buy real whipped  cream.  </P> <P> Here's what you do: Go down to the nearest gym, buy a jump rope, work out on  the light bag a couple of minutes, spar around with a couple of guys fatter  than you are. Don't overdo it.  </P> <P> And we'll see about getting you a shot at the heavyweight championship of the  world at $10 million to $12 million a pop.  </P> <P> You think that's farfetched? Well, tell me, have you had a good look at George  Foreman lately?  </P> <P> Maybe you saw George's "bout" with a pug named Bert Cooper in Phoenix Thursday  night. If you didn't see it, don't worry. Put on a Three Stooges cassette and  watch it. Same thing. Everything but the seltzer bottle and a pneumatic blonde.  A Professor Larbermacher skit was never funnier.  </P> <P> Bert Cooper didn't come to fight. He had trouble escaping blows that came at  him with the speed and trajectory of an iceberg.  </P> <P> George Foreman made his fight like a guy waiting for a bus. If it was outdoors,  pigeons would have lit on him. Guys have moved faster in checkout lines at the  market.  </P> <P> Far be it from me to say that Bert Cooper was there only to disappear at some  convenient moment, but it's interesting that the Arizona Athletic Commission  announced even before the fighters had left the ring that they were holding up  Cooper's purse, $17,000. The suspicion persists this was not the only cash  coming Cooper's way for his contribution to the comedy skit.  </P> <P> After all, what we're doing with George Foreman here is trying to persuade the  public to disregard its eyes and trust the promoters that what they're seeing  is a devastating primal force and not a fat old party who throws punches like a  shotputter or a guy who has forgotten to let go of a bowling ball.  </P> <P> Now, quitting in your corner is considered quite manly in certain sections of  the world. It's perfectly acceptable in Britain, for example. But custom calls  for you to have absorbed a nosebleed or two, maybe a knockdown, before you call  it a night. Cooper underwent two rounds of unseemly scampering and then, when  he quit between rounds, was the only person in the arena not surprised by the  action. As soon as the fight was called, he leaped off his stool with a broad  smile and rushed over and embraced Foreman, who seemed the least bit  embarrassed but, maybe, relieved.  </P> <P> Even in his prime, which was a long time ago, it was touch and go whether  George Foreman could fight at top pitch for more than five rounds. He never had  to. He first came into public consciousness as the Olympic heavyweight champ,  master of the quick knockout and the three-round fight at most.  </P> <P> He came into public view at a time when some other Olympic athletes were waving  black-gloved fists at their country's flag and anthem on victory stands, and  George endeared himself to the traditionalists by carrying a miniature American  flag in his gloves to the ring. He stood stiffly at attention as they played  the national anthem and they carried his Russian or German opponents out by the  heels.  </P> <P> As a pro, he had only two fights that went the distance. He was a pulverizing  puncher, he had arms like pythons and fists like paving blocks but his style  was as uncomplicated as a slow freight on an uphill grade.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, he was made to order for Muhammad Ali. Ali could always throw  the switch on those big slow-freight types and he derailed Foreman for good in  a predawn fight in Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1974. When Foreman got knocked down in  Round 8, Ali had him too exhausted to have a chance to get up at 10.  </P> <P> It was really the only fight that George ever lost. There was a gavotte with  Jimmy Young he lost by decision just before he retired in 1977, but it was the  knockout by Ali in Africa that drove George out of the ring and into a pulpit.  He became, of all things, a preacher.  </P> <P> George hasn't gotten his old act together for his assault on the title, he's  got a new one. The old Foreman, while affable enough, was generally a  monosyllabic, reclusive character who made Gary Cooper seem garrulous. The new  one has borrowed techniques he used to despise, those of Ali. When the two  fought in Zaire, Ali was full of bombast, boast, hype and psych -- the usual  shticks of an Ali prefight promo. Foreman locked himself in his room and slept.  </P> <P> The new Foreman is wiser. He's on his way to one more big score which can put  the ministry of the Rev. George on its way to saving souls by the millions and  George is onto it. His postfight utterances after he had disposed of Cooper  were in the best oratorical traditions of Ali, Hulk Hogan, William Jennings  Bryan.  </P> <P> "I am the hope of every man over 40," boomed George. "I am the hope of everyone  over 50, 60! I am fighting for old men everywhere. They see me and they know  everything is possible."  </P> <P> He's also the hope of every guy who can't tighten his belt any more.  </P> <P> But the pugilistic practice of dusting off an old, out-of-shape champion to  take on the current holder is not new. In 1910, Jim Jeffries was five years  retired. But the gimmick then was that America had a black champion. Jeffries  was convinced that he had a holy mission to correct this menace.  </P> <P> The pathetic phrase, "the Great White Hope," was born but the reluctant Jeff  was pounded into a pulp on the Fourth of July by the Great Black Hunk, Jack  Johnson, who appeared to be enjoying himself immensely doing it.  </P> <P> George may be the Great Fat Hope. If he could somehow win the title, he could  set dieting back 50 years. But of course, he could set pugilism back to John L.  Sullivan.  </P></p>

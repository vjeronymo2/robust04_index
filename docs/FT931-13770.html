			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Coal and rail union chiefs urge run of strikes LEADERS of the five main coal and rail unions yesterday called on their members to back a series of one-day strikes in a ballot on March 5. They plan for the first time to hold simultaneous ballots in what will be the first campaign of industrial action against privatisation since the mid 1980s. The move came as the government appeared to have secured European Commission clearance to provide temporary subsidies for coal beyond existing aid to the domestic energy sector. Mr Gordon Adam, Labour MEP for Northumbria, said Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, had indicated at a meeting with MEPs that it would be permissible for Britain to provide financial support for coal until 1995. After 1995, the Commission would seek to apply non-binding guidelines allowing member states to protect up to 20 per cent of their indigenous energy sources through subsidies or supply contracts signed with electricity generators. The planned 'rolling programme' of one-day strikes in protest at threatened job losses caused by pit closures and railway privatisation is in marked contrast to the Trades Union Congress plan for a day of action against job losses on February 18 which rules out industrial action. The call for industrial action came as leaders of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers - which was not involved in the strike moves  - met Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Neil Greatrex, the union's president, said Mr Major had told him he would be directly involved in the review of the coal industry. Mr Greatrex said the one-hour talk with Mr Major, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, had 'gone very well'. The UDM leader said he was told that Mr Heseltine would make a Commons statement to reassure miners in the 10 pits served last November with 90-day redundancy notices that the pits would remain open after the end of this month. Mr Greatrex said Mr Heseltine had added that he would consider extending the miners' redundancy scheme with an additional Pounds 10,000 top-up which is due to close at the end of March. Mr Heseltine also indicated that the white paper setting out the review of the coal industry would be published as 'soon as possible' next month, Mr Greatrex said. But the government rejected demands from MPs to commit itself to extending beyond March the period in which miners accepting voluntary redundancy would qualify for the enhanced redundancy terms on offer. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said he did not think it would be right to announce whether there would be an extension in advance of publication of the results of the government's energy review. Although industrial action supported by a ballot by the mining and rail unions would be legal it is not clear for how long the mandate would last. A 'rolling programme' might require more than one ballot to keep the action legal. The TUC's action day will involve a lobby of parliament by the unemployed and leafleting outside Jobcentres. The five unions balloting on strikes are the Nacods pit supervisors' union, the NUM mineworkers' union, the RMT transport union, the Aslef train drivers' union and the TSSA railway clerical workers' union.</p>

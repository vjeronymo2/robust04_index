			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to recent, well-publicized criticism of initial I/M testing in Maine, an agreement appears to have been reached between representatives of the Governor's Office, the Maine Legislature, the DEP, and Systems Control, Maine's I/M contractor. The agreement calls for a suspension of mandatory vehicle testing until March, 1995 so that improvements can be made to ensure a fair and equitable program. Since EPA's I/M rule permits the phase-in of emissions testing in areas implementing new test-only programs (See 40 CFR 51.373(c)(2)), the agreement in no way precludes EPA from conditionally approving the Maine I/M SIP as set forth in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While no public comments were received on this NPR, substantial public comments were received on a related NPR published on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32390). That package proposed approval of an I/M program in Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln and Sagadahoc, with no judgement as to whether or not it met any requirements of the federal I/M rule. One hundred seventy-four comment letters were received on that package. Comments centered on a proposed trade which would have allowed nitrogen oxide emission reductions not required by federal law from the I/M program to be traded to promote industrial growth. Though it was reported by local media as such, EPA's notice did not propose to approve such a trade. In addition, while many commenters supported I/M, some questioned the need for I/M in Maine. The Maine Lung Association commented in support of expanding the program to the four optional counties. Each of the letters which had a return address were responded to in writing individually from Region l's Air Director, with the exception of the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the American Lung Association of Maine. A summary of these comments, and EPA's response is included in this package. No comments were received on the July 8, 1994 NPR to which this final action specifically pertains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Council of Maine and the American Lung Association of Maine commented the EPA should wait to approve the use of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  credits for trading purposes until an attainment demonstration has been submitted by the state and approved by EPA. This would allow both parties to determine if any credits generated by expanding the program area were surplus and available for trading to meeting offset requirements. Surplus credits are credits beyond those mandated by CAA requirements and necessary for attainment or Reasonable Further Progress. EPA agrees with this comment and will continue to work with the state of Maine to ensure that any credits generated by the I/M program used to meet offset requirements are surplus credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA is conditionally approving the Maine I/M program submitted by the State, on November 1, 1993, May 26, 1994, and July 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving Maine's submission based on the commitments of the DEP. Specifically, by January 31, 1995 the DEP will submit a report outlining the effect of the ``low mileage'' waiver to the legislature; by June 1, 1995, if necessary, will hold a public hearing on revised regulation changes; and by September 1, 1995, if necessary, will submit a revised SIP revision removing the ``low mileage'' waiver from the regulations. The state must also address the above described issues related to owner performed repairs according to the same schedule. Section 110(k)(4) provides that, if a state fails to comply with its commitment, such conditional approval will convert to a disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to meet any of these dates will result in EPA disapproval of this action, unless the EPA Regional Administrator approves a later date, in writing, by no later than the date of the applicable milestone. Under no circumstances will the September 1, 1995 date for final submittal be revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 1 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conditional approvals of SIP submittal under sections 110 and 301 subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing or has committed to impose in the future. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the state actions. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  427 U.S. 246, 96 S. Ct. 2518 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If EPA issues a final disapproval or if this conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the state's failure to meet the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that in the event EPA disapproves the state submittal, such disapproval would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would not remove existing state requirements nor would it substitute a new federal requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

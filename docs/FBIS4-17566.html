			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 484] </F>   [Text] Warsaw, April 25, ELTA -- Polish social democratic  newspaper the TRYBUNA published an interview with Stanislav  Meler, deputy director of the European Department at the Polish  Foreign Ministry who had participated in drafting the bilateral  treaty.    Meler said: "During the conversations with Lithuanians I  have  noticed well-grounded doubts about whether the treaty really  will change relations between our countries or whether it will  merely be a paper. Everything will depend on the "political  will".    "All the articles of the treaty on the national minorities  make a solid background for the normalization of our relations,  in the psychological aspect in particular. We managed to avoid  formulations in the treaty which could stipulate irritation or  show the superiority of one country over the other", Meler said.    "The realization of the treaty which will be signed for 15  years and then automaticaly expanded, will depend on the  political benevolence of the both states", Meler noted.    It is admitted in the article that the preparation of the  treaty with Lithuania, the last neighbour with which Poland did  not have any document, was long and complicated. It was  protracted because Lithuanians demanded that the so-called  occupation of Vilnius region in the inter-war period by Poland  should be condemned in the treaty.</p>

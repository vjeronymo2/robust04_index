			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The 70 million  fellow countrymen, who love the country and the nation and hope  for national reunification, must vigorously wage the common  struggle of the nation to overthrow the anti-national,  anti-democratic and anti- reunification Kim Yong-sam puppet  regime and establish a genuine government, independent and  democratic.    This call was made by the Central Committee of the  Democratic  Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland in its appeal to  the compatriots at home and abroad Friday to launch a nationwide  noble struggle for settling scores with the Kim Yong-sam  traitorous clique for its monstrous crimes against the country  and the nation in the last one year and overthrow this  despicable group.    Recalling that the traitor Kim Yong-sam recently decided to  allow the United States to deploy Patriot missiles and attack  helicopters in South Korea and invited infamous U.S. state  intelligence agents to South Korea, offering the land as an  intelligence base of the U.S. imperialists directed against the  North, the appeal said:    The traitor signed the treacherous "special agreement" for  largely increasing South Korea's burden share for the  maintenance of the U.S. troops in South Korea and induced the  United States to pigeonhole the "program of the phased reduction  of the U.S. troops." He is really a pro-U.S. traitor who has  totally opened the rice market to U.S. surplus agricultural  products.    Branding the traitor Kim Yong-sam as a "civilian" fascist  overshadowing his predecessors, the appeal said his clique has  turned down with violence the South Korean workers' demand for  wage hike and the means of suppression has become all the  craftier and harsher.    Saying the traitor is a most despicable national separatist  and warmaniac, it said:    He has stalled all the North-South dialogues, which had been  held even in the period of the "fifth and sixth republics" and  has staged such joint military manoeuvres with the United States  as "Team Spirit," "Ulchi Focus Lens" and "Kfoal" "Agpe" [names  as received] and other war games, crying for a "military  reaction", to the north.    The one year hkoverebvby the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is a  year of pro-7 [as received] pro-Japanese flunkeyist treachery  and "civilian" fascism and a year of crimes and disgrace run  through with confrontation, division and war moves. It has  become all the more obvious that with him left alone, neither  the independence and democratisation of the South Korean society  nor the peace and peaceful reunification of the country can be  expected.    Today the attitude towards the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is  a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery. And  whether one joins in the anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle or not is a  yardstick showing whether he wants independence and democracy of  the South Korean society and peace and peaceful reunification of  the country, or not.    All the Koreans, whether they be in the North or South or  abroad and whether they be communists or nationalists, must  unite with each other [words indistinct] nation and invigorate  the struggle for national reunification, regarding the 10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation as a common  guideline of the nation.</p>

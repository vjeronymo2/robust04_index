A draw seems to be the most  likely outcome of the first round of the strike.    Right until the last moment the republic authorities did  everything they could to slow the strike movement down somewhat.  The day before several people who distributed pro-strike  leaflets were arrested by the militia. Printing of SVABODA, one  of the largest democratic newspapers, was wrecked thanks to an  anonymous phone call. The telephones and the heating have been  cut off at the republic strike committee building itself, so  strike committee representatives lack complete information at  present as to what is happening on the ground. They know that  some workers at Soligorsk's no. 3 mine have joined in the  strike. The management of that enterprise is threatening to  count strike days as absenteeism. The strike committee members  consider that a reliable picture of what is happening will  become clear as evening approaches, but meanwhile they could be  receiving both accurate information and disinformation.    Your IZVESTIYA correspondent visited several enterprises in  the Belarusian capital in the morning, including notably Belvar  and Tranzistor, which are the most explosive centers. But so  far those plants are working as normal. They began paying out  wages at Belvar at 0800 hours.    By 1100 hours around 5,000 people were gathered on Minsk's  main square in front of the parliament building. These included  representatives of the wheeled truck tractor, automated  production line, and other Minsk plants. The demonstrators were  kept back from the government residence by a cordon of  militiamen. A rally began at which strike committee leaders and  people's deputies of the Republic of Belarus spoke.    "I think that everything has begun better than could have  been expected," Sergey Naumchik, one of the parliamentary  opposition leaders, told your correspondent. "Those already  gathered in the square and demanding the resignation of the  government and the Supreme Council will be joined by others. I  think that the strike will be wave-like in nature: It can fall  and then rise. At any rate, the main events are due in the  spring."    The strike committee members who spoke in the square hold  roughly the same opinion. According to them, the strike is  conceived as a permanent process. They think that from today  the strike movement will be in the ascendant.    At the same time statements about either the success or the  failure of the strike seem somewhat optimistic. On the one  hand, the majority has not joined in the action so far. Thus  one could say that the strike committee's efforts as of midday  15th February have not yielded great results. But the  nonaligned majority has not demonstrated support for the  government either but has merely exploited the situation to  extract the maximum material benefit out of it in the form, for  example, of wages, which many had not received for two to three  months. The government's carrot-proferring tactics are  undoubtedly good, but, given that the stocks of those carrots  are nearing their end, it is not clear what will restrain the  workers next time. The strike committees have also shouldered a  burden in this situation which they will scarcely be able to  deal with: It will be virtually impossible to motivate people  who are in the main politically apathetic by means of purely  political demands.</p>

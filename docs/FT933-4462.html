			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (20): Good software tools aid Ford automation THE complex business of defining the features and their metamorphosis into a finished product is a perennial problem for any manufacturer. In the motor industry it is compounded by the high costs of developing new models and ensuring that they meet the demands of the prospective market, writes Philip Manchester. Ford's Escort series, for example, has about 300 different 'features'. Every one of these must be taken from the original marketing vision through to final production. Ford of Europe recognised that automating this process was not easy. Its Product Features Database (PFDB) has a wide audience of users - from the sales department, through manufacturing and finance to the planning engineers. It needed good software tools to help meet this need. 'We were concerned with user interfaces and, in particular, we wanted to be able to offer graphical user interfaces to present information to the users. It would not have been feasible to use a character-based interface,' says Nigel Booth, manager of pre-production systems with Ford of Europe. 'The system had to be a new and self-contained application - although, at the same time, it had to be mainframe-based to cope with shared databases,' Booth adds. In 1990, when Ford decided to go ahead with the new PFDB application, it looked around for tools to get the project moving quickly. 'We were not looking for rapid application development tools specifically - but we needed something which would give us a way to prototype the systems and show them to the users early on,' explains project manager Peter Harris. 'We looked at a lot of packages to do this. But they were all based on low-level programming languages and would need custom-built code to do the job.' Ford chose Easel, a software development tool specifically aimed at providing graphical user interface (GUI) based applications for mainframe environments. The product features a database which sits on an IBM mainframe server and is accessed by the Easel-built applications. Easel has features which allow it to capture standard IBM mainframe instructions and present them in GUI format. Ford was able to get the whole system up and working in about six months which, by mainframe standards, is quick. The real bonuses came, however, from the ability to build prototypes to show users in the design phase and the ability to make changes at the front end without affecting the mainframe system. 'I am not sure if the system is either quicker or slicker as a result. But we feel we got better quality end products. And by putting the presentation software on the PC we can make changes at a much faster pace,' notes Harris.</p>

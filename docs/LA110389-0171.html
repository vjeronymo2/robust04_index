			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 1,000 PRO-CHOICE PROTESTS SET  </P> <P> Supporters of abortion rights announced plans today for 1,000 demonstrations in  150 cities Nov. 12, which will begin with a "thousand points of light" sunrise  service near President Bush's vacation home and be highlighted by a massive  rally at the Lincoln Memorial.  </P> <P> "This is the most single ambitious human rights activity ever taken in the  United States," Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,  told a news conference held to publicize the event.  </P> <P> "Never before have so many groups come and converged on so many points yet also  had a massive demonstration, which we think will hit record proportions in  Washington itself," Smeal said.  </P> <P> Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action  League, which organized the coalition of groups staging the protests, said the  events would kick off a campaign to elect state legislators in 1990 favoring a  woman's right to choose an abortion.  </P></p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PSA fraud reports rejected THE GOVERNMENT has been attempting to reassure potential purchasers of the five Building Management divisions of the Property Services Agency that suggestions of fraud made about one of the five businesses were unfounded. Officials at the Department of the Environment were yesterday urgently talking to prospective bidders for the BM businesses, which carry out most of the maintenance and upkeep of government buildings. BM south-east, which is the subject of the allegations, had been proven to have been involved in only minor irregularities - relating to the appointment of staff - and they did not include financial impropriety, the officials said. The move follows press reports based on a briefing paper prepared for a PSA internal audit investigation which began in the London-based BM south-east at the beginning of the year. The department said yesterday that the paper represented an initial list of 'suspicions and rumours' that had been put to the internal audit team, and emphasised that the investigations so far had eliminated some of the allegations. 'It is not true that contracts to the value of Pounds 20m are being questioned and there is no evidence of any security breaches,' the department said. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, immediately called for the sale of BM to be suspended until investigations had been completed. They are expected to be finished in the next couple of weeks. But the government made it clear the sale would not be postponed, and it expects to go ahead with bids from a shortlist of potential purchasers, probably in June. The final stage of privatising the PSA was announced in late January, with expressions of interest from more than 70 businesses, including contractors, consultants, utilities and building management companies. Last week, on the deadline for preliminary bids, the department said that there was 'substantial' interest.</p>

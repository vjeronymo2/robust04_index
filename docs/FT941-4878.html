			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Jardine may have to delist from HK The attempt by the Jardine group of companies to bypass Hong Kong's takeover laws and remain listed on the colony's stock exchange appeared untenable yesterday, with regulators apparently unprepared to revoke their opposition to the company's plans. It is understood that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's corporate watchdog, will not approve the company's proposed scheme whereby Bermudan takeover law especially enacted for Jardine supersedes Hong Kong rules. This scheme has been the subject of negotiation between Jardine and the SFC since the beginning of this year. A failure of the two to agree raises the possibility that the Jardine group might delist its shares in Hong Kong. Jardine precipitated a flight of capital from Hong Kong in 1984 when it announced it would move its company registration to Bermuda. The company does not believe that Hong Kong's legal framework will provide sufficient protection after China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. The Chinese government has frequently attacked Jardine because of its stated support for Governor Chris Patten's democracy plans, and its alleged involvement in the removal of Mr Patten's predecessor. Last May, Jardine said Bermuda had agreed to enact laws to bring the Jardine group under a statutory version of London's Takeover Code. The code will be administered by Bermuda's Monetary Authority. However the SFC is concerned about the credibility of such legislation, created at the behest of one company. It claims the takeover code in Bermuda applies to one company in Bermuda - Jardine - and it believes that companies operating in Hong Kong should abide by Hong Kong rules. The Jardine group comprises Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic, Mandarin Oriental, Hongkong Land, and Dairy Farm. Their combined market capitalisation accounts for about 9.7 per cent of the Hong Kong stock market. Mr Nigel Rich, the company's managing director, steps down this month to return to the UK. His place will be taken by Mr Alasdair Morrison, the 45-year-old boss of a Jardine associate.</p>

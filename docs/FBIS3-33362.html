			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, President Alberto  Fujimori disavowed the involvement of members of the Peruvian  Armed Forces command in the kidnapping and murder of nine La  Cantuta University students and a professor. The president also  described the sentence handed down on Monday against 11 Army  officers accused of the July 1992 disappearance of 10 civilians  from the "Enrique Guzman y Valle" University also known as La  Cantuta as "drastic and exemplary. We hope the sentence, which  is in accordance with the law, will serve as an example so  despicable human rights violations will not occur again in the  future," the president stated after accusing some "political  sectors" of attempting to harm Peru.    Fujimori pointed out that isolated cases such as La Cantuta  must not, in any way, undermine the anti-terrorist strategy his  administration is undertaking, and warned that "this policy will  continue until subversive groups have been beaten." He insisted  this strategy must continue to prevent limiting the Armed Forces  in its determination to confront terrorism.    With respect to the approval of the controversial law  transferring the missing La Cantuta civilians case to military  jurisdiction, President Fujimori reiterated that the military  courts "are the best guarantee" to ensure that those responsible  will be penalized.    Yesterday, the Supreme Military Justice court sentenced one  general, one colonel, one captain, and four junior officers to  sentences ranging from one to 20 years imprisonment. The  military court also exonerated another colonel and left the case  pending against a lieutenant who is a fugitive. The military  court also determined that neither the Army command or the  National Intelligence Service (SIN) were involved in the case,  and ordered that once the corresponding appeals had been  evaluated, the case should be filed and the controversial  process should be closed forever.    Political opposition sectors insist that General Nicolas de  Bari Hermoza, president of the Armed Forces Joint Command as  well as Army chief, and Vladimiros Montesinos, the controversial  presidential adviser and SIN official should have both been  included in the court proceedings. Fugitive Gen. Rodolfo Robels,  who is self-exiled in Argentina since May 1993, identified  Hermoza and Montesinos as leaders of a paramilitary commando  group responsible for masterminding the massacre of the La  Cantuta students and professor.    "I flatly deny that orders were ever issued by the Armed  Forces command" to kidnap the university students, the president  insisted in stating that "some sectors are trying to politicize  this issue in order to hurt the country."    Heriberto Benitez, one of the three lawyers for the  relatives  of the missing civilians, disagreed with the way the military  court conducted the case, and he believes there were numerous  irregularities. Nevertheless, Benitez said he hopes that in the  future a new congress and a new judicial branch will review the  case and prevent the guilty parties from benefiting from a  presidential pardon in the short run. "This is a process, which  for us as plaintiffs, has not concluded yet since the appeals to  the Supreme Court for the case to be returned to a civilian  court are still pending."    He stated it is not a matter of the victims' relatives being  satisfied with the sentences, regardless of whether they are 20  or 40 years imprisonment. This is a case that must be dealt with  publicly in order for it to serve as an example to prevent any  officer from repeating La Cantuta crime in the future.    Meanwhile, Jorge Avendano, dean of the Lima Bar Association  [CAL] filed a motion of unconstitutionality against the bill  that approved the transfer of the La Cantuta case to military  jurisdiction. The CAL lawyer pointed out that the document,  filed before the Supreme Court of Justice's Court of  Unconstitutionality, seeks to invalidate the so-called "La  Cantuta" bill since he believes the norm "is not valid, and  nonexistent also." He said the previously mentioned bill  violates several legal principles. At any rate, he disclosed  that with a sentence already having been rendered by a military  court, "it will be very difficult to return it to civilian  jurisdiction."</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Executors can benefit, too CAN SOMEONE who benefits from a will also be an executor of it? Yes. In simple cases, where you might wish to leave all your assets to one person, this should not cause a problem. But you should be aware that if you wish to leave your estate to a number of beneficiaries, one of whom is the executor, then you must clearly have faith that this person will carry out your wishes correctly in all respects. You might also wish to consider if you would like a professional person as an executor to assist in these matters. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

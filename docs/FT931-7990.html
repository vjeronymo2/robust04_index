			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Business property revival expected A MODEST revival of investment in the commercial property market is expected in the second half of this year, a survey of institutional investors and property companies has found, Vanessa Houlder writes. However the study by Corporate Intelligence Group of 90 investors, owning a total of Pounds 24.4bn of property, found that no significant increase in commercial property values was expected before 1994. One in five investors do not expect any increase in commercial property values before 1995. Sentiment towards offices had marginally improved over the past nine months, although most respondents believed that office rents would continue to fall this year. Investors' attitude to industrial property had deteriorated over the past nine months, and a growing number expected further decline in rents. Warehouses are likely to be the most sought-after buildings this year. Property investment yields are generally expected to stay level or fall over the next year. About half the investors expected retail yields to level or harden over the next year, while the majority expected office, industrial and business space yields to remain at current levels.

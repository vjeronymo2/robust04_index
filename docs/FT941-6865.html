			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Convergence in the workforce - Labour unity Talk of a single market for labour in the European Union may seem premature in light of the differences between regulations and costs in the 12 member states. But Europe's individual labour markets are coming to resemble one another more closely - and in the next 10 to 15 years this convergence is likely to accelerate. The result may even be an improvement in competitiveness rather than the deterioration of which some observers have warned. Viewed from the outside, Europe's labour markets already have much in common, especially in terms of regulatory framework. But within Europe there is also great variety. Average hourly pay in Portugal is Dollars 4.69, compared with Dollars 25.34 in Germany. It is easy and cheap to fire people in Britain, but it remains expensive and complex to do so - at least in the formal sector of the economy - in Spain, Italy, France and Germany. Only 5 per cent of the Italian workforce works part-time, compared with more than 30 per cent in the Netherlands. Non-wage labour costs range from 3 per cent of wage costs in Denmark to over 45 per cent in France. A closer look at these divergences suggests, however, that they are seldom at the root of comparative advantage. For example, differences in wages tend to be matched by differences in productivity, leaving unit labour costs at similar levels all over Europe. Differences in non-wage labour costs may also be less important than they seem, as low non-wage labour costs will usually be compensated by higher direct wage costs, and vice versa. Companies are interested in the whole package of labour costs, flexibility and skill levels. When all these factors are taken into account, pluses and minuses often cancel each other out in Europe. Britain has a deregulated labour market but a patchy record in education and training. Germany is expensive and highly regulated but has highly motivated and skilled workers. Some of the southern European economies, such as Portugal, have low unit labour costs but also tend to be highly regulated. For these reasons, 'social dumping' - the feared transfer of capital from countries with high standards of labour protection to those where labour is least protected - has not materialised in Europe. But economic integration means that developments in one European labour market are now influencing others. The threat of locating new plants abroad has recently persuaded German workers at Bosch and Daimler-Benz to make concessions. And Britain - with its opt-out from parts of the EU's 'social dimension' - may continue to attract a disproportionate amount of inward investment. The result is a gradual trend towards greater flexibility across Europe, whereby continental countries are adopting some aspects of British-style deregulation without abandoning European social partnership. For example: Obstacles to part-time and temporary work have been relaxed in Spain and Italy, and the German government is now pushing for a big increase in part-time work. Minimum pay rules are generally still in place but they have in some countries been allowed to fall in value. One partial example is France's salaire minimum de croissance (Smic): the government is now allowing companies to pay young workers less than the Smic rate, provided they spend most of the money thus saved on training. Union power has been on the retreat everywhere, with the possible exception of Germany, although even there power is shifting from sectoral collective bargaining to agreements at plant level. IG Chemie, the chemical union, recently agreed to lower pay rates for new workers taken off the dole queue. On labour costs, the gap between the poorer and richer economies is narrowing markedly. According to Professor Douglas McWilliams, at the UK's Centre for Economics and Business Research, the degree of divergence in European wages will fall from 46 per cent in 1974 to 24 per cent by the end of this decade, with upward pressure in the poorer countries as productivity rises and downward pressure in the high-cost countries. One sign of convergence is that economic migrants from Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, who previously flocked to the richer northern European countries, have lately been returning home, where better remunerated opportunities now beckon as their economies begin to catch up.</p>

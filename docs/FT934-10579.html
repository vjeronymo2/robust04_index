			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis spin-off plan wins approval PACIFIC Telesis, the California-based local telephone company, has won regulatory approval for its unusual and controversial plan to spin off its mobile communications business into a separately quoted company. The go-ahead from the California Public Utilities Commission, which oversees the industry, ended a dispute which had delayed the spin-off. The commission's public advocacy office had demanded that Pacific Telesis refund Dollars 1bn to its telephone operating companies for research into cellular technology supposedly paid for out of telephone rates. In the end, the commission insisted the company pay just Dollars 41.3m. Pacific Telesis announced plans for the spin-off last December. The wireless business, to be known as Pactel, involves the group's US cellular telephone and paging businesses and its international mobile operations, which include ventures in Germany, Sweden, Portugal and Spain. The group plans to sell 12 per cent of Pactel in a public offering which could raise up to Dollars 1.2bn and will be completed by mid-December. It will distribute the remaining 88 per cent of the stock to existing investors. Pacific Telesis, one of the seven Baby Bell regional telephone companies, has a strategy very different from most of the other big local operators as they prepare for the convergence of the telecommunications, computer and media industries. Its rivals are keeping all their operations under one corporate parent and snapping up interests in cable TV companies and programme providers. Pacific Telesis, with no significant television investments, argues that the spin-off will allow Pactel to take greater advantage of worldwide wireless growth, since it will free it from much of the regulatory oversight of its traditional telephone business. At the same time, the split will enable Pacific Telesis to play a larger role in personal communications services, a new kind of mobile telephony. The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the US national telecommunications industry and is due to auction PCS licences next year, has limited the size of the licences existing cellular carriers can bid for. The split will free Pacific Telesis of these restrictions.</p>

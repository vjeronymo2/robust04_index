			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Zedillo hails departure of Chiapas envoy Mr Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling party, has welcomed the resignation of Mr Manuel Camacho, former peace commissioner in the Mexican state of Chiapas, although he has strongly denied any responsibility for it. Mr Camacho resigned last week after accusing Mr Zedillo of deliberately undermining his efforts to secure peace in Chiapas. The resignation came just a few days after Zapatista rebels formally rejected the government peace offer for Chiapas, and has raised concern of a resumption of violence there before or after the August presidential election. Far from showing any regret, Mr Zedillo said Mr Camacho's departure was the right decision for the country. He denied that his description of Mr Camacho's peace efforts as a 'failure' played any part in the resignation, claiming Mr Camacho had already made up his mind to leave before the Zapatistas rejected the government peace offer. The Zapatistas launched a rebellion in Chiapas on new year's day, demanding greater rights for the indigenous population and more democracy. Mr Zedillo's continued snipes at Mr Camacho indicate that he may be seeking to finish off a political rival who has never hidden his presidential ambitions, and shore up support among the conservative, so-called hardline wing of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, who have long opposed the reformist Mr Camacho, and his support for further democratic opening. But the strategy has opened up Mr Zedillo to criticisms from the opposition, who have accused him of obstructing the peace process in Chiapas. Mr Zedillo may have alienated Mr Camacho's supporters and possibly angered President Carlos Salinas, who has strongly backed Mr Camacho's peace efforts and publicly praised him after he resigned. Nevertheless, many supporters of Mr Zedillo believe that Mr Camacho's withdrawal from the national stage may help over the coming months. Party officials were increasingly concerned that Mr Camacho was undermining Mr Zedillo's presidential bid by attacking hardliners in the PRI and campaigning for democratic reforms. In a similar way earlier this year Mr Camacho's peace efforts in Chiapas had overshadowed the campaign of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the slain presidential candidate of the PRI.</p>

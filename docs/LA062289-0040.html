			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUAVA: RIPE TASTES OF THE TROPICS  </P> <P> Guava, its friends say, when ripe, smells just like a dream of the tropics:  sweet, fruity, distinctive. Beware of underripe guavas, however -- they remind  sniffers of the musky smell of zoos or locker rooms.  </P> <P> The flavor of ripe guavas is as endearing as their scent. The fruit's slightly  grainy flesh, which ranges in color from white to hot pink, calls up allusions  to strawberries and bananas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brought Home by Columbus  </P> <P> Native to South America, Central America and the West Indies, guavas were first  brought to a European audience by Columbus's crew. And, indeed, in the United  States they are best known in Latin American cooking.  </P> <P> However, they are also found in other tropical or subtropical corners of the  globe, including India, South Africa and Greece, where the seed-filled fruit  has been spread by migrating birds.  </P> <P> Most commercially grown guavas that are consumed in the United States come from  Australia and New Zealand, or they are grown domestically in California and  Florida (Delicious guavas are abundant in Hawaii, but because they are subject  to fruit-fly infestation, cannot be shipped to the mainland). Guavas are best  known in the United States in nectar or paste (goyabada) form, and are also  made into a candy that is popular in Mexico. All of these can be found at  groceries that carry Latin American foodstuffs. But the fruit can occasionally  be found fresh, too, at markets that carry gourmet produce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ripen Unrefrigerated  </P> <P> The fruits are pear-shaped or ovoid. Select fresh-looking specimens, slightly  tender to the touch, and allow them to ripen unrefrigerated. A deep yellow  color and that lovely aroma will be the guide to ripeness. When they have  ripened fully, guavas can be refrigerated, but they should be used soon, or the  flesh may become unpleasantly sandy.  </P> <P> Fresh guavas can be eaten raw when very ripe. (A number of small hard seeds are  clustered near the heart of the fruit. The seeds, while edible, can be  obtrusive.) For eating out of hand, wash and trim away the stem and blossom  ends, then halve and scoop out of the shell. Firmer fruit can be used for jams  and jellies, sliced in a fruit salad and the pulp pureed for sauces, sorbets or  mousse. Guava also makes a fine liqueur.  </P> <P> The nutritional reward will be plenty of Vitamin A (especially in the pinkest  varieties) and more Vitamin C than citrus fruits. Guavas are also low in  calories.  </P></p>

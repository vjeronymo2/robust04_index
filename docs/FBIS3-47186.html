			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It seems that insurance services negotiations at  the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, which will be held on 10  and 11 January in Washington, will "soon come to a stage of  seeking compromises" (according to a senior Finance Ministry  official). There is not much time left for the negotiators  because Japan-U.S. summit talks, which will complete the  negotiations, will be held in less than one month. However,  Japan's policy is to "make no concessions at all" in accepting  U.S. demands, which may be linked to setting numerical standards  or intervening in private companies' business affairs.  Therefore, it seems that representatives of both countries will  continue to have rough sailing at the negotiations.    The United States is calling for the following five points:  1) rectify Japan's customary practice of doing business among  companies related to each other through corporate affiliation;  2) further liberalization of government-related insurance  services to foreign companies; 3) securing transparency of  government procedures for issuance of approvals or licenses for  goods; 4) introduction of a broker system; and 5) shelving  liberalization of the third sector [daisan bunya]. In addition,  the United States also wants to adopt foreign insurance  companies' rate of market share in Japan as a standard to  measure the degree of market liberalization and to use such a  standard in future negotiations. Among other things, Japan is  asking the United States to unify supervisory regulations, which  vary from state to state.    The Finance Ministry, which is in charge of promoting  negotiations in the area of insurance services, thinks that many  U.S. requests are consequences of insufficient understanding  regarding insurance services because the United States Trade  Representative, which represents the United States at the  negotiations, is not an organization that is responsible for  supervising insurance companies.</p>

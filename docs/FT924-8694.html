			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Shephard warned over spending on Tecs LEADERS of the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) yesterday warned Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, that there must be no cuts to the programme in Thursday's Autumn Statement. The warning came as renewed tension emerged yesterday between the government and business on the responsibility for and the financing of national training programmes. Mrs Shephard emphasised the responsibilities of business as far as training is concerned to the conference: 'The main responsibility for developing the potential of people in work rests with employers. That embraces all your decisions about people - on recruitment, on training, on job changes and on involvement.' Employers spend more than Pounds 20bn a year on training, while the government's expenditure on training programmes is Pounds 2.5bn. The training programmes are supervised by Tecs, which are responsible for delivering the government-funded schemes. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, the group of Tec leaders which liaises with the government on behalf of the movement, told the conference: 'In the Tecs, we recognise the problems of government in the public-expenditure round. What we need, as well as adequate funds, is greater flexibility in the use of our funds.' The greater part of Tec funding is spent on youth training and the training of unemployed adults. But under Treasury rules, Tecs have little flexibility to switch money from one part of their budgets to another. Mrs Shephard refused to be drawn on the funding arrangements for Tecs likely to be contained in the Autumn Statement, but she acknowledged: 'We have some way to go on flexibility'. Mr Duncan Lawton, chief executive of British Vita, the polymer, fibre and foam company, noted that the success of Tecs is based on the reputation of their boards in local communities. 'If on Thursday we are going to be severely cut in spending, the reputation of those boards will be dented. They will not be able to deliver,' he warned. This, he added, would be 'immoral'. Mrs Shephard told the conference: 'There is a tension between trying to give these tremendously motivated business people as much freedom as we can in a way which is consonant with the use of public funds'.</p>

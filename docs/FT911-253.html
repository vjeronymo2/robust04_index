			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: A long wait to journey's end On Friday night, May 3, just before I was due to spend the Bank Holiday weekend with friends in Norman-dy I received a call from them warning me that there were spasmodic strikes by the French engineers on the boats. On checking with Sealink in Newhaven I was told that the 10.15am sailing next day would probably go ahead as planned - information repeated at 7.30am the following morning. On arriving at Victoria in very good time for the 8.32am connection the notice-board announced that the train had been cancelled, without any other information whatever. On trekking across to the so-called international information office, someone helpfully suggested that I take the evening boat-train connection to Newhaven, but without any assurance that there would be a sailing even then. It was a Sealink matter and British Rail could not help. The Sealink office in Victoria was of course firmly closed until at least 9am, by which time I would have missed several connections to the coast. Fortunately a bomb scare led to the evacuation of the international information office and of some platforms, thus delaying departures. I happened to have in my pocket the telephone number of Sealink in Newhaven. I was told initially that the sailing had been cancelled, only to be interrupted by a further message that it was going ahead after all. That was precious little use to me, as it was far too late to reach Newhaven by any conceivable method. On persisting with this mild objection, I was told to take the next train to Dover and that Sealink in Calais would provide transport to Dieppe. At Dover a Sealink hostess assured me that a message had been sent by radio ahead and that I would be met in Calais, intelligence repeated by the ship's purser. But of course there was no-one at Calais, where all the baggage was sent on to the railway station on the assumption that every non-car passenger was going on to Paris. I found one minor Sealink official who put me back on an empty bus going back to the embarkation area, assuring me - I fear correctly  - that no message of any kind had been sent. I then had to wait until the Calais manager could be found, as he was sorting out dockside problems. He was willing to arrange a taxi, so long as the Dieppe manager accepted that the lapses had occurred on the Newhaven-Dieppe stretch. There was another wait as the Dieppe man too was 'busy sorting out dockside problems'. Normally I only drop names in the last few minutes when all else has failed. But I was reduced to giving my profession, saying who my host was and that we were having a business dinner and that an extremely prominent member of the French cabinet, who lives in the neighbourhood, might drop in to join us. But even if President Francois Mitterrand had been expected it would probably not have helped. What mattered was to establish the responsibility within Sealink. I even had to give a hypocritical defence of British Rail. After I had cooled down over a cup of coffee a message came over the tannoy that I was wanted downstairs and a proud Calais manager told me he had persuaded Dieppe to pay for a taxi. My journey back was 'normal.' This means that I had to queue for a long time to get on and off the boat and carry my own luggage. And, despite '1992' and having a British passport, I had to queue again on board for a landing document. What is the moral? Sealink was taken over last year by an international concern, Stena Line, from Sea Containers. Somehow I think it would all have been very different if there had been competition between different companies to carry passengers on that particular crossing.</p>

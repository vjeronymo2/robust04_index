			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Tackling the numbers problem: The profession's troubled search for cohesion To the public, accountants are all the same. Proof of this can be seen on a video being shown at a series of accountancy conferences. In it people are waylaid in the street and asked what they know about accountants. The answer is very little, beyond a vague idea that the 'chartered' ones are trained. Given this public perception of unity it is ironic that the profession is spending a great deal of time and money trying to achieve a cohesion most people think it already has. But leaders of the profession are worried that this vague recognition is not enough. They want a 'single voice', and a strong lobbying group, to fight against government intervention and steer the profession towards unity in the next century. The present structure of the accountancy profession is anything but uniform. There are six professional bodies, six presidents, different training schemes, different qualifications, different headquarters, and different styles. As Mr Tom Glancy, president of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, told a meeting in Solihull, West Midlands, earlier this week on proposals to merge the bodies: 'It's like six cats hissing over their territory.' The meeting was one of a series of 'pan-professionals' discussing broad proposals for merger, common qualifications, and training. The mood of the meeting - which was probably more positive towards merger than others held in London and Leeds - was best summed up by Mr David Bishop, the chairman of the working party which produced the principles. He said: 'We can't stay where we are. We can agree on where we want to go. What we can't agree is how to get there.' By the end of the meeting there was widespread agreement that accountants differed more within their separate organisations than between them. The principle of rationalisation seems to be widely accepted. The details may yet prove intractable. Mr Roy Loader, a former west Midlands president of the Institute for Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said that keeping up standards was the big issue. There might be a 'dilution' of standards in a merger. This produced the most awkward moment of the evening. Heads were shaken in embarrassment and eyes turned heavenwards. Mr Bishop, a certified accountant and a member of the Financial Reporting Council, pointed out: 'We have been developing these standards together.' Mr David Delve, a practitioner from Birmingham, complained that the process had been 'top down and not bottom up. I can see nothing in it for me - am I missing something?' Mr John Sarrington, a management accountant from Corby, Northamptonshire, said: 'Will the remaining bodies go on if one of the bodies says no?' Mr Bishop refused to be drawn but pointed out that 'they are still all at the table'. Mr Bob Fisher, a chartered accountant from Solihull, said a better job was needed on propaganda as members had been allowed to 'wallow' on the issue. 'If we don't get together we shall fail the future and fail our country,' he said. Mr Martin Heathcock from Stourbridge, West Midlands, a chartered accountant with a certified accountant as a partner, said: 'I am very much in favour of these proposals.' He won the loudest applause of the evening. Mr Mike Robinson from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, immediate past president of the chartered institute's district branch, said the damage had been done by the press, which portrayed the so-called Bishop plan as dead. A warning was left by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, whose booming voice overlays the beginning of the conference video, exhorting accountants to speak with a single voice but adding with exasperation: 'I have been saying this for 20 years.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lene Skogstrom: "Norwegian-Developed Cancer </F> Vaccine"]    [Text] Pronova has secured for itself the sole right to  develop and sell a cancer vaccine that is now being tested at  the National Hospital.    The Norwegian pharmaceutical firm Pronova has entered into  an  agreement to develop and sell the cancer vaccine that has been  developed at the Institute for Transplantation Immunology (ITI).    If the results of the therapeutic vaccine are as promising  as  the scientists believe, great possibilities may open up on the  world market for the Norwegian pharmaceutical firm.    The state company Medinnova at the National Hospital has  negotiated the agreement. It includes 10 million kroner for  further basic research at the Institute for Transplantation  Immunology. In addition, there are possibilities of license  earnings in the future.    "We have collaborated with the Institute for two to three  years already. The cancer vaccine project is extremely  interesting, but it is a long way off," says Sven Arild  Andersen, administrative director of Pronova.    The Norwegian scientists at ITI and the doctors at the  National Hospital are the first in the world to test this type  of cancer vaccine on humans.    The cancer vaccine is supposed to help the patient's own  immune defenses to attack the cancer tumors. If the results are  as the scientists hope, the vaccine can help approximately  one-fourth of all new cancer patients each year. This pertains  to a part of the patients who get cancer of the colon, lungs,  pancreas, and thyroid, along with leukemia and malignant  birthmark tumors.    "Without the cross-professional and very competent milieu at  the Institute for Transplantation Immunology we would never have  been where we are today," says Gustav Gaudernack, leader of the  group of scientists behind the cancer vaccine project and senior  scientist at the Norwegian Cancer Society.  <H5>  Five Patients </H5>   In the research project, five patients at the National  Hospital with cancer of the pancreas are involved in testing out  the first vaccine.    An operation or other treatment is not appropriate for these  patients.    For the moment, the vaccine has not been shown to produce  side effects. It is too early to say anything about results. If  this first test goes well, the research group will seek  authorization to test the vaccine on colon cancer patients by  spring.    Not all patients can take part in the experiments. The  vaccine is supposed to awaken and work as a team with the  patient's own immune defenses and, therefore, it is important  that the immune defenses are functioning well. Patients whose  immune systems have been suppressed after cell poisoning or  radiation therapy will probably react poorly to the vaccine and  are not appropriate for treatment.    "Therefore, we want to introduce the vaccine as early as  possible," Gaudernack points out. "The idea is that the vaccine  will prevent remaining cancer cells from developing further  following an operation or other treatment. In the future, the  vaccine can also be used as a preventive vaccine if we can  identify persons at risk by gene testing and begin the vaccine  before the cancer has broken out."  <H5>  "Tailor-Made" </H5>   The vaccine is tailor-made to each individual patient.    Cancer tumors are produced when changes occur spontaneously  in some of the body's genes, so-called mutations. One gene  family, which is called "ras," is important from the point of  view of the cancer cell--a sort of "cancer cell Achilles heel."  The cancer cell needs this gene in order to grow.    "We have found out that three mutations in ras genes are the  most frequent. In the pilot study we are testing out these  three. We must therefore find patients who have precisely such  mutations in their genes," Gaudernack relates.    In order to chose the right patients the scientists at ITI  have developed an extrasensitive gene test, for which an  international patent has been sought.    Many scientists around the world are testing "rougher" types  of cancer vaccines. But the Norwegian vaccine is special because  it takes aim precisely against a specific gene mutation that has  been identified within the patient. "Therefore, we avoid  subjecting patients to treatment that in any case would not do  any good," Gaudernack says.    In a few years, the research team at the National Hospital  will know much more about the cancer vaccine's potentials.  Gaudernack will not indicate when the vaccine may go into  commercial production.    "This can take time, depending upon what sort of response  the  patients have to the vaccine--and whether the effects will be  different for different types of cancer," he says. "We are  breaking new ground and it is important to do the job properly  before talking about offering the cancer vaccine as a part of  the treatment of cancer patients."  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  How the Vaccine Works </H5>    -  A tissue test of the tumor shows whether the patient has  the appropriate gene mutation that the vaccine will work against.    -  A blood sample is taken from the patient--white blood  corpuscles are drawn out.    -  Specially suited vaccines--so-called peptides--are  transferred  to the white blood corpuscles drawn from the patient.    -  The "new" white blood corpuscles are injected back into the  patient.    -  The "new" white blood corpuscles rouse the other white  corpuscles to an attack against the cancer cells.    -  The cancer tumor is beaten back.</p>

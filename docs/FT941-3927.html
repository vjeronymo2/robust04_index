			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Observer: Tic tic tock The latest development in the battle by Catalans to promote their long-repressed language is the Catalan timepiece. And we're not talking Salvador Dali floppy watches - surreal though it is. Former shipping executive Francesc Ortiz has patented a Catalan watch-face. He argues that conventional watch-faces numbering the hours from one to 12 reflect the Spanish, not the Catalan, way of telling the time. To Catalan speakers 6.30 is 'two quarters of seven'; what Brits would call 'a quarter to seven' is actually 'three quarters of seven'; and 7.15 is 'a quarter of eight'. So the new watches - ordered from a Swiss manufacturer - feature the figures 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 where you would expect to see 3, 6 and 9. All clear? Ortiz, 35, then wants the Catalan-nationalist regional government to change all public clocks to the same system. He evinces surprise that no-one has thought of this before.</p>

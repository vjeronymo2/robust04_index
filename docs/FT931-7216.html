			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Computer unit helps Schindler advance SCHINDLER, the second-largest lift group after Otis of the US, said its consolidated net income jumped 26.8 per cent last year to SFr110.7m (Dollars 74.62m), due largely to the consolidation of the Also computer services subsidiary and an unexpected improvement in interest income. Excluding these special factors, net income was up 9.2 per cent to SFr95.3m on sales up 11.3 per cent to SFr4.46bn. The directors have proposed raising the dividends on registered and non-voting shares from SFr25 per share to SFr26 and on bearer shares from SFr125 per share to SFr130. Orders eased 1.1 per cent during the year to SFr4.2bn, but orders for lifts and escalators rose 3.9 per cent to SFr3.8bn. Overall, orders on hand at the end of the year stood at SFr2.9bn, 8.5 per cent lower than a year earlier, mainly because of a slump in demand for rolling stock. Also, which distributes personal computers in Switzerland, was acquired in 1988, but proved initially unsuccessful. The group wrote down its investment, but brought it back into the financial statements last year after it completed its third year in profit.</p>

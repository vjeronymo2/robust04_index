			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Germans likely to take a quiet approach: With looming elections on its mind, Bonn is expected to be diplomatic in presiding over EU wrangles The German presidency of the European Union has still not begun, and yet already accusations of German high-handedness are being heard in such capitals as London and The Hague. The unseemly wrangle at the Corfu summit over a future president of the European Commission was precisely the sort of start that German officials and diplomats were hoping to avoid. Whether justified or not, the charges about the way Chancellor Helmut Kohl sought to promote the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, against Mr Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, were what senior Bonn diplomats had feared would happen. When they take the reins of the EU council of ministers on July 1 for the rotating six-month presidency, Bonn's officials and ministers will be bending over backwards to be effective and persuasive, but certainly not pushy. 'We are very conscious of the sensitivity of some of our fellow member states, so we see a particular need to be sober and restrained,' a senior diplomat said last week. Add to that the coincidence of Germany's marathon election year, with five state polls and a general election in September-October, and the chances of an aggressive and high-handed German presidency are extremely slim. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, and Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister - the two most important ministers involved - are fighting a desperate rearguard action to keep their minority Free Democratic party in parliament at all. Mr Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, will be delighted to welcome all opportunities for a televised high international profile. But their priorities are all domestic until October 16, the general election day. 'It is one reason Germany has been keen to co-ordinate its presidency with France next year, and then Spain,' according to one foreign diplomat. 'They are worried that they will get very little started this year.' Another argument against expecting too many fireworks from the next six months is that Germany is anxious not to alienate electors in Finland, Norway and Sweden, the three future member states that still have to hold referendums to ratify their accession treaties. Thus any talk of sweeping institutional reforms at the forthcoming 1996 conference is being firmly discouraged. In spite of that, the ministries have been working hard to draw up a clear programme of EU priorities, which Mr Kinkel will spell out to the German Bundestag tomorrow. The first is simply trying to make the Maastricht treaty work. That means, in particular, putting the reforged relationship between the newly elected European parliament and the council of ministers on a good working basis. Germany is determined to take the parliament seriously. That is one important reason why Mr Kohl wants to agree on a candidate for the European Commission before July 18 - when that person is supposed to address the parliament in Strasbourg for the first time. It is also why he pushed hard in Corfu to have parliamentary representatives fully involved in the working group preparing for the 1996 conference. Another aspect of making Maastricht work will be a big effort to promote ever closer co-operation on both foreign policy and internal security between the member states. Thus the whole area of opening up the EU to central and eastern Europe, in areas of political co-operation as much as market opening, is a clear German priority. But Mr Kohl and Mr Kinkel will be making every effort to ensure that EU policy is pushed as much by other member states as by themselves. The German government has always been keen to promote co-operation on crime-fighting, anti-drugs operations, and common immigration policies. As for economic policy, the theme will be deregulation, and the emphasis will clearly be on firm cost control. It is the one area where there could be tension between Germany's national interests and its presidential priorities. For there are election pressures to keep German payments to Brussels more strictly under control. Mr Waigel has already promised to be a hard financial task master in fixing next year's EU budget.</p>

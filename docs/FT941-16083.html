			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Income tax administration faces its biggest change for decades - The finance bill, published yesterday, is designed to turn the provisions of Kenneth Clarke's first Budget into law. An all-party standing committee of MPs, meeting through February and March, will be responsible for most of the detailed deliberation on its 241 clauses. The bill needs to receive the royal assent by May 5 This year's finance bill is a record breaker. Its 241 clauses and 23 schedules cover 417 pages, making it the longest ever. It will pave the way for a system of self-assessment of personal taxes that is the most far-reaching change to the administration of Britain's income tax system since the introduction of pay-as-you-earn after the second world war. The bill to turn the November 30 Budget into law also reflects the most extensive advance consultation with experts by the government of any UK Budget. The bill contains no new departures from the policies announced on Budget day. However, it includes a mass of detail that was not in Mr Kenneth Clarke's speech or the Budget announcements from the Treasury, Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments. Two new taxes, the air passenger duty and the insurance premium tax, account respectively for 15 and 24 clauses of the bill. The insurance tax alone covers 17 1/2 pages. The chapter covering changes to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax takes up 64 clauses and covers 70 pages. The parts of the bill introducing self-assessment and simplifying the income tax system are covered in two chapters that run to 40 clauses and 40 pages altogether. The various tax schedules take up 213 pages, or more than half the bill. The government consulted experts about 170 clauses of the bill, with discussions on all but 40 clauses being held before Budget day. It released 96 clauses for discussion in draft form before the Budget and six clauses afterwards. But this detailed discussion on technical issues between the government and experts did not prevent the bill from running into criticism yesterday. Ernst &amp; Young, the business advisory company, condemned the bill as 'nonsense'. Mr Andrew Jones, Ernst &amp; Young's national head of tax, said the Inland Revenue was trying too hard to legislate for every possible eventuality, however remote. Mr Jones pointed out that the legislation on international headquarter companies and foreign income dividends, which is meant to make life easier for companies and attract foreign investment, 'runs to more than 28 pages of fine print'. 'I seriously doubt whether any member of parliament, however dedicated, can be expected to scrutinise this bill with the care it deserves,' he said. Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the bill represented a lost opportunity. Instead of producing a completed finance bill that would be debated on narrow party political lines, the government should produce a draft Budget which would trigger a widespread debate on policy and technical taxation issues, he said. The exact timing of the bill's passage through parliament has still to be fixed by the business managers of the House of Commons. However, its second reading is expected around January 24. It is likely to be considered by the committee of the whole house at the end of the month before being considered by a standing committee from February 7, 8 or 9. The committee stage is due to be completed before the Easter recess so that the bill can be considered by the Commons after the holiday. It must receive royal assent by May 5.</p>

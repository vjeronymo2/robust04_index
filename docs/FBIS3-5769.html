			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has decided  to scale back tariff concessions on nine industrial items in its  list of Uruguay Round commitments due to be submitted to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on Friday.    The Economic Planning Board presided over an international  policy meeting Thursday and decided to impose duties of 3  percent to 4 percent on the nine industrial imports rather than  abolishing them, as agreed earlier with the United States in the  GATT-sponsored negotiations last December.    In its country schedule, Washington also scaled back tariff  concessions recently on the grounds that Japan and the European  union had failed to make comparable offers.    Subject to 3-percent duties are three copper products --  tube  or pipe fittings of copper and alloy, stranded wire copper  cable, plated bands and the like.    Under 4-percent tariffs came computer equipment -- input and  output units, printers, monitors and cathode-ray tube terminals  -- and semiconductor devices -- piezoelectric crystals and  crystal vibrators.    With the changes, Korea presented non-tariffication offers  on  965 manufactured items instead of the initial 974.    The United States had proposed abolishing tariffs on some  electronic, non-ferrous and wood products last December but,  rebuffed by Japan, it submitted smaller tariff concessions in  the industrial section at the GATT on Feb. 28, a Finance  Ministry official said.    Seoul, accordingly, decided to offer tariff cuts instead of  none on the same nine items that Washington had scaled down, he  said.    It again followed Washington in setting rates, levying the  same 3 percent tariffs on copper goods as the United States and  other major countries and slashing the current 8-percent duties  on electronic goods 50 percent to 4 percent, as was done by the  Americans.    Together with its agricultural country schedule, Korea will  submit the revised list of industrial offers to the Geneva-based  GATT headquarters on Friday.    The schedules of every country undergo screening until March  21, and those drawing complaints from concerned exporting or  importing countries will have to go through extra consultations.    Seoul officials say they will actively participate in the  screening process to protect their country's interests.    Once the screening is finished, the overall Uruguay Round  accord -- whether it is revised from the Dec. 15 version or not  -- will be signed at a ministerial meeting in Morocco in April.</p>

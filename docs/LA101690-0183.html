Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'SEX, LIES' STAR DISMISSES FAME  </P> <P> Andie MacDowell, the repressed young wife in "sex, lies, and videotape,"  flinches at the possibility of becoming a superstar.  </P> <P> "I like doing normal things, like going to Disney World with my family.  </P> <P> And it would be terrible not to be able to because of fame," MacDowell said in  the November issue of Glamour magazine.  </P> <P> MacDowell, who was a top model before landing her first role in "Greystoke,"  lives in a Victorian house in Upstate New York with her husband, model Paul  Qualley; son Justin, 4, and daughter Rainey, 18 months.  </P> <P> If she weren't an actress, she said, she would be "a mother and a gardener."  </P> <P> "I've got a huge vegetable garden, everything from arugula to broccoli, to corn  to sunflowers," she said.  </P> <P> She has two new movies coming out soon: "The Object of Beauty" with John  Malkovich and "Green Card" with Gerard Depardieu.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> WORKER CRUSHED BY HIS STEAMROLLER  </P> <P> A 32-year-old Norwalk man, ending a workday of road repair in Simi Valley, was  crushed and killed Friday by his steamroller when he jumped from the runaway  machine, authorities said.  </P> <P> Miguel Gonzalez, an employee of Imperial Paving Co. of Whittier, was pronounced  dead at the scene about 3:45 p.m., said Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate of the  Ventura County coroner's office.  </P> <P> Gonzalez probably died of a chest injury, although an autopsy will be performed  today, Wingate said.  </P> <P> Gonzalez and at least one other employee had finished work on Black Canyon Road  in the Santa Susana area and were driving their steamrollers up the winding  road to their vehicles, said Lt. Tony Ditzhazy of the Ventura County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> Ditzhazy said Gonzalez jumped from his steamroller after it had apparently lost  power and began rolling backward down the slanting road. He said that Gonzalez  was then struck by the steamroller and that a co-worker found the body in the  roadway.  </P> <P> The steamroller fell into the bottom of the canyon, Ditzhazy said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian head of state has issued a decree on  certain aspects of carrying out the privatization of state  property in the republic's regions. In accordance with the head  of state's decree, commissions are to be established to conduct  an in-depth study of individual cases of state property  privatization and cases of uncontrolled privatization. Local  branches of the relevant ministries and departments are to  decide promptly on the inclusion of individual enterprises into  the privatization lists and to present agreed proposals to the  Ministry of State Property Management. Local bodies of  authority are to use economic methods to assist in the process  of managing the enterprises which have already been privitized  and utilizing their industrial potential. In order to distribute  vouchers among the population, the process of compiling the  lists of the republic's citizens and their presentation to the  Ministry of State Property Management should be speeded up.  Apart from the Ministry of State Property Management, the heads  of towns and rayons are to assume personal responsibility for  implementing this task.</p>

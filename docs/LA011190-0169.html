			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFC PLAYOFF NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> REEVES BLASTS TAGLIABUE FOR A 'ROOKIE' MISTAKE  </P> <P> Coach Dan Reeves of the Denver Broncos criticized a decision by the NFL to  allow the Cleveland Browns to arrive in Denver later than usual for Sunday's  AFC championship game.  </P> <P> "They took advantage of a rookie commissioner (Paul Tagliabue)," Reeves said.  </P> <P> League rules require visiting teams to arrive at least 48 hours before a  championship game, but the Browns sought and were granted a waiver from  Tagliabue allowing them to arrive on Saturday, 24 hours before the game.  </P> <P> Cleveland team physicians believe the Browns will be less bothered by Denver's  mile-high altitude if they arrive only 24 hours before game time.  </P> <P> "When we went to Cleveland three years ago, we had to get in there two days  early," Reeves said. "Part of the reason was media accessibility, even though  the only Broncos at a Friday press conference were me and one player.  </P> <P> "Traveling on Friday is definitely disruptive. It's a disadvantage. You  practice at home before you leave. You have to meet at your hotel on Saturday.  In Cleveland, our players couldn't sleep at night because their fans kept  driving around our hotel, honking their horns. "It's disruptive having to go on  the road, but that's the way it's supposed to be. That's why you play for the  home-field advantage. I agree that the rule is antiquated. But to all of a  sudden have it changed the week before the game is a mistake, in my opinion. I  don't agree with the decision."  </P> <P> Reeves continued to needle the Browns over their apparent preoccupation with  Denver's thin air.  </P> <P> "The altitude is going to be a factor whether they come in here 45 minutes  before the game or 45 days before the game," he said. "They went to Albuquerque  for a whole week one year. Another time they came here the day before. It  doesn't matter.  </P> <P> "Because of our crowd and the altitude, I think most people around the league  would agree that we have the biggest home-field advantage of any team. The thin  air does have an effect. Our record at home proves that."  </P> <P> Hoping to muzzle any ideas fans might have about starting up a Denver "dawg  pound," officials say they plan to clamp down on rowdy people who throw objects  during Sunday's game.  </P> <P> Fans caught tossing items on the field at Mile High Stadium during the AFC  championship game will be arrested, and could lose rights to season tickets,  officials say. In addition, security will be beefed up.  </P> <P> During an Oct. 1 game in Cleveland when the Browns defeated the Broncos, 16-13,  fans pelted players and officials with dog biscuits, eggs and even radio  batteries.  </P> <P> Referee Tom Dooley had the Broncos switch ends of the field during the game to  avoid the "Dawg Pound," after he was hit on the head with an AA battery. The  "Dawg Pound" is the nickname given to the east end of the Browns' stadium where  the rowdiest fans sit.  </P> <P> Coach Bud Carson dreams of having his Cleveland Browns run through the Denver  defense the way the Pittsburgh Steelers did for half a game last Sunday.  </P> <P> But he says it won't happen.  </P> <P> "You can't duplicate Pittsburgh's running game," Carson said. "There are a few  things that they do that we also do with our running game, but we don't do them  as well. We're a different team than they are."  </P></p>

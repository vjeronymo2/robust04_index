			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Pressure grows on Craxi to step down as Socialist leader GROWING differences in Italy's Socialist party, tainted by revelations of corruption in its Milanese stronghold, emerged over the weekend with calls for its leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, to step down. In his toughest challenge to the leadership, Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist minister of justice and a former protege of Mr Craxi's, said the current leaders had become a liability and should step aside before a national conference due later this month. Mr Martelli, backed by more than 20 of the party's 73-strong directorate, said the resignations would let the conference concentrate on reform and improving the party's image. The leadership, for years the party's strongest card, had become a 'problem', he said. Claiming surprise, Mr Craxi said he would make inquiries to see whether the majority of the party's directorate favoured the call. Although Mr Craxi has not been implicated in the various investigations into corruption and illegal political funding, close allies have been arrested in Milan, while Mr Gianni De Michelis, the Socialist former foreign minister and now the party's deputy leader, is under investigation in the Veneto region. Separately, magistrates in the northern city of Varese, a stronghold for the autonomist Lombard League, have started investigations into five MPs, one from the European parliament, for a variety of alleged charges including corruption and illegal funding. In Naples, the battle of wills between politicians and magistrates investigating alleged corruption and electoral malpractice took a new turn with judges defending their decision to seek computer records from Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the health minister, and other local MPs. Magistrates are looking into claims that MPs traded votes for political favours, notably jobs in state companies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Chang-ki] </F>   [Text] In an interview with the PUSAN MAEIL SINMUN on its  founding anniversary on 14 May, President Kim Yong-sam said: "I  believe that it is not necessary for us to particularly propose  first the South-North summit talks or the exchange of special  envoys." Thus, he clearly stated that as long as there is no  progress in South-North relations, including the resolution of  the North Korean nuclear issue, he has no intention of proposing  the summit. During the news conference on the first anniversary  of his inauguration in February, President Kim had said: "I will  hold the South-North summit talks if it is necessary to solve  the nuclear issue." However, when asked why he is expressing a  different opinion now, he said: "This is because of the  considerable change in the situation compared with that time."  He also added: "North Korea ruptured the talks itself when it  threatened us during the working-level contact for the exchange  of special envoys in March with the remark of turning the South  into a `sea of fire.'"</p>

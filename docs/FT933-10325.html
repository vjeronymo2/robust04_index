			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Donohue returns to black DONOHUE, a large eastern Canada newsprint producer controlled by the Quebecor publishing and printing group, returned to profitability in the first half with earnings of CDollars 8.3m (Dollars 6.4m), or 23 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 11.3m, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Sales were up 13 per cent to Dollars 286m. Second-quarter net profit was Dollars 2m, or 5 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 3m, or 10 cents. Newsprint and timber products shipments were higher with firm prices but pulp markets declined further. Lower interest rates and a lower Canadian dollar helped - most of Donohue's production goes to the US. Canfor, a western Canada forest products group, earned CDollars 17.6m, or 60 cents a share, in the second quarter, against a loss of Dollars 9.1m, or 34 cents. Revenues were up 10 per cent to Dollars 301m. First-half profit equalled Dollars 1.17 a share, against a loss of 78 cents. Tembex, an eastern Canada special pulp and cartonboard producer, had a CDollars 6.7m third-quarter loss, against a loss of Dollars 4.3m. The loss for nine months was Dollars 34m, against a loss of Dollars 22.7m, on sales of Dollars 277m, against Dollars 223m.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Ward denies hiding Pounds 5m from Guinness MR THOMAS Ward, the US lawyer who advised Guinness on its 1986 takeover of Distillers, finished giving evidence at his trial yesterday. Mr Ward, who denies stealing Pounds 5.2m from the company, rejected a prosecution claim that he had concealed the payment from the Guinness board because it had been dishonestly taken. Asked by the judge why he later transferred Pounds 3m of the money to the Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, Mr Ward repeated he was putting the money aside for tax liabilities. He was worried about the financial security of US banks, even though his law firm kept both its own, and clients', money in a Washington bank. It had never occurred to him to open his own account with a British bank, he said. The trial continues today.</p>

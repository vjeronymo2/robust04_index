			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- On Monday [7 March] morning, once  again warning strikes of the public sector began in parts of  Lower Saxony. According to the Public Service, Transportation,  and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV), these strikes will have a  considerable negative effect on public local traffic in  Braunschweig, Goettingen, and Lueneburg in the course of the  morning. After the agreement reached in the west German metal  industry, the Trade Union has stuck to the warning strikes in  Lower Saxony to make the public sector employers present a new  offer for he next round of negotiations on 10 March.    So far, the OeTV demand for income improvements of 4 percent  has been countered by the employers with a list of items to be  abolished and the demand for a break in wage increases. Heinz  Schleusser, the chief negotiator of the laender, has meanwhile  come out in favor of a 2-percent wage raise as of 1 January  1995. Regarding the issue of safeguarding employment, however,  the Social Democratic Party of Germany politician did not show  any readiness for compromise in an interview with the Berlin  daily B.Z. (Monday edition).    The OeTV expects about 5,000 participants in warning strikes  in Braunschweig, Goettingen, Lueneburg as well a in Holzminden,  Celle, and Salzgitter on Monday. Last Tuesday, about 10,000  public sector employees had gone on temporary strike in Lower  Saxony.</p>

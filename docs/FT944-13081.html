			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Renamo drops Mozambique election boycott Mozambique's first multi-party elections were back on course last night after Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the country's former rebel movement, reversed his eve of poll decision to stage a boycott. The Renamo leader changed his mind under intense pressure from the United Nations, western countries that have helped fund the elections, and from neighbouring states, including South Africa. It would have been made clear to him that he could expect no sympathy from either regional or international governments, and Mr Dhlakama may well have been warned that the frontline group of southern African states were prepared to offer military assistance to the newly elected government of Mozambique should Renamo resume its guerrilla war. 'The fact that Zimbabwe had committed troops (to Mozambique) in the past was a strong incentive to Dhlakama to sit up and take notice,' said Mr Greg Mills, director of studies at the South African Institute for International Affairs. He said the sending by South Africa of Deputy President Thabo Mbkei and Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, with the blessing of other regional states, to pressure Mr Dhlakama had shown the Renamo leader the depth of anger at the boycott, which had threatened to unhinge years of work to restore peace in the impoverished country. The boycott decision, said Mr Mills, announced only hours before polling began on Thursday, highlighted a deep split within Renamo, which fought a 16-year war against Mozambique's formerly Marxist rulers of President Joaquim Chissano's Frelimo party. 'There is a very big split within the (Renamo) party, with Dhlakama and his advisers on the one side and a large number of party officials who realised Renamo had very little option,' said Mr Mills. Mr Dhlakama changed his mind after negotiating through the night and morning with officials from the United Nations, western embassies and the National Election Commission. He declined to answer questions about his volte face. The Commission extended the country's two-day presidential and parliamentary elections and voting will continue today. Mozambicans and African leaders had feared the Renamo boycott could lead to a renewal of the civil war which ended with a peace accord between Renamo and Frelimo two years ago. 'A shadow has been lifted with Dhlakama's decision,' the United Nations special envoy to Mozambique, Mr Aldo Ajello, said. Mr Ajello, in charge of the 7,000 strong UN peacekeeping force, said his impression was that the election had gone well so far. President Chissano, widely expected to be returned to the presidency and capture a majorty of the 250 parliamentary seats at stake, welcomed the decision: 'This is what all of us wanted,' he said. There remain doubts, however, about the Renamo leader's intentions, and many observers do not rule out the possibility that Mr Dhlakama will cry foul when the reults are declared. Final results are not expected until mid-November. Mr There are 12 presidential contenders and 14 political groups vying for a place in the assembly.</p>

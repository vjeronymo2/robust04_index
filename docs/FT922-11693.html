			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Building blocks of recovery: The factors fuelling the US's emergence from recession The US economy seems to be recovering from one of the longest periods of stagnation since the Great Depression. But the pace of growth is sluggish and the US is unlikely to serve as an effective locomotive for the world economy, as it did in the early 1980s. On the contrary, alarm about adverse trends in Japan and Germany is raising doubts about the outlook for US exports, which have contributed heavily to overall growth in recent years. At the same time, few economists are entirely confident about the domestic revival: a relapse into full-blown recession is not expected, but few forecasters would be shocked if a period of faster growth were followed by another temporary setback. Last Friday, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told the Senate banking committee that a mild recovery appeared to be under way, but he was evidently frustrated at its sluggish pace in spite of repeated cuts in interest rates. 'I don't find 2 per cent growth, which is what we're experiencing at this particular stage, adequate,' he said. The International Monetary Fund was also noticeably cautious in its latest economic forecast released this week. Officials say a US recovery seems to be under way but describe it as 'modest' and 'hesitant'. The IMF, like most other forecasters, expects growth to fall far short of the 5-6 per cent annual rate typical of the early stages of past recoveries. The Fed's anxiety is understandable. After a surprise easing of monetary policy a fortnight ago, the federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money for banks - is 3.75 per cent, the lowest level for a generation. Low rates have stimulated rapid growth of bank reserves. But bank credit remains depressed and M2, the main measure of the money supply, has again dropped to the bottom of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range. Within a few months of this happening last year, a weak economic recovery had fizzled out. The Fed is nervous because the economy is behaving strangely. From the Second World War to the Reagan boom of the 1980s, the economy followed a traditional business cycle. During upturns, inflation rose and companies began to accumulate inventories - stocks of unsold goods. Fiscal and monetary policy was then tightened, curbing demand and causing an abrupt liquidation of inventories. After a brief downturn, policies were loosened and companies began to rebuild inventories. Growth surged and the cycle began again. The past few years have not fitted this pattern. The rise in oil prices triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 tipped the economy into a brief recession: gross domestic product declined sharply in the final quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991. But this short period of contraction was only a phase in a much longer period of stagnation. Excluding the two quarters of declining output, the economy has grown at an annual rate of barely 1 per cent for three years. Unemployment has crept higher and now stands at a six-year high of 7.3 per cent. This slowdown was fundamentally different from previous post-war recessions. The late stages of the 1980s boom were characterised less by an excess of inventories (which remained tightly controlled) than by a glut of real assets, especially commercial real estate but also of cars and other consumer durables. This was financed by excessive levels of debt in all sectors of the economy. The relevant question today is not whether the economy is capable of inching forward, but whether balance sheet strains have healed sufficiently to permit a healthy recovery. Late last year, the outlook appeared grim. With employment and production falling, many sectors of the economy seemed to be experiencing a 'double dip' recession. But late in December, Mr Greenspan seized the initiative, cutting the discount rate by a full-point to 3.5 per cent. This decisive move - the boldest of his career - prompted a surge in share and bond prices and checked a damaging slide in household confidence. Today the short-run outlook seems brighter partly because the monetary relaxation is being supported by an easing of fiscal policy. To bolster its re-election chances, the Bush administration has accelerated federal spending and reduced personal tax withholding rates. The IMF reckons the total fiscal stimulus this year is equivalent to about 0.8 per cent of GDP, less than in the early 1980s but still significant. The signs of economic improvement are visible mainly in the consumer and housing sectors. Residential construction is the one sector of the economy to have enjoyed a 'normal' recovery since early last year. Housing starts have risen almost continuously and are now running at an annual rate of more than 1.3m - sharply above last year's trough - but a pace that may not be sustained given demographic changes that have reduced the demand for housing. Personal consumer spending is estimated to have grown at an annual rate of about 5 per cent in the first quarter, relative to the final quarter of last year. This rebound, however, only compensated for weakness during most of last year and leaves consumption subdued relative to past recoveries. The rapid growth of consumer spending, however, may not be sustained. Sharp increases in retail sales in January and February reflected special factors  -temporary injections of spending power from tax refunds and higher benefit payments, unusually warm weather and faulty seasonal adjustments. The savings rate also declined from already depressed levels. Retail sales dipped slightly in March. And, significantly, car sales - usually a crucial ingredient in consumer upturns - had not recovered even by early April. In other sectors, solid evidence of recovery remains patchy. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the health of manufacturing - has bounced back after a sharp decline in the winter. But order books are filling slowly. Industrial production grew sluggishly in February and March but only partly made good previous falls. Non-agricultural employment rose only marginally last month and was not significantly higher than last May, when the faltering upturn supposedly began. On the other hand, claims for unemployment insurance have fallen quite sharply in recent weeks, providing tentative evidence of an upturn. Exports were weak around Christmas but rebounded strongly in February, helping reduce the monthly trade deficit to only Dollars 3.4bn, the smallest shortfall since 1983. What is likely to happen next? A minority of monetarist economists is worried about a potential resurgence in inflation. The shadow open-market committee set up to second guess the Fed is already calling for higher interest rates. Most economists, however, are confident that inflation will remain subdued at about 3.5 per cent, in spite of a freakish 0.5 per cent jump in the consumer price index last month. But there are clouds on the horizon. The core consumer price index has risen more rapidly than expected for several months. And a leading indicator of inflation compiled by economists at Columbia University is pointing to an early acceleration of inflation - to perhaps 4 per cent. On output, the range of opinion is surprisingly narrow. A few brave souls are projecting GDP growth of slightly more than 4 per cent at an annual rate, but the majority of forecasters - including the White House and Fed - expect growth to fall in a 2-3 per cent band. Fast rebounds are always possible when production is running well below capacity, but there are many reasons to favour the more conservative growth forecast: The poor international outlook. Mr Greenspan is probably right to downplay the direct impact of Japanese share price falls on US markets. But the shifting of resources into the export sector to help service debts incurred in the 1980s has left the American economy more dependent on overseas markets than ever before. Since 1987, exports have accounted for two-thirds of total growth. Low consumer confidence and weak labour markets. The long US stagnation appears to have seriously dented household confidence. Indices of consumer sentiment rose slightly in March but remain close to their lowest level for a decade. The sour mood is closely linked to labour market trends. After generating more than 18m jobs in the 1980s, the Great American Jobs Machine is idling. This mainly reflects a belated wave of restructuring in service industries. While beneficial in the longer term, the immediate effect is to create unusual job insecurity for white-collar employees. Sectoral weakness in defence and commercial real estate. The drag on the national economy from defence cuts is widely underestimated. The retrenchment has already led to the loss of 780,000 jobs with another 1m set to disappear by 1995. Industrial production of defence and space equipment is down more than 10 per cent from its 1990 peak with further cuts in the pipeline. Commercial real estate, meanwhile, is showing few signs of recovery. Indeed, further large cuts in non-residential construction spending appear likely given a precipitous fall in building permits. The debt overhang. A surge in bond and equity issues has allowed companies to restructure debts. Many households have refinanced mortgages at lower rates and paid back some instalment debt. But this has addressed only a fraction of the 'excesses' of the 1980s. As a share of GDP, household and corporate debt remains well above the levels of the early 1980s, not to mention previous decades. In contrast to previous recoveries, consumer and business spending in this upturn seems unlikely to move far ahead of sluggish income growth. These trends seem likely to flatten the normal trajectory of recovery. Looking further ahead Americans may need to adjust to diminished growth prospects. Annual growth in excess of 3 per cent during the Reagan boom reflected unsustainable levels of borrowing. Even the ever-bullish White House Council of Economic Advisers concedes that the potential growth rate in the 1990s is only about 2.2 per cent a year compared with 2.7 per cent in the 1980s. And even this requires an unexplained jump in productivity growth to offset slower expansion of the labour force. The biggest economic challenge for Mr Greenspan and other policymakers may thus lie less in achieving an unspectacular growth rate of about 2 per cent than in convincing Americans that - at current levels of savings and investment - this is the best to be expected without an acceleration of inflation.  -------------------------------------------- AMERICA'S LACKLUSTRE RECOVERY  -------------------------------------------- REAL GDP  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries    0.6               3.0  -------------------------------------------- INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries    0.8               4.1  -------------------------------------------- HOUSING STARTS  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries   32.7              31.2  -------------------------------------------- EMPLOYMENT  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries    0.0               1.6  -------------------------------------------- CONSUMER SPENDING*  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries    2.1               3.5  -------------------------------------------- CAPITAL SPENDING*  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries   -2.1              -1.2  -------------------------------------------- CORPORATE PROFITS  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries    4.3              32.2  -------------------------------------------- PRODUCTIVITY  --------------------------------------------   1991/92          Average of  % change       past recoveries    0.7               2.7  -------------------------------------------- Recovery periods: trough to trough plus two qtrs/eight months.

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / US and Cuba to hold talks over migrants Cuba and the US have agreed to hold limited talks on migration to address the Cuban refugee problem, but will not discuss the trade embargo and the US presence at Guantanamo Bay, it was announced over the weekend. President Fidel Castro last week called for comprehensive talks, but the Clinton administration has insisted that it is only prepared to discuss migration at the meeting scheduled to take place in New York on Wednesday or Thursday. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday: 'We're going to talk with the Cubans on the one subject where we've got something to talk about, and that is migration. . . On other subjects, we really don't have very much to say to Castro.' The US and Cuban governments have conducted periodic migration talks since 1984, covering issues such as hijacking, prevention of alien smuggling and the return of criminals. The meeting this week is a resumption of those working-level discussions, State Department officials said. President Castro followed his decision to discuss migration with an order, reported in Juventud Rebelde, the Havana newspaper, prohibiting the departure of unsafe boats and rafts carrying children. The order may be interpreted as a tiny concession to the US, which has felt the flood of Cuban refugees attempting to come to the US by boat in the last month was made possible by Mr Castro's border patrol turning a blind eye. Stormy weather in the Straits of Florida has continued to deter Cubans from attempting the crossing. The Coast Guard picked up 130 people on Saturday and by early afternoon yesterday reported it had found only another 30 Cuban refugees. The dramatic fall in numbers comes at the end of a month that has seen 17,100 Cubans flee for the US. Administration officials acknowledged the weather was a factor contributing to the drop in numbers but also said it was an indication that Cubans had come to understand that they would not get into the US if they fled by boat. Cubans were getting better information about how to legally emigrate to the US, officials said. Mr Christopher took it as a positive sign that in the past few days more than 200 refugees being detained at the Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base have asked to be returned to Cuba.</p>

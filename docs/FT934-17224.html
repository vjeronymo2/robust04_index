			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar jumps on figures THE DOLLAR responded well to positive US data yesterday, jumping a pfennig against the D-Mark in late London trading, writes Emma Tucker. It was further boosted by a feeling that investors had underplayed the significance of events in Russia. Reports from Moscow that armoured vehicles had moved nearer the Russian parliament reminded dealers that the struggle in the former Soviet Union is not yet resolved, and another bout of nerves pushed the D-Mark lower. Later, news that the Chicago purchasing managers' index rose to 54.5 per cent in September from 50.2 per cent in August lifted the dollar even higher. The market was particularly heartened by a jump in the employment component of the index from 47.3 per cent to 51.5 per cent, an early indication that next week's crucial non-farm payroll figures will be better than expected. There was also promising news from the US Department of Commerce, which reported that August personal income rose 1.3 per cent from the previous month's figure, the strongest gain since April. Economists had expected a 1 per cent increase, compared with July's 0.2 per cent fall. 'There are now signs that the market was too pessimistic about the US economy,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins from Bank of America in London. 'There is a case for being more optimistic about growth in the third quarter.' The dollar closed in London at DM1.6365 for an advance of 2 1/4 pfennigs on the day. Against the yen it was more static, although it ended only slightly below the day's high of Y106.12. This compares with the previous day's close of Y105.15. The US currency finished New York trading at DM1.6345 and Y106.15. Sterling had a better day, rising  3/4 pfennig to DM2.4475. 'The pound was oversold on Wednesday,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham of UBS. 'Now people are taking a more realistic view on the potential for rate cuts.' UK economists are still debating the merits of another interest rate cut. Yesterday, Mr Patrick Minford, one of the government's seven wise men, said: 'The chancellor should devise a more robust monetary policy and cut interest rates while ruling out tax increases. He should not worry if the pound falls against the D-Mark because this might help the recovery.' But analysts, including Mr Minford himself, are not confident that Mr Kenneth Clarke will follow this advice. Elsewhere in Europe a number of currencies gained from the unwinding of the D-Mark. The Belgian franc, however, was marginally weaker at BFr21.55 to the D-Mark after a 0.10-point cut in central and end-of-day rates. Rumours that Luxembourg was considering severing its currency peg to Belgium, should the Belgian franc depreciate further against the D-Mark, also weakened the currency.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Top bond prize will rise to Pounds 1m Premium bond owners could become instant millionaires as part of a new structure for the savings-cum-lottery scheme. From April next year the top prize in the premium bond draw, conducted by Ernie (Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment), will be Pounds 1m. National Savings, the government department that runs the bond system, said the change was not a response to the planned launch of a national lottery late next year or early 1995. The lottery, which will raise money for sport, charities and other causes, is expected to reduce the attraction of premium bonds. However, National Savings said the increase in the top prize from Pounds 250,000 was the first change since 1980, and was a necessary update. The prize system is being fully restructured - weekly prize draws will end. The monthly draw, in addition to the Pounds 1m prize, will include two prizes of Pounds 100,000, three prizes of Pounds 50,000, four prizes of Pounds 25,000 and 10 of Pounds 10,000. There is no change in the way smaller prizes - between Pounds 50 and Pounds 5,000 - are being allocated. The changes mean the overall yield on the fund (annual prize money paid as a percentage of money invested) will rise from 5 per cent to 5.2 per cent. As a further incentive to buy bonds, the waiting period before bonds can enter the draw is being reduced in February from three months to one month. Bonds purchased in January and February will be eligible to take part in the first Pounds 1m draw. National Savings also said it was cutting the interest rates paid on many of its savings products. The changes follow recent declines in building society rates, themselves largely a response to the recent base rate cut from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent. The new 41st issue of fixed-rate certificates will pay 5.4 per cent if held for five years compared with 5.75 per cent on the 40th issue; new Series H Capital Bonds will pay 7.25 per cent over five years, compared with 7.75 per cent on Series G. Rates on the First Option Bond, which needs to be held for only one year, will fall from 6.34 per cent to 6 per cent. Meanwhile, the return on the 7th issue of index-linked certificates will be inflation plus 3 per cent over five years compared with inflation plus 3.25 per cent on the 6th issue.</p>

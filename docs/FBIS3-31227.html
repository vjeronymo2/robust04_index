The meeting was attended by Romanian Ambassador in  Chisinau Marian Enache.    During the meeting the two sides briefed each other on the  development of the transition process in the two countries and  on the specific difficulties of the current period, which are  being complicated by the energy crisis. The two sides also  discussed tangible problems pertaining to bilateral relations by  emphasizing the importance of economic integration both for  Moldova and Romania.    It was stressed that the documents that have been signed and  those that are to be signed in the coming days will represent  genuine support for trading companies in the two countries, as  well as for expanding direct relations between economic units on  the two banks of the Prut River.    Within this context, the two sides noted that relations  between companies and even between ministries have exceeded  cooperation at the summit. They agreed that more frequent  contacts are necessary between the heads of the two governments.    Vacaroiu proposed that unsolved problems in economic  cooperation be checked and examined to identify the best  solutions swiftly. He assured the high-ranking guests that the  Romanian Government will continue to support -- economically and  financially, including through the 1994 budget -- the economy of  the Republic of Moldova, as well as the economic integration  process, a press release received from a government spokesman  points out.</p>

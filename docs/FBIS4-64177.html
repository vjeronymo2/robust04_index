			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 27 (LETA) -- A delegation of the Romanian  Government arrived on Thursday [26 May] in Riga to sign a  cooperation agreement on trade and economy between the  governments of the two countries. The delegation included  officials of the Trade Ministry and the adviser on economics of  the Romanian Embassy in Lithuania, Dan Tiron, who is also a  trade representative of Romania in Estonia and Latvia. The  agreement was signed on Friday in the Foreign Ministry.    The previous years were marked by a sensible decrease of  barter between the two countries which makes up only some  several hundred thousands lats. The new deal provides the most  favoured nation treatment in trade between both countries. It  means a remarkable reduction of rates of duties from both sides.  According to the forecast by the state Minister of Foreign  Trade and E.U. Affairs, Olgerts Pavlovskis, Romanian footwear,  clothes, fruits, wine and other goods will again become  accessible in Latvia soon.</p>

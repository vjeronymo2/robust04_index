			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HELMS AMENDMENT ON CONTROVERSIAL ART  </P> <P> The amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms that would ban National Arts Endowment  funding for "indecent or offensive works" has to be one of the most despicable  pieces of legislation ever ("Arts Supporters Fear Amendment as Censorship  Step," July 28, and "Senate Votes to Ban Funds for 'Obscene' Artworks," July  27).  </P> <P> It would mean that much controversial art would never see the light of day. We  would be left with museums full of still lifes, Norman Rockwell paintings and,  undoubtedly, plenty of U.S. flags.  </P> <P> Even if this amendment (approved by the Senate July 26 and pending discussion  in a conference with the House) is watered down or later nullified by the  court, rest assured that Helms &amp; Co. will still have done its work. How  many museums will decide not to book that challenging new artist or that  potentially controversial work?  </P> <P> I am ashamed of my own generation, which once was so vocal in support of  political and artistic expression and dissent.  </P> <P> WILLIAM PLATT  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Output falls 0.7% on month UK MANUFACTURING output is continuing to fall, indicating that the recession may be deepening, according to official statistics released yesterday. The Central Statistical Office said seasonally-adjusted factory output dropped 0.7 per cent in January compared with the previous month, after a revised 0.4 per cent fall in December. More bad economic news for the government came with the separate announcement of a Pounds 1bn public sector borrowing requirement last month, compared with a net repayment of Pounds 0.6bn in February 1991. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party leader, called the industrial output figures 'appalling' and said they were much worse than the City had expected. Mr John Major brushed aside the manufacturing figures and said the economy was poised to come out of recession after the election. The data had little effect on the London stock market. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed at 2,491.2, up 20.5. This ended the run of four consecutive days in which the index had fallen largely as a result of pre-election jitters. Sterling firmed, closing in London up a quarter of a pfennig at DM2.86, while it gained more than 1 1/2 cents to Dollars 1.7315. In New York, it finished at DM2.8613 and Dollars 1.7355. In the three months to January, factory production was down 0.9 per cent compared with the previous three months. The CSO data indicate that manufacturing output has dropped by about 2 per cent since mid-1991, when it appeared the decline might have stopped. On the basis of yesterday's figures, factory output is falling at an underlying annual rate of about 3.5 per cent. The CSO's data for the two previous months indicated in each case that the annual decline was about 3 per cent. According to the CSO, factory output has fallen by 8 per cent from a peak in the second quarter of 1990, at around the start of the recession.

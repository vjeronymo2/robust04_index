			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has  denied a report on 3 May from the REUTER news agency citing a  responsible military source that the northern Yemeni forces shot  down a southern Yemeni Mig-21 fighter aircraft. The responsible  source said the report was totally untrue.    The source also rejected the report of the television's  first  channel yesterday evening quoting a military spokesman of the  Defense Ministry and the leadership of the General Staff of the  movement of the 'Abbas, Taysir, and Milhim Brigades toward the  former border areas in Shabwah. The source said this report was  not only completely untrue but was aimed at obfuscating the  continuing military reinforcements of the forces of the ruling  family in Sanaa, being provocatively sent to the former border  and toward the military units transferred from the southern to  the northern governorates after unity, in accordance with the  design to pounce on unity and democracy by attacking the active  and generous forces standing in the way of the adventurist  al-Ahmar family's plan to impose military rule.</p>

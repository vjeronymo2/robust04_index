			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARZA TO DEFEND HIS TITLE AGAINST PAZIENZA TONIGHT  </P> <P> Loreto Garza and Vinny Pazienza, two junior-welterweights who aspire to fight  super-lightweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez, will meet in a small-scale  pay-per-view boxing show at Arco Arena tonight.  </P> <P> Garza and Pazienza figure to attract about 8,000 tonight, which would figure as  California's -- and Sacramento's -- second-largest boxing gate this year. On  Sept. 22, Garza stablemate Tony Lopez drew a state-record gate of $601,000 and  a crowd of 15,000-plus when he beat Jorge Paez at Arco Arena.  </P> <P> Garza, who won the championship from Argentine Juan Coggi (who is on tonight's  undercard) in Paris Aug. 17, is 27-1 with 23 knockouts. He hasn't lost since  1983. Pazienza has a 33-4 record with 23 knockouts. EARL GUSTKEY  </P></p>

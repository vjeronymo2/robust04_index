			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the published notices for both rulemakings, the Coast Guard also conducted public hearings in Anchorage, Alaska on June 3, 1993, Valdez, Alaska on June 5, 1993 and Seattle, Washington on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 25959; April 29, 1993, and 58 FR 29157; May 19, 1993). The Alaska hearings were also teleconferenced to include several outlying communities in the Exxon Valdez impact area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Escort Vessel Requirements of OPA 90 and the PWSA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4116(c) of OPA 90 provides authority to require the use of a minimum of two escort vessels for laden single hull oil tankers over 5,000 GT operating in Prince William Sound, Puget Sound, and other U.S. waters determined to be appropriate. Therefore, any regulations issued under section 4116(c) must require a minimum of two escort vessels. Further, section 4116(c) provides no authority to require the use of escort vessels for ships other than laden, single-hulled oil tankers over 5,000 GT. In contrast, the PWSA has no such limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Performance-Based Escort Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The escort vessels are to assist a ship that becomes disabled from a loss of propulsion or steering control; the immediate presence of the escort vessels will reduce its chances of colliding or running aground. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 33 CFR part 168, the Coast Guard adopted a performance-based approach: The escort vessels must be capable of controlling the disabled tanker within the navigational limits of the waterway (taking into account transit conditions and certain other factors), and the tanker must be operated within the performance capabilities of its escorts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance-based regulations do not need to stipulate any particular number of escort vessels because the compliance process will lead to an appropriate number being utilized (which, in turn, will depend upon the performance capabilities of the escorts). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPA 90, however, makes no allowances for the performance capabilities of different escort vessels, nor does it recognize that smaller ships are easier to control than larger ones. The Coast Guard realizes that there may be circumstances where a single, high-performance escort vessel can effectively control a disabled ship within the performance requirements of 33 CFR part 168. In such cases, a second escort vessel may significantly increase costs without any commensurate increase in environmental protection. In fact, just the opposite effect might occur: the presence of unnecessary escort vessels, particularly in congested waterways, increases the risks of collision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Determination of Other Appropriate Waters for Escorting in Accordance With OPA 90 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the preceding discussion, the Coast Guard has determined that, although there may be other U.S. waters where tanker escorting could be beneficial, there is no need to prescribe an absolute minimum of two escort vessels in those waters. Likewise, it may be appropriate to require escorts for ships other than laden oil tankers in excess of 5,000 GT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, designating any other U.S. waters for escorting requirements will be accomplished using the Coast Guard's authority under the PWSA, which allows greater flexibility concerning the ships to be escorted and the number of escort vessels to be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Use of PWSA With Respect to Escorting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of PWSA authority is intended to complement OPA 90, not replace it. PWSA will only be used in ways that will allow greater flexibility in escorting while still preserving the environmental protection goals of OPA 90. For example, PWSA can be used to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Recognize the capabilities of high-performance escort vessels by allowing applicable ships to be escorted by a single escort vessel so long as it can still control the ship within the performance criteria of 33 CFR part 168. This will reduce the risks (and economic burden) of providing a second escort vessel when it is not necessary; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Recognize that not all waterways warrant escorting under benign conditions. This allows escorts to be required only when sea or weather conditions deteriorate beyond an appropriate threshold; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Similarly, to recognize that not all waterways are so constrained as to present navigational hazards to smaller ships. This allows escorts to be required only for ships exceeding an appropriate size threshold greater than the 5,000 GT size established by section 4116(c) of OPA 90; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

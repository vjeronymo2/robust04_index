			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Rifkind may raise subsidy to private BR RAIL privatisation may lead to higher government grants as long as the service is improved, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, said last night. Lines and services, far from being axed by private enterprise, would be expanded to attract traffic from overcrowded roads. Mr Rifkind said on BBC2's Newsnight: 'I frankly don't mind if at the end of the day it costs us more money, if it also means that we get a better quality of service for those who use our railways.' The whole purpose of government policy was not to maintain the railway lines but to increase the number of railway services available. Mr Rifkind's comments came in spite of the Treasury's long-standing opposition to spending more on the railways and after a long period of open disagreement between cabinet ministers about how the privatisation should be handled. A white paper on the BR sale, which is set to be a central part of the Conservative party's election manifesto, has been repeatedly delayed.</p>

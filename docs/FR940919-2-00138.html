			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Benchmark is calculated using the average of the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3-month Treasury bill rate on the first and last day of each quarter within the 12-month period in question. In calculating the performance fee, the basis for determining the amount of appreciation is the starting value of the assets in the client's portfolio at the beginning of the 12-month period. Every time a performance fee is paid out, the basis for assessing the performance is adjusted to reflect the net asset value after such fee payment. According to section 4.4 of the Agreement, any underperformance in a given quarter must be made up before any new performance fees are payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4.4 of the Agreements currently in effect with non-Plan clients states that the valuation of the performance of the account will be provided by the Manager; however, the applicant represents that this section will be amended to provide that the valuation of the performance of the account will be jointly determined by the Manager and the Plan's custodian, which is the bank or other entity holding the assets of the Plan or other Plan fiduciary responsible for causing the Plan to enter into the Agreement. The applicant further represents that, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this determination. If they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree, by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers. All such appraisers will be independent of the Manager. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the alternative arrangement, the client pays only a fixed fee equal to 0.40% per annum of the net asset value of the portfolio, payable quarterly in arrears based on the net asset value of the portfolio as of the end of the quarter, adjusted for additional withdrawals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant represents that the fees are disclosed in information materials furnished to the client, including the presentation flip book and the distributors' product overview letter. The applicant represents that the Manager's fees under the Agreement are competitive with the fees charged by competitors offering no guarantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. As stated, the Manager and the Bank would like to offer the same Guarantee to the Manager's Plan clients which are not investing in pooled funds. The Plan fiduciaries would not be required to select the Guarantee, or if selected such fiduciaries would still retain the right to cancel the investment management agreement or the Guarantee feature at any time upon reasonable prior notice. A Plan will be permitted to cancel the investment management agreement with the Manager on 30 days' prior notice. In addition, a Plan will be permitted to cancel the Guarantee immediately upon notice of cancellation being given; that is, no period of advance notice will be required for cancellation of the Guarantee. No separate fee or remuneration would be paid by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their affiliates for the Guarantee. The same negotiated investment management fees would be charged by the Manager whether or not the Plan fiduciaries accept the Bank's Guarantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of determining when the Guarantee would be enforced, and in what amount, records will be kept by both the Manager and the Plan's custodian. The applicant represents that the Plan's custodian has no relationship to the Bank, the Manager, and its affiliates. The records of these two parties will be reconciled monthly. The applicant represents that in determining the value of the Plan's account, the value of a security will initially be determined by the Plan's custodian. The value will then be checked by the Manager using the following sources depending on the sector and the markets in which the security is trading: the closing price shown on the Reuters and/or Bloomberg screens; or if the security is not so displayed, mid-market prices obtained from at least two brokers with these prices then being averaged. If the value as so determined by the Manager is not significantly different from the value determined by the Plan's custodian, the latter value will be used. If there is a significant difference, the Manager will consult with the Plan's custodian in order to reach a mutually agreeable valuation. Thus, the final value of the Plan's account is determined jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian. However, it is represented that, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this determination. If they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree, by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers. All such appraisers will be independent of the Manager. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Section 7 of the Agreement currently in effect with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-Plan clients permits the Manager to lend the securities held in the portfolio and to receive income from this process for its own account. However, this section also provides that any such lending by the Manager shall be entirely at the Manager's own risk and that the Manager shall indemnify the client for any loss sustained by the portfolio as a result of such activities. The applicant represents that this section of the Agreement will be amended to provide (a) that income from any such lending from a Plan's account will be credited to the Plan's account and not to the Manager's account, and (b) that no lending of this type will occur under circumstances where the borrower is a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to the Plan unless the conditions of Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 81&hyph;6 (52 FR 18754, May 19, 1987) and 82&hyph;63 (47 FR 14084, April 6, 1982, as corrected by 47 FR 16437, April 16, 1982) are satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

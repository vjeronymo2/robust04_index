			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Out of the frying pan, into another empire? Sir, Taking into account the conditions of the accession of Finland to the European Union, it is not misplaced to assert that 'Finlandisation' was not that bad. Our national peculiarity was probably better protected under Soviet influence than by the treaty of the union. More realistically, we must accept that an empire has fallen and another is rising. After Sweden and Russia, now it's the time of Europe. It is part of Finland's destiny to belong to some empire. Then just don't call it 'accession', but 'annexation'] Manko Pekkulo, Mission of Finland to the EU, rue de Treves, 21, 1040 Brussels</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Chrysler share sale raises Dollars 100m CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, has raised Dollars 100m by selling a further tranche of its shareholding in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors to US investors over the past few weeks, the company announced. Chrysler said the sale of 15.5m shares left it with a holding of about 35m shares in the Japanese vehicle manufacturer and cut Chrysler's stake from about 5.9 per cent to 4.1 per cent. Chrysler has been gradually reducing its Mitsubishi stake as part of a plan to concentrate financial resources on its own motor operation. In March last year, Chrysler sold about 43.6m shares in the Japanese car manufacturer for about Dollars 215m. Chrysler said the company planned to sell its remaining Mitsubishi shares, which are worth some Dollars 200m at current exchange rates, but had yet to set a timetable for the disposal. It said it may take a gain on the latest sale into its second-quarter earnings.</p>

According to official figures, 117 villages and enterprises  in the county generated an output value exceeding 100 million  yuan in 1993.    The county's product last year totalled 12 billion yuan,  averaging more than 10,000 yuan per capita, increases of 43.2  and 42.2 percent respectively over the previous year.    Its gross industrial and agricultural output value amounted  to 47 billion yuan, up 36.4 percent over the previous year.    A county official attributed the good result to deepening  the  reform and scientific upgrading; concentrating on the  development of industry, especially the service trade; and  leasing out small enterprises while organizing enterprise groups.    Last year saw the county's industrial enterprises spend 3.5  billion yuan on technical transformation and extending  cooperation with research institutions.</p>

The rule also establishes procedures for releasing information about the location of caves and establishes general prohibitions to protect cave resources from abuse and degradation. The intended effect is to fully implement the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 on National Forest System lands and to ensure that National Forest System lands are managed in a manner to protect and maintain, to the extent practicable, significant caves. These regulations have been developed in close consultation with the Department of the Interior to ensure uniformity and consistency in approach to the extent that statutory authority permits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is effective June 17, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Brent Botts, Recreation, Cultural Resources and Wilderness Management Staff, Forest Service, USDA, P.O.

The Act also seeks to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves located on Federal lands for scientific, educational, or recreational purposes. The Act requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue such regulations as he deems necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act on National Forest System lands. The regulations are required to include, but need not be limited to, criteria for the identification of significant caves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 3, 1989, the Forest Service published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  inviting comments on what should be included in a proposed rule, and particularly requesting suggestions as to criteria for identifying a significant cave. A total of nine comments were received in response to that notice: 4 from agencies of State government, 2 from business entities, 2 from individuals, and 1 from a Federal agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, a proposed rule was published on December 23, 1991 (56 FR 66388). The proposed rule described the process the Forest Service would use in designating significant caves, provided for public nomination of caves, specified six criteria by which a cave would be evaluated to determine whether it is significant, and identified the authorized officer as the authority for designating and documenting a significant cave. The proposed rule also specified how cave information and locations would be released. Lastly, the proposed rule revised certain prohibitions specific to caves and cave resources. Seventy-six letters were received during the 90-day comment period in response to the proposed rule: 30 from individuals, 18 from cave-related organizations, 16 from Federal agencies, 5 from natural resource organizations, 4 from business entities, and 3 from State agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received are available for review in the Office of the Director, Recreation, Cultural Resources, and Wilderness Management Staff, Auditors Building, 4th Floor, 201 14th Street, S.W. at Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC, during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Overall, almost all respondents were pleased that the Forest Service was promulgating regulations. Many offered valuable suggestions for improving or clarifying specific sections. Some of these suggestions were group efforts, using similar or identical language to identify and describe their interests, concerns, and recommended modifications to the proposed rule. A few letters endorsed other respondents' statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

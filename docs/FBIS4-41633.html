There are currently 450,000 servicemen in the Army,"  Leonid Kravchuk said. "I do not think this number is final.  The question of the organization of the Army and its armament  is under constant study and is the focus of the attention of  state bodies. The possibility of some Army subunits switching  to service on a professional basis is being examined." [passage  omitted]</p>

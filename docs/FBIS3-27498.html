During a span of 80 minutes,  President Li answered 30 questions from Chinese and foreign  correspondents in a tone of optimism and firmness coupled with  plenty of gestures and vivid comparisons. In answering  questions, President Li stressed that the world has moved toward  a new era of regional cooperation and economic sovereignty after  the Cold War and that the Republic of China [ROC] would make  efforts in the three directions of peace, cooperation, and  prosperity to strive for the development and stability of Asia  as a whole.    The following is the full text of President Li's opening  address, as well as his answers at the news conference:    President Li said: This unofficial trip served several main  purposes. We deeply understand that at present, after the end  of the Cold War, the international situation, especially the  international economic situation, has gradually shifted toward  regional cooperation. The further establishment of regional  economic relations under these circumstances is a matter of  great importance. There should be an exchange of views between  the leaders of countries in the Asian region and the Republic of  China [ROC] with regard to the various countries' conditions and  their attitudes toward what the ROC thinks and does. This will  be a great help to us. During my eight-day vacation trip, there  were many difficulties caused by the absence of diplomatic  relations. Despite these circumstances, after talking with and  hearing the officials' views, especially from the leaders of the  three countries, my conclusion is that the visit has yielded  fairly good results. It is very important for our efforts to  further establish relations of multilateral economic cooperation  in the Asian region in the future.    Through our current visit, we can see that all countries'  views, sentiments, and respects to the ROC in Taiwan are more  than we can imagine at home. This is a very happy thing. We  should be grateful to the three leaders for their hospitality.    One thing for which I feel sorry about this trip is my not  being able to call on Chinese residents in each country, as we  had to respect the host countries' arrangements. In Indonesia,  I, in an unofficial manner, invited representatives of local  Chinese residents to the place where we stayed to exchange views  with them and understand their problems, hoping that we could  find a way to solve the problems. In Bangkok, however, we were  unable to listen to the local Chinese residents' problems. Here  I would like to express our regret to the Chinese residents of  these three countries.    Our country's further development must be separated from  ideology, with efforts being made in the directions of peace,  cooperation, and prosperity. Although we met with uncalled for  disturbances during our trip to the three countries, we did not  consider them as very serious problems. We are convinced that  the whole world will gradually understand that the ROC is a  progressive country, a country which helps other countries, and  a peace-loving country. Our endeavors do not reflect different  opinions toward any region or country, including Communist  China. Our efforts to help the mainland's development and our  efforts to help the progress and development of Southeast Asia  are all the same. We are ready to help the Asian region achieve  development with Taiwan's experience. This is our wish and  expectation.    I am really grateful to you, ladies and gentlemen, for  attending this news conference at such a late hour. I hope all  of you will raise as many questions as you can. I will make my  answers short so that everyone will have a chance to ask  questions. I thank you all, thank you.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have repeatedly mentioned  and stressed pragmatic diplomacy, that existence would bring  development, and that the ROC should have its own place in the  international community before reunification. In your visits to  the three countries this time, have you achieved indirect  results in realizing pragmatic diplomacy and fundamentally  facilitating return to the United Nations?       [Li] Pragmatic diplomacy is completely based on discussions  on economic cooperation. This trip prompted the Chinese  Communists' protests against many countries, but these countries  are all very pragmatic. In spite of the Chinese Communists'  repeated protests, they, being ready to make friends with the  ROC, maintained an unequivocal attitude, knowing the ROC is a  peace-loving and free nation.    As to the question of what actual benefits would pragmatic  diplomacy bring to our foreign affairs, I think that the  benefits to foreign relations through the current visit cannot  be seen in the short term. We must take a long-term view and  make contacts with many countries. Only then will we be able to  see results.    [Correspondent] In your opinion, in what way should Chinese  all over the world look at your trip?    [Li] We don't have a political agenda for my visits to the  three countries this time. Everyone should realize that the ROC  on Taiwan must develop. It is safe to say that the ROC is a  country of a divided China [zhong hua min guo zai tai wan shi  zhong guo fen lie zhong de guo jia 0022 5478 3046 0948 0961 0669  3494 2508 0022 0948 0433 5933 0022 4104 0948 1367]. The whole  world should realize that a unified China is a goal we will  attain in the future. However, at present the reality is that  China is divided. As a divided country under separate rule, we  should set the direction for our own development. This will  create greater room for reunification across the strait in the  future. Chinese all over the world should not approach this  visit from a political point of view, regarding it as something  that was intended to create one China, one Taiwan, or two  Chinas. There is no need to see the visit in this way, and  quite obviously, that was impossible.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, your trip to Southeast Asia  this time could be described as quite successful and very  fruitful. Will you make further overseas trips in the same  manner in the future? What countries or regions will be under  consideration should there be any similar trips?    [Li] As I have mentioned in my speeches on New Year's Day  and on Lunar New Year's eve, this may be a year the ROC will  develop a new direction for its international relations.  Besides, I feel that it is necessary to somehow make the  mainland understand this issue so that they can deal with it  more pragmatically. Today is just 16 February, there is so much  time left in the year. I think I will visit countries with  which we have formal diplomatic ties and countries with which we  do not have formal diplomatic ties. It is too early now to say  which countries I plan to visit. We will let you know after  every preparation has been made. This is the way such matters  should be handled.    [Correspondent] Your meetings during this overseas trip with  the heads of state of the three countries without diplomatic  ties with us constitutes a major diplomatic breakthrough, but  the Indonesian foreign minister said today that the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation [APEC] conference scheduled to be held in  that country this year will follow the Seattle model established  in the United States last year, meaning that you may not be able  to attend the conference in person. How are we going to resolve  this long-standing diplomatic situation on our side?    [Li] The United States established a model at the APEC  conference in Seattle last November, but it is hard to say  whether this model will be followed in the future. Therefore,  although the foreign minister of this year's host country,  Indonesia, wants to keep the model, future developments remain  to be seen. Provided we keep on trying hard again and again in  the future, the host country's attitude should eventually  change. Moreover, clearly put, are there other people who  understand the development of the Asian economic situation more  than the ROC does? This is not an issue that can be solved  within a short period of time, but I believe the future will be  very bright.       [Correspondent] Hsu Chia-tun [Xu Jiatun], former director of  Communist China's XINHUA Hong Kong branch, said in his memoirs  that the Communist Chinese leaders will not approve of Taiwan's  recent active maneuver for international recognition, which they  consider an action for independence in disguise. Such an  attitude on the part of Communist Chinese leaders is bound to  affect your unofficial trips abroad. What are your  countermeasures for dealing with the attitude of Communist  Chinese hierarchy?    [Li] Is this the attitude of the leaders on the mainland?  How are their unity and cooperation as compared to ours? As is  known to all, the communists sometimes use very strong rhetoric  in speeches targeted at others, which actually does not reflect  the internal view.    Moreover, what is Hsu Chia-tun's status? In my opinion, he  belonged to the third-generation leaders, about the same age as  Hu Yao-pang [Hu Yaobang] and Chao Tzu-yang [Zhao Ziyang]. Since  he went to the United States later, what category of people does  his mentality and view represent? How reliable is he? It is  very difficult to judge the trend on the mainland based on his  memoirs? His memoirs may reflect the view of some Communist  Chinese leaders, especially those of the older generation with a  strong ideology. Is this the consensus among the Chinese  Communists? We do not quite understand his view.    [Correspondent] Economic cooperation is the development  trend of all Asian countries today. When you met the heads of  states of the three nations, did you mention any plans for  economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, such as  cooperation with the ASEAN and Malaysia?    [Li] Despite different national conditions and demands, all  Asian countries will ultimately depend on foreign countries for  markets. Japan and the four small dragons are currently the  economically better off countries in Asia. However, assistance  from a few foreign countries will not be adequate for helping  one become well off. This is an all-inclusive issue.  Cooperation with every foreign country will be helpful and our  assistance to others will also be useful.    Discussions with these three countries about mutual  assistance did take place. For example, we discussed with the  Philippines the question of signing an agreement on establishing  free trade zones. ASEAN states are maneuvering to establish free  trade zones. However, it remains difficult to predict the  outcome. Ramos and I talked about this question and viewed it  beneficial to both countries. Further discussions will be needed  to decide whether this question should involve the ASEAN states.  As for Indonesia and Thailand, we also discussed the question  of developing bilateral trade. The ROC's experiences will be  helpful for these countries. We view this quesion with an  all-inclusive approach.    [Correspondent] Despite Communist China's strong protests  against your trip, the Philippines and two other countries have  emphasized that it does not violate their "One-China" policy.  Will this become a new diplomatic pattern, and how will it  affect the future development of cross-strait relations?    [Li] It will not have any effect. I believe that Communist  China arbitrarily lodged protests time and again, probably  because some of its functionaries, who are ignorant of world  trends, wanted to win praises from their State Council by  lodging protests to prevent Li Teng-hui's visit to these  countries. However, such a way of doing things is very immature  and childish.    In my view, there is no need to worry about this issue. We  will continue to maintain relations with the mainland. The focus  of cross-strait relations in the future should be laid on  searching for ways to strengthen mutual trust, so as to let the  Chinese Communists understand what is beneficial to them, and we  will not do what is not beneficial to them. I urge all of you  not to take this issue too seriously. The ROC is a mature  country.       [Correspondent] You visited many places during your  eight-day tour of Southeast Asia. Which of them left the most  profound impression on you? Which of them is worth our using  its experience as a reference?    [Li] Whenever I visited a country, I paid close attention to  its conditions, people's living standards, markets, houses,  farmland, and the availability of water. I am very much  concerned about these matters. We must not look down upon the  developing countries as backward just because the ROC has  achieved considerable successes on Taiwan over the past four  decades or so. Each ASEAN member has its own strong points and  shortcomings. For instance, having taken a look at Indonesia's  plan for the cultivation of mangrove woods, I found we are much  backward than others in this field of endeavor. Groundwater in  many of our localities has a high saline content. To date, no  one has come up with a very good plan to make improvement.  However, Indonesia has already made efforts to plant mangrove  woods and to use them to absorb saline content and to prevent  the increase of saline content in groundwater. It may look like  an insignificant matter, but it shows there are quite a lot that  we must learn.    In fact, due to different environments and problems, the  people in many places have their own methods of struggle. Many  of them are worth our learning. Instead of offering what one  has onsidedly, the so-called cooperation should have both sides  learn from and coordinate with each other. This is real  cooperation. Likewise, we should look upon a number of  countries in a "relative," instead of "absolute," attitude, and  should thus learn from each other.    [Correspondent] During your foreign visit, there were  different reports on the so-called "westward" and "southward"  overseas investment. What is your attitude toward our country's  investment policy?    [Li] The ROC's future economic development depends on its  overseas investment. This is because Taiwan itself does not  have enough economic resources. We are one of Asia's "four  little dragons." Statistics on our investment in ASEAN  countries, Mainland China, and North Korea -- countries which  are less developed than the ROC -- reveal an interesting  phenomenon: the more our businesses invest in a country, the  greater the volume of trade we have with it. Thus, investment  increases trade. We touched many of these issues in a  conference on Asia's trade prospects last year.    We believe we should not approach things with a suspicious  glance. This includes the so-called "westward" and "southward"  policies. The most important thing for the ROC is to increase  its international investment; economic relations and trade are  vitally important to us. From this point of view, the  government has no problem with the so-called "westward" and  "southward" policies.    [Correspondent] Your unofficial visit to the three Southeast  Asian countries, called ice-breaking journey by some people, was  quite successful. Our country's status and your prestige and  achievements in agricultural and economic areas have been  affirmed in those countries. It is believed that the trip will  contribute considerably to advancing our diplomacy, particularly  economic and trade diplomacy. How will the visit affect your  political life? Could you describe your state of mind and the  changes it has gone through?    [Li] During my visit to the three countries, particularly  Indonesia, many people called me Dr. Li or Prof. Li. This was  simply because many people, whether government ministers or  business leaders, knew that Li Teng-hui accomplished something  in the academic world and in agricultural reform. They knew  what I did was quite successful.    These countries hope that we will offer them good advice and  help them in this regard. I am quite willing to do so, because  it is a meaningful thing to do. Further, this will help us  forge closer ties with them.    In my talks with Indonesian President Suharto, for example,  70 percent of the questions he raised were on the issue of  dealing with high unemployment rate in a country where the  population is growing at 2.5 percent a year and on ways to  provide appropriate jobs to the unemployed. Seeing that  President Suharto showed great concern about this issue and was  pleased with my answers, I immediately called Taipei by phone to  send two sets of my three books to him to read.    I feel it is very significant that my work in the academic  work is respected by people. Whether it is an achievement or  not, I will be very happy if anything I did is beneficial to the  country.    My state of mind has not changed. I would feel very good if  I, at my age and with the last flames of a burning candle, could  help improve the life of ordinary citizens and enable them to  live peacefully in the country.       [Correspondent] What is the biggest gain of your current  trip? What is your mood now? How many points have you scored  in your current trip?    [Li] It is not nice for me to grade myself. Right now I am  very happy. Before my trip to Bangkok, the mass media  speculated whether I would meet with the king of Thailand. In  fact, my meeting with the Thai king had been arranged in advance.    Leaders in the whole world have a common view. Politically,  it is necessary to have democracy; and economically, it is  necessary to practice market economy, centering on the market.  The communist and socialist countries also advocate market  economy and freedom of market. Since leaders of the whole world  have this view, it is quite easy to promote mutual understanding  among leaders of the world. If leaders of the world hold more  meetings and talks, there will be only some small-scale  conflicts and a world war will not happen. Therefore, I am  convinced that the civil war in Yugoslavia will not touch off a  world war.    [Correspondent] Would you tell us whether you have another  plan to go abroad within one or two years? If you go abroad  again, where do you want to go the most.    [Li] The country I would like to visit most is the United  States. As I just said, this is a secret which does not need to  be mentioned. Whether the United States or the United Kingdom,  France, Germany, and Japan, I think I want to visit all those  countries. If there are opportunities, the U.S. President, the  Japanese prime minister, the British prime minister, and the  French president may all come to hold talks. Although Taiwan is  very small, the talks may offer some help to the world. There  are many people with whom I want to talk to.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have met with heads of  states of the three countries in your trip. Are we going to set  up a trans-ministerial organization to promote the development  of bilateral economic relations with those countries? How will  investment in those countries by plants and enterprises of our  country be protected?    [Li] In fact, the issue of investment in the Philippines and  Indonesia is well known at home. What the public has not  noticed are plans for rural development. As to how we will use  our experience of agricultural development to economically help  those countries, we have also made plans. We will examine this  matter later and I will ask Secretary General Tsiang Yien-shi to  take charge of the matter. When public and private enterprises  make investment in the three countries in the future, our  government will encourage and do its best to assist them.       [Correspondent] Having visited the Philippines and  Indonesia,  do you find their investment environments truly suitable to  Taiwan businesses? Do you not feel it is more important to  improve our domestic investment environment than helping our  businesses invest abroad?    [Li] There are no conflicts between improving our domestic  investment environment and investing overseas. The only problem  is where to spend the money. For the nongovernmental sector,  this is a question of capital distribution. Investment  direction differs from one country to another. Financially, we  have not yet reached the difficult stage of choosing between the  two.    We should realize why many businesses have invested in  public  undertakings in Indonesia. Indonesia produces a lot of energy.  The ROC cannot advance and develop if it does not have a  guaranteed source of energy supplies. Investing in Indonesia is  a long-term national policy and absolutely necessary. Investing  in that country is out of the need of our long-term national  development. It is not the same thing as setting up a few small  plants, like some other countries did. In the nongovernment  sector, labor-intensive industries in our country will be  replaced by investment in hi-tech industries. Therefore, there  will be no problems of capital distribution.    [Correspondent] The academic circles generally feel our  foreign policy and mainland policy should complement each other.  In your view, how can the two supplement each other?    [Li] Our foreign policy proceeds from pragmatic diplomacy.  Our mainland policy aims at promoting mutual trust across the  strait. The two have no conflicts with each other. It is not  necessary to view many issues, such as negotiations with the  mainland, from an ideological perspective. The mainland should  realize that it must not approach ideological issues with a  "fatherly" mentality.    I must reiterate that the pursuit of peace, progress, and  prosperity is a worldwide trend. A successful diplomacy will  become an important chip in our mainland policy. The two can  supplement each other.    [Correspondent] Did you discuss the question of Afro-Asian  economic and security system with leaders of the three countries  during your Southeast Asian tour?    [Li] The question of Asian regional security system was not  discussed. It does not help things to talk about how to fight  as soon as you meet someone whom you have not come to know too  well. The establishment of a specific security system should  proceed from economic cooperation. Exchange of views on this  will come next. The military aspect should not be made an  important element.    [Correspondent] In your view, has your vacationing journey  helped upgrade our relations with the ASEAN countries, the  principle goal of your trip? When you attend the APEC summit  next time, will you be as relaxed and confident as you play golf?    [Li] I am not confident of that. Making friends is not that  easy, nor is it that fast. We must go slow in making friends.  Take last year's APEC summit in the United States for example.  The U.S. President and other people all hoped I would not  attend. What would the outcome have been if I had insisted on  attending it? We must not let others misunderstand. We must  make all countries and people in the world respect the ROC. We  must make them view the ROC as an extraordinary country. This  was why I said then that I did not want to attend, lest people  blame us for destroying the summit's atmosphere.    Making friends requires five or six get-togethers to become  truly good friends. This is also true in the case of countries.  Between friends, some of the things must be done in an  appropriate environment. For example, in an appropriate  environment, I will ask the good friend: If you all can attend,  why can't I? In this way, many things can be resolved at the  right time.       [Correspondent] Mr. President, what is your impression of  the leaders of the three countries you visited?    [Li] The leaders of the three countries I visited this time,  including the king of Thailand, are all very intelligent and  wise. They all have deep understanding of the local situations  of their respective countries. For instance, Indonesian  President Suharto has been president for 25 years and people  think he always lives in his villa; but he knows the countryside  very well and also has a clear understanding of the Republic of  China.    Our current trip has enabled us to understand that many  leaders in the world not only understand their domestic issues  but also show concern for international issues. The leaders of  the three countries have seen many good points of our Republic  of China. I respect them very much and our talks were very  harmonious. They understood what I said and I also understood  what they said. I admired them very much.    [Correspondent] Following your visit to Singapore five years  ago as "President Li from Taiwan," you made a famous remark:  "Although not satisfactory but acceptable." During the current  visit to the ASEAN countries, some people addressed you as  Professor Li or Doctor Li although you represented the Republic  of China in going abroad. In promoting pragmatic diplomacy in  the future, how do you plan to make the Republic of China more  dignified? Besides, since you can happily hold talks with  leaders of the ASEAN countries, why can't the leaders of the two  sides of the strait sit down to talk in a calm manner?    [Li] This is a very difficult question. I am not  criticizing them, but I think, among leaders of the whole world,  the leaders of Communist China are most stubborn and ideological.    It is impossible for us to ask Communist China to forsake  one  country and two systems. Under such circumstances, the best way  is to act and they will naturally recognize the fact.    China is in a situation of split. It is no mistake that a  country needs respect. Some people invited me to dinner and  addressed me as "Professor Li" and "Doctor Li." They were very  innocent and I would not scold them. I think they have their  difficulty in their stand toward the Republic of China.  However, we should understand that the dignity of a country  does not rest with addressing me "His Excellency the Eighth  President of the Republic of China." Whether others think  highly or not of the circumstances and position of our country  -- this is the area, I believe, on which we should focus our  efforts. We should be more united and work harder, and not  think too highly of ourselves. Don't engage in "promiscuous"  and improper acts just because we have tens of billions of  dollars in our hands. We should win others' respect with our  culture and moral standards.    I am very willing to do more things for the country if there  is an opportunity. However, things between our side and the  mainland are very difficult before the time is ripe, and  according to our judgment the situation on the mainland is not  very satisfactory. I will study the question you mentioned in  the future.    [Correspondent] At present foreign policy lays stress on  economic affairs. Mr. President, how shall we assist our  domestic enterprises to develop transnational enterprises?    [Li] I have discussed this question with Minister Chien. As  conditions differ from country to country, the approach we take  should also be different. In the future, we should examine more  carefully the repesentatives and personnel we send to those  countries, for it is not helpful if the personnel we send do not  understand the conditions of those countries.    Now, in addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  other  units, even the Academia Sinica will actively discuss those  issues. I will ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make an  overall examination.       [Correspondent] Taiwan's businesses have made considerable  investment in Southeast Asia. Mr. President, are there any  specific guarantees or measures for encouraging Taiwan's  business circles to invest there?    [Li] The number one concern among Taiwan businessmen in  Indonesia and other areas is, I believe, their children's  education, including how to build schools, hiring of teachers  and principals, and curriculum. While in Indonesia, I invited  four representatives of a friendship association. The  government will address the questions they raised. They all  hold ROC passports and we should help them solve their  difficulties.    We have $15 billion investment in Southeast Asia. This  amount of money has been put into circulation, but we don't have  a financial center to provide assistance. How goods flow into  Southeast Asia and back to our country? We will ask Chairman  Hsiao of the Council for Economic Planning and Development to  study these issues. In short, we will simultaneously formulate  measures in regard to education, banking services, freight  trade, and so forth.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, during your trip to Southeast  Asia, did you invite, face to face, the leaders of the  Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand to visit our country? Will  exchange of high-level visits with Southeast Asian countries  become a regular, routine event in the future?    [Li] I did not raise this question during the meeting with  Thai King Phumiphon. As for the two other leaders, I officially  invited them and their responses were very good. They certainly  responded, by nodding their heads. We were extending an  invitation; it certainly would look awful if they did not make  any response, like nodding their heads. (laughter burst out  throughout the hall)    [Correspondent] During the trip, you emphasized promoting  regional peace and economic prosperity in Southeast Asia on the  basis of progress, prosperity, and peace. Some countries in  Southeast Asia are set against one another over the issue of  sovereignty of South China Sea. In your talks with the leaders  of Southeast Asian nations, did you raise the possibility of  using Taiwan's southern policy as a basis for a peaceful  solution to the East China Sea sovereignty issue among the  Southeast Asian nations so that they can jointly develop the  resources of South China Sea?    [Li] Your question coincides with my long-term view. I  plan to raise this issue during my second or third meeting with  them. I tried as much as possible not to raise sensitive issues  during the first meetings. Because the meeting time was  limited, sensitive issues would have made them uneasy and not  want to see me again. I certainly would raise this issue at a  second or third meeting.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you care about the aviation  and space industries a lot. During the trip, you visited the  aircraft plant in Bandung, Indonesia. Are we going to cooperate  with Indonesia or are we going to jointly develop aircraft with  Indonesia, Europe, and the United States? Will our country's  Hanhsiang Company take part in such a cooperation arrangement?  What is your assessment?    [Li] I asked a lot of questions when I visited the aircraft  plant in Bandung. I asked questions about the plant's  operations, management, and sales. But I did not suggest  cooperation. Why? I know the problems we have. They did not  say anything about their problems, but I can understand.    As for whether cooperation with Indonesia is possible,  because all the planes they produce are for commercial use.  [sentence as published] Indonesia has over 17,000 islands,  planes are needed for transportation. The plant's monthly  output of planes is about 170. Buying a plane is different  from buying a car. It takes a lot of money to purchase a plane.  Where will the money come from? Problems like these are many.    For this reason, I have asked Mr. Ku Lien-sung of the China  Trust Corporation to make an assessment, to examine all those  relevant issues including operations, management, loans, and so  forth. The Hanhsiang Company has not been officially founded  yet. There are still difficulties in this regard. We will try  to get a better understanding of the situation. I boarded one  of their helicopters. It wasn't bad at all.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, in your opinion, will your  unofficial visits to the three Southeast Asian countries help in  the ROC's bid to join the United Nations?    [Li] If the road to the United Nations is 100-km long, we  have covered only one meter. So we have to continue working  harder and harder. If we do not try harder, no country would  help us. If we work hard, even some big countries will help us  in the future.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLARK HIT BY BALL, HURT AGAIN;  </P> <P> PADRES: FREAK ACCIDENT BEFORE GAME LEAVES FIRST BASEMAN WITH FRACTURED  CHEEKBONE AND AT LEAST A TWO-WEEK EXTENSION OF HIS TIME ON THE SIDELINES.  </P> <P> Jack Clark, the Padre first baseman who was within days of coming off the  disabled list, suffered a fractured left cheekbone Friday night in a freak  accident and will be sidelined for at least another two weeks.  </P> <P> The injury was diagnosed as a fracture of the zygomatic arch, according to the  New York Mets doctors, and Clark will undergo X-rays today to determine if  there was any damage to his eye.  </P> <P> Clark, who has been on the disabled list retroactive to May 6 with an inflamed  disc in his lower back, was hit in the left cheekbone about 30 minutes before  the start of the game against the New York Mets. He had been running sprints  just beyond the infield when Padre reliever Pat Clements threw a ball from the  outfield toward second base.  </P> <P> "As soon as I threw it, I started yelling," Clements said. "I threw it real  high, but I could see he was running right underneath it.  </P> <P> "I started screaming at the top of my lungs, but it was right when a plane went  overhead. I don't know if someone 10 feet ahead of me could have heard me with  that plane."  </P> <P> Coincidentally, Friday was the first time Clark was able to run sprints and  take live batting practice. In fact, he was so impressive swinging with just  three-quarter power that Padre Manager Jack McKeon said he would likely be  activated Monday in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> And then this happened.  </P> <P> "I really feel bad about it," Clements said, "and I'll feel horrible if he's  going to be out for a long time because of this."  </P> <P> Said McKeon: "Sure, this hurts, but what are you going to do? We're going to  have to bring him some body guards from now on."  </P> <P> Since the day Clark changed his uniform number from 25 to 00, he played three  innings May 5 before suffering the inflamed disc, pinched a nerve in his back  while putting on his socks three days ago, and now this.  </P> <P> "I thought the number 00 was supposed to bring strength and power," Padre  reliever Craig Lefferts said. "I wonder if he's thinking about changing back."  </P> <P> Clark left the clubhouse before the end of the game and was unavailable for  comment.  </P></p>

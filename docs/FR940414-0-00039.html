The Duluth area was redesignated to attainment for CO, see 51 FR 45319 (December 18, 1986), and 52 FR 6548 (March 4, 1987). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Pursuant to section 107(d)(4)(A), the City of Duluth was designated nonattainment for CO as a result of monitored violations of the CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) during the 1988&hyph;1989 time period, see 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991. On October 30, 1992, the State of Minnesota requested the removal of a TCM from the CO State Implementation Plan for Duluth. This TCM is an improved truck turning radius. On September 24, 1993, USEPA proposed to approve the requested SIP revision, see 58 FR 49952. The State also requested on that date that a maintenance plan for the area be approved and that the area be redesignated to attainment of the CO NAAQS. Action on the maintenance plan and redesignation request is in a separate notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The State Implementation Plan Revision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State submitted rollback modeling that shows that the revision would not interfere with attainment of the CO NAAQS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA believes that the State has shown through rollback modeling of concentrations, air quality trends, and information on the effect of the construction of I&hyph;35 on the amount of truck traffic that would be rerouted, that I&hyph;35 provides an equivalent or greater reduction in emissions than the improved truck turning radius TCM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the transportation control measures with the exception of the improved truck turning radius have been implemented. This turning radius would have made it easier for trucks to turn at 14th Avenue and 3rd Street east (Trunk Highway 61). The City of Duluth discovered that enlarging the turning radius would require significant rerouting of utilities, which probably was not legally feasible, since utility companies have equal eminent domain authority. In some cases, trucks were using East 1st Street, which was not a designated truck route, to avoid the turn on 14th Avenue East and 3rd Street East. The City erected a sign on 1st Street directing through truck traffic to 3rd Street East so that trucks would not hamper movements on both 1st and 3rd Streets East. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, a truck heading northeast from the southwestern part of Duluth would by pass Duluth's downtown on I&hyph;35 unless it had a delivery downtown. Construction on I&hyph;35 was completed on October 28, 1992. All through truck traffic will now use I&hyph;35, eliminating permanently any need to widen the turning radius at the intersection of 14th Avenue East and 3rd Street. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Truck traffic will be able to access I&hyph;35 at Lake Avenue, 21st Avenue East, and 26th Avenue East. I&hyph;35 was designed to allow traffic out of the downtown area and a sign informs truckdrivers to use an alternate route to lead them out of the downtown area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although I&hyph;35 is not a measure in the SIP, it is a completed measure that provides permanent emission reductions. Therefore, USEPA believes the measure may be used to fulfill the terms of section 193. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State submits that I&hyph;35 provides reductions of traffic and CO by the rerouting of traffic. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) forecasts that 28 percent of overall downtown traffic is now carried on I&hyph;35, and more than 28 percent of overall downtown truck traffic is now carried on I&hyph;35. Mn/DOT forecasts that 42 percent of all downtown traffic and about 42 percent of all downtown truck traffic will use I&hyph;35 instead of downtown streets. The only trucks that will use Superior Street are the ones which are making local deliveries. Truck routes which divert truck traffic off Superior Street will be maintained for trucks making deliveries elsewhere in Duluth and for trucks carrying hazardous materials. All other trucks will use I&hyph;35. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has also shown that the completed I&hyph;35 will more than offset the reductions that would be obtained with a truck turning radius. The truck turning radius would only have lessened the amount of emissions from trucks and vehicles caught in traffic due to turning trucks. I&hyph;35 eliminated a substantial amount of emissions in the area around 14th Avenue East and 3rd Street, simply because trucks are taking I&hyph;35 instead.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State will track the SIP's progress in maintaining the standard by reviewing data from the local metropolitan planning organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comment/USEPA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No adverse comments were received on the September 24, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA approves the removal of the Improved Truck Turning Radius TCM from the SIP. The effect of I&hyph;35 as a permanent improvement has more than adequately replaced the Truck Turning Radius TCM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action makes final the action proposed on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49952) to approve Minnesota's requested SIP revision. This action has been reclassified from a Table 1 to a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12886 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filled in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

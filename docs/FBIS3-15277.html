"If those who have been  amnestied by the State Duma decision start any activity  jeopardizing the Russian state's security, they will be arrested  again in accordance with law," the president said.    Meanwhile, a high-ranking official at the Security Council  staff was utterly pessimistic in his comments on the news agency  reports: "The time is wrong, the form is wrong, and the effect  is also wrong..." Many staffers at the Security Council head  office on Ilinka Street are presently convinced that the  presidential advisers' key mistake was that they did not try to  draw on the authority of the Security Council, which "has not  yet been squandered on petty political showdowns and bickering,"  to settle the amnesty scandal. Speaking to your SEGODNYA  correspondent, a chief of the Security Council staff noted: "If  the amnesty-related problems were discussed not at the meeting  chaired by Kryzhakov, but at a Security Council meeting, which  State Duma representatives could well have been invited to join,  the matter could just have ended in a pacifying statement."    Moreover, in the immediate vicinity from the Kremlin they  have even been discussing a theory (which, as a matter of fact,  appears fairly trustworthy) whereby as early as one week before  the scandalous voting at the State Duma took place, Boris  Yeltsin received clear signals from the Security Council to the  effect that the potential political damage from the amnesty  could be minimized only if the president were decisively to  regain the initiative by granting a pardon himself. It is  doubtful, however, that any of the Security Council chiefs would  presently like to confirm the reports. The only reaction they  might have drawn would have been irritated remarks about "that  die-hard conservative, Lobov, who is always putting his foot in  it..."    Be that as it may, the Security Council sees the amnesty  story as a thing of the past. This is why yesterday's agenda  did not say a single word about it. Instead, it focused on the  discussion of the "Russian Federation Federal Program To Step Up  the Struggle against Crime."    According to reports from the Security Council staff, the  nearly 90-page document was undergoing the third reading in six  months. The document's authors, however, pointed out from the  outset that the implementation and, most important, the  financing of the extremely costly project would be impossible  without a political decision made at the top federal level. In  accordance with a resolution adopted by the Security Council  yesterday, the program must be submitted to the president for  definite approval within one week.    The two-year program, in its current form, is estimated to  cost slightly more than 4.8 trillion rubles (including around 2  trillion for 1994). The Security Council was careful to  emphasize, however, that these figures should be treated only as  preliminary estimates: the program is yet to pass a final expert  appraisal in the government. Given that the first, "liberal"  version of the program was estimated at nearly 15 trillion  rubles (it has thus been trimmed by two-thirds within the past  six months), further cuts in the proposed subsidies appear  fairly likely.    Citing estimates made according to UN methods, the authors  claim that all this money should be seen as "investment in a  profitable industry," because in two years' time it promises a  nearly two-fold yield.</p>

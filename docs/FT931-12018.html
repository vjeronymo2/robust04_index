			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Bank of Japan is pressed for interest rate cut MR Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, is under mounting pressure to cut official interest rates to help prevent the Japanese economy slipping into outright recession. Mr Mieno yesterday acknowledged the weight of the pressure from bankers, industrialists and politicians to cut the official discount rate which has stood at 3.25 per cent since last July. He said the crescendo of calls for a rate cut reflected the severity of the downturn which has hit the economy, particularly over the last six months. His remarks were seen as a signal to the business community that the Bank recognises the extent of the slowdown and will cut interest rates soon. The prospects for a cut were strengthened yesterday by figures showing Tokyo's annual inflation rate was just 1 per cent in January. Economists expect the national inflation rate, which was 1.2 per cent in December, will fall to 0.5 per cent in comingmonths. Only 5 per cent of companies polled by the Ministry of Finance said they had felt any benefits from the Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.9bn) emergency spending package announced last August. Mr Mieno earned a reputation as a financial disciplinarian after he raised interest rates more than two years ago to prick the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s. However in recent months he has faced mounting calls to adopt a more relaxed policy. Mr Mieno's critics' case has been strengthened by the Bank's research which has recently adopted a more pessimistic tone about the outlook for consumer spending and economic recovery. Bank officials argue its room for further cuts is limited because it is unwilling to reduce the official discount rate below the historic low of 2.5 per cent it reached during the late 1980s. As a result the next interest rate cut is widely expected to be the last for sometime. It is thought the Bank has wanted to delay a cut for as long as possible to make sure that more emphasis is placed upon increases in public spending to stimulate the economy. Financial analysts believe the Bank may be holding back an interest rate cut as an emergency measure to bolster confidence in the event of another sharp fall in the fragile Tokyo stock market. Mr Mieno made clear the Bank would support any major financial institution which faced a crisis through a build up of bad loans. He stressed there was no reason to expect such a crisis. Housing starts, one of the few bright spots in the Japanese economy, rose 5.4 per cent in December, according to figures published yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 29 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China, which  occupies the position of head on the rooster-shaped map of China  and used to be the country's biggest industrial base, has become  conspicuous for the rapid development of its agriculture in  recent years.    At present, at least 100 million of China's total 300  million  urban residents rely on the grain produced by the three  provinces of the area, namely Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning.    Last year the area produced 60 billion kg of grain, or 13.14  percent of the national total. About half of the grain is  marketable grain, which accounts for one third of the national  total of such grain, which is supplied to the country's urban  residents.    It is especially noticeable that Liaoning, an old industrial  province where urban residents account for 73 percent of the  total population, has produced more than 15 billion kg of grain  annually for four years in a row. Last year its grain output  reached 17 billion kg, 40 percent more than in the 1980s. Thus,  the province has become self-sufficient in grain for the first  time. Furthermore, last year it supplied 2.2 billion kg of rice  to southern China and exported some rice to Japan.    At the same time, the outputs of other varieties of farm  produce such as meat, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables  and fruit have also increased rapidly. In recent years the milk  and aquatic products supplied by the northeast China area have  accounted for 30 percent and more than 10 percent, respectively,  of the national total.    Liaoning, which has 14 large- and medium-sized cities, used  to be short of farm produce. Only a dozen years ago each urban  resident in the province had a rationed supply of a mere two kg  of rice, 1.5 kg of flour, 0.15 kg of edible oil and 0.25 kg of  meat besides a supply of coarse food grains every month. When  an urban resident of the province travelled to other parts of  the country, he often carried back large amounts of pork, which  was scarce at home. So, at that time people in the other parts  of the country nicknamed the people travelling from Liaoning  Province "hungry tigers from the northeast."    But now the supplies of meat, vegetables and other varieties  of farm produce in the free markets of Liaoning Province are  sufficient and the prices are reasonable. The province has not  only become self-sufficient in the supply of farm produce, but  also has surpluses. Last year Liaoning supplied 300,000 pigs to  other parts of China.    The three provinces of northeast China cover an area of  787,000 sq [square] km, equal to the total territories of  Britain and France. It used to be China's metallurgical and  machine-building base. About 50 percent of the total population  of nearly 100 million people are urban residents, quite a large  proportion compared with the other regions of China. Meanwhile,  the area has 16.29 million ha [hectares] of farmland.    In recent years the leadership at various levels in  northeast  China has attached great importance to the development of  agriculture. All the three provinces have increased their  investment in agriculture. In the past four years Jilin has  invested a total of 18.4 billion yuan (about 2.1 billion U.S.  dollars) in agriculture, showing a yearly average increase of 11  percent. In one year the province even invested one fourth of  its total revenue in agriculture.    The provinces have also made efforts to promote advanced  farming technology. Heilongjiang has spread high-yield  technology for growing maize, rice, soybean and wheat. Liaoning  has made great efforts to optimize the composition of  fertilizers, interplanting and irrigation. Calculations show  that scientific farming accounts for 40 percent of the factors  leading to increases in grain output.    Attention has also been paid to mechanization of agriculture  and to the development of a diversified economy, including the  development of fisheries, forestry, animal husbandry and rural  industrial enterprises, so as to increase the farmers' income  and arouse their enthusiasm for production.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of  the Communist Party of China, pointed out that the speedy  development of agriculture in northeast China in recent years  has not only made the rural economy develop in an all-round way,  but also greatly supported the economic reform and industrial  development in the urban areas.    Besides, the rapidly growing agriculture in northeast China  has also played an important role in stabilizing the grain  markets throughout the country after the central government  relaxed controls over the grain prices earlier this year. In  the past four years northeast China has supplied over 100  billion kg of marketable grain to other parts of the country.    A senior central government official has praised the three  provinces in northeast China, particularly Liaoning, for their  success in developing agriculture, saying that they have set an  example for the country's industrially developed coastal areas  to develop agriculture too.</p>

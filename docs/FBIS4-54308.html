			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists on  May 25 committed photographing and electronic reconnaissance on  the whole areas of the northern half of Korea by letting a  Japan-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane make  high-altitude flights above Tokjok island, Yangpyong and  Yangyang areas of South Korea, according to military sources.    That day, an overseas-based E-3 early warning plane flew  into  South Korea to command in an allround way flying corps involved  in a war gamble and committed an aerial espionage on the  northern half of Korea, and two RV-1 army tactical  reconnaissance planes also made an aerial espionage on the  frontline and coast line areas of the North side, flying above  the area of the military demarcation line.    These are premeditated military provocations of the U.S.  imperialists to carry their northward invasion scheme into  effect.</p>

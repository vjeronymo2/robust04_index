			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES FIRE NEW PITCH TO DAVIS  </P> <P> The Padres, in hopes that reliever Mark Davis forgets all about this free-agent  business, offered him a new contract proposal Tuesday, one which they believe  will convince him to remain in San Diego.  </P> <P> While awaiting their answer, the Padres went ahead Tuesday and contacted Arn  Tellem, the agent for free-agent pitcher Mark Langston, informing him that they  will pursue the left-handed starter.  </P> <P> "We're very interested in him," said Chicago attorney Fred Lane, who will  conduct the negotiations for the Padres, "and I think they're very interested  in us."  </P> <P> Lane, who along with La Jolla attorney Beth Benes is conducting the Davis  negotiations for the Padres, said however that the Padres' first priority in  the free-agent market continues to be Davis.  </P> <P> Davis, a left-hander who saved a Padre-record 44 games in 1989 and was selected  as The Sporting News' National League pitcher of the year, filed for free  agency Monday night. But before Davis' agent, Alan Hendricks, even had a chance  to test the marketplace, the Padres had a new contract proposal awaiting  Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> "We had already made them a fabulous offer, but we made them even a more  fabulous offer after we learned that they filed for free agency," Lane said.  "We wanted to give Mark something to think about.  </P> <P> "We want Mark to know that we're very sincere, and how much the Padres want  him. He knows that from our words. And now he knows that from our numbers."  </P> <P> Lane refused to reveal the Padres' offer, saying, "I don't want to educate my  competition," but it is believed that it is a three-year guaranteed contract  for at least $7 million with possibly an option for a fourth year.  </P> <P> Davis was unaware of the Padres' new offer Tuesday. Hendricks, his agent, was  undergoing foot surgery, Davis said, but he's expected to speak with him today  and discuss the proposal.  </P> <P> "Coming back to San Diego is still my first choice," Davis said. "Just because  I filed for free agency doesn't mean that I'm not even thinking about San  Diego, that's far from my intention. I just want to protect myself."  </P> <P> Davis would not disclose how much it will take for the Padres to keep him, but  said that he's seeking a four-year contract.  </P> <P> "A contract for more than three years is something I'd definitely like," Davis  said. "I know they're not common, but it's something I think a team and a  player could work out."  </P> <P> Said Lane: "We can probably work out anything, but we don't want to do  something nuts. I'm certain everything will work out. We're going to get him;  we're going to get him.  </P> <P> "This offer is something that'll be so attractive to him that he'll have to  take it now."  </P> <P> And if Davis and Hendricks continue to explore the possibilities of the  free-agent market?  </P> <P> "Well, in that case," Lane said, "I'll just hope he's not interested in the  teams that are interested in him."  </P> <P> While in the marketing mood Tuesday, the Padres officially launched their claim  in the Langston sweepstakes. They are considered to be among Langston's top  three choices, along with the Dodgers and Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> It's unknown just how much it will cost to lure Langston to the Padres, but  it's almost certain that he will become the highest-paid pitcher in baseball,  exceeding $3 million a year. The Padres, and every other team with the  exception of the Montreal Expos, are not allowed to negotiate with Langston or  discuss monetary terms until after Nov. 13.  </P> <P> If the Padres are successful in acquiring Langston, 12-9, 2.39 ERA, they would  enter the 1990 season with perhaps the strongest pitching rotation in the  National League: Bruce Hurst, Ed Whitson, Eric Show, Andy Benes and Langston.  It also would enable them to package one or two pitchers along with a catcher  to obtain a starting center fielder.  </P> <P> The Padres also could be in the market for other free agents, such as  outfielder Hubie Brooks and first baseman Keith Hernandez, but have yet to  decide if they'll pursue any others besides Langston.  </P> <P> "We still have to sit down, get a list together, and discuss just who fits our  needs," said Tony Siegle, Padre vice president, player personnel. "It's quite  obvious we can't sign everybody."  </P> <P> In reality, they'd be ecstatic just to sign a certain pair of left-handers.  </P></p>

At December 31, 1993, Chase had shareholders' equity in excess of $6.4 billion. Thus, Chase is a ``Qualified U.S. Bank'' under the requirements of rule 17f-5, since it is a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States, and it has aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profit substantially in excess of the $500,000 minimum required by the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Chase is a subsidiary of The Chase Manhattan Corporation, a Delaware company that provides financial services throughout the world. Through its Global Securities Services division (``GSS''), Chase provides custody and related services to global institutional investors, including U.S. mutual funds. GSS currently has over $1,300 trillion in assets under custody at various locations throughout the world, including its branches and subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Chase currently operates a representative office in Mexico and has custodian accounts at a Mexican bank and Meixco's central securities depositary. As a result of the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Chase wishes to consolidate its activities in Mexico with the establishment of Chase-Mexico, which it anticipates will be incorporated in Mexico on or around November 1, 1994. Chase-Meixco will be a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Chase engaged in the business of commercial banking in Mexico, and will be supervised by the National Banking Commission under the Banking Law. Chase intends to transfer its current custody operations in Mexico to Chase-Mexico upon receipt of the requested exemptive order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Chase-Mexico will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f-5 insofar as it will be a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of a Qualifying U.S. Bank and will be incorporated and organized under the laws of Mexico. Chase-Mexico will not, however, meet the $100 million minimum shareholders' equity requirement of rule 17f-5. Accordingly, Chase-Mexico will not qualify as an ``Eligible Foreign Custodian'' under the rule and, absent exemptive relief, could not serve as custodian for the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Where custody services are required in Mexico, Chase will hold the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies as custodian or subcustodian and will deposit (or cause or permit the deposit of) the Assets with Chase-Mexico in accordance with the arrangements described in the conditions below. Before permitting Chase-Mexico to act as a custodian for U.S. Investment Company Assets, Chase will assure that Chase-Mexico is capable and well-qualified to provide custody and subcustody services to Chase, U.S. Investment Companies, and custodians for U.S. Investment Companies. Under the proposed foreign custody arrangements, the protection afforded the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies held by Chase-Mexico would not be diminished from the protection afforded by rule 17f-5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

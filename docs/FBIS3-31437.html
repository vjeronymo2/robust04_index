			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign minister of </F> Russia, and Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at a  news conference in Pale on 17 February; both statements are in  English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Churkin] I have today brought to Belgrade and Pale  a letter from President Yeltsin. This letter is addressed to  President Milosevic, Dr. Karadzic, and other Serb leaders, as  well as the Serbian people. It contains Russia's request that,  in the interest of halting the bloodshed, the Serbian side  withdraw its heavy weapons from Sarajevo.    In that context, the Russian Federation would be prepared to  send its troops to the Sarajevo area to participate in the UN  peace operation. I am glad to state that this Russian  initiative, which we believe is in the interests of both the  Muslims and the Serbs and all the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  has been accepted by the Serbian side. We hope that the  acceptance of the Russian initiative will put an end to the  crisis around Sarajevo and we know that this will be a major  step toward the overall settlement of the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Karadzic] I would like to say that we are very grateful to  Russia for its involvement in the crisis. We have accepted the  proposal put forward by Russia regarding the withdrawal of the  heavy weapons. We also think that further Russian participation  in the conference and the peace process will be welcomed and  fruitful.    We are going to do what we will do on the basis of, first of  all, the Russian demands, which for us mean certain guarantees,  and then on the basis of our agreement with Mr. Akashi of 7  February and the Serbian-Muslim agreement of 9 February. We  think that the war in Sarajevo is finally over.</p>

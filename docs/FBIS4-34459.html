			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Josefina Blanco] </F>   [Text] A warm afternoon and a superb view of Mount Avila  greeted Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. A UH-214  Army helicopter took the Portuguese premier and his entourage  from the Maiquetia Airport to the General Francisco de Miranda  Air Base in La Carlota. The group included Foreign Minister  Jose Durao Barroso, Commerce and Tourism Minister Fernando Faria  de Oliveira, and Luis Sousa de Macedo, secretary of state for  Portuguese communities.    Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera received the  distinguished party with words that recalled the long and close  relations between both countries and the beneficial presence of  the large Portuguese community in Venezuela: "....the Portuguese  presence in Venezuela has without doubt proved to be very  positive," the Venezuelan president said. Both leaders met at  the recent Ibero-American Summit held in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, at the beginning of this week.    The Venezuelan reception committee included Foreign Minister  Miguel Angel Burelli, Tourism Minister Herman Luis Soriano, and  Armed Forces Commander Otto Garcia.    Upon his arrival, Cavaco Silva, who is 54 years old, has a  degree in finance, is a professor and member of the Social  Democratic party (PSD), and is visiting this country for the  first time, highlighted the importance of his four-day mission  in Venezuela. He comes, he said, to strengthen the existing  political, cultural, economic, and business relations between  both countries. The head of the Portuguese nation said he was  accompanied by 50 of the most important and significant  businessmen in his country.    Cavaco Silva also said that he visited the country as a  member of the European Union (EU) and that the talks would thus  cover the strengthening of relations between the EU and the  Latin American countries, taking into account the fact that  Venezuela has played an important role in furthering integration  in the region.    Cavaco Silva's presence in Venezuela will seal three  cooperation agreements between both countries. One is a two-way  investment and protection agreement, another will cover the  prevention, control, and surveillance of drug use, and the third  is for technical cooperation in several fields such as  agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and maritime transportation.</p>

Today, the combat operations of our forces were marked not  only by firm and strong defense but by inflicting crushing blows  against the hostile forces on all the battlefronts. Today, our  forces inflicted killing blows against the invading forces in  Abyan, where our fighter planes piloted by the courageous Air  Eagles, defenders of the Democratic Republic of Yemen,  successfully attacked the positions of the hostile forces and  inflicted crushing blows against their supply lines. The rest  of our fighters continued to inflict more human and material  losses on the enemy ranks, estimated at hundreds of dead and  wounded. A large number of military machines and equipment was  destroyed.

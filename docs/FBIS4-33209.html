			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 1 Jun (NA) -- Chubut Governor Carlos  Maestro said today that people in his province are concerned  "over the lack of incentives for the development of productive  activities, specially for small and medium-sized industries."    Maestro emphasized: "The lack of encouragement for regional  economies has caused many companies to collapse."    He went to Government House to meet Presidential Secretary  General Eduardo Bauza and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf. He  said: "Chubut is trying to implement key mechanisms to  revitalize production."    Maestro noted: "This involves fiscal policies like the  removal of taxes. We have removed energy taxes and rural real  estate taxes and are now implementing a dynamic loan policy."    The Chubut governor emphasized that his province "currently  has a $100-million loan portfolio for productive sectors, with  very low interest rates, 10-year repayment periods, and up to  three-year grace periods to begin repaying loans."    The Radical Civic Union governor concluded: "By implementing  all these measures, we are trying to alleviate a very complex  situation in the field of production."</p>

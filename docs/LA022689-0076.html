			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN EX-MARINE RETURNS TO THE BATTLEFIELD AS A HUMANITARIAN  </P> <P> Last year Robert Seiple returned to Vietnam for the first time since his tour  of duty as a U.S. Marine combat pilot ended in 1968. Seiple went back last  April as president of World Vision, a Monrovia-based Christian relief  organization, to arrange for the agency's return to Vietnam, 13 years after it  had been expelled by the government.  </P> <P> During that visit, Seiple said he saw a nation that was poverty-stricken and in  disrepair, largely because of almost unabated strife. He found the communist  government's bureaucracy cumbersome and unable to respond to the needs of its  citizens. Vietnam was, he concluded, "worse off than it was 20 years ago."  </P> <P> "Despair is beginning to set in," he said after the trip. "This is a country  that essentially won the war and is losing the peace."  </P> <P> But earlier this month, Seiple returned from his second visit to Vietnam since  the war, this time with hope for the nation's future. Although conditions for  the Vietnamese people remain dire, he said he saw ambitious reconstruction  projects in the nation's cities and sensed a shift in the attitude of its  leadership.  </P> <P> "The change in the Vietnamese in the last 10 months has been dramatic," he  said. "I think someone passed the word that this global isolationism has got to  end."  </P> <P> Seiple attributed the change in part to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  policy of glasnost with the West and loosening of state control, which has been  reflected in varying degrees in communist governments worldwide.  </P> <P> Vietnamese officials welcomed the involvement of groups such as World Vision,  Seiple said, adding that he senses a growing tolerance of religion by the  government.  </P> <P> "There are still five evangelical pastors in jail, so the the situation is far  from utopian," he said. "(But) to an extent, the spirit of glasnost, a spirit  of hope, is going through the world right now."  </P> <P> Seiple's current mission exemplifies what many view as a more conciliatory  relationship between the United States and Vietnam. During his visit last  month, he made sure that 25 tons of resin to be used in the manufacture of  artificial limbs for Vietnam's 60,000 amputees was delivered to Vietnam.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Combat Victims  </P> <P> Many of the prospective recipients of the prosthetic devices lost limbs in  combat against American and South Vietnamese troops. Others include children  maimed by land mines left in the Vietnamese countryside. Vietnam requested the  aid.  </P> <P> Until recently, such humanitarian efforts by American organizations in Vietnam  were rare. After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, most groups such as World  Vision were expelled from the country. Tense relations between Washington and  Hanoi precluded official U.S. aid and discouraged private assistance.  </P> <P> That changed in August, 1987, when Gen. John W. Vessey led a U.S. delegation to  Hanoi that negotiated an unprecedented agreement.  </P> <P> The Vietnamese government agreed to accelerate its effort to account for the  more than 1,700 servicemen still missing 16 years after the U.S. troops left  the country. Vietnam also agreed to facilitate the emigration of Amerasians,  children fathered by U.S. servicemen, and citizens who had assisted the South  Vietnamese government and have since been incarcerated in "re-education" camps.  </P> <P> In return, the United States pledged to address Vietnam's "urgent humanitarian  concerns," specifically assistance to those left maimed, widowed and orphaned  by the war.  </P> <P> Because the United States does not have normal diplomatic relations with  Vietnam, direct government aid is prohibited by law. Instead, then-President  Reagan encouraged several humanitarian organizations to establish assistance  programs for the Vietnamese.  </P> <P> World Vision, which had provided food and medical care to as many as 20,000  Vietnamese children a year between 1960 and 1975, was one of five organizations  that began developing programs after the Vessey initiative.  </P> <P> "The marriage between (World Vision's) expertise and the Vessey initiative is  quite good," said a U.S. official familiar with private humanitarian aid to  Vietnam who asked not to be identified. "They are going back into Vietnam in a  major way and we encourage them. Anything we can do to help them we'll do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regaining a Foothold  </P> <P> Seiple said the initiative provided an opportunity for World Vision to regain a  foothold in a nation that had been off-limits for 14 years.  </P> <P> "We think we have our foot in the door in a way that it will never be shut  again," Seiple said. He noted that World Vision's purpose in reentering Vietnam  was "to make the body whole. It's a nice metaphor for what we're doing."  </P> <P> If the door to Vietnam is now open for private relief agencies, Larry Ward may  have been the first to knock at it. Ward, who oversaw World Vision's programs  in Vietnam in the 1960s, before becoming president of Food For the Hungry, said  he has made more than 40 trips to Vietnam since 1979, seeking greater access  for humanitarian organizations.  </P> <P> Ward accompanied the first Vessey delegation in 1987 and served as an  unofficial liaison between the Vietnamese government and agencies that wanted  to develop or renew relief programs in the country. Now retired and living in  Phoenix, Ward said he is pleased with the progress made in Vietnam and praised  the Hanoi government for its cooperation.  </P> <P> "I feel personally that the Vietnamese have done a very fine job," Ward said.  "(Government officials) always posture and they always want more, and yet I  found when I got there, they were very grateful for what they received and put  it to good use."  </P> <P> World Vision provided $125,000 worth of aid to Vietnam last year and plans to  spend $400,000 on programs in the nation in 1989, Seiple said. Almost all of  the aid will be in the form of supplies and material -- not cash -- because of  Vietnam's spiraling inflation and wildly fluctuating currency exchange rates.  </P> <P> During his visit last month, Seiple spoke with Vietnamese officials about  building a World Vision hospital in Da Nang at a cost of $80,000. The  organization also plans to provide internships for Vietnamese surgeons to train  at American hospitals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Relocation Assistance  </P> <P> In addition to its medical-relief efforts, World Vision also will seek to  assist in the relocation of Amerasian children who wish to go to the United  States. Amerasians, many of whom are now in their 20s, must wait for years for  permission to leave Vietnam.  </P> <P> While in Ho Chi Minh City last month, Seiple spoke with a 21-year-old woman who  had recently received approval to emigrate. For years, she told him, she had  gone to the airport every day to see if her father had come to take her to the  United States.  </P> <P> Living as virtual outcasts because of their American parentage, many of the  estimated 30,000 Amerasians live on the streets and some have become involved  with drugs and prostitution. Before traveling to America, they will spend six  months in an orientation program in the Philippines, where groups such as World  Vision hope to provide assistance.  </P> <P> "Some of these kids are pretty tough," Seiple said. "They're street kids and  they have gotten by with their wits, and if someone were to come up to them and  express love and compassion, they'd probably be fairly suspicious. . . .  They're the most pathetic victims of a war that produced nothing but victims."  </P> <P> Although the Vietnam programs constitute a minuscule part of World Vision's  $54-million worldwide relief effort, Seiple said the venture is significant as  a means of repairing the damage done to both nations during the war.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nostalgic Feeling  </P> <P> As a former combatant, Seiple said his journeys to Vietnam have been especially  meaningful. "When I go back I feel nostalgia, and I feel a great deal of  sadness."  </P> <P> He experienced one such nostalgic moment last month, when his flight touched  down at the Da Nang civil airport, which had been a U.S. air base, out of which  Seiple flew on more than 300 combat missions.  </P> <P> He visited his old hangar and swapped war stories with the airport's director,  Ho Vam Quy, who had flown Soviet MIG-17s in combat against the U.S. Air Force.  </P> <P> "We talked about how we both had sons who we hoped would never have to fight,"  Seiple said. "I've found (veterans) tend to have stronger peace-loving  tendencies than those who have never had to fight."  </P> <P> During the past decade, the American public has expressed increasing  appreciation for Vietnam veterans, many of whom have complained of being  slighted for having fought in a losing cause. Seiple said he hopes humanitarian  aid to Vietnam will help close the schism that divided America during the war.  </P> <P> "It seems obvious, even to a non-psychologist like myself, that there's a deep  psychological wound from Vietnam that has not been healed in this country," he  said. "If we take some of that pain and put it into a healthy resolve for  reconciliation, I think some of that pain will disappear.  </P> <P> "This country has been very generous when it's won wars. I think it will be  generous again, even when it came in second."  </P> <P> But Seiple said his concern for helping to repair the damage done to Vietnam  during the war is in no way an effort to assuage his own conscience.  </P> <P> "Some people are driven by guilt," he said. "I'm not. I've not felt guilty one  day for going over there. I went out of a sense of duty and obligation to my  country. I've gone back out of a sense of duty and obligation to my God."  </P></p>

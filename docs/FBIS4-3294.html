			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe said today he has dropped his attempt to leave  the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the race  for the premiership.    Watanabe, 70, also a former deputy prime minister, conveyed  his latest decision at a third meeting with LDP President Yohei  Kono, who has himself vowed to run for the supreme government  post to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa.    Hosokawa announced his resignation last Friday after eight  months in office.    The LDP veteran's decision came after the ruling coalition  parties came closer to agreeing on a policy platform and naming  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as its single candidate for the  premiership.    Hata, 58, concurrently serves as leader of Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party), the ruling coalition's core party.    Watanabe's change of heart over the defection paved the way  for the LDP to field Kono as its official candidate to run in an  upcoming parliamentary election of prime minister.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Superfluous 301"] </F>   [Text] There are many reasons behind the U.S. decision to  give India a two-month reprieve from the U.S. "Special" 301  trade sword. One reason, perhaps, is the proposed Washington  visit by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. The subject of the  Washington talks is going to be the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty]; the imposition of Special 301 on the  eve of these talks would have been an unnecessary diplomatic  irritant. In addition, India and the United States hold  divergent views on a number of issues. Questions about  political-strategic issues are more serious than trade  questions. All of this is going to be discussed by Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao and President Clinton. Therefore, it is  impossible to understand why the U.S. Commerce Department  brandished the Special 301 sword. Agreed, the previous  two-month reprieve has just ended. Meanwhile, the official GATT  accord has been confirmed, and India has signed it. The GATT  preamble answers all the questions the U.S. Congress cited in  proposing the Special 301 act. India's acceptance of the GATT's  Dunkel draft should satisfy the U.S. Administration, and it  should be thinking about ending Special 301. To the contrary,  however, the United States has threatened to bring India under  the purview of Special 301.    It seems that India must face Special 301 again because of  China. China is going to become a GATT member; it has already  applied. China had made an issue of the delay in approving its  application. Until China joins the GATT agreement, the U.S. will  continue to threaten it over U.S. patent and copyright issues.  China and India are in the same category on the U.S. list.  Therefore, India is being warned time and again because of  China. Perhaps it is because of China that the U.S. Congress is  not thinking about revoking Special 301, despite the GATT  signing. China, India, and Argentina are the countries  currently being threatened with Special 301. India and Argentina  have already signed the GATT agreement. As a result, they must  make changes in their patent and copyright laws in accordance  with this agreement. GATT has allocated enough time for this.  The United States is applying psychological pressure on them to  enact new laws quickly by giving two months' warning. If India  ignores this, nothing is going to happen. India should not care  about Special 301 anymore. After all, why should the United  States be accepted as a godfather in place of the new  multilateral trade organization? All patent and copyright  issues are now the concern of the new trade organization. How  can the United States become a godfather in bilateral trade when  a multilateral trade system is being launched? Perhaps the U.S.  Administration refrained from applying Special 301 because it  has a proper understanding of this perspective, and the Indian  Government did not waste any time reacting to it.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Teachers to continue boycott of school tests THE UK's two largest teachers' unions yesterday said their members would continue boycotting national curriculum tests in September. This intensifies pressure for drastic changes to the tests. A review of the curriculum being conducted by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, is expected to produce preliminary conclusions at the end of the month. Boycotts by all three main teachers' unions this year meant that scarcely any pupils took the tests. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, made clear that his union would stop the boycott if the review reduced their workload significantly. 'The boycott will be rescinded if the promised reduction in workload is delivered on the ground. The government could solve this problem by either slimming down the national curriculum immediately or by limiting the number of hours teachers could be called to work. These hours are currently unlimited.' Mr de Gruchy indicated possible disagreement between the unions by adding that the boycott would end even if Sir Ron recommended introducing simple externally marked 'paper and pencil tests', although the union opposed them on educational grounds. He said that this would not provide legal backing for industrial action, although it would take other measures, such as asking parents to withdraw their children from the tests. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said his union was taking action over objections to the tests' educational content as well as workload. 'The boycott remains in place as long as the assessment and testing arrangements remain,' he said.</p>

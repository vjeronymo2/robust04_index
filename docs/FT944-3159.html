			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Hungary hunts for bank chief Hungary's Socialist-led government was last night preparing to appoint a temporary central bank governor after failing to find a replacement for Mr Peter Akos Bod, who announced three weeks ago he would step down today. Mr Bod, a political appointee of the former conservative administration, was forced out half-way through his six-year term. Government officials said Mr Gyorgy Szapary, one of five deputy governors, would take over in a temporary capacity.</p>

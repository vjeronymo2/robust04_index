			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shim'on Schiffer and Dani Shaqed] </F>   [Excerpt] The Saudi authorities have clarified to Yasir  'Arafat in no uncertain terms that the Muslim holy sites in  Jerusalem are not the PLO's property but that of the entire Arab  nation, with Saudi Arabia as its center.    This is the reason 'Arafat is delaying his arrival in  Jericho, as prior to the Saudis' issuing their warning, 'Arafat  had stated on several occasions that after visiting Jericho, he  would undertake a prayer pilgrimage to the Muslim holy sites on  the Temple Mount.    This declaration alarmed the Saudi authorities, who feared  that 'Arafat would try to create "facts on the ground," and  consequently they decided to put him in his place. [passage  omitted]</p>

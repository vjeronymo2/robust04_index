			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / People: Seelig and Hawley resurface at Hay Almost a year to the day since the Guinness trial in which he stood accused of fraud and false accounting collapsed because of his impaired mental health, former corporate finance star Roger Seelig (right) has picked up his first new directorship of a public company - a small, struggling, engineering concern called Norman Hay. Peter Hay, 42, who becomes chairman, stepping into the shoes of his brother Anthony, 56, says he has known Seelig socially for the past three or four years. 'Call me you foolish if you like,' he says, 'but I believe it is quite a coup for a small company like ours. He was a guy of enormous talent and I have nothing but respect for his brilliant mind.' At the same time, Hay is bringing in as chief executive 47-year-old Mel Hawley, who stepped down as chief executive of Haden MacLellan Holdings, an engineering company with a market capitalisation eight times as big, at the beginning of this month after only a year in the position. Hay thinks that while HMH has suffered severely during the recession, Hawley had previously proved he was 'somebody used to making companies grow'. Anthony Hay is stepping down because of ill health but will remain on the board in a non-executive capacity. Hay expects a pre-tax loss of at least Pounds 2.2m for 1992, partly as the result of delays and unexpectedly high costs incurred in relocating from Heathrow to Coventry. With his involvement in the development of near-by Stockley Park, Seelig's first task will be to find ways of generating income from the 7 1/2 acre site by the tunnel entrance to Heathrow that Norman Hay is now left with. 'As the business stabilises and we are ready to acquire, Roger the grand tactician will then come to the fore. I hope he can prove himself again at Norman Hay,' says the new chairman. The 47-year-old former Morgan Grenfell corporate financier acknowledges this is 'a tiny step' in his rehabiltation, but claims other appointments are to follow. 'One of the gratifying things about the past six years has been how senior people - chairmen and chief executives - have stayed in contact throughout. To suggest I have become a hillbilly - even if I farm part-time  -is not right,' Seelig said from home yesterday.</p>

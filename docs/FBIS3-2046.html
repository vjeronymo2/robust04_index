			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- China's ambitious plan  to wipe out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and  clothing shortages for its now-remaining 80 million  poverty-stricken citizens, will certainly be realized as long as  arduous efforts are made, Chinese president Jiang Zemin said  here today.    Speaking at a national conference on poverty elimination,  which was attended by Premier Li Peng and other senior Chinese  leaders, Jiang said that the most important experience which  China has gained from its progress in past poverty reduction is  the shift of the poverty alleviation policy from merely material  aid to comprehensive social and economic development strategy in  poor areas.    Practice shows that a poverty reduction strategy which is  market- oriented, relies on advancement of science and  technology and exploitation of local resources, will not only  provide enough food and clothes for the poverty-stricken people,  but also a way to prosperity, said Jiang Zemin, who is also  general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist  Party of China (CPC).    He described the shift as fundamental and said it should be  continued in a long period of time to come.    Elimination of poverty and common prosperity is the basic  requirement of socialism and reflection of the advantages of a  socialist system over others, he noted.    He pointed out that capable cadres should be selected and  all  walks of life should be mobilized to help poor areas.    The party leader also stressed the need for local people's  self- reliance and arduous efforts in the nationwide poverty  reduction drive.    Premier Li Peng said that it was an unshirkable historical  responsibility of communists of his generation and people's  governments of all levels to eliminate abject poverty by the  year 2000, solving food and clothes shortages for the 80 million  poor.    The plan is a strategic measure to gradually narrow the gaps  between China's developed east and the developing west, he said.    The premier said that coastal areas and large and  medium-sized cities, which have become relatively rich, should  be encouraged to help the poor areas.    The central government should give adequate financial  support  to the poor areas, said Li.    He added that priority should be given to the poor areas  when  selecting a location for important investment projects.    The premier also spoke of the need to rationalize the  pricing  of raw materials and primary products, which will benefit the  poor areas that are rich in resources.    Earlier, State Councillor Chen Junsheng announced on Monday  at the meeting that the ambitious seven-year poverty reduction  plan includes raising the annual net income of the majority of  the 80 million people.    According to the plan, China will begin from this year to  improve infrastructure construction in poor areas, solving  drinking water shortages for the people and their domestic  animals, making electricity available to most poor towns and  connecting remote areas with national or regional road networks.    As part of the plan, China will improve the cultural,  educational and public health levels in backward and poor areas,  wipe out illiteracy among the young and middle-aged population,  offer professional training to grown-ups and hold the natural  population growth rate under the official limit.    "The realization of the plan will be of great significance.  It will mean that the rights to subsistence of the Chinese  people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population,  will have been secured," said the state councillor, who is in  charge of agriculture as well as China's poverty reduction  efforts.    Most of the 80 million people are in remote mountain  regions,  rocky regions, loess plateau areas and remote deserts.    During the 1986-1992 period, poverty was eased among about  45  million poor people, an average of 6.8 million each year.    He disclosed that China will increase its investment in poor  areas and has designated 582 counties as priority targets for  poverty elimination.    China's poor had decreased from 125 million in 1986 to 80  million in 1992.</p>

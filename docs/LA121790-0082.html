			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> TB RATES CLIMB TO RECORD IN '90  </P> <P> Tuberculosis rates apparently made a record climb in 1990, with the largest  nationwide increase since national reporting on the disease began, the American  Lung Assn. said last week.  </P> <P> "We're seeing large increases in TB in many cities and states," said ALA  President Dr. John Allen.  </P> <P> The infectious lung disease, long associated with 19th-Century poverty and  considered nearly vanquished in recent decades, has been on the rise since  1985, and preliminary reports show its greatest increase in 1990.  </P> <P> TB incidence through November, 1990, increased by 8% and appeared headed for a  10% increase for the year by the end of December, the ALA said, citing new  figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control. The CDC said that 20,792  cases had been reported for 1990 by Nov. 24, compared to 19,205 by the same  time in 1989.  </P> <P> Experts blame much of the rise on the immune depressing effects of the human  immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which is linked to AIDS. TB increases were  especially marked among blacks and Latinos, young adults and children under age  5, Allen said.  </P></p>

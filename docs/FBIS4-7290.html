			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, 27 Apr -- South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam granted an interview to Shinichi Hakoshima, managing  editor of ASAHI SHIMBUN's Tokyo head office, on 27 April. In  the interview, President Kim indicated his government's position  on the North Korean nuclear issue, and how it analyzes and sees  the issue. However, he did not indicate concrete prospects for a  South-North dialogue. Even on possible talks with North Korean  President Kim Il-song meanwhile, President Kim Yong-sam said:  "We are not going to approach the North from our side," thus  backpedaling from his position in February when he viewed the  second year of his government. It seems the interview reflects  South Korea's difficult position and disappointment over its  loss of a diplomatic channel for possible dialogue with North  Korea, following its decision to abandon an exchange of special  envoys for the time being -- which South Korea says is a  precondition for a third round of talks between high-ranking  U.S. and North Korean officials.    Concerning the possible South-North dialogue, President Kim  merely said: "If talks between the United States and North  Korea are held, the situation will then enter a stage of mutual  nuclear inspections in both South and North Korea. In this  sense, North (Korea) will have to show its sincere position on  resuming the South-North dialogue." In his written answers to  ASAHI questions, he took care not to directly commit himself in  answering the issue of South-North dialogue.    Moreover, President Kim said: "North Korea's economic  situation, including food supplies, will become increasingly  serious as time goes by. This is the reason for North Korea's  desire to improve its relations with the United States. Time is  on our side." In this way, he indicated his view that North  Korea will eventually compromise although he did not refer to  the timing of North Korea's concession.    In the middle of April, following the South Korean  government's decision to no longer exchange envoys with North  Korea, the United States and South Korea discussed the issue of  South-North dialogue. They agreed to set the resumption and  "meaningful progress" in negotiations as preconditions for the  third round of high-level talks between the United States and  North Korea; along with North Korea's acceptance of full  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    As a new form of dialogue, the holding of South-North prime  ministerial talks and resumption of the nuclear control joint  committee based on a joint denuclearization statement (announced  in December 1992) are being considered. However, prospects for  North Korea's acceptance of such proposals are dim. It seems  that South Korean President Kim's lack of concrete proposals for  resuming South-North dialogue reflect gloomy prospects.    On possible summit talks with North Korean President Kim  Il-song, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam said: "The  previous government took positive action in working on North  Korea to hold the summit talks. But I think the summit talks  will naturally materialize, and in this sense, my government has  not taken positive action."    At a news conference last February when he saw the first  anniversary of the inauguration of his government, President Kim  said: "I want to promote efforts to seek summit talks with  North Korean President Kim if the talks help solve the nuclear  issue." This remark drew the attention of the international  community because he had previously said: "We do not want to  hold a summit meeting for talks." However, in the ASAHI  interview, he backpedaled from his position of last February,  and now can be seen as reflecting South Korea's difficulties in  prospects for a South-North dialogue.    In a written letter to ASAHI SHIMBUN, he said: "We are  making efforts to create a favorable atmosphere for U.S.-DPRK  working-level talks in the hope of bringing about an early  solution to the nuclear question. We hope the working-level  talks to be held soon will bear substantive results."    Judging from his above remarks, it can be said that South  Korea's decision to abandon the envoy exchange is in order to  promote a dialogue between the United States and North Korea;  and that, underlying such a decision is its aim to show both  domestic and foreign nations, including North Korea, its stand  of being deeply involved in U.S. policymaking even after the  abandonment of envoy exchanges.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Slimdown pays off with Pounds 11m at Brent Chemicals BRENT Chemicals International, the speciality chemicals group, more than doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.5m in 1992. Sales rose from Pounds 100m to Pounds 119.8m. The company said the profits figure was 37 per cent up on the previous year, after allowing for heavy rationalisation and redundancy costs incurred in 1991. Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said that while the results benefited from the inclusion of recent acquisitions and a Pounds 15.6m rights issue in 1991, they were firmly supported by organic growth of 5 per cent in sales and 12 per cent in profits. Brent's packaging and graphic arts group, focused mainly on food packaging, lifted sales by 9 per cent and profits by 20 per cent organically. The division's actual trading profits rose from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 4.91m. Trading profits from the industrial, aerospace and electronics sector rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 7.5m. This division was affected by recession in the European Community, but a strong performance in North America and south-east Asia increased profits by 6 per cent organically. Lord Lane said: 'During 1992 we improved our gross margins due to manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings, and we continued to exercise strict overhead controls. The reduction in staff levels and the streamlining of our management structure initiated in 1991 have proved their worth.' Brent said it continued to develop Hebro Chemie, the German metal finishing business it acquired at the end of 1991. Sales expanded by 8 per cent, but profits remained static. Earnings jumped to 10p (2.9p). A maintained final dividend of 5.8p gives a total of 7.4p (7.34p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ugur Sefkat report: "A `War Briefing' by the General </F> Staff"]    [Excerpts] Ankara--The tension Greece has created by its  wish to further fortify the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea in  contravention of international agreements has set Turkey into  action. The General Staff arranged a `war briefing' for  President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on  Turkey's new concept of threats yesterday. It has been  ascertained that President Demirel asked for the surprise  briefing, which was held in the General Staff Headquarters.  [passage omitted]    It was stressed at the briefing that the possibility of a  threat from Greece has strengthened, particularly after Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou came to power in that country, and  that the question of rearming the islands in the Aegean Sea has  confirmed that state of affairs. It was also stressed that  two-thirds of the Turkish Armed Forces' fighting personnel have  been assigned to combat the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] in  southeastern Turkey, and that this state of affairs has created  a significant vacuum in the defense of the Aegean and Thrace  regions. The officials at the briefing explained that shortages  were mostly observed in the ground forces but not in the Air  Force units and the Navy. They also explained that the struggle  against the PKK has used up some military stocks, and that most  of the resources of the Ground Forces Command have been  transferred to the General Command of the Gendarmerie Forces to  be used in the struggle against the PKK. That, they said, has  created several logistical problems.</p>

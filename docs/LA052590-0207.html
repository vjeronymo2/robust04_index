			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> ILESIC GETS HIS FOOT IN THE DOOR IN COMPETITION FOR PUNTING JOB  </P> <P> After 13 seasons in the Canadian Football League, punter Hank Ilesic became a  30-year-old NFL rookie with San Diego last season. As a result, he says it was  "my worst year ever in professional football."  </P> <P> He averaged 40.1 yards on 76 punts, numbers that looked pretty good to the  Rams, who had watched the alarmingly inconsistent Dale Hatcher stagger to his  worst season in five years with the team.  </P> <P> The Rams left Hatcher unprotected and he ended up in Green Bay. San Diego left  Ilesic unprotected and he's now a Ram. So a couple of Plan Bs ended up with a  chance to be somebody's Plan A again.  </P> <P> Ilesic will be competing with rookie Kent Elmore, a seventh-round pick who  averaged 40.2 yards at Tennessee, for the Rams' job.  </P> <P> "I'm happy with the way both of them are kicking right now," Coach John  Robinson said Thursday, the last day of mini-camp at Rams Park. "Hank's a good  punter. He was under a lot of pressure (in San Diego). Things were falling  apart in that area."  </P> <P> Ilesic certainly got a club-on-the-head introduction to the NFL.  </P> <P> After playing two exhibition games and 10 regular-season games with the Toronto  Argonauts last year, he got out of his contract and arrived in San Diego in  time to have Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer question the legality of  his punting shoe. Ilesic had to cut off a flap that covered the laces. Still,  he managed to average 44.8 yards on five punts in his NFL debut.  </P> <P> But the situation -- not to mention the protection -- quickly began to  deteriorate.  </P> <P> Ilesic signed to play professional football as a 17-year-old senior at St.  Joseph's High School in Edmonton. He has six CFL championship Grey Cup rings  locked in a safe deposit box at home in Toronto and two other times his team  lost in the championship game.  </P> <P> He had grown accustomed to winning. Then the Chargers finished 6-10 last  season, in last place in the AFC West.  </P> <P> Ilesic hasn't been around Rams Park long, but he already is feeling more at  home then he did in San Diego.  </P> <P> "The first thing you really notice is that the atmosphere in the locker room is  very different on a winning team," he said. "It's much looser. You establish  closer relationships with your teammates. You have fun. You enjoy being out  here.  </P> <P> "I guess that's because it's a relatively more stable environment compared to a  losing team, where you don't know what's going to happen today or tomorrow.  You're always looking over your shoulder and wondering, 'Is it my fault we're  losing?' There are fingers being pointed and that adds a lot of pressure."  </P> <P> Ilesic, who averaged a career-high 48.5 yards per punt with Toronto in 1986,  never had an average below 42.5 until last season. He said he succumbed to  pressures, real and imagined.  </P> <P> "Last year was definitely a learning experience," he said. "I had to learn the  NFL game overnight. I had to learn the game on the field. I suppose that's the  fastest way to learn, but it's certainly not the easiest.  </P> <P> "This year, I'm more settled down. And the blocking patterns are much different  here than in San Diego. I never had one blocked last year, but I got a lot of  pressure. My timing and rhythm were off and when you speed things up, mistakes  are going to happen. Then you start thinking too much and begin to lose  confidence."  </P> <P> That was never a problem when he was known as "the Ray Guy of Canada," or even  when Toronto fans started calling him "Hank the Shank" during his attempts to  wrangle out of his contract with the Argonauts.  </P> <P> After booming off a number of towering punts Thursday, Ilesic said he felt good  about his chances of playing for the Rams.  </P> <P> "Competition brings the best out in me," he said. "I think it's necessary. It's  human nature to become complacent if you know the job is yours."  </P> <P> If Hank Ilesic has learned anything about punting over the past 13 years, it's  that nothing in this business is certain. It's a fickle game.  </P> <P> "You can be a hero one moment and a goat the very next," he said.  </P> <P> And if you don't believe him, just ask Dale Hatcher.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson said he doesn't like to make evaluations based on  performances in a four-day mini-camp, but he did say that he felt the key to  the Rams' success this season would be the development of a number of young  players. "I think we're going to be improved in a lot of areas on this team,"  he said. "We have a lot of first- and second-year men that now have to assert  themselves and become real players." . . . Speaking of rookies, Robinson was  impressed with what he saw of center Bern Brostek, the Rams' No. 1 draft  choice. "It usually takes offensive linemen a couple of years, but I think he  will be able to help us this year," he said. "We've brought him into a  situation where we are very strong (center Doug Smith has been to six  consecutive Pro Bowls), but I think he can play guard for us too." . . .  Robinson said he thought third-year running back Gaston Green, who has carried  just 61 times for 190 yards in his career, is ready to make an impact. "He just  seems more mature, both physically and mentally," Robinson said. "I think he'll  be ready this year. It's just an intuitive thing."  </P></p>

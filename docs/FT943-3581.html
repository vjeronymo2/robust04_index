			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Dominion Mining reduces loss for year Dominion Mining, the Perth-based miner which earlier this year saw off a bid from Gold Mines of Australia, yesterday reported a ADollars 52.7m (USDollars 39.2m) loss after abnormals in the year to end-June, compared with a deficit of ADollars 127.1m in the previous year, writes Nikki Tait. There was a small operating profit before abnormals and tax of ADollars 4.29m, down from ADollars 15.1m previously. Dominion was loss-making in the second half, which the company said was due to 'insufficient operating margins' at the Cosmo Howley and Bannockburn gold mines, and high amortisation charges here, reflecting short mine lives. The bottom-line loss for the year also reflects a ADollars 56.9m abnormal charge, which includes a ADollars 29.3m write-down of gold operations and a ADollars 17.8m write-off of capitalisation exploration expenditure. GIO Australia, which was privatised by the New South Wales government and is one of Australia's largest general insurers, reported after-tax profits of ADollars 126.1m for the year to end-June, up by 22.3 per cent, writes Nikki Tait. The result, however, was aided by a reduced tax charge, and operating profit before tax rose more modestly from ADollars 157.1m to ADollars 163.2m. Berjaya, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, intends to sell its 20.5 per cent stake in Star Publications, publishers of The Star, one of Malaysia's leading English-language daily newspapers, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. Star Publications also has a wide range of magazines. Berjaya said that its stake in Star Publications would be sold for a total of MDollars 60m (USDollars 23.4m). Mr Vincent Tan, head of the Berjaya group, has recently launched The Sun, an English-language daily, in Malaysia.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Books: Thrills from the courtroom - Scott Turow and a new genre of thriller PLEADING GUILTY by Scott Turow Viking Pounds 15.99, 386 pages IN BRITAIN we have dear old Rumpole and John Mortimer's convivial, best-selling, TV-mounted intrigues at the Old Bailey. From America we have a very different kettle of fish - the eruption of a new genre of lawyer-procedural thrillers. There have of course been innumerable police-procedurals and private eye-procedurals and spy-procedurals: the thriller seems to need a bedrock of expert and ostensibly realistic detail on which to build its fantasies. But the latest fashion has swept aside all rivals. The best-seller lists on both sides of the Atlantic have recently been dominated by John Grisham and his master, Scott Turow. Both Grisham and Turow are, or were, practising American lawyers. They write about what they know about, and they are not particularly interested in writing, that is to say in the precise alignment of words so as to achieve a higher end than a memorandum. But they are both convinced that their subject and their expertise - the procedures of the American courtroom and the investigations that precede those court hearings - are dramatically compelling. If their sales figures are anything to judge by, they are right. No doubt they benefit from the American awareness of the drama of the law, established on the small screen from Perry Mason to LA Law. That is not a British tradition, where cameras are denied entry to the courtroom. Scott Turow showed the way with his 1987 novel Presumed Innocent. This brilliantly-achieved thriller takes off from the extreme detail of the daily workload of a deputy prosecuting attorney in a Midwest city who is investigating the murder of a female colleague; suddenly, the hunter becomes the hunted and finds himself charged with that same murder, a classic reversal which produces a truly suspenseful denouement and an ingenious final twist. Turow followed this three years later with The Burden of Proof (also available in Penguin paperback) in which he extended the legal thriller into the murkier areas of the financial world. The plot revolved around jiggery-pokery in the Futures markets: although not an entirely successful book, it became an impassioned assault on the nonsenses of this particular world and was a warning that Turow had messages to put across. Another lawyer, John Grisham, had meanwhile entered the field. He now has four books to his name; the best-known is The Firm, currently doing the rounds as a successful film. Grisham is to Turow like a mere Follett to Le Carre: Turow can write well when he wishes, Grisham never tries, though both are good at dialogue (it is startling to observe how rarely Grisham attempts a descriptive passage). The Firm has an ambitious young lawyer joining a small Memphis law firm which he discovers to be working for the Mob: his dilemma is one of conscience. With The Pelican Brief Grisham discovered, like Turow, that law naturally interlinks with big business, and in this case with investigative journalism, Watergate-style. Again, the apparently realistic detail is all-important, the novelist's traditional skills are discounted. But it cannot be denied that both these novelists have a superb narrative gift in the old-fashioned sense that you simply have to keep turning the page. Hence their well-deserved success. Turow's latest, Pleading Guilty, is a good example of his qualities and also of his superiority over Grisham. It is an over-long and complicated story about a middle-aged lawyer's investigation into the corruption that he discovers inside his own respectable firm. A partner is on the run; Dollars 5m has been siphoned off to a Yucatan tax shelter; the firm is nervous because it has secretly made a Dollars 20m profit out of a big air-crash case; a bookie has been murdered, ball-games have been fixed, the missing partner turns out to be gay; there is a trio of smooth senior partners, a tough girlfriend, a tougher black woman in the Accounts Department, a dangerous cop called Pigeyes, a vivid portrait of the ethnic mix of the American Midwest. The higher achievement of Pleading Guilty lies in its portrait of the protagonist, Mack Malloy (the device of framing the narrative as his dictation is a mistake, but no matter). Here is a memorably credible burnt-out case of an ex-policeman, a fading lawyer pushing 50, an alcoholic still prone to fall off the wagon, a failed husband, a despairing father of a useless teenager ('Children are savages - egocentric little brutes who by the age of three master every form of misconduct, including violence, fraud, and bribery, in order to get what they want. The one who lived in my house never improved'.) Malloy is assigned to track down the missing money and his missing colleague. He is a mess of a man who is trying to behave honourably while discovering that he is operating in an utterly immoral environment: what is he to do? Turow, unlike Grisham, is interested in the big issues: 'What kind of ethical social system takes as its fundamental precepts the words 'I', 'me' and 'mine'?' The drama at the end is not whether Mack Malloy will find the money but what he will do with it. Like Grisham, Turow shows us a world of ferocious greed in which the lawyers (surely unlike our own Rumpole]) are obsessed with their take. And Turow has a nightmare of a brave new world run by the multinationals: 'Your corporate types are soon going to be a stateless superclass, people who live for deals and golf dates and care a lot more about where you got your MBA than the country you were raised in. It's the Middle Ages all over again, these little unaffiliated duchies and fiefdoms, flying their own flags and ready to take on any vassal who will pledge his life to the manor . . . ' Turow is an ambitious writer and deserves to be read. Grisham is a good read. They are a phenomenon.</p>

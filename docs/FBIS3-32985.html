			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Brasilia--Ambassador Rubens Ricupero, minister of  the environment and the Legal Amazon, will ask Senate President  Humberto Lucena (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party--Paraiba State] to act on an urgent basis to examine the  biodiversity and climate change conventions that were approved  by the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday. The minister has already  begun contacts with Pedro Simon (PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul), the  administration's leader in the Senate, hoping to speed up the  process of ratifying the two agreements.    The government thinks these can be approved by the end of  February, if Senate leaders concur. Advisers to Ricupero and  Senator Pedro Simon are considering whether they might send the  biodiversity and climate change conventions to the full Senate  for passage without first submitting them to review by  committees.    In defending the idea of rapid handling of the international  treaties, government experts argue that both agreements were  exhaustively discussed in the Chamber of Deputies. Advisers from  the Ministry of the Environment note that the conventions cannot  be amended as if they were legislative proposals. An alternative  way of handling them would be to send the texts to the Senate  Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Defense. The members  of this committee would have 25 days in which to examine the  agreements before sending them directly to the floor for a vote.    "Here in the Senate there is no reason why those accords  could not be handled speedily," commented Senator Jose Richa,  (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party--Parana State], a  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. "As far as I know,  there is no resistance among the senators to take up the  matter," Richa added. If it is confirmed that the accords will  pass through the committee, it will be up to its chairman,  Senator Alfredo Campos (PMDB, Minas Gerais), to appoint a  rapporteur on the subject. "The chairman has asked that the  examination of international accords be handled expeditiously,  and these two will certainly get the same treatment," said an  adviser to Alfredo Campos.    As soon as the Senate approves the accords, the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs will send the UN secretary general a communique  reporting that the conventions have been ratified by Brazil.  From then on, the Brazilian Government will be able to enjoy the  international financial mechanisms created by the convention.  The Ministry of the Environment has been negotiating for the  release of $30 million from the World Bank's Global Environment  Fund in order to implement the National Biodiversity Program.    Also in the second half of this year, the countries that  ratified the Biodiversity convention--now there are 36 of  them--will meet to discuss additional mechanisms for the accord.  On the agenda will be new rules for technology transfers and  financing of environmental protection and conservation projects.</p>

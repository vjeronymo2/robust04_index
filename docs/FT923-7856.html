			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Observer: Shipshape How times change. The last time that Merseyside was filled with sailing ships Derek Hatton and his unpatriotic Militant chums controlled the quayside. At the official dinner for the crews, Hatton forbade proposal of the loyal toast. However, a furious local Labour politician got the chairman of Merseyside county council to ignore Hatton's orders and lead the drinking of Her Majesty's health. Eight years on and the same loyal politician, Harry Rimmer, is leader of the Liverpool council, and will be on duty this weekend when Spain's King Juan Carlos presents prizes to the crews of the 76 ships celebrating Columbus's voyage to the New World 500 years ago. Earlier this week Rimmer persuaded tenants of 67 council tower blocks to join a government-sponsored housing action trust. If Rimmer keeps on like this, he should be in line for the customary knighthood.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five comments expressed qualified support for the proposal with a preference for more restrictive regulation of the size/type of large trucks that are not carrying hazardous materials. It was specifically suggested that tandem and triple trailer rigs be prohibited. NPS notes that triple trailer rigs do not currently travel U.S. Highway 191 since they are already restricted under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;61&hyph;10&hyph;124. A variety of alternative restrictions were considered and rejected in the environmental assessments, but restricting tandem trailer rigs was not one of them. The primary environmental and safety concerns identified in the two environmental assessments relate to the transport of hazardous materials. NPS has no traffic accident data to suggest that tandem trailer rigs are involved in or contribute to any more safety or environmental problems in the park than other types of commercial trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of these comments also expressed concern that highly toxic materials such as biological or nuclear weapons may be transported without placarding for national security reasons. It was suggested that the language of the rule make clear that such materials may not be transported through the park. NPS is not aware of any unmarked biological warfare or nuclear materials being transported through the park. For the sake of consistency with standards currently followed by the transportation industry, the NPS rule purposefully relies upon the U.S. Department of Transportation for definitions and regulations related to the identification and placarding or marking of hazardous materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of these comments also suggested that wording be added so that operators transporting hazardous materials are held responsible for restoration, repair, or restitution for any and all environmental, property, or personal damage resulting from a hazardous material spill. NPS believes that this responsibility is already established under 42 U.S.C. 9607, 33 CFR 153.405, and 40 CFR 263.30&hyph;31, which are applicable to park roads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a standard condition of all special use permits issued by the National Park Service (Form 10&hyph;114) is that ``the permittee shall pay the United States for any damage resulting from use of the permit which [sic] would not reasonably be inherent in the use which [sic] is being permitted''. NPS believes that hazardous materials spills are not ``reasonably inherent'' in the transport, when permitted, of hazardous materials through the park.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two trucking organizations and the Montana Department of Transportation expressed support for the proposed rule with recommendations for a clarification of permitting procedures and/or concern about the potential for permits to be required for non-hazardous materials commercial vehicles on U.S. Highway 191. These concerns are discussed further in the Section-by-Section Analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment expressed support with a recommendation that a restriction be imposed to require trucks to maintain a 500 foot distance from other trucks. For the most part, national park areas assimilate traffic codes from the state where the park is located. In the case of U.S. Highway 191, portions of the road are within Montana and portions are within Wyoming. Both state motor vehicle codes have existing sections related to ``following too closely'' (Mont. Code Ann. &sect;61&hyph;8&hyph;329 and Wyo. Stat. &sect;31&hyph;5&hyph;210). Neither State stipulates that trucks maintain a minimum separation of 500 feet. The NPS believes that the applicable State regulations are adequate and that imposing a 500 foot distance standard in the park is not justified by available traffic accident information and would be confusing to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 8 responses opposed to the proposed regulations, 6 expressed that authorizing commercial vehicle use of U.S. Highway 191 was inappropriate, undesirable, or inconsistent with the intent of existing regulations. The original purpose and historical commercial use of the road predates the general regulations prohibiting commercial vehicles in national parks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

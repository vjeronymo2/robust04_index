			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Danish Elections: Rasmussen senses backing for welfare Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister, yesterday promised to bolster the country's extensive welfare system if he is returned to office, as expected, in today's general election. He told a final campaign press conference he had sensed a change of attitude among Danes in favour of welfare spending after a decade of restraints by centre-right governments between 1982 and early last year. 'I am convinced that after the election we shall find there is wide support for spending more money on the care of the elderly, home help services and the hospitals,' he said. The welfare state has been a central issue, as it was in the Swedish election won on Sunday by the Swedish Social Democratic party. Although government spending in Denmark is equal to 64 per cent of GDP - second only to Sweden among industrialised countries - Denmark has not incurred the big budget deficits amassed by its northern neighbour, allowing Mr Rasmussen to avoid the cuts Sweden is now facing. His chances of a second term were strengthened yesterday when the three small centre parties in his coalition government reacted coolly to calls from the Conservative and Liberal parties to join them in a new centre-right coalition. 'If there is a non-socialist majority, there ought to be a non-socialist government,' said Mr Uffe Elleman-Jensen, the Liberal leader and opposition candidate for prime minister who is campaigning for restraints on public spending to allow for lower taxes and higher private sector growth. But his call was promptly rejected by the Radical Liberal party and the Centre Democrats, who remain loyal to a partnership with the Social Democrats. The Christian People's party, who opinion polls show may be eliminated from the Folketing (parliament), were non-committal. Opinion polls indicate the four-party coalition, which took office in January 1993 without an election, will lose its one-seat majority. But they suggest Mr Rasmussen will be able to continue as head of a minority government dependent on the left-wing Socialist People's party. The Conservative and Liberal parties are set to make gains, but not sufficient to unseat Mr Rasmussen without the help of centre parties. The prospect of a Social Democratic victory has led to speculation that Mr Elleman-Jensen, foreign minister between 1982 and 1993, may seek to become Nato secretary-general in succession to the late Mr Manfred Worner. Yesterday, however, he emphasised his ambition to become Danish premier.</p>

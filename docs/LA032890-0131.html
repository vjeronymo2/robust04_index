			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4 FACE RUNOFFS IN SEAL BEACH VOTE  </P> <P> The election to fill two open seats on the City Council ended in a draw  Tuesday, with two candidates who oppose a massive housing development and two  who favor it headed for a runoff.  </P> <P> Because none of the eight candidates received at least 50% of the vote in  either of the two council district races, the top two vote-getters in each  district will appear in a May 8 runoff.  </P> <P> In District 1, which covers the downtown and Surfside neighborhoods, the race  will pit engineering contractor Joe Rullo against property manager Marilyn  Bruce Hastings.  </P> <P> In District 3, which covers the Hill neighborhood and part of the Leisure World  retirement community, Planning Commissioner Gwen Forsythe and environmental  activist Galen F. Ambrose will face off.  </P> <P> The council seats are being vacated by Joyce Risner and Victor Grgas, two  members of a council majority that support the Hellman Ranch project proposed  by the Mola Development Corp. A victory for anti-growth forces in the runoff  could set up a council majority hostile to the project.  </P> <P> Rullo and Forsythe back the project; Ambrose and Hastings oppose it.  </P> <P> The proposed 329-home Hellman Ranch project was the main issue in the campaign,  with the eight candidates evenly divided over the issue.  </P> <P> The 149-acre development, which would set aside 41 acres for wetlands  restoration, was approved by the City Council last October after months of  often heated debate.  </P> <P> Proponents of the development had hailed the project as being far better than  the original plan for 773 houses, saying it represented a fair balance between  commercial and environmental concerns. They insisted that the project would not  harm Seal Beach, and expressed doubts that the city could keep the owners of  the land from developing it.  </P> <P> Hellman Ranch foes criticized the plan for not adequately addressing  environmental concerns. They said they feared that the project would increase  traffic, pollution and crime, adding that they preferred a plan with fewer  homes and more wetlands.  </P> <P> The Hellman development took on added importance in the campaign earlier this  month when an Orange County Superior Court commissioner ruled that the city's  General Plan was outdated and that the Hellman Ranch development must be  approved for a second time by the City Council.  </P> <P> Because the General Plan revisions are not final, it is still not known whether  the council will vote on the measure before May 15, when the two new council  members will take office.  </P> <P> The election was marked by its lack of rancor and mudslinging in a city known  for heated politics.  </P> <P> Even with the divisive issue of growth at the forefront, some candidates went  out of their way not to attack the others directly.  </P> <P> Growth in the city of 26,000 people will be a major issue for the incoming  council. Two major developments -- one at Bixby Ranch in northern Seal Beach  and another at a property owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and  Power -- will likely be debated by the council in the next year.  </P> <P> Times correspondent Michelle Nicolosi contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ELECTION RETURNS  </P> <P> Seal Beach City Council  </P> <P> 100% Precincts Reporting  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:1.78IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> District 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Joe Rullo *  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 282  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marilyn Bruce Hastings *  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 252  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Charles Antos  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 231  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> James C.

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCIPLES OF CHRIST WILL BUILD NEW 7-STORY HEADQUARTERS IN INDIANAPOLIS  </P> <P> The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) has decided to build a new  seven-story, limestone and glass headquarters building in downtown Indianapolis  at a cost of $15 million to $18 million.  </P> <P> Facing the need for major renovations in current offices, now housed in three  separate facilities here, the 1.1 million-member denomination chose to erect  the new headquarters.  </P> <P> About 5,000 participants in the denomination's general assembly last week  joined in a celebration, "blessing" the new building site.  </P> <P> The headquarters staff numbers about 250. Construction of the building is  expected to begin in late 1990 with completion in the fall of 1992. The Lilly  Endowment, a funder of religious organizations, has made grants totaling $2  million to assist in planning and relocation.  </P></p>

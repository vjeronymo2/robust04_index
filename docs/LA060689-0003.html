			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two communications satellites were lifted into orbit in the fourth of nine  space flights planned by the European consortium Arianespace. An upgraded  version of the Ariane 4, Europe's most powerful rocket, carried the double  payload aloft to complete the European Space Agency's 13th successful mission.  The three-stage, 192-foot-long rocket, launched from the agency's jungle  complex in French Guiana, delivered Japan's $100-million Superbird-A  communications satellite and a West German television-relay station known as  DFS Kopernikus 1 into orbit.  </P></p>

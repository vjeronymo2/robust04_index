As one of the key national projects of the Eighth Five-Year  Program (1991-1995), the project invited bidding for design in  the country for the first time. Some new technologies have been  utilized in its construction.    The dam of the station is 5,842 meters long, now the longest  in China. Another three generating units, each with a  generating capacity of 60,000 kw, will be installed.    After its completion in 1995, the station is expected to  produce 520 million kwh every year. It will also irrigate an  area of 67,000 hectares of the island province.    Work started in 1990 and the project used world bank loans  of  67 million U.S. dollars in addition to Chinese investment.</p>

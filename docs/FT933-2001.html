			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Securum starts life with SKr12.9bn first-half loss THE EXTENT of the problems jettisoned by the Swedish commercial bank Nordbanken was made clear yesterday when Securum, which took on most of its bad debts, announced a SKr12.9bn (Dollars 1.61bn) loss in its first six months of operation. Securum, which owns 61 per cent of Nobel Industries, was set up by the Swedish government in January to speed up the reconstruction of Nordbanken, allowing it to be returned to the private sector by the end of next year. Some SKr67bn in bad debts were taken on by Securum, a separate state-owned entity which received a SKr24bn equity injection from the government. Nordbanken's subsequent return to profit has prompted criticism that it has gained an unfair competitive advantage over rivals who have not received any state assistance. In the first half of 1993, Nordbanken bounced back to a SKr1.7bn profit from a SKr5.2bn loss in the same period of 1992. Securum's six-month deficit stemmed almost entirely from SKr12bn in credit losses, mainly linked to the collapse of the Swedish real estate market. The process of selling off assets has already begun, although the focus of Securum's efforts has been to sort out its bad loan portfolio with a view to enhancing future sales values. The agency has been deliberately constructed to avoid the need for distressed sales, with the sell-off phase expected to last up to 15 years. 'We are only two miles into a marathon,' said Mr Lars Thunell, the head of Securum. The reorganisation of the credit portfolio is nearly complete and future losses are expected to be much smaller. Around SKr15bn of Securum's SKr24bn capital has already been wiped out, and the balance is expected to disappear during the disposal phase. Securum has 15 subsidiary companies, with activities in Sweden, the US and a range of European countries including the UK and Germany. Sweden's Bank Support Authority, the state body set up to tackle Sweden's banking crisis, said yesterday it had written down the value of Securum by a further SKr13.15bn to SKr1bn.</p>

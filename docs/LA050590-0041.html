			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A RUN PROVES ENOUGH FOR FILLMORE'S CHESSANI;  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL: 1-0 VICTORY OVER ST. BONAVENTURE FORCES TIE FOR TRI-VALLEY  LEAGUE LEAD.  </P> <P> Clarion calls of "Let's rope this guy!" resounded from both dugouts throughout  Friday's Tri-Valley League baseball showdown between Fillmore and St.  Bonaventure highs.  </P> <P> But senior right-handers Anthony Chessani of Fillmore and Kevin Zoll of host  St. Bonaventure were oblivious to any chants.  </P> <P> Chessani and Zoll -- each with a shutout victory over the other team this  season -- traded strikeouts and scoreless innings into the late afternoon.  </P> <P> Finally, Chessani emerged on top, hurling a nine-inning two-hitter with 10  strikeouts as Fillmore eked out a 1-0 victory in the season's rubber match  between the schools.  </P> <P> The win moved Fillmore (15-3, 11-2 in league play) into a first-place tie with  St. Bonaventure (12-7, 11-2) with two games remaining. Should the teams finish  as co-champions, Fillmore, by virtue of its two victories over St. Bonaventure,  would enter the Southern Section playoffs as the league's top-seeded team.  </P> <P> "I felt like I was getting stronger and stronger," said Chessani (7-1). "That  one run put more into me. Every time we huddled, I said to the guys, 'Just get  one run because I'm not going to let them score.' "  </P> <P> Chessani, who blanked St. Bonaventure, 4-0, earlier this season, closed five  innings with strikeouts. He gave up his first hit in the fourth and didn't  allow another until Zoll's two-out single in the ninth. The game ended four  pitches later when Zoll, on his way to second base, was struck by a ball off  the bat of Chris Borchard.  </P> <P> "He has a great fastball," St. Bonaventure Coach Dennis Johnson said of  Chessani. "He's the hardest thrower in the league."  </P> <P> Zoll (7-3), who pitched a no-hitter against Fillmore three weeks ago, struck  out six and gave up seven hits. Fillmore threatened, putting a runner at third  in the second, third, fourth and sixth, but Zoll escaped each threat.  </P> <P> In the ninth, Mike Thompson tagged Zoll for a one-out triple. After an infield  pop out, Alex Sandoval drove in the run with a ground ball into right field.  </P> <P> "We were playing him up the middle," Zoll said. "If I didn't hang (the pitch),  he would have hit it up the middle. But you can't second-guess a 1-0 game."  </P></p>

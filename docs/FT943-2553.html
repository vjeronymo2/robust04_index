			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Action urged on electoral reform Mr Charles Kennedy, the outgoing party president, called for determined efforts to establish cross-party agreement on constitutional reform before the next general election. He warned that the legislative measures needed to introduce electoral reform and other changes were almost certain to face formidable parliamentary obstacles whatever the political complexion of the next government. Mr Kennedy said: 'The way must be prepared well in advance, within parties and across them, if constitutional measures are to be addressed.' The crisis faced by Mr John Major over the Maastricht treaty on European Union, when a government with an apparent working majority had been reduced to a 'broken-back' state, underlined the hazards of constitutional bills. Mr Kennedy suggested that, if the Conservatives lost power, their MPs in the next parliament would be under pressure to close ranks and oppose any constitutional reform. He urged 'reformers of all political allegiances' to start discussions on the desirability of constitutional change and on how to deliver it.</p>

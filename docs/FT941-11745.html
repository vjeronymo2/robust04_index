			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Pakistani banks taken for a Dollars 500m ride Pakistani banks have clocked up a Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) taxi bill, after the import of 50,000 cars created a financial nightmare. These days, passengers leaving a main airport or train station can choose from scores of brand-new yellow cabs ranging from a small Suzuki to a Mercedes Benz. The yellow cabs - which replaced battered old makes, including many Morris Minors - are now at the centre of a political controversy. As parliament began debating the issue this week, 13,000 more vehicles remained stranded at Karachi's seaport and at dealer outlets. Unemployed youths who wanted to become taxi drivers were allowed to buy their vehicles on 10 per cent down-payment while paying back the rest in easy instalments. Banks were ordered to approve requests for loans on receipt of the deposit. But in the first year of the plan, according to bankers, after cab owners had been given PRs15bn (Pounds 333m), up to 60 per cent of them began defaulting, and banks refused to sanction any new loans. The supreme court has ruled the government should resolve the issue of the stranded vehicles, but the government has no easy way out. At the outset of the scheme two years ago, Mr Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister, considered the yellow cabs the most important symbol of his economic reforms. 'The prime minister feels that just as bright new cars have replaced older ones, new and fresh policies of deregulation and privatisation will eventually replace older ones of bureaucratic management,' a senior official said at the time. But because the scheme involved reducing import duties on the taxis, it worsened already strained finances, leaving the new government an even larger budget deficit. 'If I get another opportunity, I shall import half a million vehicles to help the poor,' said a defiant Mr Sharif as he led an opposition attack in parliament alleging the government's decision to abandon the scheme was hurting the underprivileged and unemployed. 'The yellow cabs gave a sense of pride to their owners, because they now had their own cars. For the first time in this country, we really helped the poor.' Mr Makhdoom Shahabuddin, minister of state for finance, retorted: 'When there is an inherent tendency in such a scheme for it to be hijacked by people who don't deserve it, then it's a problem.' Many expensive vehicles such as Mercedes, imported on loans for being used as taxis, were in fact in private use, he claimed. The government is investigating reports that many dealers took payments from clients before placing orders. Allegations of sales under fictitious names to make the cars untraceable are also being investigated. The stranded cars could be sold in the open market free of much of the usual import duty, under one proposal being considered. But even so, Pakistan's financial sector may still be looking for stronger measures to support recovery of bank loans. 'The cab issue shows that giving out loans is much easier than getting them back. This should be a lesson for us to tighten our belts if we want to prosper,' one banker said.</p>

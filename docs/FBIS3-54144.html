			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ambassador Suhayl Shammas, head of the delegation to  the Washington peace talks, left Beirut today for Washington to  participate in the meeting of the heads of delegations on  Monday. Before his departure he said:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] You are leaving  today for Washington to take part in the 12th round of peace  talks. What can you say about the Lebanese file you are taking  with you to these talks?    [Shammas] Before answering this question, I would like to  say  why I am going to Washington. After consultations with the  United States and Russia in their capacity as cosponsors of the  peace conference that was launched in Madrid, Lebanon yesterday  received through the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon an invitation to  attend negotiations that will resume on 24 January at the level  of delegation heads. On this basis, I am leaving Beirut today  for Washington provided with a unified Lebanese political  decision made with the information available to the government  and after thorough coordination, which is natural, between  Lebanon and Syria. This coordination was capped two days ago  with the expanded summit in Damascus. I am going to Washington  carrying the Lebanese people's aspirations and desire for an  honorable peace that will safeguard Lebanese rights and bring  about peace and security in the region based on a comprehensive  solution and justice. The concept of a comprehensive solution  was established and confirmed at the summit meeting between  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton.  In addition, a positive climate has been generated by this  summit that we can use to push the peace process forward.    [Reporter] The Israeli response is still unclear, as  President al-Asad, who paved the way for a fair and  comprehensive peace, has said. How can you interpret this?    [Shammas] In fact, President al-Asad was extremely candid.  He has committed himself to the peace process and answered  every question with complete clarity. He declared Syria's sure  commitment to the peace process and his desire for a genuine  peace. He elaborated on the elements of peace, which I do not  want to repeat. All I would like to say is that his clarity was  sufficient and the topics he dealt with were clear and so the  ball is now in the Israeli court. The Israeli prime minister,  who on several occasions voiced his desire for peace, has to  take the necessary steps within the framework of the one  clarified at the joint news conference held by Presidents  Clinton and al-Asad. I do not want to comment further on this  issue.    [Reporter] In your view, this time will the U.S. role of  full  partner be more effective in pressuring Israel to implement the  UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 425?    [Shammas] Resolution 425 is valid and is a basic factor in  the Lebanese position. The press uses certain descriptions,  which I can neither approve nor reject. What I want to say is  that President Clinton declared in a loud voice that Syria is  the key to peace. He used clear English terms that leave no  room for misinterpretation or doubt. He said: Syria is the key  [last three words said in English]. He used the article "the"  [said in English] clearly. This word caused us problems because  it was not used in Security Council Resolution 242 in its  English text. The word was clearly used in Geneva this time.  Such a stance by the U.S. President is significant. What  counts is that all resources should be employed to lay the  foundation for a comprehensive and fair solution. In a  comprehensive solution, Lebanon will be protected, particularly  because it entered these negotiations in close unison with  fraternal Syria. This is not rhetoric but fact because as long  as Lebanon and Syria are in full agreement, they will be safe  and sound.    [Reporter] Will the 12th round of talks be held this month,  Mr. Ambassador?    [Shammas] We are now going to Washington to resume  negotiations at the level of delegation heads. The results of  our contacts will decide if there is a point in holding a new  round. So, watch what will happen in Washington. I would like  to tell you that for a long time you are not going to hear my  voice. This is the last time you will hear me; you will spare  your listeners a dissonant voice. Thank you.    [Reporter] The Israeli ambassador to the United States said  yesterday that Syria is the key to a Middle East settlement. He  does not expect peace agreements with Lebanon, Jordan, and the  Palestinians at this stage. What do you think?    [Shammas] We believe, and the Lebanese officials have made  many statements at various levels that if progress is made on  the Syrian track, all Arabs, especially Lebanon, will benefit.  But I do not believe that the other negotiating tracks will be  deadlocked; they will affect each other. The Americans believe  that Syria is the key to a solution. If the head of the Israeli  delegation to the talks with Syria, who is also Israel's  ambassador to Washington, agrees, then this is perhaps a  positive sign. But I do not necessarily agree with him about  his other conclusions. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BURGLARY SUSPECT IN AIR SHAFT LANDS IN JAIL CELL  </P> <P> A burglary suspect wedged himself inside the air shaft of a central Los Angeles  restaurant early Saturday and remained trapped for three hours until  firefighters rescued him by sawing apart the metal shaft, police said.  </P> <P> The suspect, unharmed during the ordeal, was then arrested, said Los Angeles  Police Sgt. James Markloff of the Rampart station.  </P> <P> Jose Felipe Garcia, 21, was charged with burglary, Markloff said.  </P> <P> Police responded to a 5:30 a.m. report of a man screaming in the vicinity of  Shella's restaurant in the 300 block of North Glendale Boulevard. When police  entered the restaurant, they saw a man stuck midway through the restaurant's  L-shaped air shaft.  </P> <P> The suspect apparently had used a rope to climb down into the restaurant  through the air shaft. After allegedly trying to pry open a cash register, "he  tried to shimmy back out, but he couldn't quite make the turn in the L-shaped  shaft," Markloff said.  </P></p>

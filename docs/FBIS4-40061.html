In an interview with Armenian television on Monday, Guliyev  said that all occupied territories must be freed and the sides  involved should begin negotiations in order to determine  Nagorno-Karabakh's status.    Guliyev stressed the need to find ways of economic  integration. "We are bound to live together. We must not fear  each other or fight each other," Guliyev said.    He believes that as soon as normal economic relations are  restored, "our people will forget the war in six months."</p>

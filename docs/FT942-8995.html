			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Power watchdog looks to speedy shake-up Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, yesterday indicated a strong preference for speeding liberalisation of the power market but said it would not be possible to give domestic customers the ability to choose a supplier before 1998. Speaking on publication of the annual report of Offer, the regulation authority he heads, Prof Littlechild and his officials said they would take steps to ensure there were fewer leaks from confidential memoranda sent to power companies about a review of distribution prices. Prof Littlechild said it was regrettable that details of a letter he sent last month to electricity companies about the distribution review had leaked into the market. Offer would try to limit leaks by making clear who in the companies should have copies of letters and access to information in them. Prof Littlechild said he hoped to conclude the distribution review around the end of July. On market liberalisation possibilities, Prof Littlechild has already asked the 14 power distribution companies for their views of allowing more consumers the right of choice in 1996. Only about 50,000 industrial and commercial companies which use more than 100kw of electricity - the so called 'non-franchise' customers - are now able to choose. Government plans issued at privatisation four years ago were that the choice should be extended to other consumers only in 1998. Prof Littlechild said that there would be advantages in opening up the franchise earlier. It would, however, not be possible to allow domestic customers choice without compromising contracts made between power companies on electricity generated from coal. This suggests that the 100kw limit may be reduced to 70kw or 80kw, drawing in more industrial and commercial consumers, although he would not be drawn on a figure. The speeding of liberalisation measures has been prompted by changes in the gas market due in 1996 which will allow household consumers a choice in gas suppliers. Gas companies say power groups, which also sell gas, would have an unfair advantage unless similar measures were introduced in the electricity market. The power companies argue that they have bought coal-fired electricity on five-year contracts in the belief that they had guaranteed markets for users above 100kw in their distribution areas. Mr Ian Byatt was yesterday re-appointed director-general of water services in England and Wales for a further two years.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Cracked up in California I BEGAN to chortle almost the moment this play began, and I guffawed right through to its close. The same goes for the rest of the audience. Now, since Cracks begins with an extended scene for one man alone in silence, and since it subsequently involves the deaths of everyone onstage, this is quite a feat on the part of playwright Martin Sherman and director Tim Luscombe. The key to the comedy, now showing at the King's Head Theatre in Islington, north London, is that this mysterious series of murders occurs in a Californian house-party in 1973; and the killings never stop the nine characters from carrying on the pursuit of free love, dope-smoking, coke-sniffing, and soul-baring. Just watching each one of them entering is a hoot. There is Sammy, the religious gay - 'Like all good Jewish boys, I became Buddhist' - who is soon to join a Catholic monastery: 'I'm really into it - into God, and things.' There is Jade, the girl who had studied ballet, but 'I stopped dancing because it's easier to fuck.' Plus Roberta, the docker who changed sex. Plus Nadine, the sweet young thing who is schizophrenically possessed by the dybbuk of her lesbian psychoanalyst. And more. Once you have seen one hippy singing 'The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind' to the corpse of the first dear departed, you have got the hang of it. But each character, and the whole situation, just gets more marvellously ludicrous. 'Where's Gideon?' 'Upstairs, getting a blow job.' 'But this is a matter of life and death.' 'Honey, sometimes a blow-job is a matter of life and death.' One of the best jokes is left unsaid. You watch the corpses fall, and you think 'But why are there only nine of them? This might be Ten Little Indians on the West Coast.' Then you realise that Nadine is also Cynthia, and that there are indeed ten - or were. Bang; and, there again, bang. Cracks, first performed in 1975, today virtually qualifies as period comedy. Martin Sherman is now famous as the author of Bent and When She Danced. Though I object to the queasy mixture of farce and serious art history he attempted in When She Danced (his Isadora play), any playwright who can handle the trauma and crisis of Bent and the absurd froth of Cracks has impressive range and ambition. (An interesting footnote is that, like certain other American playwrights, he now both lives and writes in Britain.) This Cracks is directed by Tim Luscombe, has a comparable range. (His most recent staging was the beautifully intense and realistic Snow Orchid at the Gate.) He has his actors play their roles with a very nicely judged dash of caricature. As Nadine/Cynthia, the play's funniest but most complex role, Jane Gurnett lacks the impish assurance that marks the rest of the cast, but nonetheless makes the virtuoso switches of voice and psyche hilarious. As Maggie, who has given up acting to be a full-time star, Deborah Norton gives a performance of delicious comic authority, reigning over the hippies in stellar glory whenever she hasn't lost a contact lens - and, in a perfect period echo, she looks like Carol Burnett. Briony Glassco, as Irene, has a note of crazy laughter in her voice that wafts back the young Goldie Hawn and the Rowan and Martin Laugh-In. The fact that she plays the least far-out person onstage makes her near-hysteria only funnier. But all the cast deserves high praise. Though the play is inch-deep, I haven't laughed so much for many a week. At the King's Head, Islington, London N1 until May 30.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mark W. Stiles, Regulations Analyst, Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, Bureau of Land Management, (202) 208&hyph;4256.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed amendment to 43 CFR parts 4, 1780, and 4100 is part of the Department of the Interior's Rangeland Reform '94 package. The provisions of this proposed rule are necessary to ensure proper administration of livestock grazing on the public rangelands and to bring about reform in the management of rangelands for the improvement, protection, and proper function of rangeland ecosystems. Many of the proposals would result in greater consistency between the administration of grazing on public rangelands by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and administration of grazing on National Forest System lands by the United States Forest Service (Forest Service). This proposed rule would govern the BLM's administration of livestock grazing on public rangelands. It is proposed under the principal authorities of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; FLPMA), the Taylor Grazing Act (43 U.S.C. 315  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43208). The comment period on the advance notice ended September 13, 1993, and was subsequently reopened for a 30-day period that ended October 20, 1993. A notice of intent to prepare an associated environmental impact statement (EIS) was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 13, 1993 (58 FR 37745), and August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43234). These notices requested public comment to assist in the scoping process for the EIS. The comment period on the second notice of intent closed September 13, 1993, and was subsequently reopened to correspond with the comment period on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. A booklet entitled Rangeland Reform '94 was developed to describe the Secretary's proposal and approximately 35,000 copies were distributed to all BLM grazing permittees and lessees, interested Congressional staff, and other interested parties, in late August and September of 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reviewers of this proposed rule may find it helpful to refer to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , August 13, 1993, in their consideration of this proposed rule. The advance notice contains some background material that has not been reproduced in this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During a three-month period beginning November 17, 1993, Secretary Babbitt met on 20 occasions around the West with groups which included western governors, State and local officials, ranchers, environmentalists and other public land users. He visited locations in Colorado, Wyoming, and Oregon where on-the-ground consensus groups were already engaged in addressing how land management decisions should be made, and participated in hundreds of hours of discussion about the components of rangeland reform. The meetings in Colorado, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, Oregon, Nevada and Utah resulted in many productive suggestions that are reflected in the new proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of public comments on the various documents distributed in the summer of 1993 and the meetings attended by the Secretary, the Department has modified many of the initial proposals for reforming rangeland management. The modified Rangeland Reform '94 proposal is summarized below. Much of the reform package is reflected in the proposed regulatory text provided in this document. The public is asked to review this revised proposal and provide comments and recommendations for improvement. Due to the great volume of comment anticipated, the Department requests that reviewers specifically identify the section and paragraph labels for the proposed regulatory text on which they are providing comment. Reviewers are also asked to provide suggested wording changes whenever possible. Comments on this proposed rule will be analyzed in detail and considered in the preparation of a final rule. The Department also intends to hold public meetings or hearings in western grazing States to obtain input on this proposal. Announcement of the place and time for these meetings or hearings will be made in a separate notice. The Department anticipates publication of the final rule late in calendar year 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Motorola's handy communicator Motorola has introduced a hand-held 'personal wireless communicator', called Envoy, which delivers on many of the promises that Apple Computer's Newton failed to keep, writes Louise Kehoe. Envoy can be used to send or receive electronic mail, facsimile messages or paging messages via a built-in modem. General Magic's Magic Cap software gives Envoy a friendly interface based on three scenes: the desktop; an 'infinite hallway' with doors to rooms such as the library; and 'downtown', with buildings which represent services such as a travel agent. However, the book-sized device does not recognise handwriting. Envoy will sell in the US for about Dollars 1,500. Motorola: US, 708 576 1600.</p>

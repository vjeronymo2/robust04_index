President Clinton's  lifting of the three-decade-old American trade embargo against  Vietnam was long overdue, but nonetheless welcome.    While the embargo may have served its original purpose of  encouraging the Vietnamese to account for the more than 2,000  American servicemen still listed as Missing in Action, it has  ceased to have any real function other than to block US  companies from competing in one of Asia's fastest growing  markets. Indeed the move may have come too late for some  American businesses. As former Vietnamese Foreign Minister  Nguyen Co Thach said at an end of embargo party in Hanoi: "In  Vietnam, we have a saying. The latecomer buffalo will drink  polluted water".    It was nonetheless a brave political act for a President  still plagued by accusations of draft-dodging during the Vietnam  war, and whose Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, has only just been  cleared of accepting bribes for working to have the embargo  ended.    The criticism levelled at Mr Clinton by Vietnam war veterans  suggests he may still pay a political price for his decision.  It would be a price worth paying.    For the lifting of the embargo is good news, not only for  Vietnam and the US, but also for Hong Kong and the rest of Asia.  In the short-term, local companies will have to work harder in  a market where they have built up a dominant position. The  territory has already pumped HK$1.2 billion [Hong Kong dollars]  into projects there, an amount second only to Taiwan.    But, in the longer term, the lifting of the embargo will  strengthen Hong Kong's chances of remaining a regional hub  beyond 1997, with the territory -- already well-served by direct  flights to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City -- well-positioned to  serve as a staging post for American businesses as they flood  back into Vietnam.    More important still, the decision should finally close the  chapter on the Vietnam war and its legacy of boat people who are  still attempting the journey to the territory. As the thousands  of boat people who are languishing in detention centres know, it  is a journey to nowhere.    Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey and Refugee  Coordinator Brian Bresnihan leave this week for an international  conference in Geneva to look at ways of speeding up the return  of boat people, the majority of whom have been screened out as  economic migrants by Hong Kong.    It has always been recognised that the long-term solution to  the boat people problem lies in Vietnam itself. Mandatory  repatriation may have halted the influx over the past couple of  years. But the only real guarantee for the Vietnamese lies in  bringing the country back into the international fold. Vietnam  needs to rebuild its economy and give its people every reason to  stay and become a vital part of the process.    The lifting of the embargo can give an important boost to  that process. It is not the end of the road, for that will only  come when the US resumes diplomatic relations with Hanoi,  something which is still some way away. But it is certainly a  significant step in the right direction.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Inflation falls to 2.6% but underlying rate rises BIG CUTS in mortgage interest rates pushed down UK retail price inflation - the so-called headline rate - to 2.6 per cent last month, the lowest level for 6 1/2 years. But the Treasury's chosen measure of underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, crept back up. Higher seasonal food and petrol prices were the main factors behind the rise in the annual rate of underlying inflation last month. Prices rose by 3.7 per cent in the year to December compared with 3.6 per cent in the year to November. This was the first rise in the annual rate since March last year. The latest rise leaves the underlying inflation rate near the upper end of its target range. Last autumn Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the government aimed to keep this measure within a 1-4 per cent range, and bring it down to 2 per cent before the end of this parliament. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday he was confident the headline rate - down from 3 per cent in November - would fall further this month. He described the rise in underlying inflation as 'very marginal' and said it was well within its parameters. The government was 'absolutely determined' it remained so, he said. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'While headline inflation has fallen because of the recession, the underlying rate is rising and is heading towards the upper end of the government's target range.' Most economists expect the headline rate of inflation to continue falling this year as further interest rate cuts affect the index, but they are less sure about the direction of the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments. Earlier this week figures for producer prices showed that sterling's devaluation has pushed up the prices of raw materials and fuels. Manufacturers' output prices have also risen slightly, but so far they have resisted passing on the higher costs to retailers. Mr Robert Lind, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the investment house, believes the Treasury's underlying measure will rise above 4 per cent because of the effects of devaluation. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at the investment house Greenwell Montagu, said: 'Our measure of core inflation, which measures only the prices of goods and services that you buy in shops, fell again this month. We consider this to be indicative of what is really going on with inflation in the economy.' Apart from the big rise in seasonal food prices - 4 per cent on the month - Central Statistical Office figures showed a sharp rise in the price of tobacco as manufacturers' price increases continued to feed through to the index. Prices rose by 1.6 per cent on the month and 9.1 per cent on the year. Price reductions were concentrated in alcohol, cars, clothing and footwear.

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNOCAL'S GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS ARE GAINING STEAM  </P> <P> Unocal Corp. has given a new meaning to the term steaming jungle.  </P> <P> Amid the rain forests of the Philippines, the company has tapped into a source  of energy more primordial than oil or natural gas: the heat of the earth's  crust itself, manifested in super-hot water and billowing steam.  </P> <P> The resource, dubbed geothermal energy, can be drilled, extracted and piped to  generators to produce electricity. On the Philippines' main island, Luzon,  Unocal's geothermal division supplies steam to produce 660 megawatts of power,  enough to fill 25% of the island's electrical needs, said division President  Stephen C. Lipman.  </P> <P> The decade-old project is Unocal's largest foreign geothermal operation, but is  only part of the company's Pacific Basin operations. In that sense, Unocal --  which calls itself the world's largest producer of geothermal energy -- seems  to be pacing the industry.  </P> <P> As domestic geothermal markets dry up, the Pacific Basin is emerging as one of  the best new markets for California geothermal companies, officials said.  </P> <P> "We feel (the potential overseas) is very strong because of the diversity of  experience many companies have here," said Claudia Barker, assistant director  of the California Energy Commission. "There's just not that range . . . in any  other state."  </P> <P> Geothermal energy occurs in the form of heat captured by fluids trapped in rock  formations beneath the earth.  </P> <P> Companies such as Unocal explore such geothermal fields, drill wells and  produce either superheated water or steam. The company can sell the steam to  utilities to produce electricity in generating plants. Or the company can build  its own generating plant and sell the resulting electricity directly to the  utility.  </P> <P> The heat comes from molten rock, or magma, that has worked its way close to the  earth's surface. That happens in areas with faults, earthquakes or volcanic  activity -- such as the Pacific Basin, which also carries the nickname the Ring  of Fire.  </P> <P> In addition to favorable geology, the Pacific Basin includes many developing  nations eager for a relatively cheap, home-grown source of electrical power and  a way to reduce their balance-of-trade deficits. All of which makes the region  favorable for geothermal.  </P> <P> The 10 countries with the most geothermal development include six Pacific Basin  countries, according to the Geothermal Resources Council, an industry  information group in Davis, Calif.  </P> <P> Even Indonesia, with its membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries and its oil reserves, wants to develop steam-powered electrical  plants -- and save the oil and gas for export, Lipman said.  </P> <P> Unocal is already active in the area. By 1992, Unocal plans to begin geothermal  production for a 110-megawatt power plant in the Salak area of Indonesia, about  40 miles south of Jakarta on the island of Java.  </P> <P> The company is talking about geothermal projects with officials in Guatemala  and even the Soviet Union, which has geothermal fields on the Kamchatka  Peninsula, Lipman said. Unocal is also talking with officials in Kenya.  </P> <P> Other geothermal companies in the Pacific Rim include Chevron Corp. and Texaco.  </P> <P> Worldwide, geothermal development is growing at an annual rate of 15% to 17%,  said David N. Anderson, executive director of the Geothermal Resources Council  and the National Geothermal Assn., a trade group.  </P> <P> In the race for a piece of that business, U.S. companies may have an edge in  technology, Lipman said. Unocal has perfected equipment that can withstand the  high temperatures, hard rock and corrosive salinity of geothermal drilling, he  said.  </P> <P> But American firms find themselves at a disadvantage when competing against  government-subsidized foreign firms that can offer cut-rate financing to  cash-strapped Third World utilities.  </P> <P> The main competitors are Japanese and Italian companies, Anderson said.  </P> <P> The state energy commission has taken on the role of broker to help state-based  geothermal companies get together with foreign governments. Among other things,  the state has sponsored "reverse trade missions" in which foreign utility  officials fly to California, where state geothermal companies trot out their  stuff. The missions have resulted in at least three agreements for further  development, Barker said.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that these companies are struggling . . . and were having a  hard time breaking in," she said.  </P> <P> Anderson's group, the National Geothermal Assn., was formed in 1987 to  coordinate efforts of geothermal vendors. The association is also seeking  federal permission for its members to form coalitions to bid on foreign  projects, which would enable them to compete better with foreign companies.  </P> <P> The need to look overseas is spurred by a domestic market that is going up in  smoke.  </P> <P> California easily overshadows other areas in the world in geothermal activity,  with 2,609 megawatts of power generated at the end of last year, according to  the Geothermal Resources Council. That is projected to grow to 2,889 megawatts  for 1989.  </P> <P> Total worldwide production was 5,004 megawatts at the end of 1987, the latest  year for which statistics were available, the council reported. By now, another  600 megawatts may have come on line, Anderson said.  </P> <P> But future domestic geothermal development isn't attractive, in part because of  the economics. Up to this point, steam prices have not remained strong enough  to support further exploration, Anderson said.  </P> <P> Moreover, the state Public Utilities Commission is reviewing the standard  contract between utilities and geothermal producers and could require  geothermal to be competitive with other fuels, Barker said.  </P> <P> "It's probably going to be a little difficult to compete with oil- or  natural-gas-based technologies," given relatively low fossil fuel prices,  Barker said.  </P> <P> Besides, California probably won't need more electric generation capacity until  the mid-1990s, Barker said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the world's biggest geothermal field, the Geysers in Northern  California, may be overloaded with 26 plants now tapping steam and two more  under construction. Production of steam has peaked and is in decline.  </P> <P> The drop in steam pressure has caught the attention of the Energy Commission,  which is now studying the phenomenon to help manage the field better.  </P> <P> It's a question of "how many straws should be stuck into the ground up there  and how they should be sipping," Barker said.  </P> <P> At Unocal, slipping domestic steam prices are partly to blame for sliding  geothermal revenue and earnings. At the end of 1988, the geothermal division of  Unocal reported net earnings of $25 million, down from $33 million in 1987.  Revenue was $155 million, down from $165 million in 1987.  </P> <P> Last year, the company lowered its estimated reserves at both the Geysers field  in California and the Tiwi field in the Philippines, which could affect revenue  from both fields in the future.  </P> <P> But Lipman says earnings have turned the corner this year, partly because of  higher overall production from the Philippines and revenue from a new  47.5-megawatt geothermal plant in the Imperial Valley.  </P> <P> Earnings should improve even more once the Indonesian field begins production  and sales to the national utility, he said.  </P> <P> Improved financial performance would underline the company's need for Pacific  Rim development.  </P> <P> "In the past, we've tended to rely on our operations at the Geysers in Northern  California . . . to provide the cash flow for the rest of our operations," he  said. "Now we're at the point where we've got three significant profit centers  in our operation (the Geysers, Imperial Valley and the Philippines), and when  Indonesia comes on, the fourth one will be there.  </P> <P> "So we've got the stability and are able to take the ups and downs of any one  area, and still maintain a very good level of earnings and cash flow."  </P></p>

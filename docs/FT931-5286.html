			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: BNP tumbles steeply to FFr2.1bn BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), one of France's largest state-controlled banks, yesterday highlighted the difficulties of the French banking sector by unveiling an unexpectedly steep fall in estimated net profits, of 28 per cent, to FFr2.1bn (Dollars 378m) from FFr2.9bn in 1991. It said its performance last year had been badly affected by the need to make heavy provisions on its property interests and industrial investments. The group, with Credit Lyonnais, is a candidate for privatisation if, as expected, France's conservative coalition wins this month's parliamentary elections. Other French banks have also reported poor results for 1992. The banking sector last year suffered from the impact of the sluggish economy on demand for credit and from the problems of the property market, particularly in Paris, and the steep increase in business failures among small and medium-sized companies. This week Suez, the industrial group with significant investment banking interests, disclosed that last year it had suffered its first ever loss. Societe Generale, a leading commercial bank, recently announced static profits for 1992. Paribas, the investment banking group, said it had returned to the black last year but was forced to make steep provisions. BNP refused to comment on its 1992 performance, saying it would publish detailed figures after a board meeting at the end of this month. However it confirmed that net banking income rose by 5.2 per cent to FFr40bn last year, with costs rising at the slower rate of 3.7 per cent. As a result it was able to improve its operating margins, with operating profits rising by 8.9 per cent to FFr11.8bn. The group, which has already reported a 13.4 per cent fall in interim net profits to FFr1.33bn for the first half of 1992 after provisions of FFr4.11bn, did not specify the exact level of provisions for the full year. Credit Lyonnais is expanding its European interests by raising its stake in Banque Franco-Hellenique of Greece from 50 per cent to 75 per cent by buying shares from the Greek National Bank for Industrial Development, which will retain a 25 per cent stake.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATWATCH: BIG NUMBERS TELL STORY AS BOOK CLOSES ON HIGA, WALTERS  </P> <P> Gabe Higa of Quartz Hill High and Chris Walters of Antelope Valley, two of the  best basketball players to come out of the high desert, ended their high school  careers last week when their teams were eliminated from the Southern Section  playoffs.  </P> <P> Higa, a four-year varsity player, scored 603 points and had 263 rebounds in 26  games this season, averaging 23.2 points and 10.1 rebounds.  </P> <P> He scored a school-record 43 points against La Puente in December and finished  his career by scoring in double figures in 49 consecutive games.  </P> <P> All told, Higa, a 6-foot-6 forward who will attend UC Irvine, scored a  school-record 1,486 points in 90 games (16.5 average).  </P> <P> Walters, a three-year starter, scored 557 points in 26 games (21.4 ppg).  </P> <P> He made 226 of 452 shots (50%) from the field and 95 of 162 (59%) free throws.  Walters also had 59 assists and 59 steals.  </P> <P> Walters, a 6-2 forward who is bound for Texas El Paso, scored 1,207 points in  76 games (15.9 average) in his career.  </P> <P> Rebounding: Although Harvard entered play Tuesday with a record of 22-2, the  team has struggled on the boards. The Saracens have been outrebounded in five  games but won each time.  </P> <P> In a convincing 109-78 victory over Blair on Saturday, Harvard held a slight  rebounding edge, 30-29.  </P> <P> "I know coaches and commentators say that's a vital statistic," Coach Greg  Hilliard said. "Thank goodness for us, it hasn't worked out that way."  </P></p>

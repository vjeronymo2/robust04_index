			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- Cuba and Belgium maintain  their agreement that the departure of the individuals who  illegally occupied the residence of the Belgian ambassador in  this capital is indispensable, local foreign ministry sources  told PRENSA LATINA.    The situation at the diplomat's home remained unchanged  during the past few hours in view of the refusal of the  occupants to return home and to initiate the normal paperwork to  travel abroad if they so desire.    The solution, accepted by the Belgian Government, includes  the decision by the Cuban Government to allow the evacuation of  the residence by the people who forced their way into it without  applying legal measures stipulated for this type of action, both  in Cuba as well as in any other country, the source explained.    The source himself confirmed that the Belgian Government  informed the Cuban Embassy in Brussels of its desire to  reinforce, with diplomatic and technical personnel, the small  mission in Havana.    Cuba accepted the request, bearing in the mind the current  situation in the Belgian Embassy and the small number of  officials working and there. However, the official request for  the extra personnel to travel to Havana has not yet been issued  to the Cuban Foreign Ministry.    Political observers said that the prolongation of the  occupants' stay at the Belgian ambassador's residence has  weakened their position in view of the lack of support they have  received. This has occurred basically because the two  governments involved have been in accordance on how to deal with  the situation.    The departure of four of the occupants, a few days ago, who  have not been harassed by authorities, may encourage the  remaining occupants to follow this path as the proper way to  resolve the problem.    At any rate, conversations between Belgian representatives  and Cuban Foreign Ministry officials continue to take place  normally, as PRENSA LATINA has learned. More contacts are  expected in the next few hours.</p>

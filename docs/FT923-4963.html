			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hopes of 'Yes' to Maastricht lift Paris CAUTIOUS optimism that the French will back Maastricht lifted late-closing bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS staged a turnround to end 2.2 per cent higher, boosted by a show of unity by leading politicians in favour of the Maastricht treaty and some opinion polls predicting a majority of 'Yes' votes in the referendum. The CAC-40 index finished 37.18 higher at 1,711.41, off a low of 1,659.84, in improved turnover of FFr2bn. Euro Disney jumped FFr5 or 6.9 per cent to FFr77 on talk that the theme park was about to announce good attendance figures and high occupancy rates at its hotels. The market responded well to the appointment of Mr Philippe Bourguignon as president reporting directly to Euro Disney's chairman, Mr Robert Fitzpatrick. Total slumped FFr12.20 or 5.9 per cent to FFr195.10, as analysts slashed their 1992 forecasts following the oil refiner's poor interim results. James Capel has cut its 1992 net profit estimate to FFr3.8bn from FFr4.5bn. Investors wanting to keep a weighting in oils switched into the higher-yielding Elf which rose FFr7 to FFr330. Oversold financial stocks jumped on hopes that the Maastricht treaty would be ratified. Suez jumped FFr7.60 to FFr232 while Bancaire added FFr13.50 to FFr293. There was unusually high volume of 48,575 shares in Pernod, the drinks company, which rose FFr11.90 to FFr406.80 on renewed takeover speculation. MILAN weakened further on renewed foreign selling. The Comit index fell 9.65, or 2.5 per cent to 375.34, its lowest level since September 1985, in turnover estimated at L100bn after L59.8bn on Tuesday. Dealers saw no way out of the crisis, which stemmed from a lack of confidence in the country and in the lira. Not only was there uncertainty over the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht, but also the prospect of further austerity measures by the government. Fiat fixed L142 lower at L3,800 while Generali shed L730 to L25,020. Mediobanca was settled at L9,530, down L570. Italmobiliare, which was temporarily suspended due to a trade imbalance on the sell side, dropped L3,590 or 10.2 per cent to L31,510. FRANKFURT dropped again in the official session, the DAX losing 12.03, or 0.8 per cent to 1,506.67. But in spite of the continuing fall in the dollar, widely blamed for the drops in exporters, there has been a technical aspect to the recent falls. The market rose by 1.7 per cent on Monday on panic short-covering by professionals, said Mr Edgar Benischeck, equity dealing head at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt. The dollar then fell below DM1.40 on Tuesday, driving dealers to cover long equity positions, which carried on yesterday. However, Mr Benischeck noted that share prices improved in the post bourse yesterday, and by the end they showed little change from Tuesday afternoon. ZURICH, described by Kleinwort Benson's Mr Anthony Thomas as 'simply . . . . the most defensive in Europe', paid its way with the SMI index 10.4 higher at 1,757.85. Swissair put on SFr24 to SFr584 after Tuesday's encouraging progress report, and Surveillance rose SFr35 to SFr1,410 on the belief that Hurricane Andrew would boost its loss adjustment business. MADRID was lifted by sharp advances in banks, where both domestic and foreign investors showed buying interest in BBV, Santander and Central Hispano. The general index rose 3.45 to 209.82, and volume was healthy at over Pta10bn compared to an average of Pta5bn during most of August. OSLO's all-share index touched 303 in early trading before closing at 307.60, down 1.52. Elkem plunged on speculation that it was heading for collapse, the free shares falling 25 per cent to NKr30. STOCKHOLM extended its session by half an hour after a power cut halted trading 15 minutes before the close. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.2 to 746.4 in turnover of SKr458m after SKr342m. COPENHAGEN continued to worry about its place in Europe, the KFX index losing a further 1.61, or 2.1 per cent to a new low of 73.27. East Asiatic continued to weaken on last week's swing from profit to a six-month loss, dropping DKr9.50 to DKr63.50. AMSTERDAM ended broadly on worries about the softening of the dollar and weak corporate earnings. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.6 to 108.5. The light machinery manufacturer, Stork, dropped Fl 5.90 to Fl 29.30 after announcing a 17 per cent decline in first-half net after the close on Tuesday. BRUSSELS's Bel-20 Index fell 3.99 to 1,046.07, a new low since the index was introduced in March 1991.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1001.41  1001.64  1003.59  1004.57  1006.66  1010.20  1010.38  1011.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1011.30          Day's Low  1000.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             Sep 1     Aug 28     Aug 27     Aug 26     Aug 25           1007.79    1013.54    1017.14     997.98     993.01  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

San Jose Municipality invited  Chamorro to visit Costa Rica to open the Nicaragua Park in this  capital. She will seize the opportunity to meet with Calderon.    The dispute emerged over an alleged five-dollar charge,  which  is considered illegal by Costa Rican authorities, collected from  tourists navigating along the San Juan River which delimits  almost 200 of the 320 km that the two countries share.    Last weekend the Costa Rican president hinted that the next  administration, which will be inaugurated on 8 May, could take  this dispute to the International Court of Justice,  headquartered at The Hague (the Netherlands), in case it cannot  be solved through other means. Calderon today stressed the  cordial relationship between Costa Rica and Nicaragua and said  that he will talk to Chamorro to find a solution to the said  charge which Nicaraguan authorities consider legal.    Nicaragua has sovereignty over the San Juan River, which  drains Lake Nicaragua, but according to border treaties signed  last century, Costa Rica also has the right to navigate it  freely. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus today told  ACAN-EFE that the matter could be taken to the International  Court of Justice at The Hague, but he is hopeful it can be  solved through talks between the two nations. He said that he  hoped to talk today to his Nicaraguan counterpart, Ernesto Leal,  to find a solution to this problem, which arose due to Costa  Rican tourist enterprises.</p>

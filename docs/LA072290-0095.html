			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> WILLIAM WHYTE;  </P> <P> ENSURING THAT CITIES GIVE PEOPLE A 'PLACE FOR DREAMS'  </P> <P> William H. Whyte enjoys stories in which the accidents of fortune win out over  the deliberation of planning. He recalls the time when the buildings of an  industrial office park were finished and inhabited before connecting sidewalks  could be laid. "Wait," he recollects the architect saying. "Hold back a few  months and see where people walk. That's where you put the sidewalks."  </P> <P> At the age of 76, Whyte is an elder statesman of urban design who still  cultivates the outlook of a rebel. "Street Corner Society," first published in  1943, is still widely read in college sociology courses. Whyte was one of the  first American thinkers to suggest that the modern American city was not some  monument to be plotted, paved and puffed up to expectations, but was something  that had already taken shape -- out of a gorgeous conglomeration of different  peoples, passions and dreams. "What the city has to do -- still more important  than ever, I think -- is to give people a place for dreams."  </P> <P> He was born in Springfield, Mass., and educated at Swarthmore, Harvard and the  University of Chicago, where he became a professor of sociology. Some of his  more than 14 books appear to be technical tomes -- "Human Relations in the  Restaurant Industry" (1948), or "Higher Yielding Human Systems for Agriculture"  (1984) -- that attracted a reputation outside their industries and disciplines  because of Whyte's wit and insights. The largest part of his academic career  was spent at Cornell, where he taught industrial relations, applied  anthropology and social science.  </P> <P> "City: Rediscovering the Center" (1989), out in paperback, represents the  conclusions he and 10 years of students developed by observing the way people  conduct themselves on the streets of Manhattan. The sociology is footnoted; but  Whyte's enthusiasm and affection for urban peoples is what stands out.  </P> <P> Today, Whyte commutes daily to his mid-town Manhattan office, overlooking  Central Park. It is not the post-card view; water-towers, scarred gravel roofs,  alleys and fire-escapes fill most of his window, but you sense these features  captivate Whyte more than the rolling green plain of the park that lends a  sense of peace to the city. "I like to see the guts of a city working," says  Whyte with a gesture to the view. He offers visitors a cup of coffee, then sets  out on a 15-minute voyage that involves rinsing, heating, brewing, pouring and  maneuvering through hallways and storerooms in his office building, to return  with a single, graciously presented cup. "Dr. Whyte," says a secretary in an  office across the hall, "loves going off on one of his adventures."  </P> <P> Question: You say that there seems to be a holy war going on against the  streets in our major cities, and the miscreants are not necessarily muggers and  scoundrels, but often urban planners.  </P> <P> Answer: Exactly, exactly. They are doing all sorts of things for the streets --  except strengthening them. They are putting the streets up in sky-bridges. They  are putting streets in underground concourses. What they are not doing is  strengthening the good, old streets as we know them. The street, I figure, is  the river of life of the city. You stick it underground, you put it up in the  air, and you have diluted your constituency. It deadens the city.  </P> <P> Q: Doesn't that come in response to the fact that urban planners and architects  and retailers and hotel owners concluded that people were frightened by a lot  of what was going on in the streets?  </P> <P>  A: Yes. A man put it very well to me. I had been jumping on him, saying, "Why  are you pushing these off-street streets, and also the megastructures," and he  said, "OK, they are somewhat anti-urban. But we will never lure people, middle  class, back to the city unless we offer them security from the city." That's  the reason for these huge megastructures that look like fortresses . . . .  </P> <P> Like in Detroit, the Renaissance Center . . . for example, they have that great  big berm -- sort of a long hill -- which actually contains their air  conditioning. It is part of what is meant to be an invitation to come in and be  safe from Detroit. I think that some of us have thought, "That's a hell of a  way to sell the center of the city." It's defensive, it's apologetic. Heavens,  the way you get people back into the town is to say, "Hey! We have something  here that you will like."  </P> <P> Q: Why does it seem that so much of what has been designed to revitalize the  city has not worked, and rather more of what just naturally fell into place  seems to survive?  </P> <P> A: I think that some of the things were sort of doomed.  </P> <P> For instance, planners go on these pilgrimages. They say, "Let's look at some  of the other cities which have done well, we can get some ideas." So, they go  to Minneapolis, and they see it's a successful downtown and they see these  skybreakers. And they go to Montreal, and there are these wonderful subways and  underground concourses, in both Toronto and Montreal. So they go back home with  visions and plans for underground concourses and overhead walkways.  </P> <P> Now, I don't blame people in Minneapolis and Montreal for wanting to be a  little warm in terribly cold weather. But then you get to a place like Dallas,  with all that warm weather -- they've built the most complete network of  underground walkways and sky-bridges. They boast you can go from one building  in Dallas to any other building without ever having to go up on the street. And  the question I would throw out is: Why? Why do they go to all this trouble to  take people off the streets?  </P> <P> Q: Reading between the lines of much of what you have written in recent years  suggests to me that two of the principal motivations in urban planning over the  past generation have been fear and greed.  </P> <P> A: Yes, that is true. And of the two, I don't mind greed so much, because that  can impel a lot of merchants to do a better job of merchandising, but I think  that the fear is itself an aggrandizing factor. For instance, it is a very  unhappy sight when you go in and see spikes in public places, like in the  Peachtree Plaza, Atlanta -- spikes. And you ask them, "Why this?" And they say,  "Oh, so bums won't spend the night." Well, suppose a bum did spend the night.  So what?  </P> <P> So I think one of the big negative factors in downtowns today is the fear, the  almost obsessive fear, that if you fix up a place to attract people, you will  attract undesirables, ergo, don't fix it up.  </P> <P> Q: You have set up cameras on the streets of New York to observe how people  behave. Let me ask you about a few of your discoveries. For example, people  don't walk where there is space to walk; they walk where people are already  walking.  </P> <P> A: The 100% conversation, I call it. If what we found out is true, then an  awful lot of the principles of city planning as now practiced are wrong. When I  started this, in 1970, the big cry then was: Let's reduce this terrible  congestion that is throttling the city. And you had a lot of documentaries  then, which, again, were almost neurotic on the subject. Their favorite scene  was shot from the telephoto lens, and so you see this tremendous compression,  all these poor people jammed together --  </P> <P> Q: -- cattle being herded is the impression.  </P> <P> A: Exactly. You know it's just all wrong. I'm not saying that everybody's  deliriously happy on the streets of New York, but I took sensational,  authentic, undoctored film of people on the streets of New York smiling . . . .  </P> <P> We were testing hypotheses on-camera, most of which blew up in my face. One of  my hypotheses was when people meet on the street and say, "Hi, how are you  doing?" "Long time no see," and that sort of thing, they would move into that  foot of space along a building front. Quite the opposite. With very good  exceptions they move into the center of traffic, what I call the 100% location  -- which is what real-estate people call the busiest street corner. It's  crowded, but it's also the place of maximum choice. They don't get off in a  corner somewhere; they don't let themselves get trapped.  </P> <P> That was a most valuable finding, because of the tendency, the thrust, of so  much pedestrian planning, downtown planning, is let's be more spacious, let's  give more room, don't cram them in.  </P> <P>  Q: What about some other findings your film seemed to reveal, that people are  not the slobs they have been blamed for being.  </P> <P> A: No, they are not. Our film showed people carrying trash around with no place  to put it. They couldn't see anywhere to throw it away. The minute a trash  container gets filled, that's when you get the slob. What is he to do? He puts  the trash in on the top of the thing and it blows away.  </P> <P> Let me tell you about a pet peeve I have: Stairs are unnecessarily steep. Of  course, they have to be steep enough so that the flight can be contained in the  lateral space. But, for example, take the 27 steps from the Lexington Avenue  subway stop to Grand Central -- 27 uninterrupted steps. It is really a job  getting up these things. And unnecessarily steep, because at the top you have  got all the room in the world. They could have used that space to make fewer  steps. You see this kind of thing all over. They don't use the space for where  people actually walk.  </P> <P>  Q: There seem to be a lot of blank walls in cities.  </P> <P> A: You know, I used to take a lot of pictures of blank walls because they are  very photogenic.  </P> <P> Q: What's that on your office wall?  </P> <P> A: That is my favorite. AT&amp;T's Longline Division headquarters in Manhattan.  It is about 50 stories high.  </P> <P> Q: And the small sign at the bottom saying --  </P> <P> A: "No ball or frisbie playing." I love it. But the walls, they really shut  people out.  </P> <P> Q: No signs of life visible?  </P> <P> A: No. And once you put up a blank wall, it is self-proving. Building owners  and/or developers can think of all sorts of excuses, for the heating, for the  air conditioning, but it is justification for a blank wall, to dullify  downtown.  </P> <P> Q: They did put a window in John Portman's Los Angeles Bonaventure Hotel.  </P> <P> A: They were finally driven to it because of tremendous criticism from types  like myself. You bring up the subject of Bonaventure, any of his (Portman's)  stuff, and everybody says, "I was just in a conference there, I couldn't find  my way." All these horror tales. You go inside this thing, and they have got  the Cocktail Plaza, they have got water walls, and you don't know where is  north, where is south, and it is all sort of circular. Very confusing. And I  think it is ironic that only about 30 miles away, down in Anaheim, people pay  good money to walk along a replica of an old-fashioned street in Disneyland.  See, the market is saying something.  </P> <P>  Q: Let me see if I can get you to be a bit indiscreet. What North American  cities do you most enjoy walking around?  </P> <P> A: The pedestrian cities, which, generally speaking, are pedestrian for a  number of reasons, but one is the ancient street pattern. Boston is a  delightful place really to walk around. And yet you could argue that the really  old parts look very perverse, very twisty and so forth, but it is a wonderful  example of pedestrian scale. OK, what other ones? Well, I am hopelessly  provincial -- I like New York. It is a great pedestrian town. Philadelphia,  also. They tend to be 18th Century cities.  </P> <P> Then, there's Seattle. And Portland -- a city that is really coming around. I  think that the thing that runs though, and you can see my bias, is that they  look like cities. They don't look like the suburban thing. San Francisco, of  course -- everybody's favorite city. And Chicago, Toronto, Montreal. These are  ones -- they tend to be a little on the big side, except for Portland, so they  have a strong identity. Everybody jumps on Chicago and says it is gritty. Well,  that is one of the reasons it is great.  </P> <P>  Q: What are some of those North American cities you least enjoy walking  around?  </P> <P> A: I hate to name any particular. Most middle-western smaller cities, I think,  have thrown away some of their great attributes. They seem unusually vulnerable  to the siren song of a suburbanized downtown. With a lot of them, it is too  late, although I've been to Dayton (Ohio) and they are doing wonderful things.  </P> <P> Q: Where does the 20th-Century city, Los Angeles, fit?  </P> <P> A: Well, Los Angeles is very difficult to place. It is a very urban place, make  no mistake. I mean, everybody says so many suburbs in search of a city, but it  is an urban place. They have a downtown that is beginning to take shape again.  I think Los Angeles is a very dynamic city, very exciting, fascinating.  </P> <P> They are trying to work their way to a strong center. There is a downtown, but  it doesn't fit any category of the others. For instance, Broadway -- it is  mostly Mexican, a damn lively place, it really is. I mean, you want to see  street life, boy oh boy, Broadway on Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Q: You have been writing about and walking about the streets of the city for 50  years now. How are North American cities different today from what you might  have imagined 50 years ago?  </P> <P> A: I think they are better. They really are. It is interesting that the most  interesting part of the city is downtown. It is not the mall, because as people  say, one mall looks just like another. They are really amazingly identical --  1,000 feet from anchor to anchor.  </P> <P> Q: Would you have guessed, 50 years ago, that there would be so much concern  about our cities becoming vacant rather than congested?  </P> <P>  A: That was a big change, a big change. But you know, these things people say  stem from a philosophic base that cities are basically bad places and we have  got to protect ourselves from the city. That battle is now over, and I think  sort of ideologically won.  </P> <P> Q: That lesson notwithstanding, how much progress can be made until Americans  feel that they are not only safe in the middle of the city, but that they can  send their youngsters to school there, or hold a job in that area?  </P> <P> A: Well, this is the big problem. We certainly don't see any solution how.  </P> <P> You know, it is interesting about crime. As far as downtowns go, downtown is  about the safest place there is in America. Really. I went to a conference of  police chiefs, and got the computer printout of all the reported crimes in  Dallas. And, hell's bells, I mean, it is in the suburbs, the suburban mall.  </P> <P> Now, I don't want to say too much bad about the suburban malls, because they  obviously fulfill a purpose. But the parking lot of a suburban shopping mall is  a very dangerous place. Something in the layout -- they are scary places. If  you park way out there, and then if, by the time you take your car most of the  intervening cars have since left, it is spooky.  </P> <P> So what you are talking about -- crime and homelessness -- is part of a huge  social problem. And that is just as much a problem, it seems to me, for the  suburban shopping malls as anywhere else.  </P></p>

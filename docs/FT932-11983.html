			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Privatisations bill set for programme MEASURES TO streamline the process of giving parliamentary approval to future privatisations are likely to be included in next year's legislative programme. The government is planning to incorporate a measure making it unnecessary to enact specific paving bills giving ministers the power to sell individual government-owned entities. Senior ministers are expected to finalise next week their decision on which bills are to be put forward in the parliamentary session beginning in November. Deregulation, law and order, and improvements in public services have emerged as the main themes of the programme, which was discussed by the cabinet yesterday following a presentation from Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader. It is so far unclear whether the privatisation measure is to come to the House as a stand-alone bill or take the form of additional clauses 'piggy-backing' on another bill going through parliament. One candidate for such an approach would be a general deregulation bill put forward by the Department of Trade and Industry. One minister said yesterday he would be 'astonished' if the privatisation measure was not included in one form or another. The deregulation theme is also expected to feature in the deregulation of London buses and changes to the law on Sunday trading. A criminal justice bill, a police bill, and action to curb new age travellers will underline the government's commitment to regaining the initiative on law and order. Further action on improving the efficiency and quality of public services will be shown by, for example, measures such as the bill setting up the environmental protection agency, and re-organising local government in Wales. The fate of the legislation needed to equalise the pension age still hangs in the balance, with ministers divided on whether to move ahead with the plans in spite of their probable unpopularity, or to delay the controversial move until the following year. The programme may well not contain as many bills as other parliamentary sessions, but will involve a high proportion of substantial measures. The government has not required paving legislation to carry out every privatisation in the last 14 years, but a bill was enacted earlier this year covering both British Coal and British Rail. Among the principal prospective sell-offs to be affected if current proposals are included in the legislative timetable could be the Post Office. The government recently decided to delay that sale until the 1994-95 session at the earliest.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Move to oil wheels of single market BRITAIN will try today to accelerate plans to make the single European market, due to come into force next January 1, both efficient and user-friendly. At today's meeting of internal market ministers, Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister responsible for the internal market, will present his counterparts with a series of ideas, including calls for: Commission proposals to ensure the smooth running of the market; regular reports on implementation, which might embarrass laggard member states into turning EC legislation into national law; greater transparency, and an improved contacts between EC members to deal with complaints and problems. Britain, the current Community president, will also suggest that an analysis of the effectiveness of the internal market should be carried out in 1996. British officials yesterday described it as 'a Cecchini report Mark Two' - a reference to the 1988 analysis of the benefits of market integration which helped underpin the Commission's single market proposals. Some countries (said to include Spain and Italy) believe it may be too early to make such plans while member states and Brussels are still discussing subsidiarity, the principle that EC decisions should be taken at the lowest appropriate level. The resolutions are supposed to be complementary to the recent Sutherland report on implementation, which recommended improvements to consumer rights, streamlining of EC law and enforcement of directives through national courts. A fuller response to that report will be made in the first half of 1993. Mr Peter Sutherland, the ex-commissioner who chaired the report committee, is among many who fear that a strong and fair internal market will be undermined if member states use the pretext of subsidiarity to assert their own national interests over those of the Community. Ministers will also try to reach agreement today on two long-awaited and much-debated measures which will allow cross-border movement of cultural goods, and the free movement of pharmaceuticals.</p>

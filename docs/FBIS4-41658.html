			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Savchenko] </F>   [Excerpts] Anatoliy Borisovich, professor Belkin has  recently published interesting figures. He says more or less  the following. Privatization and combating inflation are all in  vain. Nothing will come out of it. Why? Because we have  excessive military expenditure. Because in the economic respect  we are in a state of war. A country can afford such an amount  on military expenditure only when it is in a state of war.  Indeed, more than 40 trillion rubles. [passage omitted] The  question arises: what does the government think?    [Chubays] Let us look at the factual side of what you have  just said. Indeed, the share of the military expenditure in the  budget which has been approved is very high. The figure you  have just mentioned is correct--more than 40 trillion rubles.  With the budget's revenue of 120 trillion rubles, this is  indeed a huge portion. Nevertheless, one should understand  where it comes from. Where does our present army and our  gigantic expenditure on it come from? In fact, we have  inherited almost all of the former Soviet army of the Soviet  Union that, as one knows, was in confrontation with nearly the  whole world.    [Correspondent] It seems we have inherited the Brezhnev  stagnation.    [Chubays] Exactly. It is the case when we have to finance  the army we had in the past although today we simply do not need  such a big army either from the political, economic, or  financial viewpoint. But can one resolve this problem just like  that, in one go? Can one half the expenditure on the army as  soon as from tomorrow? What is the army? The army consists of  human beings, soldiers and officers who are returning from  Germany and the Baltic's. They are returning to Russia where  they do not have either accommodation or work, or real income,  or savings they can live on.    [Correspondent] But under the present state of the economy,  I  mean the present military expenditure, they will never have  highly-paid jobs or accommodation?    [Chubays] Are you suggesting that we should tell them to  leave the army, that we should say goodbye to them for the time  being while we are improving the economy. Perhaps in two or  three years we would succeed and then they could have a good  life. No, this is not the way. Here, indeed, I agree with  Belkin that the situation must be radically changed. It's the  simple truth. But one cannot change the situation simply by  reducing the expenditure, that's the point. The situation could  be changed through a very profound reform in the army. We  should reform the mechanism itself. Yegor Gaydar said very well  at the recent congress of Russia's Choice that one cannot bring  down the number of soldiers to the number of generals. The  number of generals should be brought in accordance with the  number of soldiers. This means that a profound army reform is  needed which would essentially mean a reduction in the numerical  strength and an improvement in the financing of those who are in  the army.    [Savchenko] But that is as far as the army is concerned.  After all, our legendary military spending is the legacy, among  other things, of our famous military industry, which in peace  time was 70 percent of our whole industry. Now it constitutes  perhaps 60 or 65 percent?    [Chubays] You are wrong. It comprise just about 15 percent  of all industry. Here are some concrete figures for you. In  the first six months of 1994 spending on the purchase of  military hardware for our military and industrial complex has  been cut by 60 percent. Incidentally, we say today that 1994 is  marked by decline. I can assure you that nearly 50 percent of  this decline can be accounted for directly by the cuts in  government spending on the purchase of equipment and military  hardware. That is the most that one could have done in that  respect. That this process cannot be continued on the same  scale is another matter because a living enterprise, millions of  people working there, and a whole range of social problems are  at stake. This aspect of the problem can be resolved not just  through paying less but through profound reform of the actual  economic mechanism. Then a tank factory will not have to close  down but will be able to change over to the production of things  which people need.    [Savchenko] Incidentally, has privatization helped this  process?    [Chubays] Undoubtedly. Here is a living example. Take for  instance my native St. Petersburg and its LOMO enterprise, the  Leningrad Lenin optico-mechanical association. This is a very  famous company. Its output used to be solely military. It is  now in a most difficult situation because of spending cuts in  the military industry. Fourteen thousand people used to work  there. Now just 11,000 are employed there. No doubt there will  be further cuts. This very plant, having carried out  privatization--not without its own battles incidentally--certain  structures put up very tough resistance. Nevertheless, it was  privatized with our support, and it became a joint stock  company. It has begun the process we have just been talking  about. It was not just a matter of becoming a joint stock  company. The organization had to elaborate an in-depth plan for  the restructuring of all production relations. It had to  provide for a change in the nature of the output, and carry out  a study of the existing market, a transition to the production  of a new type of output, a restructuring of the internal  production structure, a change in the structure of the  administration of the enterprise, and finally staff cuts.    So, what is now happening at the LOMO. Two figures can  characterize it: the LOMO share price--that is the price written  on the share certificate--is 500 rubles, yet the market price of  the LOMO shares is now 75,000 rubles. Among the LOMO's share  holders are the world's major companies with names known  worldwide, such as Credit Suisse [word indistinct] Boston and  others which can see that following the restructuring, the LOMO  has an enormous potential in the next tens and even hundreds of  years. That is thanks only to the fact that a little while  back, the LOMO opted for privatization which opened up all these  opportunities.    [Savchenko] Anatoliy Borisovich, will we be able to hope  that  next year military spending will be reduced.    [Chubays] I think that the volume of military spending will  be cut next year, but the beginning of a real army reform--it  cannot be postponed for years any longer--is a prerequisite for  this. The reform must be started this year so that we could  make our army cuts next year.</p>

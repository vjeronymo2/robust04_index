			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (13): Focus on food processing - Christopher Bobinski discusses the role of the Agro-Industrial Bank The Agro-Industrial Bank is Poland's newest bank and Mr Dariusz Ledworowski, the former foreign trade minister who runs it, is confident about its future. 'We're starting after all the others, so we won't be repeating their mistakes and we have qualified staff. All our credit officers have at least three years' experience, and no more than five,' he says. That means none is influenced by socialist-style banking. The bank has been helped by the toughness of the central bank's supervisory regime. 'Slightly to our surprise they really came in and checked out the qualifications of our staff,' Mr Ledworowski says. The bank opened in February and iscapitalised at a modest 170bn zlotys (Dollars 7.7m). Part of the capital comes from the funds earned from sales of European Community food aid in 1990, and part from the US Congress-funded Polish American Enterprise Fund which has 20 per cent of the equity. The EC-funded Counterpart Fund owns 46 per cent. Various farm-related state agencies are the remaining shareholders. The shareholders reflect the bank's specialisation - the financing of medium-sized food processing businesses - rather than farming itself. 'The European Community, which had to give the go-ahead for aid funds to be put into the bank, liked that idea,' Mr Ledworowski says. He hopes to lend 150bn zlotys by the end of this year. Later, the bank intends to raise new capital, by bringing in private shareholders, and also to develop an investment banking arm to establish an equity fund for privatisations. Other specialised activities will include channelling EC aid for the financing of rural gasification and telephone projects and loans to managers who have leased former state farms. At present the new bank provides little competitive challenge to the huge Food Economy Bank (BGZ), which is closely linked to the ruling Peasants party and has received a capital injection of more than 3,000bn zlotys from the state. The BGZ was the main source of finance for the farming sector and the agricultural machinery industry in the past, along with a mass of mostly weak and undercapitalised rural co-operative banks. But the new bank is targeting the most forward-looking parts of the country's developing agro business which offers the best opportunity for adding value to Poland's farm output.</p>

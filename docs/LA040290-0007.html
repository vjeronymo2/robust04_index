			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL RACE, $47-MILLION BOND MEASURE TOP LANCASTER BALLOT;  </P> <P> ELECTION: GROWTH AND CRIME ARE KEY ISSUES AS ONE INCUMBENT AND 15 OTHER  CANDIDATES VIE FOR THREE CITY COUNCIL SEATS IN THE APRIL 10 VOTE.  </P> <P> The crowded campaign for three Lancaster City Council seats enters the final  stretch this week, with candidates focusing on management of the city's rapid  growth, reduction of conflict on the City Council and the fight against crime.  </P> <P> The decision by two incumbents -- Mayor Lynn Harrison and Councilman Els Groves  -- not to seek reelection left a wide-open race for two of the three council  seats on the April 10 ballot, while incumbent Arnie Rodio is campaigning for  reelection to the third seat, which he has held since 1986. There are 16  candidates for the seats, many of whom are well-known in the community.  </P> <P> Many candidates concur on how to address the basic challenges confronting  Lancaster, a city whose population jumped by nearly 10,000 to an estimated  90,000 residents in the last year alone. They call for the creation of more  jobs to reduce the number of residents who must commute to jobs "down below,"  the term residents use to describe areas of Los Angeles County south of the  Antelope Valley. An estimated 40,000 area residents are commuters.  </P> <P> Crime, particularly gang and drug activity, has been an increasingly  high-profile issue in the Antelope Valley as urbanization alarms residents who  once considered the city an exurban refuge, and anti-crime measures have been a  familiar refrain among the candidates.  </P> <P> In addition to conflict on the streets, conflict in the City Council chambers  has been a campaign topic. There have been occasional bitter political and  personal confrontations among council members, and candidates have called for  an end to the acrimony.  </P> <P> Although many candidates say the Antelope Valley's population and construction  boom has strained roads, the water supply, schools and other infrastructure,  only a few describe themselves as favoring slow growth. Instead, the majority  stress the importance of managing growth.  </P> <P> Among the latter is Jack Abney, 63, who wants to retain a "country atmosphere"  in Lancaster. Abney works as a property manager for a real estate firm. He has  stressed the importance of protecting Edwards Air Force Base and Air Force  Plant 42, two of the region's biggest employers, from urban encroachment. He  also called for a program to attract clean industry to the city.  </P> <P> Sandra Bateman, 42, is another advocate of "planned growth." She runs a  financial planning business and calls for council members to stop fighting.  Reducing the commuter population will have a positive impact on youth-related  problems such as gangs, Bateman said, because parents will be closer to their  children.  </P> <P> Carl (Duke) Bloom, 59, said that Lancaster is "the last frontier" for young  home buyers, and that new development will bring schools and parks paid for by  developers. Bloom, who owns an appliance store, said he wants to preserve the  competitiveness of small businesses as big commercial centers proliferate.  </P> <P> The Rev. Henry (Hank) Hearns, 56, was chief environmental engineer at Edwards  Air Force Base until his retirement in December. He serves as pastor of the  First Missionary Baptist Church in Littlerock.  </P> <P> Martha Hughes, an insurance agent, said she wants the city to televise City  Council meetings on local cable channels to increase awareness of government  business among residents. She described herself as an advocate of controlled  growth and said more must be done to combat gang members.  </P> <P> Thomas Lacey, 61, said he wants to "save the city of Lancaster from builders,  real estate dealers and developers who want to overdevelop the city." Lacey, a  retired aerospace quality-control consultant, also wants to create a city  police department to replace the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Jeff J. Murray, 21, is a deliveryman for a pizza restaurant and a political  science student at Cal State Northridge. He said he sees his candidacy as the  start of a political career.  </P> <P> Ray Peeler, 56, a retired landlord, wants to curtail the spread of high-density  housing in Lancaster. He opposes recent development near Plant 42, which was  also opposed by Air Force officials, who said the proximity of the housing  would lead to conflicts over aircraft noise.  </P> <P> Professional tennis umpire Claude (Rocky) Pickering, 63, says he will use his  experience as a professional labor arbitrator to end conflict on the City  Council. He also believes that council members should not double as members of  the Redevelopment Agency and pledges to appoint a representative to that agency  in his place.  </P> <P> Frank Roberts, 58, is dean of technical education at Antelope Valley College  and serves on local committees working to bring a state university to the area  and to block a planned state prison in Lancaster. He believes that a spectrum  of community groups should be involved in preparation of the city's General  Plan.  </P> <P> Rodio, 61, is a plumbing contractor and has been on the council longer than the  either of the other council members. He urged voters to retain him because of  that experience. He also said the council has done a good job, saying, "If you  slow down development, you are putting your head in the sand."  </P> <P> George Root, 59, an administrator for an Edwards Air Force Base research  facility, is a leader of mobile home residents. He calls for new schools,  improved streets and "planned growth" that would involve strict adherence to  the General Plan.  </P> <P> Michael Singer, 36, a Los Angeles County Fire Department captain, made news  when he was forced off the ballot over a residency dispute, but has since  qualified as a Lancaster resident and started a write-in campaign. He said he  speaks for residents concerned that development will destroy their quality of  life.  </P> <P> June Snow, a 43-year-old hospital administrator, said development is slowing  down on its own and that the council must better plan all the facets of the  community affected by growth, including recreation and education.  </P> <P> Freddie Steese, 74, is a retired engineer. He espouses a hard-line anti-crime  stance, calling for an auxiliary police force and for treating drug dealing to  minors as "premeditated attempted murder."  </P> <P> Anthony E. Tsaousis, 46, manages an architectural firm. He says one of his  priorities is ensuring that the high desert has a viable water supply. He calls  for new water conservation measures.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Rodionov report: "Transfer Ruble Equated to Dollar </F> Retrospectively. Russia To Pay Czech Republic 3.5 Billion By  2003"]    [Excerpts] Moscow and Prague have reached agreement on the  terms of the repayment of the Russian debts built up in the last  years of the USSR's existence and inherited by Russia. [passage  omitted]    Russian Foreign Ministry circles are noting that this  agreement is the result of a compromise brought about by the  recent talks between [Czech premier] Klaus and Viktor  Chernomyrdin. It makes it possible to galvanize Russo-Czech  economic (and not only economic) ties -- something that both  sides are interested in. For Prague in particular it is  important, in comparison with Bratislava, to make up some ground  in its Ostpolitik.    The agreement between the Czech Republic and Russia may help  to resolve the difficult problem of mutual financial claims  between Russia and Poland and between Russian and Bulgaria. In  these two cases it is a question both of the former USSR's debts  to its partners, and of debts on the part of the partners  themselves. And Moscow's dollar loans were kept secret. In the  case of Poland, certain specialists believe, the zero option of  a mutual write-off of the debt is possible.    The extent to which it is necessary to dump the ballast of  the past in favor of wide-ranging trading relations is shown by  the example of Budapest. Hungary was the first of the former  CEMA countries to settle the Soviet debt problem, accepting  MiG-29 fighters and other military equipment as payment. In  lieu of the outstanding sum -- $900 million -- the Hungarians  intend to take part in the privatization of the Russian oil and  gas complex and other enterprises. The agreement has cleared  the way for the gradual restoration of trade and industrial  ties, and Hungary now occupies first place in trade with Russia  among all the former Soviet CEMA partners.</p>

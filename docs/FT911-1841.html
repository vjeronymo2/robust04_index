			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Sale could raise over CDollars 1bn CANADA'S Reichmann family, which controls large property and natural resources investments, could raise more than CDollars 1bn (USDollars 860m) from the sale of energy-related companies. A court ruling earlier this week allows the division of the Calgary-based Interhome Energy into two parts - Home Oil, an oil and gas producer, and Interprovincial Pipe Line, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator. Both companies are controlled by GW Utilities, in which the Reichmanns have an 89 per cent stake. GWU said it has been approached by potential buyers for its shares in both Home and Interprovincial. But Mr Jim Doak, analyst at First Marathon Securities, said that the sale of Home will be complicated by its debt load.</p>

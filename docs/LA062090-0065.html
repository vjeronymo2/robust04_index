			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED IN 1982 DRUNK-DRIVING DEATHS  </P> <P> A man who eluded police for eight years after causing a 1982 crash in Reseda  that killed two women pleaded no contest Tuesday to manslaughter, drunk driving  and other charges and agreed to a prison sentence of three years and eight  months.  </P> <P> Ruben Perez Lemon, 28, of Woodland Hills, entered the plea after prosecutors  said they would not seek the maximum sentence for the charges -- four years and  four months in prison.  </P> <P> Sentencing is scheduled for July 12 in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Ruth Hanzlik of Granada Hills, the mother of one of the women killed, fought  successfully after her daughter's death for tougher sentences for convicted  drunk drivers. But the new sentences do not apply to Lemon because the crash  occurred before they went into effect.  </P></p>

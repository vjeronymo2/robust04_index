			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Property Market: New lease of life in landlord-tenant fight The relationship between landlords and tenants in the UK is being strained to breaking point. At a time of recession, the workings of the institutional lease - 25-year leases with upwards-only rent reviews - is seen as unfair, archaic and inflationary by tenants throughout England and Wales. Now the gauntlet has been thrown down by tenants. Businesses have been encouraged by the glut of empty commercial space and their own recession-induced financial pressures to challenge the system openly. The landlords are defending a leasehold structure that provides secure flow of income, thus underpinning the value of property and so the finances of institutions, property companies and banks which lend to the sector. Critics argue that the existing system damages the economy by allowing landlords to profit at the expense of tenants, many of whom are already struggling under the burden of recession. 'Landlords continue to make money in a recession and in doing so they serve to deepen the recession,' says Mr Giles Henschel of the Covent Garden Business Group, which represents local businesses. Some economists believe that the institutional lease distorts the letting market in the way that unions are seen to distort the labour market. Lettings on new leases, which account for just 4 per cent of the market, are the only part of the system that function smoothly. According to Professor John Burton of the European Business School, rents are dictated by legal and institutional factors, making them 'impervious to market forces'. This 'constitutes a 'core' inflation problem for the British economy as a whole,' he says. But the debate about leases goes beyond academic concern. For the structure of leases is having a critical impact on many businesses. Last month, Tandy, a multiple retailer, closed down a profitable store in Chatham, Kent, because it could not reach agreement on the lease. 'We are making a stand,' says Mr Barry Liddle, chief executive of Tandy. 'If we have to lose 30 or 40 stores I am willing to do that. If not, nothing will change.' Tenants are demanding the following changes: An end to 25-year leases. Criticism of such long leases was recently voiced by Mr Andrew Buxton, chief executive of Barclays, which rents a large amount of property across the UK. 'Twenty-five years leases are required for financing purposes or perhaps to satisfy the institutional desire for long investments, but how many businesses plan 25 years ahead?' he asked. 'At the moment it is a classic case of industry satisfaction and institutional desire being put before the customer. Very few other industries can take such a complacent attitude,' he adds. An end to upwards-only clauses in rent reviews. Tenants argue that the upwards-only ratchet is inflationary and unfair to tenants at a time when rents should be falling. Boots, the chemist, recently won a court battle over its refusal to accept an upwards-only review on a retail property in London centre. An end of privity of contract, which allows landlords to claim unpaid rent from previous tenants. The controversy about tenants' continuing liability has come to a head over the past year as unexpected bills for rent due on former premises have pushed many struggling companies into receivership. The case for reform has been promoted by Sir John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'Small businesses are being forced into bankruptcy through no fault of their own,' he says. A change in the way rent reviews are determined. Critics say that reviews are often unreasonable because they ignore vacant property, the state of the economy and the ability of tenants to pay. Professor Burton believes that rent review disputes should be resolved by the Lands Tribunal, with members drawn from both sides of the commercial property leasing market. Mr Henschel of Covent Garden Business Group dislikes this system because decisions are made at arbitration by surveyors, who may have a tendency to favour landlords. 'No surveyor will put his neck on the line because future business depends on his ruling. I would like to see a parliamentary review of the whole system,' he says. An end to confidentiality clauses. If rents are to be set according to recent deals in a particular area, there should be greater openness about those deals, perhaps through a national rent register. 'Confidentiality clauses inflate market levels,' says Mr Henschel. Some aspects of the commercial property lease are likely to yield under this pressure. The Lord Chancellor, for example, is expected to recommend a change in the law on privity of contract. Tenants would no longer be responsible for the rent owed by their successors for the duration of the 25-year lease; instead they would guarantee only their immediate successor. The proposals would probably only apply to leases that were assigned after the legislation came into force. 'This is in the spirit of a good British compromise,' says solicitor Mr Steven Fogel of Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb, who was on the Law Commission's working party which recommended a change in the law. Bankers are concerned, however, that a change would make property finance, which relies heavily on the quality of a tenant's covenant, even more difficult to secure. Market pressures alone are forcing some landlords to accept shorter leases and break clauses in heavily over-supplied markets such as the City of London. Some institutions make a virtue out of necessity when accepting a 15-year lease on the grounds that a building often needs refurbishment by that stage anyway. But most property owners are uneasy about changes to the lease structure. They fear that yields would be pushed up to compensate for the diminished security of income, with severe effects on the property industry and banks. The Prudential, one of the largest UK landlords, will fight any changes to the 25-year lease, says its chief executive Mr Hugh Jenkins. 'Only as a last resort would we give up long-held terms of trade. In this market we would rather let the rents take the strain than start monkeying around with lease structures,' he said. Landlords argue that tenants should take the rough with the smooth, having enjoyed the benefits of a system that gave them artificially low rents during much of the 1980s and the rights to assign their leases at large premiums. They believe that tenants will stop clamouring for change once an economic recovery gets under way. 'During the 1980s a lot of tenants made a fortune from selling their leases,' says Mr Peter Hunt, chairman of Land Securities, the UK's biggest property company. The abolition of privity of contract and upwards-only review clauses would be a setback to the industry and ultimately the economy as a whole, adds Mr Hunt. If such changes took place, pension funds would be less likely to invest in property with the result that yields would rise, new developments would be constrained and ultimately rents would go up. The counter-argument is that the rigid institutional lease has inflicted damage on tenants and the economy and, in the end, on the property market itself. Tenants have been put under extra pressure to the point where they have been put out of business. Long leases have made landlords complacent and neglectful of their customers. Lease inflexibility at a time of falling rents has prevented tenants from assigning their old leases and so created a huge oversupply of new buildings in areas such as central London. Apart from the changes concerning privity of contracts, these arguments are ultimately likely to be settled by the relative strengths of landlords and tenants. The optimists say that the concessions wrested by tenants will only last for as long as property is in oversupply. Tenants, however, are determined to cling onto any gains they make. They are not merely seeking short-term advantage; they wish to change the industry for good.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                             TOTAL RETURN (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------------                      Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to April 92      6.3      -6.4       8.4           1.8 Quarter to April 92   1.6      -1.8       0.6           0.1 Month of April 92     0.5      -0.3       0.3           0.2  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment Property Databank  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

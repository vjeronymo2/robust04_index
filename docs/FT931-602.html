			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Move to impeach Yeltsin defeated in Congress: Moscow rally of 60,000 supports president - Deputies fail to unseat Khasbulatov MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, faces a further struggle with conservative deputies even though they failed to muster enough votes in parliament yesterday to impeach him. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, heralded more conflict between the two rival power centres in Moscow after he, too, survived a confidence vote by deputies. In another day of turmoil and demonstrations, the Congress of People's Deputies cast 617 votes in favour of impeaching Mr Yeltsin, short of the 689, or two-thirds, needed to oust him from office. After some deputies rounded on Mr Khasbulatov, 339 deputies voted to dismiss him as speaker but this was well below the 517, or simple majority, needed. With the political tussle between president and deputies left unresolved, Mr Khasbulatov signalled more manoeuvring when he pointed out that Congress had balked at impeaching Mr Yeltsin by a small margin. The Congress is likely to continue its work today and further efforts may be made to limit Mr Yeltsin's powers or even to strip him of the presidency by other means. The surprise attempt to remove both men yesterday was a furious reaction to an overnight compromise agreement by the two arch-rivals. Under their pact, Mr Yeltsin would have dropped his plebiscite set for April 25, the Congress would have been abolished, and early elections would have been called for president and a smaller legislature. The vote against Mr Yeltsin's impeachment appears to mean he retains the special powers he declared for himself last week. Under these powers, his decrees and instructions can be challenged only by the Constitutional Court and not by parliament. Mr Yeltsin drew strength from a rally of about 60,000 supporters, who gathered behind St Basil's Cathedral, just outside the walls of the Kremlin. Before the vote, he told the crowd he would not 'submit' to any decision of Congress to impeach him. After winning the vote, he said: 'A communist coup has failed. The people have won.' The rally, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, Mr Genady Burbulis, the former presidential aide and others, heard Mr Gavril Popov, leader of the Movement for Democratic Reform, say that: 'We're living badly because we're conducting the reforms badly. They're trying to turn out the president because he wants to deepen the reforms - but the people won't let them.' A rival gathering of some 10,000 nationalists and communists rallied on the Manezh Square to hear a succession of calls for Mr Yeltsin's impeachment. In contrast to the pro-Yeltsin rally, this was heavily policed, with mounted militia, armoured cars and water cannons ringing the group. It is the first Congress for more than a year from which Mr Yeltsin has emerged strengthened. But on Saturday he had used his proposed plebiscite - about trust in the president - as a bargaining chip: he offered to cancel it in exchange for an election in November for president and a new two-tier parliament. However, deputies rejected this compromise before proceeding to vote themselves the right to ballot on the future of both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov. The speaker, who had made several dramatic turnabouts in the past few days, aroused the ire of many deputies who, according to one, had 'grown plain sick of him'. Several dangerous elements remain: President and parliament are now more bitterly opposed than ever. Deprived of the opportunity to impeach him by parliamentary means, hardline opponents will be tempted increasingly to turn to extra-parliamentary protest. The Congress passed a resolution to take control of TV and radio, demanding the right to appoint supervising committees over all stations with the right of appointment of chairmen and of interference in programmes. Mr Yeltsin's main argument for his actions, underscored on Saturday by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is the 'catastrophic' state of the economy and the need for rapid action. But this action will weaken his still-impressive popularity and give extra support to his opponents. The president will be tempted, in the period to the April 25 plebiscite, to pass measures that will increase support in him by paying out extra benefits.

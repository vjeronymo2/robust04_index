			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: SBC forecasts 20% advance in net income for full year SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC), the country's third-largest bank, said operating income in the first nine months of 1993 was 'substantially ahead' of that in the same period last year. No figures were given. Mr Georges Blum, chief executive, said business continued to be strong in October. He anticipated a 20 per cent rise in net income in the full year against last year's SFr1.01bn (Dollars 673m), in spite of continuing high provisions for bad loans. The forecast appears modest considering the bank doubled net income, to SFr719m, in the first half, and in comparison to the much higher growth rates anticipated at rivals Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse. However, SBC's full-year 1992 net income was boosted substantially by a SFr255m extraordinary profit on the sale of an Austrian electricity utility. Mr Blum also announced a reorganisation of the bank's senior management and a restructuring of its Swiss branch network. Competition in Swiss retail banking has intensified since Credit Suisse acquired Swiss Volksbank last spring. Mr Blum said SBC, which has been pushed into third place by the Credit Suisse deal, aimed to gain market share and to cut costs by about SFr100m a year through the restructuring. SBC said the most important factor in its strong third-quarter performance was the buoyancy of international stock markets. Consolidated revenues from financial and trading operations in the first three quarters more than doubled, due mainly to active securities trading and the rapidly-expanding volume of interest-rate derivatives. On the other hand, revenues from foreign exchange trading dropped following the widening of the fluctuation margins within the European Monetary System in August. Net commission income improved substantially, with strong growth in earnings from brokerage and syndications, as well as in administration and custodian fees. Net interest income remained disappointing. Total assets of the parent company at the end of September stood at SFr175.9bn, 1.5 per cent lower than at the end of June. Loans outstanding dropped 2.9 per cent during the quarter to SFr102.8bn, but securities holdings jumped 23.3 per cent to SFr20.8bn.</p>

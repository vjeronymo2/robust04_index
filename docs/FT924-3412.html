			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Cowie swaps merchant banks T COWIE, the motor group, has replaced its merchant bank, Noble Grossart, appointing NM Rothschild. Noble Grossart came in for criticism when Cowie's Pounds 32m bid for Henlys Group failed in September. The appointment of a new merchant bank suggests Cowie intends to pursue expansion by acquisition. During the bid for Henlys, Cowie was asked by the Takeover Panel to make a number of corrections and clarifications to statements made about its offer. Cowie is not changing its broking and legal advisers. At the time, observers felt that Noble Grossart, which is based in Edinburgh, was not sufficiently experienced in hostile takeover battles. Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said that Rothschild had been selected from a shortlist of five merchant banks, and the final choice had been a matter of personal chemistry between the company and the bank. He said that Rothschilds' 'extensive experience will help Cowie substantially in the evaluation of strategic acquisition and development opportunities in Britain and mainland Europe.' Cowie is keen to expand its vehicle leasing business into Europe where the industry is not as well developed. It is the market leader in the UK. Stockbrokers also believe Cowie could bid for Henlys again, once a year has passed from the lapsing of its original bid, or earlier if another company bids first. Cowie retains a 9.9 per cent stake in Henlys, bought at about 73p a share. This stake will be written down in Cowie's 1992 accounts, unless Henlys shares rise from yesterday's close at 67p. Cowie's shares rose 2p to 142p yesterday. Analysts have cut profit forecasts for Cowie's profits this year from Pounds 25m, expected in the summer, to about Pounds 23m pre-tax compared to Pounds 18.2m in 1991.</p>

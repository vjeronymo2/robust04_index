			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (11): Ammunition for scaremongers - Doomsday scenario watching has become a US preoccupation Inhabitants of the Kanawha valley in West Virginia were treated to a doomsday scenario this month. This valley, running east from Charleston into the foothills of the Appalachians, houses chemicals plants run by no fewer than 12 different companies. In an exercise that will eventually be repeated throughout the US, the managers of those plants talked publicly about what could happen if their safety procedures went badly wrong. Until now, chemical companies have been understandably reluctant to discuss potential disasters with their local communities. 'It is the moral equivalent of Bhopal: they know what could happen, and they're not telling us,' says Fred Millar, a long-time activist and former director of the Friends of the Earth toxics project. But the publication of 'worst-case scenarios' - projections of the damage that would be caused by the worst possible accidents at chemical plants - will be forced in the coming years. The US Environmental Protection Agency, under the provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990, is currently drafting rules on what should be disclosed, and how. The Kanawha exercise marked an early experiment by the chemicals industry: the companies involved wanted to act first, using their own definitions of what amounts to a 'worst-case scenario'. When widely published around the country, the information will provide plenty of ammunition for scare-mongers - including those legislators in Washington DC who want tougher environmental controls on the chemicals industry. For instance, chlorine used for water treatment in the nation's capital could, based on a worst-case assessment, create a poisonous cloud enveloping a large part of the city, including the President's home. 'Even the White House is not immune. The data is going to scare a lot of people,' says Mr Joe Mayhew, vice president for the environment and policy analysis at the Chemical Manufacturers' Association. The attention likely to be given to this information, when published, indicates how much further the chemicals industry still has to go to win over public confidence in the US. A survey conducted for the CMA two years ago revealed how low the public's esteem for the industry was, and - despite an extensive public relations effort - things have barely changed. The industry's approval rating 'probably hasn't improved a lot,' says Darwin Wike, head of corporate environmental stewardship at Du Pont. Mr Mayhew at the CMA agrees, though he puts it less pessimisticly: 'It's not getting any worse.' The Clean Air Act's requirement for companies to reveal the potential damage their chemicals could cause signals the direction in which regulation of the industry is moving. Until now, it has focused on emissions of waste by chemicals companies, with the EPA producing lists of polluters and their discharges. In future, attention is likely to be directed more towards the actual (and potential) harm to public health and the environment, and towards the use (rather than just the disposal) of chemicals. The industry plans to stress the low probability of major accidents occurring. However, the pressure of public opinion will almost certainly have an effect, for instance by encouraging companies to review their arrangements for storing their most hazardous materials. Campaigners want companies to go further. They should, says Millar, publish the results of safety audits and details of how much insurance they have (if companies carry insurance to cover most of the costs of a disaster, he argues, they have less incentive to prevent it happening). There is also growing pressure for more information about how chemicals are being used. At present, the state of New Jersey is alone in collecting detailed information in this area. Federal regulation is skimpy: under the Toxicity Control Act, big users of chemicals are subject to a report once every two years on the volumes of chemicals they use. In future, that could be extended, forcing more frequent reporting and more detailed information - including, for instance, the extent to which the chemicals are recycled. This data, ironically, could end up being of use mainly to chemical companies. They are already the biggest users of the EPA's data on toxic releases, says Mr Mayhew - such information provides important clues about what competitors are doing. Detailed information about what materials the chemicals companies are using would go further still. While regulation looks set increasingly to add to the costs and reduce the flexibility of the chemicals industry, it has at least one thing to cheer about on the environmental front. The proposed reform of the Superfund legislation, governing the clean-up of hazardous waste, would reduce the legal wrangling over who should shoulder the costs on particular sites. The result would be lower legal bills - one of the biggest costs in the clean-up process. Chemicals companies, meanwhile, are also finding more efficient ways to spend the money they set aside for environmental purposes. The danger, says Mr Wike at Du Pont, is that the easiest and most effective programmes are the first to be adopted, and that smaller and smaller gains are made with each additional step: 'You get 80 per cent of the reduction with the first 20 per cent of spending.' One way of improving the impact of environmental spending has been to shift attention from the treatment of waste, for instance with incinerators or water treatment plants, to a search for ways to reduce waste in the first place. Companies have also become more efficient at setting targets for their emissions. Du Pont, for instance, used to impose waste reductions targets on its operating units: now, it is switching more of the initiative to plant managers, asking them to come up with their own proposals first. Managers closer to the operations should be better positioned to propose the environmental programmes which have the biggest impact for the least cost at their plants. The industry is also hoping that the EPA will countenance more voluntary waste reduction programmes, rather than enforced ones. Its so-called '33/50' programme, which set stepped targets for reduction of certain emissions by first a third and then a half, is a model which many in the industry would like to see repeated. Despite these initiatives, the rulebooks keep getting thicker. The EPA is about to add more than 300 additional chemicals to the list of those whose output has to be measured. Under the Clean Air Act, tighter permit regulations will shortly make it difficult for virtually any changes to be made to a chemicals plant without going through the entire approval process again, the industry complains. 'We're slowly falling behind the rest of the world in terms of developing new processes,' says Mr Wike.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Elf Aquitaine - Other companies The results of the public offer for shares in the French oil group are due to be announced this evening or tomorrow morning.  Analysts expect the issue, the largest so far in the government's ambitious privatisation programme, to be oversubscribed, and shares may be clawed back from the tranche allocated to institutional investors.  The price for institutions, also due to be announced at the beginning of this week, should be above the FFr385 paid by individuals.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Volvo and Renault in co-ordination plan VOLVO, the Swedish car maker, plans to co-ordinate component planning and product development with the French Renault group over the next 10 to 12 years, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm. The co-ordination programme is part of the alliance between Volvo and Renault. The programme, which covers production of light trucks as well as engines, gear boxes and other components, is expected to save Volvo between SKr350m (Dollars 60m) and SKr400m in 1992, Mr Christer Zetterberg, Volvo chief executive said. 'The earlier estimates of savings of SKr2bn a year from 1995 onwards through co-ordination with Renault have been adjusted upwards,' he said. He also confirmed that the cut in Volvo's workforce will total 11,000 employees by the end of 1992. To date, about 8,000 employees have been made redundant since 1990, with 7,000 job losses in Sweden and 1,000 abroad. 'The majority of the 3,000 redundancies in 1992 will occur abroad,' he said. He emphasised the reductions in 1992 are the consequence of earlier measures and did not represent new or additional redundancies. Volvo Personvagnar, the group's passenger vehicle unit in Sweden, said it would cut production of its 960 model by 2,000 cars in the spring.</p>

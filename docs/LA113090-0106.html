			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> IBM Joins European Research Project: Europe's semiconductor research project  JESSI opened its doors to a U.S. firm -- IBM Europe -- for the first time ever.  </P> <P> The Joint European Submicron Silicon group also agreed to formalize its ties to  the U.S. semiconductor research program, Sematech, it said in a statement  released in Munich, Germany. But JESSI plans to review the role of British  International Computers Ltd. following that company's takeover by Fujitsu Ltd.  of Japan. The move reflects a reluctance among some JESSI members to share  technology with the Japanese. The $5-billion, eight-year JESSI project was set  up in 1989 as part of the 19-nation Eureka high-technology research and  development program.  </P></p>

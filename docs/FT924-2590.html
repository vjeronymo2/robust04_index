			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Italo-American cinema scheme clarified FURTHER DETAILS have emerged about the ambitious Italo-American project for a new multi-screen cinema chain in Italy, amid clarification of some financial details. The news follows the signing in Rome last week of a letter of intent between Situr, the Italian property and entertainment concern, and UCI Europe, the cinema group owned by MCA Universal and Paramount of the US. Situr, which recently sealed a deal with the Standa retail group to develop new shopping centres in Italy, expects to invest between L250bn (Dollars 179m) and L300bn in a series of multi-screen cinemas, which could be developed alongside. The potential financial commitment by UCI Europe is unclear. UCI Europe, the first company to bring US-style multiplex cinemas to Europe, has already built up a substantial chain in the UK, with cinemas of up to 15 screens. Although Italy has one of Europe's biggest film production industries and is the home of some of the continent's most famous directors, recent years have seen the closure of many cinemas under the assault of television and video. Mr Luigi Clementi, Situr's managing director, said the planned venture with UCI represented a further step in the development of the group, which earlier this year opened the L150bn Mirabilandia theme park near Ravenna, Italy's biggest. The company, which controls the Valtur holiday villages chain, is also negotiating to buy CIT, the travel agency owned by Italy's state railways. CIT is the country's only chain of travel agents, and a successful acquisition would give Situr its first direct access to the retail travel market.</p>

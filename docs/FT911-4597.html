			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Power sale attracts 2m applicants ABOUT 2m people have reg-istered to receive application forms to buy shares in the two Scottish electricity companies to be privatised by the government at the end of May. The registration figure, similar to that achieved at this stage of the much larger flotation of the English and Welsh regional electricity companies, was disclosed yesterday, with details of incentives for people who buy shares. The breakdown of those registering from England, as opposed to Scotland, is not being announced. The May 30 flotation of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric is expected to raise between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn if, as expected, the government sells 100 per cent of the companies. Incentives and conditions for Scottish electricity customers who buy shares in their electricity companies are similar to those offered to the regional company customers. For a minimum investment of Pounds 250 with a first instalment of Pounds 100, customers can have Pounds 18 of vouchers to set against electricity bills, or one free bonus share for every 10 shares allocated, provided they hold the shares until June 1994. The first vouchers will be issued before Christmas, well before the second of the three instalments is payable in May 1992. The third instalment is due in April 1993. Non-customers will have to apply for a package of shares in the two companies and make a Pounds 750 minimum investment with a first instalment of Pounds 300. They will be offered a loyalty bonus of one share for every 20 shares, up to a maximum of 150 bonus shares, to be held until June 1994. The two companies are being floated simultaneously at the same offer price. Applicants for the package will be allocated shares in each on what is expected to be a ratio of about 2 1/2 shares in Scottish Pow-er to one in Hydro-Electric. Customers who apply for the package must make a Pounds 750 minimum investment with a first instalment of Pounds 300, and will be offered Pounds 18 worth of electricity vouchers for every 100 shares in their own company or a loyalty bonus of one share for 10. In the other company they are entitled to a one-for-20 loyalty bonus. The Pounds 750 minimum for non-customers and people applying for the package compares with the Pounds 525 minimum for the package of National Power and PowerGen, the generating companies floated in February.

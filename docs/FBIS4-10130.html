			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alberto Fujimori asked Congress on 24  March to expedite the debate and approval of the regulations on  the new electoral system established by the Constitution, as  well as the legislation that will regulate the 1995 general  elections.    "They will be regulations the government will support  because  they will come from an autonomous branch," said Fujimori, who  also noted the openness of the official bloc in gathering  suggestions presented by other political groups and unions.    He pointed out that debates and disagreements are always  good  because they lead to conclusions. This is why he believes the  debate on the electoral system is not tangled up in discussions.    Fujimori refrained from commenting on the request by some  congressmen and politicians that he leave the presidency six  months before next year's general elections if he decides to run  for reelection.    "Excuse me, I am abstaining from commenting on the electoral  issue for the time being," said Fujimori in answer to a reporter.    Regarding other issues, Fujimori announced that as of April  all public servants will get a salary increase and that the  increase will be higher for those working in health and  education.    He did not give a percentage because "it is still being  evaluated by the Economy and Finance Ministry."    The president made the announcement after admitting that  government salaries are very low.    He said: "There should not be any doubt that there is a  desire to increase the salaries not only of teachers but of all  public servants."    After dedicating seven new educational centers in northern  Lima, Fujimori confirmed his confidence in Peruvian Ambassador  to Ecuador Eduardo Ponce.    Fujimori said: "Peruvian relations with Ecuador are at the  best possible level, although there are some situations that can  be misinterpreted but which do not take away the merit of the  high level of trust between the two countries."    He added that relations are fluid because there is direct  communication between the two countries' foreign ministries.    He indicated that the friendship between the two peoples is  above any circumstantial situation.    He noted that the ambassadors are representatives of the  Peruvian Government and that "as long as they act in support of  those relations, I am sure there is no need for the government  to question their performance."    Fujimori then confirmed his confidence in Ambassador Eduardo  Ponce and disregarded reports that he would be called back to  our country.    He said: "I am sure Ecuadoran officials will have a spirit  of understanding in this situation."    Fujimori also expressed his disagreement with the idea that  part of the resources received from the privatization of public  companies be used to pay the foreign debt.    He said: "We don't want the resources from privatization to  be used for paying the foreign debt because we have much  infrastructure to be improved and medium- and long-term projects  to carry out." He said it is essential that those resources be  used in social projects.    Fujimori reiterated that it is expected that about $3  billion  will be received this year from the sale of public companies and  it will be essential for social investments.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (1): Facing up to a harsher world - After a decade of hectic development, growth of the property market's youngest sector has been badly stunted. While there are signs of a broadening interest in business parks, tenants are becoming more discriminating THE youngest sector of the UK property market is going through a baptism of fire. After being nurtured by the relaxed planning controls, buoyant demand and easy money of the second half of the 1980s, business parks have now stumbled into some of the harshest conditions for the property industry in living memory. The market still shows promise but its growth has been badly stunted. Gone are the careless days at the end of the 1980s, when business parks were planned at the rate of four a week, even though it would take 30 years to fill them all. Over the past year, developers have struggled to fill their buildings, while some who paid inflated prices for their land have gone bankrupt. Many of the planned developments will not be built, although plenty of new projects are in the pipeline. Last year nearly twice as many out-of-centre schemes were completed as in the year before, according to Applied Property Research (APR). This year it forecasts a 10 per cent drop in completions to 13.5m sq ft of completions, while next year it reckons that some 9.6m sq ft will be completed. While supply has been building up, the recession and the Gulf war have taken their toll on demand. Just over 10m sq ft was taken up last year, down 21 per cent on 1989. So far this year, 1.4m sq ft has been taken up, leading APR to estimate a total take-up of 9m sq ft for the year. The demand figures, although weak, suggest that business parks have managed to appeal to a broadening audience. Last year, the most enthusiastic newcomers to business parks were the telecommunication industry, government services - which are relocating out of London to reduce costs - insurance, electronics and computers. This year, food and drink industries are tipped to be important space takers. The result is that there are enough business parks to satisfy demand for 18 months and enough land with planning permission to last for decades, according to APR. However, the picture is clouded by large variations in quality and location. Agents report that choice is relatively limited in some regions and, moreover, that well-designed, well-located office parks are still attracting reasonable demand. For the best schemes, rents are rivalling, if not outstripping the city centres. That said, it is unquestionably a tenant's market and few places are entirely immune from the slump which dragged down overall office rents by about 7 per cent last year. As the property industry grapples with oversupply, the marketing advantages of business parks are being closely scrutinised by tenants offered cut-price rents to stay in town. The quality of the working environment and good car parking provisions is often bait enough for tenants used to cramped, congested city centres. However, Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks reckons that the problems of business parks have been underestimated by nearly everyone involved. 'Car parking and a better environment are not everything,' it says. 'Rural locations can mean isolation: poor public transport and back-up facilities, few neighbours and only a shallow pool of staff nearby.' Some of these criticisms are inescapable, but the business park industry would argue that its best schemes are trying to address some of the complaints. The evolution of business parks has been a rapid affair, producing a large discrepancy between the concept and quality of different schemes. The original goal of UK business parks, which were modelled on US schemes such as Silicon Valley in California, was to give industrial companies a new standard of space and environment. In reality, these turned out to be slightly more appealing than average industrial estates. High-tech developments were introduced in the early 1980s for computer-based industries that did not need or want to separate offices, production and warehouses. These second generation schemes were larger than their predecessors and more likely to be out-of-the-town centres and in the green belt. As most of these scheme were agreed outside the existing planning controls, there was an increasing demand to clarify the planning rules. In the 1985 White Paper, Lifting the Burden, the government said it would deregulate planning legislation and, as part of this process, review the Use Classes Order 1972 to cater for high-tech development. The resulting introduction of the new business activity use (B1) in 1987 had a decisive impact on the growth and nature of the business park market. Between 1979 and 1981, under 250,000 sq ft of space was completed on business parks, while between 1982 and 1986 the market grew gradually so that just under 3m sq ft of space was completed in 1986. The new planning rules were so eagerly received that by the end of 1988 more than 10m sq ft of new B1 space was coming forward for completion in 1989. 'At timesit appears that every farmer with land near a motorway junction was seeking to develop a B1 business park,' says APR. The change in planning rules also fundamentally changed the nature of business parks. The 'third generation' of business parks were office campus schemes for corporate headquarters as developers discarded the original concept of allowing high-technology companies to perform all its functions under one roof. The 'B1 effect' has produced a tendency for developers to think exclusively in terms of maximising land values through office development to the exclusion of mixed use and industrial buildings and this new phenomenon is transforming the mixed use business parks of the 1980s into the office parks of the 1990s,' says APR. In 1988, offices were 32 per cent of the total market compared with 79 per cent in 1991. The bonanza clearly got out of hand. Many schemes were ill thought out and badly located. Clearly, some may have to revert to warehousing and industrial schemes, even though office prices were paid for the land. What is more difficult to predict is where business parks go from here. The definition of a business park is increasingly blurred thanks to its changing role, the introduction of new terms such as Stockley's 'mid-urban' park at Chiswick, and the tendency of developers to borrow the label for any clutch of new suburban buildings surrounded by a few trees. The fourth generation schemes, meaning a business park that covers hundreds, if not thousands, of acres with leisure facilities and housing, are limited to one or two examples and some intensive lobbying of planning ministers. There is not even any clear consensus on which types of schemes are the most successful. It has long been assumed by the industry that if a business park is to compete with the town centres, it must be large enough to offer a restaurant, a health club, a creche, a hotel and even shops. In spite of the logic in this argument, the facts do not back up the industry's hunch. Good quality small schemes get taken up just as well as good quality large ones, according to APR, which has examined the relative take-up of schemes larger than 50 acres and the rest. 'It is our view that size of schemes has only a marginal impact on the size of lettings to be accommodated,' it says. Nonetheless, the bare statistics should not invite complacency about schemes which do not offer attractive amenities for employees. When the economy emerges from recession, employers' choice of new premises will have to reflect their anxiety to win and keep good staff.</p>

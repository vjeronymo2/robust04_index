			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / People: Capital Radio picks Thames's Mansfield Capital Radio, which runs Britain's two biggest independent radio stations, wants to put a stop to being regarded as the poor relation when it comes to national advertising. It has hired its new commercial director, 38-year-old David Mansfield (left), from the television marketing world. Mansfield, currently deputy director of sales and marketing at Thames TV, joins Capital on January 1 and will be respon-sible for boosting the revenues of a group whose two London radio stations have an estimated 6m people a month. Having started his career selling Terry's chocolates, Mansfield will be one of three executive directors reporting to Richard Eyre who took over as chief executive at the start of the year following Nigel Walmsley's move to run Carlton Communications TV business. The radio industry's share of total advertising revenue of about 2.5 per cent is 'far below its potential', says Eyre. He blames the poor showing on the fact that commercial TV came to Britain long before commercial radio and as a result has hogged an unusually large share of the national advertising budget. Eyre, who comes from the advertising world, believes that television's share of national, as opposed to local, advertising - currently around a third of the total - has peaked and the share of commercial radio is poised to grow. 'Mansfield shares my vision,' says Eyre, who argues that with increasing competition at local level, radio stations like Capital must increase their share of the national advertising market. Mansfield's arrival will overlap with next year's retirement of Philip Pinnegar, the deputy managing director who has been with Capital since its launch in 1973. However, the company says that the management of the sales department under sales director David Lees would not be affected by the new appointment.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRYING TO BRIDGE DIFFERENCES;  </P> <P> VENICE: HEATED DEBATE OVER HOW TO FIX CRUMBLING CANAL WALLS HAS GONE ON FOR TWO  YEARS. BUT THERE'S HOPE ON THE HORIZON.  </P> <P> Homes on the banks of the Venice Canals are fetching prices in the $750,000  range, but the quaint waterways that provide the area's charm continue to be  "fixer-uppers."  </P> <P> As cottages that once lined the banks are transformed into fancy remodels, the  crumbling walls of the canals seem all the more forlorn as they wait for their  own face-lift. And wait. And wait.  </P> <P> Though long in the works, rehabilitating the canals has been stymied by a  variety of disputes, ranging from environmental concerns to financial matters.  </P> <P> There are six waterways remaining in what was once a system of canals  envisioned by Venice founder Abbot Kinney, though these were dredged by another  developer. One resident described the canal area, between Washington Boulevard  and Venice Boulevard, east of Pacific Avenue, as an urban oasis, albeit one in  which the waters have grown murky and the banks are disintegrating.  </P> <P> For almost 25 years, city plans to restore the canals have been repeatedly  drawn up and then shot down.  </P> <P> The latest delays in the rebuilding project involve an acrimonious two-year  debate between property owners and Venice-area Councilwoman Ruth Galanter over  what type of concrete blocks should be used to rehabilitate the canals -- a  battle between brands known as Loffelstein and Armorflex. And although that may  sound like nothing more than a tongue twister to an outsider, to a majority of  canal property owners, it means beauty versus the beast. It means war.  </P> <P> Hostilities between the councilwoman and the Venice Canals Assn. are set out in  an exchange of sharply worded correspondence with each other and with other  residents of the canal community.  </P> <P> The association, which claims to represent 200 property owners (there are 350  properties in all) have accused Galanter of taking an Armorflex or  nothing-at-all stance. The association strongly opposed the use of the  Armorflex blocks for aesthetic reasons. And according to their poll, about 70%  of property owners along the canal oppose the Armorflex plan.  </P> <P> Galanter has said the choice of blocks is not a beauty contest.  </P> <P> "Of course, Ms. Galanter doesn't face the specter of waking up every morning to  the cinder-block horror of Armorflex," fumed a letter to canal property owners  from the association after a rancorous public meeting late last year.  </P> <P> Galanter has fired her own written salvos, dismissing the group's aspersions on  her as "hogwash, pure and simple."  </P> <P> In an interview, Galanter insisted that she has not cast her lot with  Armorflex. "I have no brand loyalty whatsoever," she said. "My job is to  represent my constituents and to uphold the laws . . . and that's what I'm  trying to do."  </P> <P> Despite the harsh words, there appears to be on the horizon a perestroika by  the Pacific. Canal association leader Mark Galanty, a major critic, now talks  of a "a new beginning with Galanter," a shift in the relationship that  apparently began when a consultant was hired by the property owners to  intercede at City Hall.  </P> <P> Galanter, too, acknowledges a thaw in the feud, which she attributes in part to  new property owners in the area who have taken a more conciliatory tone with  her by asking for help, which she said she was all too happy to give.  </P> <P> Some of them even came to her fund-raiser, Galanter said, though she, too,  credits the consultant with convincing hard-line canal property owners that she  was not to blame for derailed plans for the canals that were one step from  fruition when she took office.  </P> <P> A large part of the neighborhood's unhappiness with Galanter can be traced to  what they perceive as her role in the cancellation of one canal rehabilitation  plan that had the backing of her predecessor, Pat Russell. After many earlier  battles on if and how the canals should be refurbished, property owners had  voted for an assessment district in which they would be charged for repairs to  the canals.  </P> <P> The city had signed off on a plan for vertical concrete walls, and the matter  was on the agenda for the Coastal Commission, when it was suddenly discovered  that the canals were subject to environmental protection as a wetlands area,  even though they are made by humans.  </P> <P> That, Galanter explained, meant a vertical bank was unacceptable because there  was no way that protected organisms could cling to it and the Coastal  Commission staff had recommended against it.  </P> <P> Galanter said canal property owners wanted her to use political muscle to push  the project through, but she declined, preferring to withdraw the city's  application and come up with a plan that was environmentally sound.  </P> <P> This is where Armorflex came on the scene, after it was suggested by the  Coastal Conservancy, to whom Galanter had turned for help. Armorflex is a  blanket of interlocking concrete blocks tied together by cables. Parts of the  blocks would be hollowed out to allow for native plants and organisms to grow.  </P> <P> A test site was launched to see if a planting of pickle weed and salt grass  would succeed. The first planting didn't take. The second was eaten by the  canal ducks (the bird most people associate with the area is considered  domesticated and not protected).  </P> <P> Finally, wire was placed over the blocks to protect the tender new shoots, and  Galanter planning deputy Jim Bickhart was spotted by residents wielding a  garden hose in an attempt to get things moving.  </P> <P> At one point, canal association leader Henry Colman reports, the anti-Armorflex  faction was accused of sabotaging the pickle weed by drenching it with a toxic  substance in the dead of night. The charge proved groundless, Colman said.  </P> <P> Galanter, meanwhile, was accused in a letter from an association representative  of caring more about pickle weed and salt grass than about her constituents.  </P> <P> As the debate rage, Armorflex became the look the neighbors loved to hate. They  disliked it enough to shop for a substitute -- Loffelstein or Loffel Block.  Loffelstein is a series of log-like concrete planters that weigh more than 100  pounds each. The planters are stacked on top of each other to form a retaining  wall.  </P> <P> A city study has found Loffelstein to be a close second to Armorflex in safety  tests, with no substantial differences found. However, Galanter said, Armorflex  appears to be easier to repair. In a press release issued last fall, Galanter  pronounced Armorflex as "safer and less expensive than other materials and will  do the best job of protecting the environment."  </P> <P> But now, she is assisting the Venice Canals Assn. in getting the approval of  the Coastal Commission for a Loffelstein test site, to see if it passes muster  with the pickle weed and salt grass seeds. The test, if approved, is expected  to take up to another 18 months.  </P></p>

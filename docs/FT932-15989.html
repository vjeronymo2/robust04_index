			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Audit letters need improvement, accounting conference recommends LETTERS issued by auditing firms to companies as part of the annual audit are repetitious and could be considerably improved, a study at the conference showed yesterday. Eighty-four per cent of a sample of 120 companies received letters after the annual audit and 37 per cent after an interim, research by Mr Sean McCartney, Mr Stuart Manson and Mr Michael Sherer from the University of Essex found. Two thirds of the letters dealt with accounting methods and policies, 45 per cent with taxation and 43 per cent with general business advice. But managements generally said that the letters were of moderate value, and 58 per cent said they could be improved. Half of the respondents said at least two fifths of the content of the letter repeated advice that had already been given. Nearly three quarters of companies had implemented at least 60 per cent of the recommendations made on internal control and accounting systems, accounting methods and taxation. The accuracy of analysts' forecasts varies significantly between different countries, with greater reliability in the UK and the US than in Germany, France and Japan, the conference was told by Mr Eamonn Walsh of New York University.</p>

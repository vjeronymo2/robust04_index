			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-EXCLUSIVE PRAGUE HOTEL FOR PARTY BIGWIGS TO OPEN DOORS TO PUBLIC -- FOR  PRICE  </P> <P> A Prague hotel so exclusive that not even a visiting millionaire could get a  room has thrown open its imposing doors and plans to go commercial.  </P> <P> For eight years a veil of mystery hung over the Praha Hotel, property of the  Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and reserved for the exclusive use of its  officials and visiting foreign dignitaries.  </P> <P> Now, however, it has been opened to outsiders, ending one of many taboos swept  away after weeks of popular unrest that forced the party to relinquish its  monopoly on power.  </P> <P> Inside the Praha's doors are palatial suites, a luxury sports center and a  theater -- where officials enjoyed private screenings of Western films they had  banned for the public.  </P> <P> Hundreds of uniformed staff glide noiselessly through its long corridors, but  because of the severe restrictions on entry there has rarely been a guest to be  seen.  </P> <P> "Now things will be different," manager Jan Dite told Reuters in what he said  was his first interview with a Western correspondent. "We'll have to get used  to it."  </P> <P> Management said the hotel, built in 1981 at an undisclosed cost, will go  commercial early this year -- although it will remain the property of the  party.  </P> <P> Ordinary rooms will cost about $100 a night, enough to burn a hole in the  pockets of Westerners and certainly beyond the reach of ordinary Czechs.  </P> <P> But the move is at least a concession to opposition demands that party members  forfeit privileges that include not only use of the hotel but also special  health care and access to secret stores stocked with luxury meats and dairy  goods.  </P> <P> Dite admitted that the hotel had been losing money since it was built but would  not say how much.  </P> <P> "We were subsidized from the party's budget. Our average occupancy rate has  been less than 50%," he said.  </P> <P> The six-story, horseshoe-shaped building has a tropical garden in its central  atrium. Room balconies -- all of which face south -- offer an exquisite view of  the once royal Hradcany Castle and chandeliers light its grand marble  staircase.-  </P> <P> The 116 rooms with terrace gardens include 32 "small" and eight "presidential"  suites. A small suite is actually bigger than many family apartments in Prague.  The manager graciously declined to show any of the presidential suites.  </P> <P> The hotel can sleep 200 people and employs a staff of 350, Dite said.  </P> <P> Facilities include a circular indoor swimming pool, a well-used bowling alley,  pool tables, a sauna, tennis and volleyball courts, a beauty shop, a cinema and  a massage parlor.  </P> <P> But its miles of wood-paneling, hundreds of black leather armchairs and public  rooms resembling vast caverns exude the grim, moody atmosphere of a place that  is too big and too empty.  </P> <P> Only during party congresses and on other special occasions has the building  ever come to life.  </P> <P> At those times the hotel teemed with officials. Fleets of chauffeur-driven  Tatra limousines would wait outside to take them to the congress in the Palace  of Culture, another huge structure nicknamed "Moby Dick."  </P> <P> For years locals eyed the hotel, built on the site of a former public park,  with a mixture of awe and resentment.  </P> <P> They told tales of 18 underground floors, private elevators to suites, a secret  tunnel from the subway stop nearby, wild parties and call girls.  </P> <P> None of those stories could ever be verified, however.  </P></p>

By dealing directly with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department before the expiration of the exclusive negotiating period under the Department's contract with Gianotti, KBL tortiously interfered with his advantageous contractual and business relationship with the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46.

Because of the conduct of KBL, Dennis F.

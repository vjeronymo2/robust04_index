			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: TNT plans ADollars 325m convertible issue TNT, the Australian trans-portation group, yesterday announced plans to raise up to ADollars 325m (USDollars 213m) through a convertible preference issue - a key move in the group's efforts to tackle its ADollars 1bn-plus debt burden. TNT said it would issue 194m convertible preference shares at ADollars 1.55 apiece, and that oversubscriptions of up to 16m shares, raising another ADollars 25m, would also be accepted. The preference shares will carry a coupon of 8 per cent, and there will be mandatory conversion into ordinary shares no later than May 31, 1997. The new stock will be sold to both institutional and private investors. About ADollars 225m of the issue will go to institutional clients of underwriters - County NatWest Australia Securities and Macquaries Underwriting - while private investors will be entitled to the remainder of the offer and the oversubscription option. Existing holders of TNT shares will have priority, provided that they are not also participating in the institutional offer. TNT will use the money to pay down some of its sizeable borrowings. The net balance sheet debt stood at ADollars 1.12bn at end-June, and this figure should be cut to around ADollars 831m after the preference share offer. TNT has seen major boardroom upheavals recently - including the departure of Sir Peter Abeles. For its last financial year, to end-June, TNT announced a ADollars 256.7m loss after tax and abnormal items - although the hefty deficit resulted partly from write-downs and provisions. At the operating level, TNT returned to a small profit of ADollars 14.2m. Australian National Industries, the heavy engineering group, is investing in a joint venture with Amur Steel, a Russian group, to produce and market steel and steel-related products for Russian and international markets. The venture will be controlled by Amur, with a 53 per cent equity stake, while ANI will hold 21 per cent. Parmelia Resources, an Australian resource company based in Perth, will own the remaining 26 per cent. ANI's investment  -comprising both loans and the equity investment - will amount to about USDollars 12m. ANI-Amurstal Joint Venture (AAJV) will utilise steel-making facilities at the Amurstal Steel Works, at Komsomolsk in the Khabarovsk district of the Russian Far East. The works date back to 1942 and the mini-mill has an annual steel-making capacity of 1.2m tonnes.</p>

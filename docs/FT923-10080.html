			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: O'Reilly takes 1.3% stake in Mirror Gp Newspapers MR TONY O'REILLY, former Ireland rugby international and the head of Heinz the US food group has given the most tangible evidence so far of an interest in Mirror Group Newspapers. Since the re-listing of MGN shares earlier this month Independent Newspapers in Dublin, the newspaper group, of which Mr O'Reilly is chairman, has bought a little more than 5m shares or 1.3 per cent. The shares were probably bought at an average price of about 60p following the opening of the re-listed shares at 50p. The MGN shares have climbed gradually since and closed yesterday at 71p, an increase of 2p on the day. MGN management found out about Mr O'Reilly's modest stake building by submitting 212 disclosure forms to find out who was buying the shares. The Independent Newspapers stake was the only one to be revealed that suggested that potential purchasers of the popular newspaper group might be buying. The rest of the activity in the shares came from stockbrokers and involved relatively small stakes. Mr O'Reilly has made no secret of his interest in MGN which includes the Daily and Sunday Mirror, The People and the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail. A 1.3 per cent stake is however little more than symbolic. More than 54 per cent of the company in under the effective control of Arthur Andersen, the administrators to the private Maxwell interests. All the signs are that the administrators intend to hold on to the stake until the share price returns much closer to the flotation price of 125p.</p>

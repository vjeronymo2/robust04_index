			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Russia clamps down on TV advertising The Russian government yesterday approved a draft law on advertising designed to stop the blanket advertising which propelled the now collapsed MMM financial company into most Russian homes through TV advertising, gaining it millions of shareholders who now face losses or even ruin. The draft comes as advertising executives say that Russia's TV advertising market is becoming rapidly more sophisticated and profitable, and is steadily acquiring the range of products which provide the staple of western TV ads. The draft, still to be passed by the state duma (lower house of the parliament), bans all advertising from unlicensed companies - as MMM was - and prohibits any company from advertising more than twice in one hour on TV or radio. MMM swamped TV programmes with as many as five commercials in an hour. The draft legislation also lays down that all advertisements be 'trustworthy and conscientious'; bans subliminal advertising and all advertising for alcohol and cigarettes; and calls for the need to protect the young. It also decrees that commercials 'do not discredit works of art representing national or universal values'. This is to prevent the satirical or comic use of art works and historical figures. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, called the measure 'timely' and said he had opposed more radical suggestions to cut down by decree the volume of advertising in newspapers and in the broadcast media. MMM was far and away the largest advertiser on TV, spending on some estimates up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.5m) annually on pushing its shares through commercials using the Golubkov family of working class Muscovites. Mr Bruce MacDonald, head of the BBDO agency in Moscow, said yesterday that 'no other advertiser came close'. However, a number of western consumer goods companies are now spending heavily on TV commercials as they seek to buy their places onto the increasingly choosy Russian market. Mars, the confectionery company which has established a manufacturing plant in Russia, is thought to be spending around Dollars 20m on an annualised basis - while western cigarette and cosmetics companies are spending between Dollars 2m and Dollars 6m each a year on their products. The largest Russian advertisers are financial services companies and banks. Many of these are either establishing their names through rather grandiose displays linking their enterprises to Russian historical figures or events, or pushing shares. Alcohol and tobacco advertising on TV accounts for some 5-8 per cent of the total, according to Mr MacDonald. Foreign brands of alcohol have proved particularly popular on the Russian market, with even the vodka sector now showing a one-third penetration by overseas brands. However, whole sectors of consumer advertising such as cars, certain kinds of foods and some kinds of financial services such as mortgages are wholly or largely absent from the screen. Mr MacDonald said that 'it would be better if the industry could develop its own code of conduct and police itself, as in other countries - but frankly it's not yet in a position to do so'.</p>

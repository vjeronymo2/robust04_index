			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Creditors may sue Merseyside agency Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, faces legal action by creditors over the opera concert to celebrate the visit of the Columbus Grand Regatta tall ships to the area in 1992. Only about Pounds 10,000 of assets remain in Carroll Promotions, the failed company set up with a share capital of Pounds 2 by Mr Brendan Carroll, the corporation's public relations consultant, to run the concert. Mr Sandy Jack of Parkin S. Booth, the liquidator, yesterday said he would not apply for a winding-up order until the Commons public accounts committee had published its report on the matter. Creditors include the corporation, which had to inject more than Pounds 400,000 to save the concert after poor ticket sales. Smaller creditors say they believed the event was in effect sponsored and underwritten by the corporation which should therefore be held responsible for all the debts. The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, expects the losses to be about Pounds 695,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah believes that  the peace settlement in the region is not moving quickly.    'Allamah Fadallah, in his answer to questions during a  lesson  on the Koran, said: "This stage revolves round the  Lebanese-Syrian- Israeli negotiations. The Syrian-Israeli  negotiations revolve round two contrary demands because Israel  wants to normalize relations first, then establish diplomatic  relations and security, and then withdraw in stages over eight  years. On the other hand, Syria wants withdrawal first, then  the establishment of diplomatic relations. It wants  normalization to be left up to circumstances.    Fadlallah believes that the objective of Israeli attacks on  Lebanon is to put pressure on the Syrian-Lebanese stand and the  mujahidin, and to create new issues over which negotiations can  take place to delay the basic negotiating issues. This is  especially true since Israel is monitoring Palestinian autonomy  and working on finalizing the autonomy negotiations over the  West Bank. This prevents it from moving in two directions.  Therefore, we believe that Israel wants to play upon the time  factor--perhaps wait for some changes from one party, or some  pressures from another party. It seems that the United States  still falls in line with Israeli policy. We believe, therefore,  that settlement will not take place very quickly.    Answering a question, Fadlallah said: We do not trust the  PLO and we have in our possession some documents on relations  between the PLO and Israel since 1982. We know that the PLO  used to make things easy for many European intelligence agencies  and give them opportunities. They used to offer them a great  deal of information about the Islamists in Lebanon and about  many of those groups opposing Western policies in the region.  Therefore, we fear the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in the  region. We fear that the Palestinian officials will cooperate  and coordinate with Israeli intelligence to strike the Islamic  and liberation movements in the region. We also fear that the  autonomy agreement will constitute a bridge for the Israelis to  cross into Arab economy using the Palestinian element which  could be a cover behind which the Israeli element hides.    As regards Israeli threats, 'Allamah Fadlallah believes that  "there are no Israeli, American, or Arab circumstances that  provide Israel with the opportunity to do what it did last year  or to occupy new Lebanese territory. The whole issue is that  Israel is working on planning qualitative strikes, either  security or military, every now and then because it fears the  reaction of the Islamic Resistance."</p>

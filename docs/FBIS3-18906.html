			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias yesterday urged  his European partners not to accept a lesser role than the  United States or Russia in Bosnian peace efforts.    Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Mr Papoulias said  the European Union [EU] had wanted a presence by Moscow and  Washington and said their efforts to resolve the Bosnian  conflict had been positive.    "But we cannot just sit back and give up on our action plan.  The EU cannot accept being put on a lower rung than the United  States and Russia," he said.    Mr Papoulias said EU foreign ministers, who discussed former  Yugoslavia over dinner, all agreed on the need to reinforce the  United Nations Protection Force - but he gave no indication who  might send more soldiers.    Mr Papoulias said "there was no objection" at the dinner to  a  suggestion by French Minister Alain Juppe that there should be a  meeting between the United States, Russia and the EU to prepare  discussions with all sides in the Bosnian conflict.    Heading an EU delegation, Mr Papoulias will fly to Belgrade  and then on to Moscow this coming Friday [11 March] for talks in  support of EU peace efforts in Bosnia.    He is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev on Saturday to discuss Bosnia.    The focus of peace efforts has shifted to Russia, in an  attempt to use Moscow's influence with the Serbs to back  settlement initiatives.    The Croatian Foreign Minister, Mate Granic, and Bosnia's  Haris Silajdzic are both due in Moscow this week.    Among the proposals they will be discussing is a United  States-backed plan to roughly divide the former Yugoslavia  between Serb-held areas and a Muslim-Croat coalition.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to  discuss the plan when he visits the Russian Town of Vladivostok  on March 14.</p>

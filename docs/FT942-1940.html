			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Niceness reigns in the heat of battle - Jurek Martin in Washington finds plenty to cheer about as the tournament gets into its stride It won't last, of course. Somewhere, somehow, soccer must beget mayhem because that it is the natural order of things. But it has not happened so far. Over the first five days, 11 matches in nine cities produced only sweetness and light, on the field and off it. First, the players are being nice to other players from other teams. Only two have been sent off, one a Bolivian substitute who clearly wandered on the field by mistake for three minutes thinking he was playing in the last World Cup - and even then the referee's judgment seemed a little harsh. Next, the fans are being nice to each other. Even the Dutch, more boorishly English than most, contained themselves after their victory over Saudi Arabia here on Monday night, perhaps because they realised they were a little lucky to get a win at all. Their orange-clad masses made a lot of racket compared with the Saudis, but doubtless the 50 princes present would have frowned on unseemly behaviour. Finally, the great American watching public, both the couch potatoes seeking relief from the heat and inexorably drawn to the OJ Simpson drama played out live, as well as those at matches, seemed quite beguiled by it all. In the TV ratings on Saturday afternoon, Italy against Ireland outdrew the US Open golf, even though Nicklaus and Watson, two American icons, were contending for the lead. The on-field vignette that most caught the spirit featured Jostein Flo and Jorge Campo. Flo is a very tall Norwegian striker, Campo a very short Mexican goalkeeper who compensates by wearing a jersey and shorts that would make a psychedelic Sumatran parrot look dowdy. Flo, sensibly playing to his advantage, spent most of the first half climbing all over Campo, who frequently ended up on the turf. The Hungarian referee, who had obviously been reading up on the importance of Nafta, considered this an unfair trade in bodies and repeatedly blew his whistle, though objective observers thought Flo was a little hard done by. But, as they waited for a corner kick in the second half, their tongues hanging out in the stifling 96' heat, there was Campo handing Flo a water bottle, not laced, as far as can be told, with tequila or jalapeno peppers. Moreover, Flo did not throw it back at him but politely returned it. They might even have smiled if they had had energy left to spare for lip movements. It was much the same in the Saudi-Dutch match. The sons of the desert kept offering a hand to any cloggie they had just hacked down, which they managed frequently and with enthusiasm. This unnerved the Dutch at first, who tended to treat any fallen Saudi with suspicion, largely because the Saudis fell often and with a dramatic effect that suggests that their latest South American coach had been reading Lawrence of Arabia rather than the Koran. But, in the end, the Dutch became positively benign, too. Even the Russians, beaten far worse by Brazil than the 2-0 score implied, contained themselves, though they conceded the only penalty, the first awarded before Greece's yesterday. Not that there were many sympathetic Russian supporters out at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto to egg them on to dirty deeds. The few ancient and hardy Sovietologists from the Hoover Institution were easily outnumbered by the Brazilian press corps alone, most of whom spent their time getting Pele's autograph. A contributory factor may be the referees. This is not because they have been calling games tight amd flashing yellow cards at the hint of a nudge. The more likely answer is that their authority has been enhanced by new uniforms. No longer garbed in sinister black, the refs now sport a rather gorgeous mauveish-purple, uncannily similar in hue to that of a Church of England bishop, though flashier. Fan contentedness also matters. Washington has been a sea of celebrants, driving round in cavalcades and making polite merry in Georgetown's bars. Norwegians did not impale Mexican sombreros on horned helmets after their Sunday victory. A local Catholic priest urged his constituents on the morning after the loss to Ireland to pray for the Italian team rather than to make Norway an offer it could not refuse before tomorrow's match in New York. US media coverage has also been conspicuously helpful to the uninitiated. Where US sporting jargon has been introduced into commentaries, it has tended to enlighten, not confuse. Thus, from ice hockey, comes the expression that a goalkeeper was beaten 'on the high side,' and from baseball that a player 'steps up to the plate' to take a free kick. Less felicitous is the word 'rejected' for any kick into touch, because a blocked shot in basketball is one of the game's high points. But US broadcasters have also adapted and begun to speak of draws, not 'tied games,' and of one-nil, not one-zero. The absence of commercial interruptions has been an unmixed blessing, though the commercials that dominate half-time and the pre- and post-game shows do not speak much for the creative talent and knowledge of soccer of the American advertising industry. US mania with sporting statistics, in which simple soccer is fundamentally deficient, sits less easily. After each quarter of a basketball game, the press boxes are provided with minute detail about every shot, pass, assist and foul. So, after half-time here, sheets are issued with no less than 16 statistical categories, including the number of times the ball has been headed, by whom and in what part of the field. The foreign hacks crumple them quickly. But, in the end, it is the matches themselves which have most entertained. Even if goals have not come by the glut, all games have been competitive, except Brazil-Russia and Argentina-Greece. Some favoured teams - Italy, Colombia, Spain, Mexico - have been found wanting at the first hurdle. The gap between the touted and the unsung has not appeared that great. Saudi Arabia, indeed, could - though not should - have beaten Holland. Fuad Amin's first-half header was a deliciously clinical piece of work and not the only example of his eye for the goal. For the 45 minutes he played, Majed Abdullah, the 'Desert Pele,' gave Koeman and van Goebbel in the Dutch defence fits, as did his replacement, Falatah, and Owairan. It took a mighty strike by Wim Jonk and an 87th-minute error by the previously excellent Al Deayea in the Saudi goal - a weak punch gave Taument a header into an open net - to bring Holland through. The Saudis did tire badly in the last 20 minutes, but their worst fears of humiliation were easily avoided. After the game, faithful retainers handing out information leaflets about the Kingdom even found some takers. For what it is worth at this early stage, and with only Nigeria of the fancied sides still to play their first games later yesterday, Brazil and Germany (though not at their best in beating Bolivia) still look the cream of the crop. In their respective ways, Ireland, Holland and Norway have shown they will be no easy marks. Today's match between the US and Colombia looms as the next biggie. The US did not impress in drawing with Switzerland, but Colombia, picked by no less than Pele to win it all, were simply awful in losing 3-1 to Romania. If Colombia recover form and score the goals they now need, US progress into the second round will be doubtful, and so will domestic interest in the competition. Or so conventional wisdom has it, but it could be wrong. If the World Cup continues to overflow with its present spirit, the national hangover may endure.</p>

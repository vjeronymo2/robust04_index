			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] ELTA reported that according to the figures for  the first quarter of the current year the expenditure of the  state social security budget exceeded the revenue by 15.7  million litas.    The increasing number of insolvent enterprises was named as  the main cause of this. An especially difficult situation has  developed in June; on 1 June the debt of the insurers [to the  department of social security -- "Sodra"] reached 200 million  litas. [passage omitted]    The revenue from the state and from state joint stock  enterprises, budget offices, and organizations have dropped  significantly. According to the figures presented on 20 June  the revenue received by the state social security budget  comprised 71.9 percent of the planned revenue for this month.    As a result of this the "Sodra" is unable to pay out  pensions  on time and to settle accounts with the pharmacies and  sanatoriums. On average the payment of pensions in June is late  by four days. Apart from this the "Sodra" is not able to pay  debts to the sanatoriums, which on 20 June comprised 500,000  litas.    The total debt of "Sodra" this month is 40.3 million litas.

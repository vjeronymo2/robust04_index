			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Technology: Body shops order CD-Rom parts - A system that makes car repairs easier Lex Retail, the UK car dealership group, is equipping its 54 body shops with a system for estimating repairs based on a CD-Rom disc database. The system stores data on 500,000 car parts on a single CD-Rom (read-only-memory) disc, which is played on a drive connected to a personal computer. Several car-rental companies and insurers, including Guardian Insurance and Royal Insurance, also use the system, called Glassmatix, to help agree estimates more quickly with their approved body shops. The system, produced and sold by Glass's Information Services, bases repair times on data drawn from a UK research centre in Thatcham, funded by UK insurers. Car-part prices in Glassmatix come from the manufacturers. Steve O'Brien, UK fleet maintenance manager at Budget, the car rental company, says he wanted estimates based on criteria that were standard in the insurance industry. At Budget, the damage manager examines a car and decides what new parts are needed. He then passes a barcode wand over the relevant reference in a catalogue. For example, he might swipe the barcode for a new side wing in a 1994 Ford Mondeo. The informa- tion is later transferred to the PC. The PC works out (based on a CD-Rom updated monthly) how much each repair will cost, including parts and labour. It also works out the most efficient order in which to do repairs, keeping labour costs to a minimum. 'We basically tell the body shops what we're expecting to pay,' says O'Brien. This has contributed to a Pounds 1m cut in maintenance costs a year, the company says. The system also works out when a car is not worth repairing. O'Brien says: 'If repairs are going to cost more than 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the car's value, we replace the car with a new one.' The system means Budget spends less time rummaging through car-part catalogues or phoning suppliers and haggling over repair estimates. It has also enabled insurers, and other users, to see more clearly the size of mark-up being made by some garages over the retail price of a component. 'At first we thought the system was wrong,' says Jeremy Seal, chief motor engineer at Guardian Insurance. 'Now we're picking up on over-charging, even if it is as small as 1.5 per cent.' Guardian Insurance - part of Guardian Royal Exchange Insurance - is to equip its staff engineers with a portable version of the system so they can send estimates back to the office via the Ram Mobile Data network, the UK mobile data service. Some insurers, such as Guardian, also plan to use a related product - Glassimage - which enables still or moving video images of damaged vehicles to be sent to the insurer down telephone lines, or over a mobile data network. The software, which compresses the size of each video image, was developed in conjunction with video card company, Videologic. Users will need a standard video camera, a video card and a modem to take and transmit still or moving images. The Thomson Corporation, which owns the Mitchell's CD-Rom system in the US (on which Glassmatix is based) invested Pounds 6m to help Glass's develop the UK version of the product. The company says it may have to wait several years for a return. But there is a potential market of 2,500 insurance assessors, the 5,000 biggest body shops and principal car dealers and fleet managers. Subscribing to Glassmatix costs Pounds 5,000 a year including paper catalogues, monthly CDs and support, but excluding hardware. Glassimage costs an extra Pounds 495 a year. There are similar products on the market. The best known is Audatex, which is owned by Swiss insurers Swiss Re. Its collision-repair estimating system draws information on parts and labour costs from manufacturers. Audatex is planning to incorporate the insurers' Thatcham data by January.</p>

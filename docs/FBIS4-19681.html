			<p>BFN     [Text] Answering reporters' questions on what the  Government intends to do about the arrests of Greeks in Albania,  Government Spokesman Evangelos today said that Greece has made  all necessary diplomatic demarches on the Albanian authorities'  wave of arrests against the Greek minority. It is also waiting  for Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' meeting with Albanian  Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi on 3 May in Zurich.    Venizelos stressed: Greece cannot take a casual or timid  stance considering it is a guarantor in the region. Therefore,  it is acting in a low-key manner to avoid any misunderstandings.  The spokesman noted: Anyone who misunderstands our muted  approach will be making a political mistake. I am referring to  Albania.    The spokesman stressed that trumped up charges are  unacceptable. He said: The improvement of Greek-Albanian  relations depends on respect for the Greek minority's human  rights, international law, and the standard of human rights  traditional to European civilization. Venizelos added: This  [Orthodox] Easter [1 May], the Albanian authorities must prove  that they respect freedom of religion.    The Greek Government will proceed to reduce the staff of the  Albanian Embassy in Athens, because Albanian President Sali  Berisha's government has not reconsidered their decision to  reduce the staff of the Greek Embassy in Tirana. We remind you  that the staff of the Greek Embassy in the Albanian capital has  been reduced by 30 percent.    A short time ago, REUTER NEWS AGENCY reported from Athens  that an Albanian diplomat had been informed that he must leave  the country by tomorrow. REUTER added that this is the second  incident in the past 10 days resulting from the tension between  the Greek and Albanian Governments.</p>

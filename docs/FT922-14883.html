			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: Gounod's Sapho Saint-Etienne, an industrial town in hilly country south-west of Lyon, was graced during the Malraux era with a large cultural centre with among other things three theatres: large, small and experimental. The place hums with activity. On the musical side, Saint-Etienne has been conspicuous for Massenet revivals - he was a local boy. There will be a festival and symposium later this year. Meanwhile Saint-Etienne has scored a hit with Gounod's Sapho - not to be confused with Massenet's opera of the same name on a contemporary subject. Sapho, Gounod's first work for the theatre, was commissioned by the Paris Opera at the instigation of the mezzosoprano Pauline Viardot, already famous and influential after her success in Meyerbeer's Le Prophete. Apart from some church music, Gounod was an unknown quantity. The Opera, unwilling to risk the expense of a five-act blockbuster, prudently asked for a shortish work which would allow room for a ballet in the same programme. The chosen librettist was Emile Augier, a successful author whose plays were domestic dramas in full reaction against Romantic excess. The premiere in 1851 had a mixed reception. Viardot in the title-role was admired; Berlioz found much to praise in the score, but neither then nor in subsequent revisions (reduced to two acts, then puffed up into four) was the public won over. The fault surely lay less in the music, much of which is in Gounod's most personal lyrical vein, than in the book - a lop-sided, uneasy mixture of public ceremonial, private intrigue and political conspiracy. We meet the poetess Sapho at the Games at Olympia, where she wins a contest with an ode about Hero and Leander. Sapho loves and is loved by Phaon, a flawed hero-figure, also loving and loved by a viperish stop-at-nothing courtesan, Glycera. Phaon is involved in a conspiracy against the (unseen) tyrant Pittacus. By threatening to expose him, Glycera blackmails Sapho into rejecting Phaon and forces Phaon to take her with him into exile. The miserable Sapho throws herself into the sea, not (as in some versions of the legend) from a rock in Leucas, but in her native Lesbos. For only two performances, SaintEtienne honoured Gounod with a musically and visually rewarding production. The producer Denis Krief successfully combined dance-mime (the athletes' scenes, frieze-like tableaux vivants perceived through gauze, were ravishing) and chorus movement. Krief was also responsible for the sets and the soft, romantic lighting. Sapho did not leap visibly into the sea but was gradually obscured by Turneresque clouds. The style was Greek-classical seen through 19th century French painters' eyes. Gerard Audier designed the costumes. The only number in the opera familiar today is Sapho's valedictory 'O ma lyre inmortelle' (recorded by Crespin among others), a piece of long-limbed, grave lyricism. That it is so satisfying as a finale is the more curious because it is really a strophic song with two verses and a short coda. Michele Command, who had sung the earlier scenes with charm, dignity and sensitive phrasing, rose to the occasion. As for the wretched Phaon, with whom the weak and vacillating composer surely - if perhaps unconsciously - identified, the only thing a tenor can do is to sing the music (better than the character deserves) as mellifluously as possible. Christian Papis did well. As the viper Glycera, the Canadian soprano Sharon Coste showed a vibrant voice of great promise. But since she swallowed most of her words, the result was inconclusive. The 'Nouvel Orchestre' of Saint-Etienne has been thoroughly trained in a short time by Patrick Fournillier, the moving spirit in these revivals. On the first night this able conductor was showing a degree of consideration for the singers which Gounod's transparent scoring hardly calls for. There is grandeur as well as clarity in this score. In future performances Fournillier could afford to give the orchestra more headway. That will only be possibly if this staging, as it deserves, can be shown in other theatres. A live recording is promised. Meanwhile the excellent Cambreling version with Katherine Ciesinski and Alain Vanzo has been transferred to CD (Rodolphe RPV 32663.64).</p>

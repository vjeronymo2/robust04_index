Smith, 32,  was dropped in return for his guilty plea to the hit-and-run charge.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann M. Korban said prosecutors agreed to the plea bargain  because they were uncertain that they could secure a manslaughter conviction.  </P> <P> Smith faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 22 in Van Nuys  Superior Court, Korban said.  </P> <P> Smith pleaded guilty in connection with the June 24 death of Saul C.

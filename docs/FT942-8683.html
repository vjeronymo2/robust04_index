			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: National Power International diversification by privatised UK utilities has received a bad name. That is why National Power is rather coy about its overseas investment plans. Though its public goal is to invest Pounds 1bn in international expansion by the end of the decade, the management's true ambitions are more extensive. The group would, for example, be prepared to spend Pounds 500m on a foreign privatisation in addition to the Pounds 1bn, which is earmarked for green field site investments. The group's financial strength will permit such investment levels. Net cash inflow from operations - Pounds 832m during the last financial year - will rise as economic recovery gathers pace and yet more costs are squeezed out of the business. Meanwhile, capital expenditure in the UK will bob around at the current level of Pounds 436m. Without foreign investments, National Power's gearing of 13 per cent would soon turn into a cash pile. Even if the whole Pounds 1bn was spent by 1998 and dividends are raised as envisaged, gearing would still be modest. Shareholders may feel they would do better if the pay-out was increased faster than planned or the company bought back its own shares. But it would be a mistake to tar National Power with the same brush as other utilities such as BT and British Gas. Its international strategy is more focused. The opportunities in global power generation look fairly attractive. Moreover, National Power can already boast one success: American National Power has contributed to earnings after financing costs in its first year within the group.</p>

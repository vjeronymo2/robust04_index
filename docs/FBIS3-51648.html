Legislators from the rightist Social Christian Party (which  holds a majority in Congress), other progovernment parties, and  independent parties voiced satisfaction over the reforms, which  they described as "very important and justified." During a  special session of Congress last night, a group of legislators  promoted the constitutional reforms that will become effective  in 1996.    Congress approved increasing the number of deputies (from 77  to 113), the participation of independent candidates (except for  the posts of president and vice president of the Republic), and  the elimination of mid-term elections. The next step is to turn  over the reforms to President Sixto Duran-Ballen for final  approval.    Fernando Rosero, leader of the Ecuadoran Roldosist Party,  announced his parliamentary faction will strive to abolish the  reforms because they are the product of a "spurious" session.  Deputies from minority parties -- the Democratic Left (ID),  Popular Democracy Party, and Democratic People's Movement --  voiced their opposition and agreed that the approval of the  reforms "showed some serious irregularities."    ID Deputy Antonio Rodriguez said increasing the number of  deputies would imply a heavy allotment from the state budget.  He added that President Duran-Ballen's ruling will allow  knowing if his policy of reducing the state and exercising  fiscal austerity is authentic. Minority deputies noted that the  reforms had been approved in a very hasty manner, adding that  these reforms were useful for "certain smug attitudes of the  Social Christians."</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> OUTDOOR CONCERT PROMOTER HOPES 3RD TIME IS A CHARM  </P> <P> In the past three years, there have been two unsuccessful attempts at staging a  major outdoor concert series in North County. Promoter Rick Tupper is hoping  the third time will be the charm. He has announced tentative plans for a  10-show series next summer at Palomar College in San Marcos, in a natural  amphitheater behind the school, with room for 5,000 people.  </P> <P> The Oct. 14 Palomar Music Festival is something of a trial run. Tupper is  producing it with campus radio station KKSM-FM (98.9, cable only) and the  Associated Student Government.  </P> <P> The concert, to start at noon and end shortly before sundown, will feature  performances by Jimmy Cliff, the Untouchables, Psychefunkapus, local reggae  band the Cardiff Reefers, and two other acts to be named later.  </P> <P> "Depending on how well the show does," Tupper said, "the idea is to do an  entire series next summer, with as many as 10 shows."  </P> <P> Good luck. Two previous attempts at producing an outdoor concert series in  North County, both at the Sammis Pavilion in Carlsbad, were dismal failures.  </P> <P> In 1988, promoter Bill Silva had big plans for the 7,000-capacity amphitheater:  a dozen concerts, if not more, by summer's end. As it turned out, only two  shows, by Bob Dylan and Basia, were actually held before Carlsbad city  officials yanked his conditional-use permit due to insurmountable traffic and  security problems.  </P> <P> The next year, the owner of the Batiquitos Lagoon Educational Park, in which  the pavilion is located, decided to give it another shot on his own, only to  give up a few weeks before the series was scheduled to start.  </P> <P> Tupper, however, is confident he will succeed where others have failed. The  Palomar amphitheater is on a college campus, with much easier access, and a lot  more parking than Sammis Pavilion, which is smack-dab in the middle of a  residential neighborhood.  </P> <P> "Plus, San Marcos is one of the fastest-growing areas in the county," Tupper  said. "And there's a real need for somewhere to go, something to do, for  entertainment."  </P> <P> Tupper is no stranger to the Palomar College facility. In the early 1980s, he  produced several concerts there until the welcome mat was withdrawn in 1982.  </P> <P> "At that point, a different set of trustees came in, and they had a whole  changeover of school officials, who didn't want to have concerts," Tupper said.  </P> <P> "But now, largely due to the efforts of the campus radio station and the  student government, they have decided they want to put the area in back of the  school to good use, once again."  </P> <P> In the late 1970s and most of the '80s, singer-songwriter Rob Lamothe fronted a  succession of San Diego hard-rock bands that played school dances and parties  and occasionally ventured into the studio to cut some demos.  </P> <P> Nothing ever became of those demos, however, and in 1986 Lamothe, like so many  other frustrated San Diego musicians before him, decided to try his luck in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Well, it took awhile, but Lamothe has finally arrived, as they say. He's the  lead singer of the Riverdogs, a hot new L.A. rock band that also features  Vivian Campbell, formerly with heavy-metal giants Dio and Whitesnake, on lead  guitar.  </P> <P> The Riverdogs' debut album was released by Epic Records last June. Sales have  been quite good for a first album, and the reviews have been great. With good  reason: The band's bluesy rock 'n' roll packs a real punch, the musicianship is  top-notch, and the 10 songs, all either written or co-written by Lamothe, have  a lot more passion, substance and lyrical integrity than the typical hard-rock  ear-splitter.  </P> <P> One interesting aside: In a recent interview with national metal-mag Screamer,  Lamothe talks about his local rock 'n' roll roots. "In 1979, I went to high  school with Warren DeMartini and Robbin Crosby (currently with Ratt), and  played with them in different bands."  </P> <P> The poor lad's memory must be failing, or else he's trying to hide his real  age. In the fall of 1972, Lamothe and I both began our freshman year at  University of San Diego High School in Linda Vista (we were enrolled in the  same honors math class). I graduated in 1976, and I would assume he did, too.  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Playscool, the granddaddy of San Diego's nomadic nightclubs,  celebrates its fourth anniversary Friday night with a big splash backstage at  the San Diego Sports Arena. There will be four dance rooms, six deejays and  three bands -- San Diego's If Tomorrow and Burning Hands, and Mary's Danish  from Los Angeles. . . .  </P> <P> The Beat Farmers left town last Wednesday for a six-week, 40-date U.S. tour.  The first stop was Dallas, two days later. The trip is scheduled to end Oct.  31, with a Halloween-night performance in Boulder, Colo. . . .  </P> <P> Another celebrated local rock band, Robert Vaughn and the Shadows, will make a  rare hometown appearance Saturday night at Winston's Beach Club in Ocean Beach.  . . .  </P> <P> Twenty-two years ago this week, Iron Butterfly's notorious "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"  entered the national Top 40. The band had been formed in San Diego as the  Palace Pages; the name change came after their 1966 move to Los Angeles. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale: Friday at 3 p.m. for the Indigo Girls' Nov. 4 concert at  Symphony Hall downtown; Saturday at 10 a.m. for Billy Idol's Oct. 26 show, with  Faith No More, at the Sports Arena; Saturday at 2 p.m. for Bad Manners' Oct. 19  appearance, with the Skatalites, at UC San Diego's Price Center Ballroom. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Joe Satriani with Eric Johnson, Friday  at San Diego State University's Open Air Theater; the Nashville Ramblers with  the Bedbreakers, Friday at the Casbah in Middletown; the James Harman Band with  the Blonde Bruce Band, Friday at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Linda  Ronstadt with the Neville Brothers, Sunday at SDSU Open Air Theater; Johnny  Clegg and Savuka, Monday at the Price Center Ballroom; and John Conlee, Tuesday  at the Circle D Corral in El Cajon.  </P></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Arts: Batsheva's 'Mabul' - Dance Umbrella To open this year's celebration of the newest choreographic ideas, Dance Umbrella offered us the Batsheva Company from Israel. The Umbrella has sheltered some pretty odd enterprises in the past, but Batsheva is, even in these circumstances, like the ace of trumps. The troupe is directed by Ohad Naharin, who is choreographer of the 75 minutes of Mabul (no indication as to meaning) which was on view on Tuesday night at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. The ingredients are the seven men, seven women of the company in less than flattering outfits of slate grey vests and shorts; some singing (Naharin as a none too convincing counter-tenor; the rest of the cast mellifluous); chatter, and fish-wife yapping from the girls; a scream of horror - at least one of the dancers is also a critic; a collection of Euro-dance incidents of little interest; musical snippets ranging from Vivaldi, whom Naharin treats in cavalier fashion, to pop-racket; a bleak stage; a hamster. (This last creeps over the head and torso of a man while he gently writhes - as if dancing were not difficult enough on its own). The effect, as you may gather, is prodigiously tiresome. The Batsheva troupe has gone through various mutations since it came into being 30 years ago as a Martha Graham offspring. In its latest incarnation, Naharin's Mabul gives it a neurotic, aggressive manner. Activity is, at best, inexplicable; at worst, and there is a good deal of this, it aims for brutish effect. The grumpier cliches of today's European dance are put through their paces yet again. Bodies slam to the floor; routines of post-modern aridity show the cast as a dull ensemble; movement is dead-pan, dead-end. Amid the gloomy, shadowed lighting - a William Forsythe speciality for the Frankfurt Ballet - the action has the ill-suppressed ferocity and all-too-evident frustrations that I associate with long waits at Moscow Airport during the bad old days. Were one, at the end of 75 minutes, to feel that some image, some personality, had made a positive (let alone pleasing) effect, then the piece might be justified. I found it leaden with its own self-importance, inexpressive. Nor does it flatter its performers, whose style appears without finesse or brilliance, though there is a virtuoso outburst of body-slapping. In a programme note, Naharin says he feels blessed because he was not born 'as a Bedouin woman who has had her clitoris removed'. I do not think this is any excuse for making Mabul.</p>

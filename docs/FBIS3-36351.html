The United States pledges to send Latvia internationally  recognized experts to monitor the agreement's implementation,  said Saeima (parliament) Foreign Committee head Alexander  Kirsteins.    Latvia's Way's Andrejs Pantelejevs underlined that Latvian  security was important not only to his country but also to  American and European security, judging by the results of this  week's meetings in Washington.    The U.S. Government confirmed its interestedness in the  conclusion of a formal agreement between Latvia and Russia on  the withdrawal of the Russian troops and the dismantling of the  Skrunda radar station.    The Russian Government promised the United States to get the  remaining troops out of Latvia until the end of August on  condition Latvia allows it retain the Skrunda radar for four  years and 18 months.    If Latvia rejects the term and follows its own way to reach  an accord with Russia, the United States declines to extend any  subsequent security guarantees.    Latvia, however, will accept the proposal only if the new  building of the Skrunda early-warning antimissile installation  will be pulled down immediately, said Pantelejevs.    The United States supports Latvia's signature to NATO's  Partnership for Peace program and will help Latvia with  technical provisions, Kirsteins said.    The Latvian delegation met with President Bill Clinton,  State  Secretary Warren Christopher, Deputy State Secretary Strobe  Talbott and Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry.</p>

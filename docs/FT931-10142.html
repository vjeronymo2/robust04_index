			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / People: Lord Eden, Allan Jonnes and Matt McBride - an apology On January 18, in an article about the Bricom Group Ltd and its recent management changes, we wrongly stated that the Bricom Group is in a disastrous financial situation and implied that the former management team of Lord Eden, Allan Jonnes and Matt McBride was to blame. We fully accept that this was totally untrue. We are assured that the Bricom Group prospered under its former management and is in a sound financial position. We understand that the management changes resulted from a change in the strategic direction of the Bricom Group. We greatly regret the damage and embarrassment caused by our article to Lord Eden, Mr Jonnes and Mr McBride.</p>

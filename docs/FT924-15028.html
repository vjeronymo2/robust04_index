			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Separatist setback for Georgia ABKHAZIAN separatists and their allies have secured the whole of north-western Abkhazia in a bloody setback for the Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, just five days before general elections, Reuter reports from Moscow. Last night Georgia requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council on the conflict and asked for the despatch of UN observers. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, is shortly to report on the situation to the council. Georgian troops were swept from their last two villages near the Russian border on Monday night, suffering hundreds of casualties. Some were evacuated by the Black Sea, others fled inland into the mountains, and at least 200 crossed into Russia and were interned, Itar-Tass news agency said. Following the capture of Gagra on Friday, the rebels now control the entire 100km stretch from the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, to the Russian border. In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin, main guarantor of an abortive Abkhazia ceasefire agreed last month, told parliament Russian troops were taking over the Abkhazia section of the Moscow-Tbilisi railway.</p>

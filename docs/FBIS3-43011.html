Brodov, </F> Central Scientific Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy and  Ferrous Metallurgy Economics Institute]    [Text] In the foreseeable future, steels and alloys will  remain the principal structural materials; this is dictated by  the broad range of their physical and mechanical properties,  relatively low cost, and a well-developed raw material and  technological production base.    The conditions of a market economy determine the  characteristic features in approaching the development and  production of new metallic materials,[.sup]1[/] improving  traditional materials, and using new and improved materials in  products. Moreover, the new materials play the role of a  commodity which has the consumer properties satisfying the buyer  and bring profit to the producer.    A number of aspects of the movement of new materials to the  metal products market is considered in the article.    Stimuli and incentives for developing new  materials. The new metallic materials can successfully  reach the market under the following conditions:  1. there are no similar products in the existing market, and  the use of new materials opens up new opportunities for  developing products, i.e., a free ``niche'' exists.  2. existing similar metal products are inferior to the new  products in quality, and production of new items is more  profitable.    Materials with a completely new set of properties open up  the  possibility of developing a new products market. Materials, as a  rule, are developed simultaneously with designing a product,  i.e., custom-developed. Examples of this approach are the  simultaneous development of a new category of amorphous alloys  and the most recent modifications of pulse transformers and the  separation of the spheres of influence between metallic soft  magnetic alloys and semiconductor ferrites.    The opposite used to be true, i.e., the new material was  ``looking for'' its applications or, in other words, the product  was being developed for existing metal. This happened, e.g.,  when superconducting alloys and cryogenic power engineering and  cryoelectronic products [2] were being developed simultaneously  on the basis of the discovery of the high-temperature  superconductivity phenomenon [1]. Production of the principally  new materials often cannot be realized by traditional production  methods using conventional equipment and calls for new designs.  Oriented crystallization of eutectic alloys, impregnation of  frame matrices with alloys, explosive impact methods, metal film  sputtering, etc., can serve as examples.    As we have already mentioned, these types of materials  figure  primarily in the new sector of the metal products market.    Another sector of the metal products market is characterized  by displacement of ``classical'' traditional metal products by  new materials. In this case, a higher level of properties blazes  the trail to the market for the new material thus ensuring a  higher quality of products or their greater adaptability to  streamlined manufacture, a decrease in production costs, an  improvement in the product reliability, etc.    IF-steels (especially deep drawing and without free  interstitial atoms) and clad steels for the automotive industry  are examples of such materials. Materials whose properties are  at the level of classical analogs yet cheaper due to efficient  alloying, e.g., nickel-free stainless steel and tungsten-free  tool steels can also be classified as belonging to this group.  These classes of materials are developed, as a rule, on the  basis of improving their production practices (ensuring a  specified chemical composition, steel purity, more stringent  allowances, using heat treatment, improving the surface finish,  etc.).    Since materials, as a rule, are semi-finished products for  making items while the products as a commodity have a certain  life cycle in their market [3], the life cycle of the material  also depends on it. For example, metallic and film memory  elements developed for early-generation computers ceased their  existence together with these types of computers. High-purity  metals and alloys developed for designing vacuum tubes in  early-generation radio and TV devices were also not used in  subsequent generations of electronic equipment. As a result of  the further development of these skill-intensive industries,  metals were no longer used in new-generation products--the metal  was displaced by semiconductors, ferrites, and other materials.  The life cycle of a multifunction material, as a rule, is longer  than that of the materials custom-designed for a specific  product.       Economics of materials with new qualities. The  development and production management of new or improved  materials are fraught, as a rule, with additional production  outlays. In principle, the production process can be arranged in  such a way so as to ensure a predetermined degree of  approximation of the physical limits of this class of material  properties. Yet the economic expediency of such approximation  under market conditions is far from always justified. An  analysis demonstrates that each unit of "gain" in properties  calls for progressively increasing production outlays (Fig. 1).  The cost of material whose range of properties is close to the  physical limit C[.sup]0[/] is substantially higher  than the cost of mass-produced material with a traditional range  of properties C[.sup]1[/]. For the consumer, it is  more profitable to deal with a commercial level of properties  (the C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range)  which is higher than the traditional level but lower than the  physical. Under market conditions, the commercial level forms as  a function of the specific demand for the material, the product  market opportunities, and the product's specific metal  consumption. The commercial level of properties may not coincide  with the design level of properties C[.sup]4[/]  with respect to the material parameters on whose basis the  engineering design of the product is made. The degree of  discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels  (the difference between the  C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range and  C[.sup]4[/]) characterizes the material  utilization level in the product: given  C[.sup]4[/]&lt;C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/],  the material properties are underutilized; given  C[.sup]4[/]&gt; C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/],  the specific metal content in the product increases since the  shortfall in the property level has to be compensated for by an  excessive amount of material (e.g., for increasing the net  section in order to ensure a specified strength or operating  magnetic induction of the product).    In the case where  C[.sup]4[/]&gt; C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/],  we may be dealing with an economic paradox: despite the  discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels,  an elevated metal expenditure may turn out to be economically  justified if the smaller quantity of metal with higher  properties costs more than a greater quantity of relatively  cheaper metal. For this reason, in particular, anisotropic  electrical sheet steel exposed to laser treatment (the  properties are improved by 8% and the cost rises by  15%) has  limited applications [4].    Consequently, the use of a new material whose applications  in  a product ensures a decrease in aggregate production and  operation outlays compared to the one it substitutes can be  considered economically efficient.    Operating properties, reliability, and competitiveness  of materials. After the engineering analysis of the product  is completed, the consumer, in the final analysis, is no longer  interested by the primary physical characteristics of the  material (ultimate tensile strength, density, magnetic  permeability, etc.) but rather the ability of the material as a  whole reliably to perform certain functions, ensure the  serviceability of the product, and guarantee the lowest  manufacturing outlays (adaptability to production). Naturally,  these comprehensive characteristics are largely determined by  the primary ones yet the final assessment of the material (the  material fits or does not fit) is made only in conjunction with  the product and by the product's market suitability, i.e., the  product's consumer appeal and economic characteristics.    The operating properties of the material and supply  reliability must be ensured by the manufacturer technology  level. The metal consumer must be confident in the producer's  goods. Thus, as a result of many years of tradition at American  automotive companies, a certain procedure developed in the  relationships with metal suppliers. Each car part is made from  metal supplied by only one vendor who managed to  attain consistently high quality of metal products. Such  producers are awarded quality certificates by the automotive  plants. Such a quality certificate enables the metal supplier to  hope that car manufacturers "will let them supply one more  part." The USS Corporation is one of the first U.S.  metallurgical companies supplying automotive sheets and it has  received Ford and Chrysler quality certificates.    In certifying metal products, the Ford Motor Company  proceeds  from meeting the four principles of interrelation with metal  suppliers:     -  the quality of metal supplied (50 points on a scale of  100);    -  timely and predictable shipments (20 points)    -  metal product price (20 points)    -  supplier participation in jointly developing and finishing  the  metal products together with the user (10 points).    -  It is important that the price competition is assigned  priority  number three (20 points) while the shipment quality and  regularity move to the forefront (a total of 70 out of 100  points!).       Foreign (especially Japanese) automobile producers [5] are  being increasingly transplanted to the United States in recent  years. Japanese automobile manufacturers have established that  the automobile body sheet produced by metallurgical enterprises  in the United States and used by American customers does not  meet Japanese requirements [6]. An assessment of 14 quality  parameters shows that American steel is inferior to Japanese  with respect to the seven most important parameters (the coat  quality, surface finish, suitability for drawing, geometric  tolerances, etc.). Thus, the automobile body sheet market  becomes closed, and it is very difficult for nontraditional  metal producers to penetrate it. It is expected that competition  will heat up even more in the automobile body sheet market due  to the fact that construction of units for applying coats in a  number of countries (Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan,  and South Korea) has acquired elements of obsession according to  the analytical report by P. Marcus to the Eighth Congress of  ``Ferrous Metallurgy Survival Strategy'' held in 1992.  Furthermore, in a short run, ``...a major battle will develop  among plastic and aluminum sheets and various types of clad  steels in the automobile body sheet market'' [7].    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Classification of Metal Exposure Types During Operation                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Type of exposure                      |Structural and other processes leadin-|  |                                      |g to metal failure                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mechanical                            |Residual deformation, fracture, fatig-|  |                                      |ue, wear, creep, and magnetic aging   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chemical                              |Corrosion and change in chemical surf-|  |                                      |ace composition                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Temperature                           |Aging, creep, mechanical stress redis-|  |                                      |tribution, phase and structural insta-|  |                                      |bility, stress relaxation, defect red-|  |                                      |istribution and relaxation, shape and |  |                                      |configuration loss, and embrittlement |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Magnetic                              |Magnetic texture development and loss,|  |                                      | changes in temperature conditions, a-|  |                                      |nd loss of superconductivity          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Radiation                             |Loss of shape and configuration (swel-|  |                                      |ling), redistribution and increase in |  |                                      |the number of defects, residual radio-|  |                                      |activity, magnetic and structural rel-|  |                                      |axation, and radiation-induced cold w-|  |                                      |orking                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Combined factors                      |Combined processes                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A general assessment of the service properties of materials  can be complemented by the concept of material reliability which  is especially important for the material operating under extreme  conditions. Reliability is a comprehensive material  characteristic and determines its ability to ensure the product  serviceability within a specified time interval under the effect  of external damaging factors [8]. A classification of the  external factors and the character of the resulting metal damage  are summarized in the table. The character of the material  damage development under a constant effect of a certain external  factor (or a group of factors) where the operating parameter  changes exponentially with time (Fig. 2) is representative. The  product fails when the working parameter goes beyond the  operating range  P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/]. The  reliable material operation span (Curve 2) may be  increased by stabilizing treatment, e.g., aging or thermal  cycling. Ensuring reliability is the most important condition of  guaranteeing the ability of the material to perform its  operating functions. A guarantee of reliability calls for  additional material producer and supplier outlays related to  more stringent production practices, the need for stabilizing  treatments, accelerated reliability tests, and reliability  forecasts.       Another important aspect of the issue of ensuring product  reliability which depends on the material is its maintainability  [8], i.e., preserving the necessary product performance level by  changing the failed material. This problem is related to the  supplier's ability to provide materials whose parameters are at  the level of the initial parameters of the failed material. For  the material supplier, solution of this problem involves  adjusting the technology for producing metal batches with  identical properties, improving the chemical, structural, phase,  and geometrical homogeneity of the metal which leads to  additional production costs due to the need to maintain a high  level of production culture, stringent requirements for the raw  material quality and homogeneity, etc. In this case, the  question of what is more economically expedient--to tighten up  the production process in order to prevent rejects or allow a  certain amount of rejection but ensure that off-grade metal is  taken out [9]--cannot be a priori answered  unambiguously.       The coincidence of the properties of the original (failed)  material and its substitution has a probablistic character and  is described by a material property distribution curve with a  transition from batch to batch as well as within each batch. The  narrowing of the distribution curve by technological methods or  rejecting the metal which does not fall within the operating  parameter range  P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/](P&lt;P[.sub]1[/]  and P&gt; P[.sup]2[/]) also leads to  additional producer costs. In the case where the practices are  tightened up in order to optimize the material produced with  respect to several parameters, we are witnessing the narrowing  the volumetric distribution curve. For example, for the two  parameters P and S (Fig. 3), optimization  means that both parameters fall within area 1-2-3-4. Naturally,  this problem is much more complex than optimization by a single  parameter. At times, different parameters have opposite behavior  trends in which case the optimization task becomes even more  complicated.    The problem of metal homogeneity is directly related to the  issue of the product's specific metal consumption. The  reliability of the entire structure depends not only on the  specific characteristics of the material, but also on the cross  section margin necessary for decreasing the metal damage  probability due to local deviation of the characteristics from  the mean specific value. The probability of local deviations is  determined by the material homogeneity, i.e., the distribution  curve and, in the final analysis, the degree of technological  rigidity.    As we have already mentioned, a guarantee of reliability is  especially important for materials under extreme conditions.  Thus, e.g., according to data in [10], the requirements imposed  on the materials used in making sea-based aircraft are more  stringent in a number of cases than those for space equipment (a  high strength combined with a low specific gravity, resistance  to cyclical loads in a corrosive medium at temperatures of up to  1,150, etc.). Composite metallurgy methods (production of  composites on the basis of intermetallic compounds), powder  metallurgy methods (engineering ceramics and materials for  specialty bearings operating in corrosive media under high loads  and high temperatures), single crystal and quasisingle crystal  metallurgy, and specialized coat application methods (heat  protecting, corrosion resistant, etc.) are used for developing  such materials for specific products.    According to forecasts by the Japanese Ministry of Trade and  Industry [11], the need for specialty materials for operation  under extreme conditions will increase rapidly and by 2000  exceed the 1989 consumption level by several times. This is  primarily true for the following classes of materials:  intermetallic compounds with a high strength and heat  resistance, alloys with a high resistance to biological and  physiological media, and high-temperature superconductors. The  demand for materials which determine energy conservation and  microelectronics development [11, 12], i.e., amorphous alloys,  microheterogeneous (including nanocrystalline) alloys,  multilayer composites (including metal-ceramics), materials with  an amorphized surface, and hydrogen accumulating materials for  hydrogen engines, etc., will increase sharply. New modifications  of traditional materials must also be developed, e.g.: stainless  steel micrometer-thick fibers for woven materials and screens,  reinforced concrete in seismically resistant structures and  nuclear reactors, and reinforced refractory products [12]. The  issues of developing the aforementioned classes of materials are  resolved especially effectively in places where material  producer and item producer integration has been achieved.    An analysis shows that one can win customers in a saturated  market only by offering a commodity which has advantages  compared to competing products and which meets user demands at a  higher level. Under these conditions, the metal product  competitiveness becomes especially important [13].       The competitiveness of metal products as a commodity is a  comparative comprehensive estimate of the totality of  qualitative and economic properties (parameters) relative to the  market requirements or the properties of a similar (or  substituted) commodity. A quantitative estimate of the  competitiveness level K is made on the basis of  developed procedures [14] and, in the final analysis, is  expressed through the free parametric quality index  I[.sup]p[/] and the free parametric economic index  I[.sup]c[/] (the difference between the quality  parameters of this commodity and a similar commodity per unit of  production outlays):    K =  I[.sup]p[/]/I[.sub]c[/].    Given K&gt; 1, the commodity is more competitive than  the analog while given K&lt;1, it is less so. The metal  product competitiveness level is especially sensitive to the  range of consumer appeal (I[.sup]p[/]) at low  outlays--small fluctuations in the value of the  I[.sup]p[/] index require a high degree of  customer satisfaction with quality in order to maintain a high  level of competitiveness (Fig. 4). Thus, the nonprice  competition factors come to the forefront at low outlays. This  is taken into account by experienced material producers [15]. In  practice, the situation with assessing the competitiveness is  much more complicated since the I[.sup]p[/] and  I[.sup]c[/] indices are independent. Thus,  according to data in [16], an increase in the degree to which  the metal product consumer requirements are met (the  I[.sup]p[/] index) from 90 to 95% is fraught with  almost doubling the metal producer outlays (the  I[.sup]c[/] index). On the other hand, production  of higher-quality items gradually leads to a decrease in  production outlays due to an increase in the production quality  and a decrease in rejections and outlays for additional product  finishing [15].    In penetrating the free market, the new producers must take  into account all possible factors. We can cite examples where  given similar expenditure and consumer appeal levels, the  materials capture markets due to traditional customer loyalties.  Thus, the well-known can war led to a division of the metallic  beverage container market: the Coca Cola Company prefers  aluminum cans while Pepsi Cola--steel cans [17].    Material property standardization principles. As  we have already mentioned, while possessing a broad range of  diverse properties, the same types of metal products, as a rule,  are used in items for very different purposes, i.e., are  multifunctional. This determines the specific features of  unifying the properties in standards and other regulatory  technical documents.    In standardizing production, the indicators used in all  application versions must be mandatory (base); the remaining  requirements are optional and become mandatory only upon  additional agreement (contract) between the producers and  consumers. Sometimes, it is sufficient to have reliable  reference data on a range of properties cited in an appendix to  the standard or a supplier company catalogue. This approach  takes into account the mutual interest of the producers and  consumers and ensures their constructive technical dialogue and,  in the final analysis, metal product utilization effectiveness.  This standardization principle is widely used in foreign  standards and is reflected in all newly developed domestic  regulatory technical documents.    The set of properties for new materials for specific  purposes  (developed for the specific product) must be standardized and  mandatory with respect to the service characteristics of the  product indicating the procedures for measuring these properties.    The chemical element composition standards for steel and  alloy properties for specific applications must be strictly  regulated. For multifunction metal products, rigid  standardization of the chemical composition is unacceptable  since in order to ensure a specific range of requested  properties, one must be able to manipulate the chemical  composition to a certain extent.    Depending on whether the product is crucial, the  requirements  for the level to which the properties regulated by the standards  are ensured differ. Thus, experience shows that for metal  products used in construction, this norm is at least 0.95 but  for more crucial applications--0.97 or more. In addition to the  requirement to ship products in accordance with international or  national standards of technically advanced countries, the  manufacturer penetrating an external market must ensure that all  contract requirements are met and guarantee the quality  stability of the shipped products which, as a rule, is confirmed  by the export production certification by acknowledged  international or national societies (the British Lloyd Register,  the German TGF, the American Oil and Gas Institute, etc.)    One should keep in mind that certification of the product  shipped is an initial phase of certification as a supplier  warranty, while certification of the system ensuring the quality  in effect at the manufacturing enterprise should serve as the  concluding phase. The requirements for ensuring the quality  system are described in ISO 9000 standards [18].  <H5>  Summary </H5>   The specific features of the development, production, and  application of new metallic materials under market economy  conditions are considered. Under the conditions where new  materials become a market commodity, such market material  characteristics as competitiveness, new property standardization  principles, commercial quality level, life cycle, and the ratio  of the material and product economics are significant. These  categories determine the ability of the new materials to become  a commodity profitable for both the producers and the consumers.    Bibliography    1. V.Yu. Galkin.

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Mellor pays price of living dangerously: Talent will be missed in cabinet Risk-taker with weakness for high life Self-confidence made enemies A CONSERVATIVE colleague dubbed him one of the sharpest politicians of his generation. The only problem was that the secretary of state for national heritage knew it. Few at Westminster were surprised by the nature of Mr David Mellor's departure. Just as he has always played the game of politics dangerously, he never looked the type who would slot easily into a conventional private life. The 43-year-old MP for Putney is a man for fashionable restaurants and nightclubs rather than slippers and fireside. A politician who, when charged with policy towards the Middle East, preferred bawling out an Israeli officer in front of television cameras to the genteel diplomacy of the Foreign Office. His weakness for much wealthier friends and willingness to accept their hospitality provided the lever with which the tabloid newspapers eventually forced him from office. Though he is undoubtedly pro-Arab, there is no evidence he was influenced by the hospitality provided by prominent members of the Arab community. But in government, the implication is enough. He will be missed from Mr John Major's cabinet. Not because he is the most popular politician at Westminster: a self-confidence that merges easily into arrogance has won him plenty of enemies. But in a government not noted for its political and human sparkle the self-styled minister for fun looked as if he was enjoying getting things done. 'Others agonise about the minutiae. David makes up his mind and gets on with it,' is how one cabinet friend puts it. In the end his arrogance was his worst enemy. An illicit relationship between a cabinet minister and an actress was always bound to provide the tabloids with a field day. But the sheer tenacity with which some of the newspapers stuck with the story over two months - even after Mr Major had given his full backing to a colleague who had become a close friend - attested to the fact that Mr Mellor made too many enemies among the government's friends. It was no accident that newspapers which had fiercely supported Mr Major at the general election were ready to extend their attacks on Mr Mellor's personal life to detailed accounts of his links with generous friends. What Mr Mellor lacks in humility he has frequently made up for in sheer guts. It is no coincidence that similarly brave colleagues such as Mr Michael Heseltine have a good word for him. He started in politics early. The son of a schoolmaster from Wareham in Dorset, he was chairman of South Dorset Young Conservatives at the age of 15. A degree at Cambridge and a brief spell at the Bar were interludes in what was a determined ascent on the political escalator. Within two years of entering parliament in 1979 he was a junior minister. Although his friend Mr Major has never shared Mr Mellor's penchant for the high life, the two share a political outlook shaped by childhoods outside the Tory establishment. They both like soccer, forging their close political as well as personal relationship during Saturday afternoons watching Chelsea FC. A Dorset grammar school boy, Mr Mellor is a meritocrat. Like the prime minister he is dry on economics, wet on social policy. Like Mr Major he has no time for the traditions of the old Tory establishment. Ironically, as the minister charged with the press and broadcasting, his instincts are far more liberal than those of many in the Tory party. As a junior home office minister he frequently defended the BBC against the intemperate attacks of the Tory right. Piloting the broadcasting bill through parliament he persuaded the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher that there was a role for quality as well as money in independent television. When he took the responsibility for broadcasting to the new Department of National Heritage, the BBC management breathed a huge sigh of relief. He would be tough on efficiency, on securing value for money. But he was committed to the principle of public service broadcasting. During the summer he responded to the political uproar over press intrusion into the private lives of members of the Royal family by asking Sir David Calcutt QC to carry out another investigation into the effectiveness of self-regulation. But colleagues said that while the royal stories had tipped the prime minister decisively towards advocacy of a new privacy law, Mr Mellor was unconvinced that legislation was the best way to regulate a business in which he has many friends as well as enemies. The events of the past few days may well have changed his mind. Mr Mellor is widely regarded as a clever man and talented politician. Many will say his reckless confidence in his future was at the heart of his downfall. Others will lament the Victorian principle of thou shalt not get caught, which still infuses British political life. David Mellor was yesterday finally consumed by headlines. It began on July 19 on the front page of The People with the headline, 'David Mellor And The Actress'. The Sun then claimed that 'Mellor Made Love In Chelsea Strip'. Mr Mellor said it had been made up. But the minister for fun was rapidly being laughed out of his job. It was the headlines over the libel action against The People by another friend, Mrs Mona Bauwens, that really undermined Mr Mellor. Some of the best came yesterday after Mr Mellor went on television to argue that it was the prime minister, and not tabloid editors, who decided who should be a member of the cabinet. 'Mellor's Last Stand' said the Sun. And so it was for the man who three years ago warned the press it was drinking in the 'last-chance saloon'.</p>

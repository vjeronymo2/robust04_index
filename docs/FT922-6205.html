			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Walesa asks parliament to create new cabinet PRESIDENT Lech Walesa said yesterday that he had lost confidence in the government of the prime minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, and asked the Polish parliament to create a new cabinet, Reuter reports from Warsaw. Capping weeks of pressure on Mr Olszewski's minority cabinet to resign, Mr Walesa sent a letter to the speaker of the Sejm (lower house) saying he had withdrawn his support for the government because it was destabilising state structures. 'I lost confidence in the government and this forces me to withdraw my support for it. I propose that solutions aimed at creating a new cabinet are undertaken (by parliament),' Mr Walesa said in a letter.</p>

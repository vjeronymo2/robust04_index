			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Rifkind to question Moscow on N-arms THE British defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, is seeking clarification from Moscow and Kiev about the recent agreement for Ukraine to hand over to Russia its strategic nuclear weapons and its share of the Black Sea naval fleet. Mr Rifkind arrived in Moscow yesterday. In the first visit by a UK defence minister since the break-up of the Soviet Union, he will meet defence chiefs from both countries this week. Mr Rifkind said the agreement earlier this month between President Boris Yeltsin and Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk left open several crucial questions including the timetable for the transfers and how the agreements were to be ratified. The nuclear agreement covers 176 intercontinental missiles as well as air-launched weapons based in Ukraine. Mr Rifkind said the missiles themselves, as distinct from the warheads, also needed clarifying. Discussions will also focus on joint peace-keeping efforts and Russian attitudes to peace-keeping in former Soviet territories. It was important that any Russian participation should come under an international mandate, Mr Rifkind said. An agreement on UK assistance for resettling former members of the Russian armed forces is due to be signed today</p>

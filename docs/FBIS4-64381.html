			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation is once more slowly deteriorating in  Bosnia. The cease-fire is disintegrating in Sarajevo, the Serbs  are only partially respect their promises in Gorazde, and a  group of UN soldiers sent there to monitor the truce are blocked  35 km east of the Bosnian capital. Talks between the powers and  the warring factions are at a standstill, and the French foreign  minister is not hiding his concern:    [Begin Juppe recording] It is true, I am worried. We are  constantly on the brink. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is  increasingly less capable of controlling the situation simply  because it was asked to fulfil tasks without the means to do so.  We are not immune from a catastrophe, which could be sparked  off here or there. I am particularly worried by the situation  in Brcko, this very sensitive area between the Serbs and the  Muslims. Besides, the contact group -- which I proposed -- has  started work, but it appears to be limiting itself to  consultations with the various parties. What I had in mind was  the emergence of a common American, Russian, European position  which would later enable us to bang the table -- if need be --  to say: We must now get a negotiated settlement. We are not  doing that. This is why the chances are greater than ever that  the arms embargo will be lifted. It must be known that -- if  this decision is made -- it would naturally bring about the  withdrawal of the UNPROFOR contingent, which could not remain  there for obvious reasons. I want to remain confident. I  believe that the only way to put pressure on the diplomatic  process is to organize a meeting at the ministerial level as  early as possible. [end recording]</p>

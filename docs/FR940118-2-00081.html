It is further represented that the allocation of any gain on the sale of the shares will not violate the discrimination provisions of sections 404 and 401(a)(4) of the Code. Inasmuch as interpretations of sections 401, 404 and 415 of the Code are within the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department expresses no opinion with respect to the applicant's representations of compliance. However, the Department does note that the applicant also represents that the sale of the Assets is being completed solely to prevent an investment loss which might result to the Plan by virtue of the Plan's holding of the Assets and to avoid, without admitting, any possible fiduciary liability with respect to the holding of the Assets by the Plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Angelena C.

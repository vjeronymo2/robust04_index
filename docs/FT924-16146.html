			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: IEL defers ADollars 2bn flotation of Woolworths THE fall-out from a failed ADollars 1.2bn (Dollars 883m) rights issue by Westpac Banking Corporation yesterday prompted Industrial Equity (IEL), part of the Adsteam group formerly controlled by Mr John Spalvins, to defer the ADollars 2bn flotation of its Woolworths retailing subsidiary. In a separate announcement, Adsteam reported a net loss of ADollars 746m after abnormal items for the year to June. The group said the result was not comparable with its loss of ADollars 1.57bn in the previous year, which was determined on a different accounting basis. IEL, which is jointly-owned by the three main companies in the Adsteam group, said market conditions had changed significantly since the Woolworths float was announced in August, creating 'a particularly unfavourable climate'. The company said it had been told by JB Were, the lead underwriter, that it was impossible to underwrite the issue at a satisfactory price. 'Directors are not prepared to enter into a sale at what they consider will prove to be at a level which does not reflect the true value of Woolworths,' the board said. JB Were agreed in August to underwrite a minimum capital raising of ADollars 1.95m, but is understood to have failed to find sub-underwriters at the reduced level of ADollars 1.85m. The reluctance of institutions to support the float follows the failure last week of the Westpac rights issue, which was 72 per cent undersubscribed. The prospects for the Woolworths flotation have been undermined by a weakening in the Australian share market and the announcement of a discounted ADollars 1bn rights issue by Foster's Brewing Group. However, Mr Simons said he expected the flotation to go ahead 'when the markets are quite stable and there is no risk attached either to investors or the vendor'. In its results announcement, Adsteam said it made a profit of ADollars 336m before deducting tax of ADollars 24m, finance costs of ADollars 638m and abnormal losses of ADollars 420m, mainly related to property write-downs by IEL. Woolworths made an operating profit of ADollars 247m on turnover of ADollars 9.2bn, compared to profits of ADollars 218m on turnover of ADollars 8.2m in the previous year.</p>

He said the  massacre is part of a larger Israeli scheme to empty Hebron and  Jerusalem of Palestinian citizens to prepare for the  implementation of the old Zionist idea of a land without people  for a people without a land.    In a seminar organized by the Dialogue and Thought Club at  Philadelphia University at noon yesterday, Zaki said that  because they are unsatisfied with the official Palestinian and  Arab recognition of their entity, the Israelis now want  religious recognition. Hence, he said, other massacres should  be expected in the occupied territories in order to move the  battle from the political to the religious arena. [passage  omitted]    Responding to a question, 'Abbas Zaki said he supports  negotiations, but believes they should not be the only approach,  since other methods must be supported. He explained that the  Vietnamese and Algerian revolutions were negotiating and  fighting at the same time.    Zaki said: The massacre will not go unpunished.  Instructions have been issued to the Fatah Hawks. However,  these instructions have not been implemented yet because of the  Israeli maximum state of alert in anticipation of a painful  Palestinian response.    Complaining about the weak coordination among the joint  commands in the occupied territories, Zaki said Fatah has made  no decision to end the armed struggle against the occupation.  He complained that the Palestinian factions are vying among  themselves for positions in unions or professional federations  in the West Bank and Gaza strip, but fail to vie to confront the  Israeli occupation.    He said competition for positions has exposed many  militants.  He said Fatah means martyrdom, pride in martyrs, and the  inevitability of the masses' victory. [passage omitted]</p>

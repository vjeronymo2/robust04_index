			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Facts Cannot Be Bypassed"] </F>   [Text] The Baghdad regime is proceeding with its falsehood  and ignorance. It has not learned from the lessons of the past  despite their hardness and it does not want to learn from the  lessons of today despite their facts that cannot be bypassed.    Following this regime's failure in its feverish attempts to  break its isolation in the world and to affect the convictions  of the international community, which are strengthened by past  evidence and current practices; and now that this regime's  procrastination -- designed to evade full compliance with the  resolutions of international legitimacy -- has been exposed,  this regime is trying, through its tools and lackeys, to  undermine Kuwaiti national unity by jumping over facts and  claiming that it wants to discuss "all unresolved matters" with  the Kuwaiti National Assembly.    We firmly believe the attempt made by the speaker of the  so-called Iraqi National Assembly does not deviate from Iraq's  deception and lies. This attempt shows Iraqi arrogance and  insistence on disavowing Kuwaiti legitimacy, separating the  state from its constitutional institutions, and bypassing the  legitimate government representing people's sovereignty over  their land. It is a stupid and mean booby trap aimed at  blackmailing national feelings regarding the issue of prisoners.  Proceeding from its ignorance and failure to understand the  lessons of the past, the Iraqi regime believes it can drive a  wedge in national ranks pained by the ordeal of the prisoners in  Baghdad jails.    The Iraqi regime has forgotten, or pretended to forget, that  Kuwaiti national unity was the rock that shattered the evil  ambitions of aggression. Had the Iraqi regime an iota of  awareness or sense it would have opted for the one clear road in  order to emerge from the swamp of humiliation, siege, and  isolation. It is the road of international legitimacy's  resolutions, full, and frank recognition of the sovereignty of  the State of Kuwait over its territory, straightforward  recognition of the international borders demarcated by a neutral  international committee, immediate release of prisoners, and  readiness to pay compensation to all those who were harmed by  the criminal aggression. This is the only way.</p>

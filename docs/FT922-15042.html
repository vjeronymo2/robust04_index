			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The risk of Sun burn The only way Sun Alliance could face a real challenge for last year's booby prize in the insurance sector would be if its accounting methods were also used by Eagle Star. As it is Sun's Pounds 466m pre-tax loss was almost Pounds 100m higher than the dreadful Royal result, and starkly underlines the company's rapid and humiliating fall from grace. Sun might have seemed overcapitalised in the mid 1980s when its solvency margin (net worth as a percentage of premiums) touched 120 per cent; with last year's figure including minority interests down to 69 per cent - and likely to slip as low as 50 per cent by end-1992 - it is perhaps just as well that there was so much balance sheet fat to burn. The case for buying the shares lies in the perception that Sun Alliance can at least maintain its dividend this year and generate real increases through the mid 1990s. That requires a lot of faith. All UK composites are dogged by uncertainty, and it is worth remembering that this time a year ago many in the City thought Sun capable of making profits of Pounds 50m in 1991. There are encouraging signs, to be sure, that, like its competitors, the company is prepared to shed unprofitable household and motor business. But the ill fated mortgage guarantee book is sensitive to rises in UK unemployment, and subsidence losses remain higher than elsewhere. There is also room to ponder the group's relatively big exposure to commercial property and equities (a large part of which is represented by substantial stakes in Commercial Union and Chubb of the US, both poor stock market performers this year). Investors would be wise to stay clear of composites till well past the election; even then a 7.6 per cent yield may not be sufficient enticement to buy the Sun.</p>

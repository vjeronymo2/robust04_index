			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Gas plan deadline extended Presidents Itamar Franco of Brazil and Gonzala Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia yesterday extended by 12 months the deadline for agreement on a proposed gas pipeline between the two countries. The extension gives more time for final feasibility studies and to raise finance for the project, which was originally due to be ready to go ahead by this week. Brazil still plans to buy 8m cubic metres of Bolivian natural gas per day, rising to 16m cubic metres in 7 years, but admitted for the first time the possibility of buying more gas, as requested by Bolivia. The price of 90 cents per British Thermal Unit was confirmed. Final shareholdings in the pipeline were also agreed. The Brazilian part of the project will be controlled by Petrobras, the state-owned oil and gas company, with a 51 per cent holding. BTB, a joint venture between BHP, Tenneco and British Gas, will hold 25 per cent and private Brazilian companies 4 per cent. Yacimentos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), the Bolivian oil and gas company, will hold 20 per cent, a bigger shareholding than Brazil had initially offered. On the Bolivian side, YPFB will hold 85 per cent and Petrobras and BTB 15 per cent.</p>

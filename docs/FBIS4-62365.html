			<p>BFN     [Text] Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan met Aide  of the U.S. State Secretary for Coordination on Affairs of the  CIS new independent states, James Collins, in Yerevan on 14 May.  They discussed guarantees for security of the Nagorno-Karabakh  population and the stages for establishment of peace in the zone  of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict after the cease-fire. This  was announced to INTERFAX by the Armenian Defense Ministry press  center.    During the meeting Sarkisyan considered it necessary to  separate the conflicting parties after the armistice with  utilization of special forces. He suggested that this would  guarantee security for the Nagorno-Karabakh population.    James Collins proposed that the U.S. and Armenian defense  structures continue to cooperate.    The NATO Partnership for Peace program was also discussed at  the meeting. Contrary to Georgia and Azerbaijan, Armenia has  not as yet joined it.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Rexrodt named for Bonn economics job A FORMER banker and privatisation expert was yesterday nominated as Germany's economics minister after a scandal forced the resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann last Sunday. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, 51, who was overwhelmingly chosen by the parliamentary faction and executive committee of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the ruling coalition which holds the economics portfolio, said he faced 'a hard, but engaging job'. His nomination, which coincides with a continuing rise in unemployment and a decline in industrial production, has to be approved by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Kohl, who is due to announce a cabinet reshuffle late this month, is expected to confirm Mr Rexrodt's nomination as part of the reshuffle. However, Mr Kohl might face some resistance from officials from the governing Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union parties, and from the opposition Social Democratic Party, which earlier this week said they preferred a candidate to be chosen from outside the party's ranks. Mr Rexrodt joined the FDP in 1980, was Berlin's senator (minister) for finance between 1985 and 1989, and joined the party's federal exeuctive committee in 1990. If his nomination is accepted, he faces the task of carving out a clear role for the Economics Ministry, pushing ahead with deregulation and forging a long-term strategy for the restructuring of the economy of east Germany, which he knows well. Born in 1941 in Berlin, Mr Rexrodt was educated in Thuringen, former east Germany, and studied in Berlin in 1960, settling in the western part of the city before the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. Since then, he has worked largely in the banking sector. In 1989, he was employed by Citibank, in Frankfurt, with responsibility for corporate banking. In late 1991, he joined the board of the Treuhandanstalt, the agency set up to oversee the privatisation of eastern German industry, where he oversaw the privatisation of the textile sector.</p>

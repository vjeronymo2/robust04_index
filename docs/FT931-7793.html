			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Yen soars to new highs on Bentsen comments: Tokyo stance on currency linked to concern about rising trade surplus THE YEN surged to a new high against the dollar of Y116.85 in Tokyo yesterday as the Japanese financial authorities showed little sign of planning a concerted intervention to check its rise. The sharp rise was mainly due to comments on Friday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, that he favoured a stronger yen, apparently to help choke off the mounting Japanese trade surplus. In New York, the dollar continued to react to Mr Bentsen's comments by dropping below Friday's record low levels of Y118.20. Rumours that the Japanese would intervene, despite their apparent lack of concern, reined in the yen's rise and in late trading it was quoted at about Y116.30. Early today Finance Minister Yoshiro Hayashi said Japan would act appropriately to help stabilise the yen in the foreign exchange market, as currency instability was bad for the global economy. The yen's rise would be discussed at the Group of Seven finance ministers' and central bank governors' meeting in London. Economic Planning Agency Minister Hajime Funada also said he expected Japan's monetary authorities to take 'appropriate steps'. 'I am concerned about the latest high yen trend which has been rather too rapid,' Mr Funada said. 'I want to stress that it is desirable (for the yen) to move gradually.' Compared with the New York close the yen eased in morning trading in Tokyo to about Y116.57. The yen has risen by 6 per cent against the dollar in two weeks. While Tokyo foreign exchange traders have scrambled to buy it, Japan's authorities have engaged in a concerted display of calm over its ascent. Foreign exchange traders were surprised at the government's low-profile approach yesterday. In previous periods when the yen has appreciated rapidly, most recently last autumn during the turmoil in European currency markets, government officials maintained a daily commentary on the state of the foreign exchange markets. Yesterday, officials were still adopting a relaxed approach. Mr Hayashi said there had been no specific steps against the yen's appreciation but he would watch the exchange market closely. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice international trade and industry minister, expressed concern over the rapid rise, but said a dollar-yen rate of Y117 would be acceptable. Tokyo's willingness to see the yen appreciate is probably closely related to its concern that its mounting trade surplus, which rose 34.9 per cent to Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.73bn) last month, might sour relations with the Clinton administration. Japan's leaders welcomed Mr Clinton's plans outlined last week to reduce the US federal deficit. Japan has insisted that this has been one of the main causes of the trade surplus. By allowing the yen to rise, Japanese leaders are showing their willingness to reciprocate with a macro-economic approach to reducing the trade surplus. Japan wants to avoid a more segmented industry-by-industry approach. Yet the surge may be short-lived, even though Tokyo economists belief the yen could rise to Y115. The currency's rise has been prompted partly by Japanese companies repatriating funds to improve their profits before they close their books at the end of March. After that the demand for the yen might tail off. In the longer run, much will depend on the performance of the US economy. While the Japanese economy is expected to remain sluggish until the autumn at least, a sustained recovery in the US would strengthen the dollar. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Barings Securities in Tokyo, believes that the yen could weaken to Y135 in the medium run. The Bank of Japan yesterday played down the negative effects of the yen's rise, saying the appreciation of the Japanese currency was not a pressing economic concern as long as it was not rapid. However, a stronger yen will hurt export-oriented motor and electronics industries, already being battered by a plunge in domestic demand. Toyota Motor says profits would be eroded by Y6bn (Pounds 36m) on a Y1 fall of the dollar. Japanese life assurance companies, heavy investors in the US dollar bond market, will also face losses on their portfolios. The yen's appreciation, however, will help the country's banks, which need to clear the capital-to-assets ratio set by the Bank for International Settlements at the end of March, as the value of the banks' overseas assets will fall relative to their yen capital base. Other beneficiaries should include industries reliant on imports of raw materials, such as paper and pulp companies and power utilities. If the impact on Japanese industry is uncertain, the likely effect on Japanese economic policy-making at home is easier to predict. Manufacturing industry is already deeply depressed. Further pressure on manufacturers' export margins would be extremely unwelcome. Lex, Page 20</p>

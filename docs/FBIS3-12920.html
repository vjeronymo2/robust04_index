			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dubayy, 6 Mar (MENA)--Press reports published here  today said that the PLO leadership has asked the Fatah Movement  leaders inside the occupied territories not to take any military  action against Israeli targets at this time.    AL-BAYAN cited Palestinian sources as saying that this  request came in the wake of reports that reached the Palestinian  command that some of the armed Fatah members in the occupied  territories are planning with elements from Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] to stage widespread acts of revenge in  retaliation for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    On the other hand, the same paper cited Hamas sources in  Amman, Jordan, as saying that the group has agreed not to take  military action at present and limit itself to civil  disobedience and popular rebellion.    The sources added that Hamas agreed to this on the  conditions  that it be for a limited period of time and that this agreement  would come after the PLO command informed it that there is an  imminent agreement with the United States to provide  international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied  territories.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW CITIZENS GROUP OPPOSES PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF SDG&amp;E  </P> <P> J. T. (Tom) Hawthorne, a California Transportation Commission member from  Escondido, announced Monday the creation of a citizens committee opposed to a  government takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.  </P> <P> The committee, composed of several well-known county residents, was formed  because of fears that municipalization of the utility would lead to a drop in  service and higher rates.  </P> <P> "It is my firm conviction that the private sector is a more appropriate  operator of utilities than the public sector," Hawthorne said in a prepared  statement. "Public takeover would result in poorer service and higher rates."  </P> <P> The board of directors of SDG&amp;E has agreed to merge with SCEcorp, the  parent company of Southern California Edison, and the two companies are seeking  the approval of the state Public Utilities Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fear Loss of Control, Jobs  </P> <P> The merger is vehemently opposed by those who believe it will mean a loss of  local control and local jobs. Mayor Maureen O'Connor has come out against the  merger, as has another group called the Committee for Local Control, headed by  Gordon Luce, chairman of the board of Great American First Savings Bank. Luce's  committee, however, has not taken a stand on municipalization.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the San Diego County Water Authority has embarked on an analysis of  the feasibility of taking over SDG&amp;E, a proposal sharply opposed by the  utility.  </P> <P> The new committee announced Monday, while specifically formed to oppose any  government takeover, has not taken a stand on the SDG&amp;E-SoCal Edison  merger.  </P> <P> The committee, called Taxpayers Against Government Takeover, has asked for  "seed money" from SDG&amp;E to help it get organized, though Hawthorne said the  group will also draw on private donations and contributions from other  investor-owned utilities in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Study, Opinion Polls  </P> <P> Hawthorne said two recent developments have reinforced his committee's  opposition. One is a study by consultants CH2M Hill "indicating a possible 23%  jump in utility rates if a government takeover did occur." The second are two  opinion polls, including one done by The Times, which show that citizens are  opposed to municipalization. (The Times poll also showed strong opposition to  the merger.)  </P> <P> Other members of the committee include Gil Contreras, vice president of  Contreras Brothers Construction Development Corp.; Bob Watkins, an executive  search consultant from San Diego; Fred Schnaubelt, a former San Diego city  councilman and now a Chula Vista real estate broker, and Gary Clasen, La Mesa  district manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California.  </P> <P> Others identified by Hawthorne as also opposed to a government takeover of  SDG&amp;E were Mac Strobl, a former San Diego city councilman and a public  relations consultant; Jack Raymond, a North County developer and former  president of the San Diego Economic Development Corp.; Leonard Knight, an  executive with the Epilepsy Society, and Bud Wilson, a Chula Vista insurance  executive.  </P></p>

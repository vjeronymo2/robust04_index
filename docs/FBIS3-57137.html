			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1350 GMT on 19 January carries recorded remarks by Russian  Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin from an interview with  Radio Rossii. The place and date of the interview are not  given. Shokhin is asked to comment on what he thinks the  government should be doing.    Shokhin says: "The most preferable government policy would  be to continue maintaining the policy of the past few months.  Any sudden fluctuations would only be worse. Continuing the  line of the Chernomyrdin government would mean continuing the  policy of improving the financial health and stability of the  Russian economy, while, at the same time, taking account of the  economy's problems and a policy of renouncing shock methods.  The most difficult thing here is finding the golden mean."    Shokhin goes on to regret that experienced government  members  who had learned from their mistakes were leaving the government:    "I think both the president and the prime minister should  keep all those willing to work at this difficult time. One  should not, of course, be raising the issue of satisfying all  the ultimatums coming from absolutely everyone. However, I do  think that sensible compromises should be made here.  Unfortunately, the present government crisis was, of course,  prompted by the not very well-timed decree on the reorganization  of the Cabinet."    Shokhin then gives his forecast of what the compositon of  the  new Cabinet would be:    "It is known that First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets will be  remaining first vice premier. The long, drawn-out discussion  between Fedorov and Zaveryukha has to end with the resignation  of one of them." He says he could not say who might replace  Gaydar on the economic portfolio: "I doubt it would be  Yavlinskiy, because that would entail a long period during which  the prime minister and the new father of reforms would have to  get to know each other and learn how to work together."  Yavlinskiy, he says, criticized Gaydar for many months, and his  reforms would be different anyway.    Shokhin goes on to say that people with previous economic  experience, like Soskovets and people who wish to continue  reforms, should work together. Shokhin says he was given the  CIS portfolio, but he rejected it. A ministerial post is not  enough to deal with such a wide remit, he says, you have to have  wider powers. He says he was also offered the economics  portfolio, but says he cannot give his final answer until he  knows the identity of the deputy prime minister in charge of  macro-economic affairs. He concludes by saying: "To be honest,  I cannot say whether I will remain in the government, although,  to be honest, it is more interesting to work in the government  than in the Duma, as far as I am concerned."</p>

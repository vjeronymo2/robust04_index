			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: A chance to raise the standards at your workplace - Training Does your employer communicate effectively with you? Do you feel that your training is appropriate to the demands of your job? If the answer is no, your company might be a candidate for the Investors in People standard which, among a number of other functions, offers a system of auditing the way a company manages its human resources. The standard, which was government inspired, is managed by Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-funded training programmes and foster enterprise. Four years old this November, the scheme got off to a slow start but take-up is now gaining momentum, with Provincial Insurance the thousandth company to achieve it. Barbara Clifford, marketing manager at Provincial, said: 'The process has been extremely valuable for us. It followed a period of restructuring and it focused minds on the future.' So far the standard has been adopted by companies representing 15 per cent of the UK workforce. But many of the earliest participants were businesses which probably had above average employment practices already. How successful has the standard been? It is not yet certain that numerical government targets for the take-up of IIP will be reached. Ms Mary Chapman, chief executive of Investors in People UK, which polices the standard, last week described the target of 50 per cent of UK organisations employing more than 200 being recognised as IIP organisations by the end of 1996 as 'challenging'. However, there seems considerable satisfaction with the standard, which has been taken up by a raft of organisations, from big public sector organisations to schools. A recent survey by Industrial Relations Services, the independent research organisation said 96 per cent of companies that had gone through the process expressed satisfaction with it. But one task for the next few years will be to percolate IIP down to more small businesses, where training and staff development are generally regarded as lacking. In Worcestershire 30 per cent of all employees in the area covered by Central England Training and Enterprise Council work for companies that have obtained the standard or are moving towards it. However, they are employed by 200 companies in an area which has 12,000 businesses. Mr Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of Centec, said it was becoming easier to involve small companies. 'It is important to have role models that small companies can identify with. But, people still have to be convinced that it offers real benefits and that it is not a gimmick,' he said.</p>

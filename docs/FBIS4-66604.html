			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 19--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, today told the representatives of foreign and  Indian companies collaborating in joint venture projects that  the country required higher and quicker investment flows  particularly in the critical infrastructure sector.    While assuring them that the government was committed to  continuing the process of economic reforms started in 1991, Mr  Rao sought to allay any misgivings about problems arising due to  red tape or procedures. "The government will effect the  necessary changes with regard to procedural matters in the  quickest practicable time," he observed.    Mr Rao did not think that the problems and irritants coming  in the way of speedy implementation of the joint venture  projects were not of an insurmountable nature and said the  suggestions made would be considered on merits.    He said he attached importance to a proper feedback from  business, industry and trade pertaining to their experiences in  undertaking economic activities in the new environment in this  country. He felt this meeting provided a good opportunity for a  frank exchange of views and said such dialogues would be held at  regular intervals by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board  (FIPB).    After giving a patient hearing to specific problems raised  by  the foreign and Indian companies, the Prime Minister said some  adjustments would have to be made to streamline the functioning  of several authorities including customs and excise and making  investment procedures simple.    At the end of the meeting lasting more than 90 minutes, Mr  Rao said his impression was that those who had already made  substantial investment in this country encountered fewer  problems. At the same time, those who were now keen or  contemplating investing in this country seemed to be conjuring  problems in their minds, he remarked.    He reiterated that economic liberalisation was here to stay  and said the response to the new policies both within and  outside the country were very encouraging.    The representatives of the Indian and foreign companies  acknowledged that India had emerged as a major player on the  global economic firmament in the wake of the economic reforms  over the last 30 months. Some of them whose projects were in an  advanced stage of completion said the Centre's help of providing  counter guarantee had turned the climate for financial  assistance in India's favour. They expressed satisfaction that  investment procedures had been streamlined especially the FIPB  route and agreed to keep the FIPB posted about the progress  achieved in the implementation of their projects.    Stating that they would seek the FIPB's assistance in  resolving difficulties faced by them during the period of  implementation of their projects, the company representatives  drew the government's pointed attention to cumbersome details  sought in the financial statements.    The government explained that it was proposed to amend the  Company Law and an indepth exercise was already on to overhaul  some of these provisions. It also promised to look into the  problems of varied interpretation of the Urban Land Ceiling Act  by the state government in transferring land to the companies  for starting joint ventures.    The minister of state for industry, Mrs Krishna Shahi,  responded saying there was already a mechanism for monitoring  this aspect and officials of her ministry were interacting  closely with the state government to sort out the difficulties  at the implementation stage.    These representatives of foreign and Indian companies  further  spoke of problems in securing financial packages because of the  norms and procedures of the Reserve Bank of India and financial  institutions and varying rates of duty and taxes for a  Non-resident Indians (NRI) compared to others.    What these companies found worrisome was the implementation  of the Customs and excise laws and underlined the need for  greater transparency. They wanted to know if the structure of  Customs and excise levies could be simplified and the existing  list reduced.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by radio correspondents Qaysar Kabahah and Muhammad </F> Sharif "from Damascus" -- recorded]    [Text] [Kabahah] The delegation of Arab Israeli citizens  started its second day in Syria with a visit to new  al-Qunaytirah and old al-Qunaytirah, which was destroyed by the  Israeli Defense Forces during the Yom Kippur War. A large crowd  of the city's notables, headed by al-Qunaytirah Governor Dr.  Walid al-Buz, received the delegation.    The governor welcomed the delegation at the main reception  hall in the Governorate Building. He reviewed the geographic  and living conditions in the two parts of the Golan Heights [the  Syrian and Israeli-controlled parts]. He also talked about the  concept of peace from the Syrian viewpoint.    [Al-Qunaytirah Governor Walid al-Buz] Syria is working for  the sake of a just and comprehensive peace. The banners for  that kind of peace have been raised by the president on several  occasions. The president has declared that kind of peace as a  stated policy for Syria and for all the Arabs; the just and  comprehensive peace on all Arab fronts; the peace that would  restore rights and return the land; the peace of the brave; the  peace of the knights; the peace that will give each what is  rightfully his; the peace that can survive and last; the peace  that will guarantee the interests of all within the framework of  international legitimacy and the relevant UN resolutions,  particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425.    [Kabahah] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, Knesset member and head  of the delegation, delivered a speech thanking the hosts for  their hospitality and said that peace can only be achieved by  ending the occupation of all Arab territories occupied in 1967  and by recognizing the legitimate rights of peoples in the  region. He also said the desired peace is the peace of the  brave, as His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad has said.    [Darawshah] ...the brave that guarantees the recognition of  rights for all peoples.    [Kabahah] The delegation toured neighborhoods in the  destroyed city. The head of delegation, Darawshah, and Knesset  member al-Sani' planted a tree at the al-Qunaytirah World  Visitors Garden on behalf of the delegation. My colleague  Muhammad Sharif is joining me now and he will talk about the  Syrian media's focus on the delegation's visit.    [Sharif] In fact, the delegation has drawn much of the  attention of the media, including the radio, television, and  local and foreign newspapers here in Syria. Journalists are  accompanying and following the delegation members everywhere.  The attention they have been given has been prominent on the  Syrian radio and television. The news of the delegation, as  well as the interviews with Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab  Darawshah, the head of delegation, and Knesset Member Talab  al-Sani', have occupied a prominent position in the newscasts.  The journalists also took interest in their fellow journalists  and conducted interviews with them. They were keen to ask  questions about Israeli politics and party affairs.    Papers issued here today highlighted the delegation's visit  on their front pages and published pictures of the delegation  members. Papers also highlighted the celebrations marking the 8  March Revolution, which brought the Ba'th Party to power in  Syrian 33 years ago. They also highlighted the speech President  Hafiz al-Asad made last night. This was the first speech to be  made by the president since the death of his son, Basil.    Members of the delegation are being received warmly  everywhere by the Syrian citizens, who are fully aware of the  delegation's visit and who are following with interest the  delegation's visits, activities, and meetings.    The meetings between some of the delegation members and  their  relatives or people from their hometowns who live in Damascus,  for the first time in over 40 years, were really touching. Many  Palestinians have flocked to the hotel to inquire about their  relatives and kinsfolk in their hometowns.    [Kabahah] Tomorrow, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad is  expected to meet with the delegation members, who will offer  condolences on the death of his son, Basil. Other meetings are  expected to be held with other public figures in Syria.    Muhammad Sharif and Qaysar Kabahah from Damascus.</p>

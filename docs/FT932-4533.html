			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland on course to be new Gatt chief MR Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner, still looks likely to be appointed director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade when Gatt members meet this afternoon in special session. This is despite a vigorous Latin American challenge to his candidacy to succeed Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general since 1980, who retires at the end of this month. Some Latin American countries indicated yesterday they were preparing to join a consensus in Mr Sutherland's favour. This remains contingent on 'satisfactory understandings' with other Gatt members on how the world trade body should be run. The group has already made clear its interest in the third deputy director-general post likely to be created at today's meeting. Trade officials have informally discussed a 'package' which would give Mr Sutherland deputies from the US, India and Latin America. Japan also has a candidate in mind for the third deputy job but this is unlikely to prove acceptable to developing countries. Deputy appointments are made by the director-general 'in consultation with' Gatt members. Latin American officials say their motives in backing alternative candidates to Mr Sutherland were never to force a split in the 111-nation organisation, but to open up the succession debate and serve notice that, in future, the selection process and Gatt itself will have to be more democratic. Late last week, Mr Luis Fernando Jaramillo of Colombia withdrew his name, leaving Uruguay's veteran trade negotiator, Mr Julio Lacarte-Muro, as Mr Sutherland's sole rival. No one has questioned Mr Sutherland's abilities - 'excellent' and 'impressive' seem to be the most commonly-employed adjectives to describe the 47-year-old Irish lawyer, who is currently chairman of Allied Irish Banks. But many developing countries were offended by the assumption that, once nominated by the Community and backed by the US, Mr Sutherland was a shoe-in for Gatt's top job. For the Latin Americans there was the further indignity that their two nominees, first proposed when Mr Sutherland was reportedly reluctant to stand, appeared to be discarded without a hearing. Latin American and other developing countries have argued recently for a more open process of selection than the traditional Gatt procedure of consensus-building through informal consultations. These, by common consent, have been conducted 'impeccably' by Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador and current chairman of Gatt's contracting parties (members). In the end, Mr Lacarte failed to get much support from outside Latin America. His supporters are disappointed but not downhearted. 'We've helped the process to be more transparent and more multilateral,' says one ambassador. As a direct result, he says, Mr Sutherland has been twice to Geneva to meet Gatt ambassadors - though on EC advice he turned down an invitation to appear before Gatt's informal developing country group. Community officials argued this could undermine Mr Zutshi's efforts at consensus-building and encourage politicisation of Gatt, hitherto remarkably free from North-South conflict. The Latin Americans say they wanted to make a broader point about the conduct of Gatt affairs and the hoped-for conclusion this year of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. 'It's a signal that developing countries, and Latin America in particular, will not just accept anything that's put on the table,' says a senior negotiator.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       OECD Export Credit Rates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development announced new minimum interest rates (%) for officially-supported export credits for June 15 to July 14 (May 15 to June 14 in brackets)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- D-Mark                            7.51 (7.47) Ecu                               8.00 (8.07) French franc                      7.97 (8.24) Guilder up to 5 years                     7.30 (7.30) 5 to 8.5 years                    7.55 (7.50) more than 8.5 years               8.05 (8.00) Italian lira                      11.7 (12.4) Yen                               5.20 (4.90) Peseta                           12.10 (12.7) Sterling                           8.20 (7.9) Swiss franc                       5.82 (5.88) US dollar for credits up to 5 years                     5.40 (5.30) 5 to 8.5 years                    6.20 (6.13) more than 8.5 years               6.66 (6.59)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally in the middle of the month.

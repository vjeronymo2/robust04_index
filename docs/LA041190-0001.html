			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, MULRONEY HAVE A BALL AT BASEBALL SUMMIT  </P> <P> President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada met in a summit  conference Tuesday that will go down in history -- if it goes down at all --  far less for what was declaimed and decided than for where it took place -- the  newest, most high-tech baseball park in the major leagues.  </P> <P> Although no records are kept on such matters, it is probably safe to assume  that two powerful leaders have never met in a locale so oddly suited for  political discourse.  </P> <P> Bush and Mulroney met and dined and talked to the press at various lounges and  rooms of the SkyDome, home of the American League's Toronto Blue Jays, for four  hours before the game with the Texas Rangers began.  </P> <P> Several significant issues were raised, among them the upcoming summit between  Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Canadian-American  free-trade agreement, acid rain and this summer's economic summit in Houston.  </P> <P> But there are no real divisive issues between the two neighboring countries or  between the two politicians, and it was hard to imagine that anything of great  moment had been settled. It was a chance for review rather than pronouncement.  </P> <P> And baseball, as might be expected from the site of the sessions, seemed to  intrude everywhere.  </P> <P> Mulroney, for example, could not keep from boasting at a joint news conference  that the Blue Jays would "inflict terrible damage" on the Rangers in their home  opener.  </P> <P> Bush, in mock retaliation, told everyone in the Texas locker room later that,  in view of what Mulroney had said, he was rooting for the Rangers, a team owned  in part by the President's eldest son, George Walker Bush.  </P> <P> The President wore a Texas jacket and Mulroney a Toronto jacket as they threw  out the first balls, lobs that hit the catchers' mitts but had little power or  spin on them.  </P> <P> Domestic Canadian politics intruded on the opening game ceremonies twice. The  Toronto crowd booed lustily when a trio of singers known as Blue Rodeo sang a  verse of the Canadian national anthem in French. The bilingual policy of the  Canadian government has provoked an English-language-only campaign in parts of  Ontario.  </P> <P> The crowd booed even more when Mulroney was introduced. The garrulous prime  minister with a gift for silken speech has reached the nadir of his popularity  in public opinion polls in Canada.  </P> <P> Bush and Mulroney then settled in to watch the game. They left after five  innings of an eventual 2-1 Toronto victory. The President returned to  Washington late Tuesday.  </P> <P> There were some serious moments at a joint news conference before the game.  Bush, for example, said that while the foreign policy of a country does not  depend on one individual, it is important to keep in mind that Gorbachev has  "demonstrated an openness and a commitment to reform and openness inside that's  remarkable."  </P> <P> Asked if he thought Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi's intervention to help gain  the release of a French-Belgian couple and their child could presage an  improvement in U.S.-Libyan relations, Bush said: "If, indeed, a person deserves  credit for facilitating the release of people held against their will -- anyone  in the world -- I would certainly say, fine, give the person credit. I don't  know enough about the facts of this release."  </P> <P> But, at least publicly, the day belonged to baseball. The President was  grinning as Texas Manager Bobby Valentine led him and the prime minister  through the visitors' locker room before the game.  </P> <P> The President shook everyone's hand and stopped to chat with ace pitcher Nolan  Ryan.  </P> <P> "Good start," he told Ryan, who gave up no hits in five innings in his victory  over Toronto in the Rangers' home opener Monday.  </P> <P> The President also grabbed the night's starter for Texas, knuckleballer Charlie  Hough, and announced, "I've got to talk to him about my pitch." But, if Hough  gave him any pointers, it was not evident in Bush's opening throw a few minutes  later.  </P> <P> In the Toronto locker room, Bush came upon players holding baseballs for him to  autograph. The President signed for all who asked but warned, "I hope you have  some balls left to play with."  </P> <P> When photographers asked Bush and Mulroney to pose with Toronto slugger George  Bell, the Dominican player turned to the President and said, "You're used to  cameras, too?"  </P> <P> Long before the President arrived in Toronto, he had baseball on his mind.  Talking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Bush, accompanied by Commissioner  of Baseball Fay Vincent, fielded questions about Lithuania and nuclear  disarmament.  </P> <P> And he even offered a bit of news when he told them that, unlike Secretary of  State James A. Baker III and White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, he  was not disappointed by the results of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze's visit to Washington last week. But the impatient President  finally wondered aloud if anyone was ever going to ask him questions about the  great national pastime. That immediately elicited a flurry of questions about  baseball.  </P> <P> Should we call it the national pastime in Canada?  </P> <P> "Well, I think we want to get them to buy into that definition," the President  replied. "That's why we're going."  </P> <P> Are you going to throw a curve?  </P> <P> "I'm going to go with a slider this time," Bush said. "I've had such good luck  in the last couple of years. The catcher let me down one time when he couldn't  get into the dirt and grab it properly."  </P> <P> Are you working on your stuff, Mr. President?  </P> <P> "No, no. Nolan will handle the fast one, and I'll go with the stuff."  </P></p>

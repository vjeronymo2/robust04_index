			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Venezuela acts over economy Venezuela's cabinet this week approved an outline economic stabilisation plan designed to attack inflation and bolster government revenues. Approval of the final version is expected next week. The move has been prompted by a deteriorating economic background. Venezuela's GDP contracted by 1 per cent last year and the recession has deepened this year. Officials have not released details of the programme, but it is expected to include the following elements: Staggered increases in the retail price of petrol on the domestic market. High-octane petrol currently only costs about 13 US cents per US gallon at the pump in Venezuela, which loses PDVSA, the national oil company, millions of dollar a year and cuts potential income to the Treasury. The government hopes to offset the effects of higher prices by giving a special monthly bonus to workers. Commitment to reform the system of accumulated severance benefits for workers. The present system carries a high cost for public and private sector employers and discourages the creation of new jobs. A new type of government bond, denominated in dollars (or linked to the value of the dollar), which is meant to replace zero-coupon bonds issued weekly by the central bank to absorb excess liquidity in the financial system. The government believes that the zero-coupon bonds, denominated in Venezuelan bolivars, carry an excessively high cost.</p>

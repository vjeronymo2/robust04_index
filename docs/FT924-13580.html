			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Wave of protests over pit closures: Conservative MPs, church leaders and unions attack government on job losses A NATIONWIDE wave of pro-tests hit the government yesterday over its drastic programme of pit closures as several Conservative MPs openly criticised Tuesday's announcement of the loss of 30,000 coalminers' jobs. With ministers braced for a sharp increase in unemployment figures today, Tory backbenchers joined church leaders and unions to charge Mr John Major's administration with insensitivity and a failure to grasp the human dimensions of the recession. As the public furore grew, the government suffered a new blow when the European Commission turned down a request for an extra Pounds 24.7m to help mining regions hit by the shutdowns. The depth and savagery of the cuts in the British coal industry also provoked nearly unanimous condemnation from usually loyal Conservative newspapers. In a full-page editorial, the Daily Express accused ministers of 'drifting aimlessly' and being 'too little concerned' by the rising rate of business failures. 'Above all, we deserve and require leadership,' it said. Coming in the wake of job losses at Lucas Industries and Vickers' failure to win a Pounds 1bn tank order from Kuwait, many critics targeted the prime minister for failing to tackle the recession with sufficient urgency. Lord Ridley, former trade and industry secretary, warned that without 'drastic' cuts in interest rates the country faced a slump worse than that of the 1930s. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Conservative MP for the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen, called for the reversal of the pit closures, saying dependence on imports was 'strategically dangerous' for the long-term health of the econ-omy. Mr John Carlisle, Tory MP for Luton North, said that, in devastating the lives of thousands, the government was showing it was 'not fit to govern'. Churchmen added their protests with the Bishop of Sheffield describing the cuts as 'wicked' and Dr John Habgood, the Archbishop of York, condemning them as 'economic madness'. The closures have fuelled a growing clamour for a new industrial policy alongside demands for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Such sentiments were widely voiced at a small business conference in Surrey yesterday despite efforts by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, to stress the need for competitiveness and the recession's international dimensions. Meanwhile, Mr Tim Eggar, the coal minister, resisted calls to reconsider the closures. 'It was an appalling decision to have to make, but it is a completely unavoidable decision,' he said, ruling out any reversal. Labour seized on the tide of protest, warning that the pit closures would mean the loss of as many as 50,000 more jobs in related industries at an additional cost to the Treasury of some Pounds 650m. Party officials said they would press for a statement when the Commons returned on Monday and would use opposition parliamentary time to debate the issue later in the week. Mr John Smith, the party leader, denounced the cuts as 'senseless economics and energy madness'. Labour officials now believe the government is caught in an intractable dilemma. Either it can hold firm and slash public expenditure, thereby breaching at least some of its manifesto commitments, or it must make a policy U-turn and take up Labour proposals for an employment action programme and incentives for industry. Many Conservative MPs privately share this analysis, adding that an alternative option - tax increases - may be the only solution, although this too would be in contravention of the party's election promises.

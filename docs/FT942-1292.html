			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper attains new high as oil prices fall further Leading contracts at the London Metal Exchange built on Wednesday's rally yesterday with copper touching fresh 21-month highs at one point. But oil prices and soft commodities extended their falls. Having tested downside support on Wednesday morning the LME copper contract challenged overhead resistance in early trading yesterday, when the three months delivery position peaked at Dollars 2,507 a tonne. But profit-taking was attracted at that level and the market quickly shed about Dollars 30. Renewed buying took it back to Dollars 2,483.50 a tonne at the close, up Dollars 32 on the day. Dealers did not think that the stalling of the rally signalled the end of coppers' bull run, which has seen prices soar from 1994 lows of Dollars 1,725. 'It looks to have found good support on the dips and should bounce back towards Dollars 2,500,' one told the Reuter news agency. He added that today's announcement of the level of stocks in LME warehouses 'could be the key'. The earlier highs were attributed mainly to robust demand in after hours trading on Wednesday, which sparked covering against short positions, speculative interest and Chinese buying. Aluminium was also lifted early in the session by reports of Chinese buying and fresh speculative interest. At one stage the three months position hit fresh a three-year high of Dollars 1,492 a tonne before easing back in line with copper. It closed at Dollars 1,487.50 a tonne, up Dollars 16 from Wednesday. Lead received a boost from commission house buying and European trade interest, which helped to lift three months metal from a late afternoon low of Dollars 555.50 a tonne to Dollars 560 in after hours trading. Although oil prices fell yesterday, traders remained optimistic that fundamentals were still positive and that the underlying upward trend was intact. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for August delivery was Dollars 17.10 a barrel in late London trading yesterday, after having closed at Dollars 17.48 on Wednesday. Mr Lindsay Horn, trader at the London office of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, said yesterday's correction was tantamount to the market 'stopping to change horses'. He said Brent was holding up well given the fact that most of the upward price pressure had been on West Texas Intermediate because of supply bottlenecks in the US Midwest. At the London Commodity Exchange meanwhile robusta coffee prices continued their downwards movement after Brazil's announcement on Wednesday that it would sell 300,000 bags to exporters over the next two months. The September futures contract slipped by Dollars 39 to Dollars 2,240 a tonne, deepening losses made on Wednesday, when the New York market was weak. In spite of early strength, cocoa prices followed coffee downwards on fairly heavy selling by speculators. The second position futures price in London fell by Pounds 25 a tonne to Pounds 975 a tonne.</p>

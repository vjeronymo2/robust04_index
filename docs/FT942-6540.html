			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Sharper TV coverage heaves into view The television pictures transmitted from the decks of heaving yachts during the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race may not have completely satisfied the most fastidious engineer. But they were as near broadcast quality as makes no difference. The Yacht Video System meant that for the first time broadcasters could receive news clips of life on board the competing boats, even when they were far out at sea. Last week Craig Woolf and David Tilson, the two engineers who put the operational system together in British Telecommunications' laboratories, received a Royal Television Society's Technology award for their achievement. BT initially planned the Yacht Video System as a demonstration and promotional exercise. Now it is starting to see the business potential. The system could be used by broadcasters for transmitting pictures from a moving vehicles in remote terrain. Cruise lines are also showing interest in using the system in reverse to deliver television news bulletins by satellite to ships in the middle of oceans.</p>

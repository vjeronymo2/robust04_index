			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of the temporary administration in the zone of  the Ossetian-Ingush conflict Vladimir Lozovoy said that the  state of emergency will be imposed only on a small part of the  Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy regions of Ingushetia.    Asked by IF's correspondent about the possibility of  excluding this provision from a draft decree on extension of the  state of emergency in the conflict zone, Lozovoy said: "I do not  know why this question arises. We agreed on it with the Ingush  president and he had no objections to it."    "These parts of the Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy regions  will  perform the role of a buffer zone to prevent penetration of  militants in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict," Lozovoy  said.    In the meantime, in neighboring Chechnya armed forces were  put on alert in connection with the possible expansion of the  state of emergency in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict.    Groznyy assessed the intention to include the Sunzhenskiy  and  Malgobekskiy regions of Ingushetia in the state of emergency  zone as "an act of open armed aggression." With the lack of an  administrative border between Chechnya and Ingushetia these  regions are a subject of dispute between the two republics.</p>

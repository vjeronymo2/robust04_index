			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / IMF chief rejects US call for lower interest rates THE US administration clashed with the head of the International Monetary Fund yesterday over how to revive the world economy and restore order in financial markets. Welcoming delegates to the IMF/World Bank annual meeting in Washington, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, called for lower world interest rates, arguing that this was the best route to increases in investment, productivity and living standards. 'When interest rates remain high for whatever reason, the returns on investment stay sterile in the banking system', he said. He was responding to a call on Monday from Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and chairman of the IMF's policy-making interim committee, for an increase in US interest rates. However, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director took a diametrically opposite position to Mr Brady, calling on Germany and the US to take immediate steps to cut their budget deficits but warning against a premature relaxation of monetary policy. 'Some will tell you that it could be safe now to relax monetary discipline and so give a boost to activity . . . but this would be the most serious mistake we could make today.' It was the weakness of fiscal and structural policies that had undermined confidence, caused high long-term interest rates and hindered growth, Mr Camdessus said. 'I urge prompt action to ensure speedy and lasting fiscal consolidation in the US and Germany. I would also recommend firm fiscal action in other European countries, most notably Italy', he said. Firm action to reduce deficits was sensible despite signs of a hesitant world economic recovery. 'Any further postponement of fiscal retrenchment out of concern for possible short-term effects on activity would contribute to a worse environment,' he added. On the other hand, 'credible action to reduce budget deficits would improve confidence, lower inflationary expectations and produce a downward adjustment of long-term interest rates. All these would more than offset any short-term contractionary impact,' he said. US still grappling with Russian debt, Page 4</p>

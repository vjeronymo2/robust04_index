			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Details" program; by presenter Nikolay Svanidze] </F>   [Text] Russia will shortly have one more president. Air  Force One is currently in flight. In 90 minutes, it will land  at Vnukovo- 2 Airport. By the aircraft steps, Bill Clinton will  be met by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and this  will mark the start of the American President's official  three-day visit to Russia.    On his way to Moscow, President Bill Clinton visited Prague.  Incidentally, he is flying on his own at the moment, without his  family. His wife, Lady Hillary, no less well known than  himself, and, possibly, his daughter Chelsea as well, will join  him the day after tomorrow. Two-and-a-half hours ago, he should  have had a brief conversation with Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk at Kiev's Borispol Airport. One day earlier, President  Bill Clinton attended the NATO Council session. [Video shows a  meeting in progress with an inset of a statue of an angel;  Russian troops talking; man presenting a box of candy to a  little girl; NATO Secretary General Woerner meeting Czech  President Havel, then Polish President Walesa].    Apparently, the North Atlantic bloc advertizes itself so  well  in its publicity material, and Russia so dubiously in its  elections, that our neighbors in Eastern Europe and the Baltic  area are knocking on NATO's door like piglets running away from  the wolf. Unlike the bold piglets, though, the Europeans won't  hide from us anywhere: we'll get them wherever they are, if we  want to. Both Clinton and the NATO leadership are well aware of  that.    The December elections in Russia frightened world public  opinion with the prospect of a communist comeback or the reign  of national- fascists -- the most unpredictable and,  consequently, alarming consequences. There was also another  apprehension.    And then a man appeared who just talked, and that talking  was  enough to resurrect many old suspicions since the cold war and  to excite politicians, and I do not rule out that now, like a  tuning- fork, he says that's how one should be, and many rather  unprincipled politicians may also follow that path. [Video  shows Svanidze talking to Kozyrev]    [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Are President Yeltsin and you,  as foreign minister, not tempted now to strike a statuesque  pose, adopt a facial expression that is as patriotic as possible  and talk far tougher to Clinton than he talks to Russia?    [Kozyrev] We shall do the same has we have been doing. We  have always talked quite tough, it must be said. [end recording]  [Video shows Yeltsin inspecting troops]    Both Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of Western countries have  displayed resilience in the situation that has arisen. The  Russian president has raised his eyebrows. Everything is under  way. There is no reason for hysterics. If the West adopts a  fair attitude toward Ukraine's attempt to revise nuclear  agreements and toward the massive panic-stricken exodus of the  former brothers-in-socialism towards NATO, he, Yeltsin, won't  understand that. [Video shows EC meeting; Kravchuk speaking;  Lithuanian President Brazauskas talking to Yeltsin; Clinton  joking with Havel]    The subtle hint was taken. Clinton and other Western  leaders, who were under intense pressure last week from those  who favor a change in policy toward Moscow and, above all,  toward Yeltsin, kept their nerve. In fact, the West was facing  a dilemma. Either to throw the doors open to all-comers and  thus build up a strong defensive cordon on Russia's western  borders right now, in case the Russians want a bit of a fight.  These tactics threaten to stiffen militarist sentiments and to  bolster the extremist radical wing in Russia itself. Or to  relax, not make a fuss, and realize that, if the Russians go mad  and move their tanks in, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic,  and Slovakia can't be saved anyway. And so, whoever is accepted  into what, there will be no stable Europe without a stable  Russia. Eastern Europe itself probably understands that and is  relying more on monetary than on military assistance. But the  West doesn't have a bottomless pocket. [Svanidze is seen  talking to Kozyrev]    [Begin Kozyrev recording] NATO has not been intimidated by  the hasty demands for a quantitative expansion of its ranks. We  were against that, and it must be said that the American  "Partnership for Peace" blueprint actually envisages a lengthy  stage, as they see it, of preparing the new states for entry to  NATO. Here there is some difference of emphasis between us. We  do not put the emphasis on preparation for entry to NATO,  although we do not rule out the possibility that, at some stage,  Russia itself may become a member of NATO. Why not? But the  main thing is not that we shall be in some kind of preparatory  class. The main thing for us is the actual period, a  sufficiently lengthy and substantive period, of partnership.  What is meant by that? Joint maneuvers, training of  peacekeeping troops, let's say, for areas of conflict, and so on  and so forth. [end recording] [Video shows Clinton next to  Delors and other EC leaders]    At the NATO session, the partners proceeded from the view  that the hasty acceptance of East European countries into the  organization would lead to the destabilization of Europe. This  was reflected mildly in the adopted program "Partnership for  Peace," which is open to Russia so long as we have the good  fortune to observe one of the program's principles -- civilian  control of the military. [Video shows Clinton at EC meeting;  ship's guns firing; Georgiy Arbatov, academician, Russian  Academy of Sciences, appears]    [Begin Arbatov recording] Today we have less civilian  control  of the army than we had even before perestroyka. [end recording]  [Video: another sequence from the Kozyrev interview]    [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Has the influence of the  military on the drawing up of foreign policy not grown stronger  recently?    [Kozyrev] No. People have usually said that ever since,  let's  say, the tragic events in October. Now they say that the  president or the whole government are dancing to the tune of the  military because they are obliged to them, and so on. No,  there's no such thing. That's wrong.    [Svanidze] There's no dancing?    [Kozyrev] No. As for bearing them in mind -- yes. We bear  them in mind. [end recording]    It is beyond doubt that this whole collection of issues  connected with Eastern Europe and NATO will be among the most  important at the Moscow talks. A second substantial item is the  problem of nuclear security and relations with Ukraine. The  third is the problem of aid. President Boris Yeltsin will  undoubtedly insist that it should be spelled out in detail.  There will also undoubtedly be discussion here of the 43,000  million dollars that were earmarked for us by the G-7 and which  are essential to the continuation of reform in Russia. [Video  shows more of the Kozyrev interview]    [Begin Kozyrev recording] We shall raise the question of its  being in the form of help for our emergence on to the  international market, and for the activation of our own economy,  while we concern ourselves with our unemployed. [end recording]  [Video shows back to Arbatov]    [Begin Arbatov recording] I get the impression, quite  frankly, and I think the Americans will think of it too,  perhaps: was the game worth the candle? [end recording]    Western Europe and the United States are following our  reforms closely. But today, exactly a month after the  parliamentary elections in Russia, the U.S. President is flying  to see us, and it can confidently be said that one change in the  American and Western approach to events in Russia has already  taken place. Today they are more interested in our stability  than in the pace of our reforms. [Video shows more of the  Kozyrev interview]    [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Do you equate the work of the  president with work for Russia, work for democratic...?    [Kozyrev, interrupting] Yes, because this president was  elected by the people, and his mandate was confirmed by the  people. Will the people vote for a different president? I  don't know whether I will. It will depend on what that  president's character is like. But, at any rate, he will  personify Russia. The constitution says that the president is  the head of state, and he determines foreign policy. [end  recording] [Video shows Kozyrev standing beside Yeltsin]    In fact, Kozyrev has recently been operating hand in glove  with President Yeltsin, which is rare. He clearly has a subtle  understanding of Yeltsin. [Video shows Clinton addressing an  audience; brief clip of German President Kohl]    Clinton seems to understand him, too. At the meeting in  Brussels, when greeting Chancellor Kohl, a man of solid build,  Clinton said: Helmut, I thought of you all night as I watched  sumo wrestling on television. I wonder what Bill Clinton  associates with President Yeltsin.</p>

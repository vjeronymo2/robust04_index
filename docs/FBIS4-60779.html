			<p>BFN     [Text] Director of the technical center of Lithuanian radio  and television, Yuosas Niverauskas, has reported that from May 2  there will be a considerable reduction in the broadcasting of  the Russian Ostankino television channel in Lithuania.    He said that this was a result of the fact that Ostankino  owed a million litai (approx. 250,000 dollars). Programs will  only be broadcast from 18:00 local time (19:00 Moscow time).    As the debt question remains unresolved it is unclear how  much longer even evening broadcasting will continue.    The remaining time -- from 1:00 to 18:00 -- may well be  leased to the Litpolinter private studio.    As of next week, Niverauskas said, broadcast of the Mayak  radio station will be suspended, also because of debt. It is  suggested that relay stations now broadcasting Mayak lease their  time to private radio companies.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: When Vienna was red THE Karl-Marx-Hof, that austere 1920s block of workers' flats, is the most obvious monument of Vienna's socialist administration in the 11 years from 1922. But it is only one example among many; the city council built 65.000 dwelling units in that period, as well as pioneering an enormous programme of social legislation. A new exhibition in the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna covers all of this and transports us back to an age of political idealism. While the Austrian republic was being proclaimed from the steps of the Vienna parliament house on November 12 1918, some of the more extreme adherents of the city's socialist majority tore the white stripes out of the Austrian flag and flew the red which remained. The country's Christian Socialist government duly got the message and separated Vienna administratively from Lower Austria to seal off the socialist virus. Vienna, now quasi-independent, set about tackling the enormous problems of poverty and underprivilege that existed in the city. The city council introduced measures which have today become part of the baggage of all political parties, more or less, but which were revolutionary then. It introduced programmes of mother-and-child care, and set up medical care, advisory services, orphan homes; it built swimming baths and paddling pools. It built the Vienna stadium in the Prater and organised a Workers' Olympics in 1931. Under Otto Sloeckel it reorganised education, breaking with the tradition of military-style discipline and adopting curricula and teaching methods more suitable to the child. Notes for a speech by Gloekel, displayed at the exhibition, sum up its ambition: to form 'sincere, happy, hard-working and morally sound republicans'. One is uncomfortably reminded of those red banners inscribed with slogans that used to hang across so many streets in eastern and central Europe. The difference is that in the 1920s it was still possible to believe in the Message. Culturally, Red Vienna had big ambitions; it aimed to open the whole field of bourgeois high culture to the working class and believed that was what it really wanted. It also put on symphony concerts for workers; it even tried to set up people's universities. The art it produced consisted mainly of statuary glorifying heroic labour, like Otto Hoffner's Youth With A Hammer. But there was also political cabaret (though not of a very high standard) and of course hundreds of posters, some hectoring and accusatory, some celebratory of organised labour: a long hoarding of these has been put up outside the museum; you have to walk past it before you go in. And there are all those flats. The exhibition renders a service by reminding us just how many and varied they were, and that they were not really an innovation: even before the turn of the century Vienna had started building workers' accommodation to the pattern later adopted by Karl Ehn and other architects, namely rectangular blocks around a central green space. Most of them are in the Bauhaus-inspired style of the 1920s. The Karl-Marx-Hof is stark and functional, but with little towers at intervals and sets of three balconies one above the other like the wrinkles on a furrowed brow. But others are more graceful - for example Hubert Gessner's Reumann-Hof. One block, the Heim-Hof, had no kitchens in its flats; instead, there was an excellent communal canteen which the Nazis closed down after the anschluss. The tenants then had to build little cooking niches for themselves. Even before the Nazis came, Dolfuss had sacked the Vienna City Council and replaced it by a nominated mayor and corporation. There was a concerted rising against him in 1934, bloodily put down. The Karl-Marx-Hof was bombarded with artillery. You can still see most of the flats in various parts of the city today. The humbler, more practical work of Red Vienna still stands. What seems to have vanished without trace is its high-flown political rhetoric: who believes in the New Socialist Man today?</p>

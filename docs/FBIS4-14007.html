			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Umar Salih Farwanah and Dr. Sa'ud </F> al-Shawwa, identified as leaders of Hamas in Gaza, by Muhammad  al-Hinnawi in Tel Aviv; date not given -- interviewees not  identified in response]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Hinnawi] How will you deal  with the new Palestinian authority that will emerge in Gaza and  Jericho?    [Hamas] It will be a relationship of cooperation and  sympathy  so that we can rebuild the Palestinian house. But at the same  time we will stress the Palestinian people's right to armed  resistance because this was the only way to force the Israelis  to start the Gaza-Jericho negotiations.    [Al-Hinnawi] And where will the armed resistance take place?    [Hamas] Beyond the boundaries of the new Palestinian entity  and wherever the Israeli authority, army, and police exist. The  Palestinian authority will therefore have no responsibility for  these military operations because they will be carried out  outside the self-rule areas. Gosh Qatif, for instance, is not  part of the self-rule region. So it will be a target for our  operations. This applies to the West Bank towns of Hebron,  Nabulus, and others; they will be the venues of operations like  those carried out in 'Afula, Hadera, Tel Aviv, and Yafo.    [Al-Hinnawi] After these operations, will your elements flee  to the self-rule areas and, consequently, create problems  between the Palestinian authority and the Israeli Government?    [Hamas] Those who carried out the latest suicide operations  did not hide in Gaza or Jericho. The Israeli Army could not  find them. Had the army known where they were it would have  captured them. The torch of resistance must remain lit. This  will make Israel feel that there is no use keeping the rest of  the Arab territory.    [Al-Hinnawi] Do you have links with the other Islamic  parties  in the Arab world?    [Hamas] We must first make it clear that we are against all  the terrorist operations that take place in Egypt in the name of  the Islamic groups, such as killing innocent people, killing  Christians, and thefts. We are for a rational and enlightened  Islam that establishes genuine legitimacy.    [Al-Hinnawi] So you are against the liquidations that are  now  taking place in Gaza, something that I saw with my own eyes?    [Hamas] We cannot say there is a struggle and campaign of  liquidation between Hamas and Fatah. Problems do appear  occasionally but they are quickly solved. But those who are  proven to be enemy agents tell a different story.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 LAWYERS WORKING FOR COUNTY FINED $52,000 FOR MISCONDUCT  </P> <P> Attorneys defending Los Angeles County from a lawsuit over a jail inmate's  death were fined more than $52,000 for "egregious" misconduct, the largest fine  ever imposed on a county legal team, court records show.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Haig Kehiayan ruled that Philip S. Miller,  principal deputy county counselor, and Donna Bruce, a private attorney hired to  help him, acted to delay the trial through "bad faith and frivolous actions."  </P> <P> The delays forced the plaintiff's lawyer to do large amounts of unnecessary  work, Kehiayan ruled.  </P> <P> Miller and Bruce were each ordered to pay $22,887 to compensate attorney Allan  F. Grossman for his extra efforts. Two other private attorneys who handled an  appeal for Miller and Bruce were ordered to pay $3,187 for their roles in what  the judge called "unnecessary delays."  </P> <P> The county is appealing the May ruling, which imposes the largest such fine  ever given a county legal team, Bob Pellman, senior assistant county counselor,  said Friday.  </P> <P> The wrongful-death lawsuit was brought by the widow of Stanley Malinovitz, a  North Hollywood man who died after he was strapped to a cot in County Jail for  40 hours, although a Municipal Court commissioner had ordered that he be taken  to a hospital for immediate medical care.  </P> <P> After two days strapped to the cot, Malinovitz died of a pulmonary embolism,  which is often caused by lack of motion. In December, five years after  Malinovitz's death, a San Fernando Superior Court jury awarded his widow and  children $2.5 million. The county is appealing that verdict.  </P> <P> Grossman, who represented the widow, contended in a complaint to the judge  that, before the trial, the county legal team filed many motions and appeals  that were "totally and completely without merit . . . for the sole purpose of  harassing" him by forcing him to prepare responses.  </P> <P> For example, Bruce and Miller sought to have the lawsuit dismissed before the  trial by arguing that Municipal Court Commissioner Charles Peven considered his  court order "advisory." The lawyers argued that Peven would not have issued the  order to move Malinovitz to a hospital if he had known that the inmate was  being held in the jail mental ward.  </P> <P> But the state evidence code prohibits testimony by judges in civil court  proceedings about the intent behind a previous court order.  </P> <P> Grossman also said Miller and Bruce tricked him into wasting days preparing for  the testimony of medical experts who were subsequently never called as  witnesses in the trial.  </P> <P> Although attorneys are regularly fined during civil proceedings for failing to  appear in court or failing to provide information to their opponents, the  nature of the alleged misconduct and the size of the sanctions in the  Malinovitz case are very unusual, some Superior Court judges said.  </P> <P> Assistant County Counselor Robert Ambrose, however, called the sanctions  "nonsensical."  </P> <P> "No one on our team did anything that was illegal or unnecessary," he said.  </P> <P> In court papers filed in response to Grossman's allegations, county lawyers  called Grossman's motion for sanctions an "unwarranted, vituperative and  transparent attempt to intimidate, and to penalize the county, and its counsel  personally, for vigorously and diligently defending the action."  </P> <P> Miller and Bruce said they believed it was legal for Peven to testify about his  court order, and that neither Grossman nor Peven objected to the testimony at  the time. They also said they had valid legal grounds for every motion they  filed, although their arguments were often rejected by the courts.  </P> <P> The two trial attorneys said they chose not to call the many experts designated  as potential defense witnesses because they did not feel Grossman had succeeded  in making points they needed to contradict. In court papers, they contended  they should not be punished for this "legal tactical decision" made during the  trial and should rather be "praised for not lengthening the case."  </P></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / 'Superbike' designer signs contract The designer of the carbon fibre and titanium 'superbike' on which Briton Chris Boardman (above) won a pursuit cycling gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic games has signed a contract to work for Giant, the Taiwanese cycle producer, John Griffiths writes. Mr Michael Burrows said he had become disillusioned with British industry after failing to see his innovative ideas for cycles put into production. Although the 'superbike' was designed by Mr Burrows, its patents are owned by Lotus Engineering, which says the launch of a Pounds 3,000 road-going version of the machine is imminent. Nearly two years have elapsed since Lotus, sold recently by General Motors to Bugatti, announced it was looking for a partner to put the cycle into production. Lotus has designed the roadgoing superbike's components but it is to be assembled by Casket, the cycles and clothing group which has bought the LotuSport brand name. Mr Burrows claims to have made his decision to join Giant only after being ignored by British cycle makers including Raleigh, the UK's biggest producer, which makes 600,000 cycles a year. Raleigh has denied receiving any formal approaches from Mr Burrows. Giant is one of the world's largest cycle manufacturers, making about 1.6m a year, almost entirely for export. It is thus one of the UK industry's fiercest competitors. After the success of his Olympic design, the self-taught Mr Burrows designed another cycle, on which Scot Graeme Obree cycled a world record 51.597 kilometres in an hour last July. 'It's sad that it's not an English company,' said Mr Burrows, who will undertake concept engineering for Giant from his base in Norfolk. 'But their engineers want to learn and it could be the perfect combination. If I can give Giant the technological edge there'll be no stopping them.'</p>

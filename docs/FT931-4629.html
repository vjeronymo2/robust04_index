			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Glynwed's Pounds 33m fails to impress City GLYNWED International, the diversified Midlands engineering group, yesterday reported a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 33.1m for 1992. However, the figure was widely expected in the City and it failed to impress the stock market. The shares, which last week climbed 26p to 291p, were firm immediately after the announcement but a reaction followed and, in moderate trading, they fell 7p on the day to close at 282p. That valued the group at Pounds 580m. For the second year running Glynwed failed to cover its maintained dividend. Mr Gareth Davies, chairman, who promised that 'our fortunes are on the turn', made no apology: 'We did not feel it right to cut when profits are rising,' he said. Earnings per share were 10.95p (8.43p) and a final dividend of 7.5p makes an unchanged total of 11.65p for the fourth year running. A fall in turnover to Pounds 906.4m (Pounds 949.9m) largely reflected lower than average metal prices. However, there was a 10 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 44.8m while a cut in interest charges to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 15.4m) gave an added boost at the pre-tax level. Glynwed's fortunes are now showing the same pattern of recovery that they did after the 1980s recession. The nadir of its fortunes in the current recession was in 1991. But trading conditions remained difficult and Mr Davies attributed the profits recovery, approaching the level of 1986, to reductions in operating costs and increased competitiveness. He warned that 'it will certainly not be before the second half of the year that the benefit of interest rate reductions, and any other economic stimulus, can be expected to have any worthwhile impact on our results.' What Glynwed would like specifically is for the growing number of house reservations to be translated into sales, an expansion of motor exports and a rise in metal prices. 'If these come to pass we shall do well,' Mr Davies asserted. Last year Glynwed continued to take losses in its tubes and fittings division, but profits increased from steels and engineering, were steady on consumer and building products and declined in the plastics and property divisions. COMMENT Glynwed is decently poised for recovery, and a rise in metal prices, which has started to happen in some sectors, would rapidly feed through to the bottom line. The group has been expert in the past in wringing profits from staid businesses - indeed, the return on capital employed went up to 15.5 per cent from 12.4 per cent last year. But that route to higher profits looks played out for the immediate future, pitching Glynwed's prospects firmly on to those of the UK economy. A modest upturn would make brokers' estimates of pre-tax profits of Pounds 45m for 1993 look a realistic estimate. That would translate to earnings per share of 15p, putting the shares at yesterday's price of 282p on a prospective p/e of 18.8, high enough if it is assumed that some part of the corporate recovery is already built into the price.</p>

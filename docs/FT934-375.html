			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Current account surplus shrinks by 20.6 per cent Japan's current account surplus shrank by 20.6 per cent in the 12 months to November, the first fall in six months. A finance ministry official said the figures showed that export volumes were levelling off or declining, while import volumes were steadily growing. The fall, to Dollars 8.21bn (Pounds 5.47bn), was larger than most economists had expected from the 5.4 per cent fall in the trade surplus, announced this month. This was because services, not included in the trade account, swung unexpectedly from a surplus of Dollars 1.1bn in November 1992 to a deficit of Dollars 202m last month. A fall in the yen's value against the dollar also played a part. In yen terms, the current account surplus declined more steeply, to Y885.1bn (Pounds 5.32bn), down 30.9 per cent from November last year.</p>

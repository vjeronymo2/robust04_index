			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: An acquisition with logic - Sedgwick's purchase of Noble Lowndes SEDGWICK GROUP was quick yesterday to defend its proposed acquisition of Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy, from TSB Group on both price and business logic. At Pounds 110m, the purchase is priced at more than three times the company's net assets of Pounds 33.9m and nearly 10 times pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.5m in the year to October 31 1992. But Mr Stuart Tarrant, Sedgwick's group finance director, preferred to stress that the acquisition is for less than the company's turnover during the past year of Pounds 122.5m. Sedgwick argues that Noble Lowndes is an important part of the benefits consulting sector with a strong brand image, which fits in neatly with its own consulting services division. Last year, its own employee benefits consultancy reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.1m. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive of Sedgwick, said yesterday: 'It has been our stated strategy to develop our business in two clearly defined areas, worldwide insurance and reinsurance, and consulting services. We consider the employee benefits field offers significant potential for long-term growth.' He highlighted the scope for increased business from the budgetary pressures on governments, the changing demographic structure of developed countries and the reviews of employee benefits instigated by many companies as a result. Mr Tarrant also stressed the potential for considerable cross-selling between Noble Lowndes and Sedgwick's existing clients, particularly in the middle market. He was also keen to point out yesterday what he believes is substantial scope for improved margins, particularly in the US. 'They bought six different businesses in the US, and I'm not sure the rationalisation is fully completed,' he said. 'Our view of the US is very positive.' Noble Lowndes, which was acquired along with Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, in 1987 did not fit easily into TSB's collection of businesses. Its disposal marks a further step towards the bank's stated intention of concentrating on retail banking and insurance for mass market customers. Sir Nicholas Goodison, the TSB chairman, emphasised yesterday that Noble Lowndes was a 'discreet' business despite being profit-making. 'It is a particular type of expertise and a particular culture. It was always relatively small, and there was no obvious synergy for us,' he said. TSB has accelerated the rate at which it has disposed of businesses recently, although Sir Nicholas emphasises that this strategy has been in place for three years. It agreed to sell Swan National Leasing, its vehicle contract hire arm to the leasing business of Midland Bank last month. The bank has a greater managerial than financial incentive to dispose of businesses. It is already well-capitalised, despite the large losses on lending through Hill Samuel. Its Tier 1 ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets stands at 8.1 per cent - well above international standards. But the bank has made little secret of wanting to divest businesses outside retail financial services - inclu- ding Hill Samuel - in order to focus its management on a single type of operation. This would mark a return to TSB's roots as a retail savings bank before acquisitions in the late-1980s. The bank has already added Pounds 58m to its Pounds 1.3bn of Tier 1 capital by selling Swan National Leasing; the Noble Lowndes disposal will increase that further. Probably as important, the bank has been seen to achieve a good price despite fairly publicly offering several businesses for sale. The biggest strategic question for TSB is whether the Noble Lowndes sale is a precursor to that of Hill Samuel. The bank has been trying to re-focus Hill Samuel as a merchant bank, concentrating on corporate finance and advisory services, after removing Pounds 1.6bn of poor debt into a separate unit. Sir Nicholas insisted that yesterday's disclosure was 'irrelevant' to Hill Samuel. But the upturn in acquisition activity which the sale signals can hardly be bad for TSB's chances of getting an offer for the merchant bank which satisfies the barrier of returning value to shareholders.</p>

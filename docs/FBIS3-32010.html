In a discussion with German journalists during the predawn  hours today at the Cuban beach resort of Varadero, Castro added,  nevertheless, that Cuba, despite the boycott, is capable of  "surviving these more difficult times."    "Clinton seems to be a man of peace," especially concerned  by  his country's domestic problems, "but U.S. presidents have huge  power limitations," the Cuban president said.    Castro said Cuban exiles in the United States exert great  pressure on the Washington Government. The Cuban president said  for the United States "the problem with Cuba is a domestic  problem, not a foreign one."    Castro expressed gratitude for European economic aid,  particularly German aid to Cuba, during the official  inauguration of a new Cuban hotel operated by Germans. "Germany  is a very important player in today's world, not only for Cuban  economic interests but also for Third World interests," Castro  said.</p>

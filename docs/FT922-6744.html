			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Afghan leaders sign agreement RIVAL Afghan guerrilla factions announced an accord yesterday to pull back their forces and abandon war as a means of solving problems, AP reports from Kabul. The agreement, negotiated by a neutral guerrilla party, also created a peacekeeping force. It banished from the interim government all high-ranking members of the ousted Communist regime. The accord, however, still did not address a knot of political differences between guerrilla factions led by the Islamic fundamentalist Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, defence minister.</p>

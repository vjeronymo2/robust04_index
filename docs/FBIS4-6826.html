			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry  instructed commanders of major military units Saturday to stay  on full alert for North Korean troop movements.    Over 50 commanding officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force  and Joint Chiefs of Staff attended a meeting at the ministry  held to analyze the latest developments in the North Korean  nuclear impasse and Pyongyang's military movements.    The meeting, presided over by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae,  concluded that North Korea has not showed any signs of forward  movement but that the North's conventional troops still pose a  threat of attack.    The commanders also decided that North Korea is unlikely to  abandon its nuclear program despite South Korean-U.S. efforts at  dialogue, leaving the issue clouded by uncertainty.    North Korean aggression cannot be ruled out if the matter is  referred to the UN Security Council for sanctions, they said.    Yi instructed the military to support the government's  policy  on resolving the nuclear crisis through dialogue, while  remaining on full alert to deter any attack and maintaining an  early warning system in cooperation with the United States.    Yi asked the armed forces to prepare for the South  Korean-U.S. joint military exercise "Team Spirit," scheduled to  open in November unless the nuclear problem is sufficiently  defused.</p>

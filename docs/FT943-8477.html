			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Management: Aesop's business legacy - Why business schools use modern parables to teach their students Organisations, like individuals, have one thing in common: they are all different. Each company is unique even if its products are not. If this is true, why do students of business try to learn from case studies? Can general principles be grasped by looking at unique examples? Are case histories just entertaining stories of business success and failure or the Aesop's fables of the 20th century? Business experts and textbook authors are aware of the appeal of the case history. With the zeal of an evangelical preacher, US business gurus such as Tom Peters tell stories of how, often by making the most simple changes, organisations were saved from bankruptcy and their employees from redundancy. Less attractive, perhaps, are the smug autobiographies by millionaires recounting their own 'tea-boy to managing director' tale. Many best-selling business books are simply a catalogue of interesting and unusual case histories which are used to illustrate a specific point. Business textbooks also often use case studies to illustrate what they teach. For scientists and social scientists alike, the idea of teaching by parable is bizarre. Does management science have no facts, formulae or theories which can be taught by conventional methods? Physics and mathematics have their axioms; but the principles of management science are constantly changing. Advocates of teaching with case histories argue that the system has specific benefits. First, case studies are realistic and highly relevant. They are not abstract and not based on jargon. Students can easily identify with the everyday examples from the real world. Second, the stories are much more memorable than dry formulae. Third, and perhaps paradoxically, the ambiguities in a business case study can be its strength as a learning tool. Just as biblical parables have kept theologians busy for two millennia with arguments about the precise meaning of a story, so the case study encourages participation by provoking different interpretations and points of view. Alternative insights, solutions and implications can be evaluated and debated. The case study's complexity makes it difficult to analyse exhaustively, and in this sense it mirrors the real business problems the students will confront later in their careers. Finally, students using case histories not only have to generate different interpretations but they have to argue and compete for their perspective. In this way this method of teaching can help develop an ability to marshall evidence in support of a particular explanation. Critics of the case study approach to teaching see management science as having no facts or theories. What they forget is that medical students - for better or worse - use case studies for all the above reasons. It could be argued that lawyers are educated exclusively through the case study. Business people, like lawyers, are encouraged to draw abstract principles from specific case histories.</p>

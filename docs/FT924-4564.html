			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bank rejects scheme to reshape Uni Storebrand THE FUTURE of Uni Storebrand, the troubled Norwegian insurer, looked uncertain yesterday following a rejection by Uni's biggest creditor, West Deutsche Landesbank, of a plan to recapitalise the crippled group. The board appointed by the Norwegian government to administer Uni said that it would seek a new solution to strengthen the group and did not rule out disposals. The most saleable unit is the non-life insurance business which has an estimated 40 per cent domestic market share. But a disposal of this unit could be disruptive for the life business, which is the biggest investor in the Oslo bourse. The failed recapitalisation plan called for, among other things, 70 per cent of NKr4.5bn (Dollars 690m) of debt to be converted to equity and a share issue to raise NKr1bn in fresh capital, but it relied on the backing of Uni's creditors. The administration board said it would work to achieve a solution by next summer. West Deutsche Landesbank, which holds NKr1bn in Uni debt, has also suffered heavy currency losses on the debt. The bank scuppered the recapitalisation plan - also rejected by numerous small creditors - and demanded cash reimbursement instead of payment in shares.</p>

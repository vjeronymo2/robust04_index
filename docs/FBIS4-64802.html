			<p>BFN     [Text] Rear Admiral Sakari Visa, the commander of the Navy,  thinks that expanding Finland's territorial waters may cause  problems in safeguarding sufficient supervision of those waters.  In an interview for the daily TURUN SANOMAT, Visa says that the  Navy would first need a new patrol squadron of four to five  vessels as well as fixed supervisory equipment so that the  supervision of an expanded sea area could be managed properly.    Before the end of this month, the government intends to  submit to the Eduskunta a proposal to move the territorial  waters limit. The move would multiply Finland's territorial  water area but the Navy has not been promised any additional  equipment or staff. Visa would also like Finland to have its  own submarines. He notes that a squadron of submarines for  Finland would crucially facilitate supervision and would raise  the threshold of frontier violations. According to Visa,  nevertheless the submarines are not the top priority on the  Navy's list of purchases.</p>

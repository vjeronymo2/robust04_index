			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Compensation - What's on offer IF YOU are caught out by a cowboy, you will need to rely on compensation, writes John Authers. But the rules are complicated and vary from investment to investment. They have also changed totally since the Barlow Clowes affair. On that occasion, compensation was funded directly by the Department of Trade and Industry, and was announced in December 1989 after the ombudsman's scathing report into the handling of the affair. That compensation, totalling Pounds 150m, was somewhat more generous than the arrangements now available - investors who lost Pounds 50,000 or less received 90 per cent of their money. For sums between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 100,000, 80 per cent was paid, and for sums above this the proportion dropped to 60 per cent. As Barry Riley points out in The Long View, the new arrangements have rather less than their fair share of logic. For example, pensioners reliant on defrauded pension schemes seem to have no defence. But the rules still dictate the compensation you will receive. If you go to a licensed Independent Financial Adviser (who will be a member of Fimbra) or an appointed representative of a fund manager or life office (in which case the company will be a member of Lautro), then you are protected by the Investors Compensation Scheme. This ran into funding problems last year, due to the heavy burden of claims on Fimbra members, and investors had to wait for pay-outs. Its rules are complicated - the first Pounds 30,000 of the initial value of an investment are covered completely. You then receive 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000, so that the maximum compensation is Pounds 48,000. Those investing in guaranteed income bonds have the security of the Policyholders Protection Act will pay out 90 per cent of the sum invested, without limit. What about 'safer' forms of investment? Even banks, as we all now know following BCCI, can go bust. In the UK they are covered by compensation which will pay you 75 per cent of your investment with the bank, up to a maximum of Pounds 20,000. Thus the greatest compensation you can receive is Pounds 15,000, and deposits above Pounds 20,000 are effectively uncovered. Building societies are marginally safer, covering 90 per cent of investments up to Pounds 20,000. The maximum compensation you could receive is Pounds 18,000. Legislation means that societies have to be much more cautious than banks in their lending, so a crash is extremely unlikely. However, the US experience with 'Savings and Loans' institutions, and some recent building society mergers, show that a building society crash is conceivable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Jan 3 (AFP) -- About 150 Jews gathered to  pray in the snow Monday outside the remains of an historic  Moscow synagogue, burnt down last week in what some suspect was  the latest in a number of anti-semitic attacks.    The building, in the Mariina Roshcha district in northern  Moscow, was badly damaged overnight last Wednesday, in a fire  which police said was due to an electrical short circuit.    Rabbi Berel Lazar is less certain, noting threats made  against another synagogue recently, and a fire at a Jewish  community school in Moscow last week.    "I hope it is all accidental," said Lazar, sent to Moscow by  the orthodox Lubavich movement, as he led a service by young and  old Jews outside the burnt out building Monday.    Addressing the two-hour service in the cold, he questioned  the police's decision not to open an official inquiry into the  fire. "We have neither the time nor the means to find out who is  responsible and what happened," he said.    Moscow's small number of synagogues have suffered a number  of  incidents in recent years, culminating in an arson attack on the  Hasidic synagogue on Bolshaia Bronnaia street in April 1992.    The 1929 Mariina Roshcha synagogue was the only Jewish house  of worship built after the Bolshevik revolution.    Jewish fears have been particularly raised by the electoral  success of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. "That is  just one thing which leads us to say that the events of recent  days are not simply accidents," said Lazar.    In response to a growing threat of anti-semitism, the  government last October banned a number of organizations and  publications which were openly anti-Jewish.    A Moscow city official, Vladimir Sister, assured Jews Monday  of the "cooperation, friendship and understanding" of the  authorities, although he insisted that the fire was caused by a  short circuit.    A collection was organized at Monday's service, as those  present tried to be positive. "All we can do today is rebuild  our synagogue," said worshipper Heshiel Fried, his voice  strained with emotion.</p>

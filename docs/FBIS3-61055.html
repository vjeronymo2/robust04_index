Golovko, deputy </F> Commander-in-Chief of the Navy for shipbuilding and armament,  under rubric "Armament and Equipment"]    [Text] Since olden times Russian people have been connected  with naval affairs and have been famed for the art of  navigation. The Russian Navy always proudly sailed the waters of  all the planet's seas and oceans. And the fact that we had an  entire galaxy of innovative scientists who achieved major  successes in naval shipbuilding and in creating naval ordnance  largely contributed to this. The work of many of them--Ye.  Nikonov, S. Dzhevetskiy, V. Yershov, A. Popov, P. Titov, E.  Gulyayev, S. Makarov, M. Naletov, I. Bubnov, V. Pyatov--was  known far beyond Russia's confines.    Russians were pioneers in the development and combat  employment of mine and torpedo ordnance. Our scientists also  performed great services in the area of radio communications,  hydrology, meteorology, cartography, oceanography, piloting and  dead reckoning, nautical astronomy, deviation and so on.    The traditions of Russian scientists, designers, and  creators  of combat equipment and naval ordnance were continued in Soviet  times. Realization of the latest discoveries in the area of  nuclear power engineering, electronics and rocket building  permitted the Navy to become truly oceangoing and capable of  combating a strong naval enemy. It was in this period the Navy  acquired qualities of a long-range Navy and the capability of  exerting substantial influence on the course and outcome of  warfare in enormous ocean and even continental theaters of  military operations.    Any state's navy is intended for protecting its interests  through naval warfare. Based on this, construction of the home  fleet in all historical stages was dictated by an aggregate of  factors determined by the disposition of military-political  forces in the international arena, the nature and degree of the  military threat, missions of ensuring state security stemming  from this and, in addition, by established views on the Navy's  role and place in the system of the country's Armed Forces and  by the country's economic capacities. A scientific-technical  direction of creating ships formed with consideration of the  growth in combat capabilities of the probable enemy's naval  forces and with consideration of conditions for Navy employment  in light of general patterns of development of means and methods  of naval warfare.    A combatant ship is a concentration of complex, interrelated  machinery, i.e., a unified system created on the basis of latest  achievements of science and technology. Participants in its  many-sided, complex process of creation are hundreds on  thousands of scientists of different specialties, designers, and  personnel of various types of enterprises, and they are navymen  and organizers of shipbuilding production and of shipbuilding as  a whole.    The improvement in naval shipbuilding based on the latest  scientific-technical achievements and foremost technologies has  acquired especially great importance at the present time, when  we began making reasonable sufficiency for defense and not the  principle of a competition of strength the basis of Armed Forces  organizational development. Therefore the nature of Russia's  military doctrine of today envisages a substantial increase in  qualitative parameters of armament and military equipment  ensuring high combat readiness of our Armed Forces, including  the Navy.    USSR shipbuilding in the postwar period represented a  powerful, involved complex of enterprises for scientific  research, planning and design, shipbuilding, instrument making  and machinebuilding that were capable of creating any classes of  ships, vessels and naval facilities in close cooperation with  enterprises of other sectors of industry. With full readiness of  its capacities, the sector was capable of supporting an annual  output as follows:     -  ships for the Navy as well as vessels and floating  facilities for the national economy with an overall displacement  up to 900,000-1,000,000 tonnes, including for export;    -  consumer  goods amounting to around two billion rubles (1991 prices)  overall.       The status of Soviet shipbuilding basically corresponded to  the world level with the exception of the production of  electronics and individual set-making articles for vessels,  which resulted from our lag in the area of an element base and  in production of nonmetallic materials. It gave the USSR an  opportunity to have a Navy with an overall tonnage of around  four million (the United States now also has around four  million) and a civilian fleet (not counting river transport  vessels) with an overall deadweight of 24.3 million tonnes (the  United States has 23.3 million).    In connection with the USSR's disintegration and the  political and economic reorganization going on in the Russian  Federation, conditions have changed significantly for  development and series deliveries of armament and military  equipment. A need has arisen to shift production and development  of their individual models, including also of set-making  assemblies for their manufacture, from former USSR republics to  Russian Federation territory. Cooperation of enterprises of  defense sectors of industry continues to collapse due to the  absence of a precise conversion program and nonallocation of  sufficient funds to support production activity of remaining  defense enterprises. The sharp limitation of their financing is  leading to a reduction in military orders, curtailment of  production, a drain of skilled cadres, and a changing  specialization of enterprises. And where there still are  military orders, the workers' pay is considerably below that of  civilian production enterprises.    For the very same reason, many Navy ranges and scientific  research experimental bases created to support weapon test  programs ended up outside the Russian Federation, while those on  its territory need additional outfitting with ships and  equipment for making path measurements (airborne, underwater)  and performing capital construction (shops, berths, storage  areas, laboratories, hotels, barracks).    Around two-thirds of the overall potential of the former  USSR  shipbuilding industry now is concentrated on Russian territory.  At the same time, the potential is substantially lower for  individual kinds of production such as construction of  large-tonnage ships and vessels; production of mines, torpedoes,  antimine weapons, rolled plate and particularly special sections  for shipbuilding; and production of ship gas-turbine plants and  radar and sonar equipment.    It should be noted that in order to retain the sector's  vital  capacity Russia requires a transition period lasting a minimum  of 5-7 years, during which problems of cooperation must be  resolved either by continuing mutual deliveries within the  framework of the CIS or by bringing in exports from other  countries or by creating Russia's own industries. A possible  form of solving the problem seems to us to be bilateral and  multilateral government agreements regulating mutual deliveries  and the procedure for joint work within the CIS framework.    As of today warships which require allocation of significant  resources for a period up to 5-6 years for fitting out and which  can support the employment in Russia alone of approximately  150,000 workers, including 60,000 highly skilled workers, are on  the ways and at the outfitting quays of shipyards in varying  degrees of readiness.    Cutting up incomplete ships, especially among those on the  ways, also requires great expenditures (including moral!) and  cannot be performed quickly enough. In case of a refusal to  complete the construction of ships, funds will be required for  their recycling in amounts exceeding expenditures for  fabrication. The situation at hand must be regarded as an  emergency and a way out should be found in the shortest possible  time.    Before the beginning of the 1990's the USSR Navy included  two  ocean fleets (Northern and Pacific) and two fleets on inland  seas (Baltic and Black Sea), as well as the Caspian Flotilla.  The Navy order of battle included nuclear powered missile  submarines, nuclear powered multipurpose submarines, diesel  powered submarines, air-capable ships, cruisers, destroyers,  large ASW ships, large patrol ships, small combatant ships,  combatant craft of various design projects and support vessels  for various purposes. At the present time its ship order of  battle essentially has shifted completely to Russia's  jurisdiction and now is the basis of the Russian Navy. At the  same time the present Navy infrastructure differs substantially  from the previous one. Above all this is caused by loss of a  number of naval bases in the Baltic, Black and Caspian Sea. But  problems facing the Russian Navy and its naval shipbuilding  basically were inherited from previous times; moreover, they  were exacerbated considerably as a result of the USSR's  elimination.    All these problems can be grouped along two lines. The first  group of problems is insufficient development of fleet systems  of basing, servicing and repair and the shortage of support  ships and a floating logistic establishment. This is especially  characteristic of the North and Far East in connection with  difficulties of capital construction in these regions. The  second group of problems is the high proportion of obsolete  ships with reduced combat effectiveness in the Navy makeup, but  which require the very same and in a number of cases even  greater expenditures for keeping them in formation than for new  ships.    In examining the status of naval shipbuilding it is also  necessary to consider the status of the civilian maritime and  river fleet inasmuch as they are interrelated, since they are  determined by activity of the country's unified shipbuilding  complex. Therefore, it also seems advisable to make brief  mention here of problems facing civilian shipbuilding, as the  naval and civilian fleets are created in the same national  economic sector.    The USSR civilian fleet represented an involved complex,  including vessels of various classes and for various purposes as  well as ship repair yards, establishments and rather developed  port facilities. As a result of partitioning of the civilian  fleet, Russia was left with approximately 55 percent of  cumulative deadweight tonnage of maritime transport vessels, a  little over 60 percent of fishing industry fleet vessels, 30  percent of offshore oil and gas field supply vessels, and 12 of  the 27 floating drilling units that were in the USSR. Russia's  share of the overall number of former USSR ports today is 53  percent, but it is around 40 percent in cargo volume.    This situation on the one hand demanded either conclusion of  appropriate agreements on leasing or on joint use of ports or  government decisions on constructing new ones, above all in the  Baltic and Black Sea. On the other hand, an acute need arose for  an accelerated buildup of Russia's civilian fleet tonnage. There  is no other way to get out of the existing situation than on the  basis of conversion of the shipbuilding industry.    Thus, in building a concept for developing the Russian Navy  under present conditions it is necessary to take into account  such factors as quantitative and structural makeup of the now  existing naval fleet; reality of a sharp reduction in  appropriations for its construction and upkeep; a change in the  world situation as a whole and in the Baltic and Black Sea in  particular; the obviousness of the need for Russia to preserve  the status of a naval power; and the insistent need for  increasing civilian fleet construction rates.    In considering the concept of the development of  shipbuilding  in Russia, one also should bear in mind that shipbuilding is  capable of playing the role of a leading sector supporting  progress of other sectors of industry and of the country's  economy as a whole, as occurred in Japan and South Korea. In  addition, Russia's shipbuilding has good chances to be one of  the leaders in the world shipbuilding market since, first of  all, its level of development in Russia is rather high;  secondly, market capacity is sufficient and is around $300  billion for the near term (8-10 years); thirdly, shipbuilding  today is shifting to third world countries, and competition with  them is within Russia's capability even under today's  conditions. An additional argument in this regard is the  competitiveness of many of our ship classes with the possibility  of their sale on the world market, as demonstrated recently at  the IDEX-93 international exposition in Abu Dhabi.    Thus, it should be stated that a reduction in the proportion  of naval shipbuilding within the overall volume of Russian  shipbuilding is a real fact, but it must be emphasized that  maximum permissible replacement rates of military products with  civilian products at yards of the shipbuilding sector should not  exceed 15 percent per year. Otherwise this will lead to "locking  up" ways with ships being built on them and to disintegration of  labor collectives at these yards. Another question of state  importance under present conditions is recycling of written-off  ships, especially ships with nuclear power plants, which also  requires appropriate capacities.    Based on everything that has been said, the concept of  development of Russian shipbuilding and arms under present  conditions should, in our opinion, provide for the following:  Mandatory fitting out of ships and vessels which are in a high  degree of readiness, if only to free up capacities for civilian  products, i.e., receiving permanent credits for financing their  fitting out; licenses for selling a portion of fitted-out ships  and vessels on the world market and for sale of secondary  resources to direct the proceeds toward renovating shipbuilding  and ship repair bases and support sectors; and financing of the  program for recycling written-off ships and vessels. For its  realization, in the first stage (over the next 3-5 years) we  propose to fit out combatant ships and auxiliary vessels which  are in various degrees of readiness. At the same time, work must  be done to upgrade and renovate the fleet basing and repair  infrastructure. In parallel, it is necessary to accomplish work  of inspecting the available ship order of battle in order to  clarify the status of each specific ship and determine prospects  for her further use: Keep some in the order of battle, prepare  others for modernization and support such modernization, and  mothball still others or send them for recycling (to be written  off).    At the same time, within the scope of the new military  doctrine and new missions facing the Russian Navy, we must not  reduce rates of RDT&amp;E and planning work to determine basic  directions of Navy development for the future and to form a  permanent sliding program of naval shipbuilding for the next  10-15 years. It is quite clear from the studies conducted that  we cannot get by without creating new strategic missile  submarine cruisers, nuclear and non-nuclear powered multipurpose  submarines, aircraft carriers (or air-capable ships),  multipurpose surface combatants of the destroyer, frigate and  corvette types and mine countermeasures ships, as well as small  combatants and new-generation floating logistic support ships  and vessels.    Today it is premature to speak of a specific appearance and  standard types of the above ships. It is enormously more  important to emphasize the problem of the need for intensifying  test-design work to create weapons, armament and equipment of  the future with an optimum combination of high specifications  and performance characteristics and with resolution of problems  of their standardization, unification, modernization capability,  and maintainability. This means that the scale of research and  test-design work should not be reduced. Moreover, under present  conditions this must be given even more attention than before.    Prospects of domestic naval shipbuilding are linked closely  with successes and achievements of S&amp;T progress. Its  interests  lie not only in the area of solving applied S&amp;T problems, but  extend to a wide range of basic research in various directions.  Therefore naval shipbuilding plans must rely on results of  fulfillment of major comprehensive and specific state research  and scientific, planning and technological work.    The history of domestic naval shipbuilding has shown  repeatedly that "ups" and "downs" in the process of constructing  ships and vessels had a pernicious effect on the Navy's status  for decades. To the contrary, construction of the Fleet requires  "monotonous continuity," and this is possible in part with  observance of a number of basic conditions, the principal ones  of which are long-range (for 10-15 years), specific program  planning and stable (with consideration of inflation),  continuous financing of the fulfillment of this program. But  loss of achievements of our naval shipbuilding may bring broader  and deeper consequences than simply a temporary loss of existing  military-strategic or political-economic parities in naval  armaments.    Thus, on the eve of its tricentennial, Russian naval  shipbuilding is faced with solving serious new problems. The  difficulty of this solution is determined by many political,  economic and social factors. But we always must remember our  forefathers' behest--"let there be maritime vessels"--and in the  situation that is taking shape find real ways to maintain  Russia's naval might at a level worthy of a Great Sea Power.

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / BP 'not defrauded by middlemen' BRITISH Petroleum was not defrauded by middlemen acting for engineering companies bidding for lucrative North Sea contracts because it ultimately received the best value for money, Southwark Crown Court heard yesterday. The prosecution was misguided in suggesting that BP was a victim of fraud because confidential information had been leaked regarding the tendering processes for 11 contracts, Mr Paul Purnell QC, for Mr Josef Szrajber, said. The trial continues today.</p>

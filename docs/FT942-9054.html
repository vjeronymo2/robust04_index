			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Unions fear Orly competition Air Inter, the French domestic airline, was brought to a virtual standstill yesterday as unions launched a one-day strike in protest over the liberalisation of the French airline market. Unions said the introduction of competition on some of their most profitable routes would compound the financial pressures facing the loss-making airline. They demanded that Air Inter be given greater management autonomy from Air France, its state-owned parent company, and be allowed to operate on profitable European routes. Last month, the European Commission ordered the French government to open routes between London and Orly airport in Paris to competition, and said the lucrative Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles routes must be opened to rivals within six months. Mr Michel Bernard, president of Air Inter, said the relationship between Air Inter and Air France would be reorganised during the summer. An airline official said it was important the domestic airline remained part of the Air France group, but increased competition on some of its profitable routes should be compensated by a relaxation in requirements to serve unprofitable routessuch as between Paris and Quimper, in Brittany.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Sir Charles Villiers, chairman of BSC: Obituary SIR Charles Villiers, who was chairman of the British Steel Corporation between 1976 and 1980, one of its most traumatic periods, died yesterday aged 79. Sir Charles, a well-intentioned, kind and thoughtful man, was one of the most beleaguered BSC chairmen. The closure programme he enacted - the workforce was reduced from 208,000 to 166,000 - provoked a bitter strike during which he lost the support of his political masters. In spite of the criticisms of his performance, his time as chairman was pivotal in the corporation's development, marking the end of the over-ambitious expansion plans drawn up in the early 1970s and the start of the cost-cutting that turned British Steel into one of the most profitable steelmakers in Europe by the end of the 1980s. Sir Charles was groomed for a career in the City by his education at Eton and New College, Oxford. He served in the Grenadier Guards during the Second World War, winning the Military Cross in 1945 after parachuting into Yugoslavia to fight alongside Tito's partisans. After the war he moved briskly into a string of banking jobs, eventually becoming managing director of J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank. In 1968 he was appointed chairman of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, where he recruited a team of ambitious young people who went on to senior posts in British industry - including Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Courtaulds, and Sir Alastair Morton, the deputy chairman of Eurotunnel. After leaving British Steel, his main achievement was a book on British industry entitled Start Again Britain, in which he wrote of the downward spiral in which the country was caught. It would not escape 'unless we make a drastic effort to break out of it on a scale so far not contemplated'. Sir Charles leaves a wife, two daughters and a son.</p>

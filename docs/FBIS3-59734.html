			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Co., Ltd., has  developed a transistor which operates at the fastest speed  achieved to date. it is an HBT (heterojunction bipolar  transistor) which stacks different types of compound  semiconductor crystals. The production process can be improved  by using indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) thin-film crystal  which is suitable for highly mobile electrons. In this way, an  operational frequency of 176 gigahertz, a new world record, has  been achieved. High-speed operation of 100 GHz or more is  achieved even at low operational current of 1 milliampere or  less. The subminiaturization of devices clears the way for  integrating the HBT. Efforts will continue to pursue even higher  speeds to prepare devices for use in optical communications  having a transmission capability of 40 gigabits per second,  which is the latest research objective.    Until now, the world's fastest transistor achieved to date  was an HBT developed by NTT which operated at 171 GHz and which  used gallium arsenide (GaAs) crystal. Since using GaAs has  approached the limitation with regard to higher operational  frequency, NTT used InGaAs to break its own world record.    It has been known that InGaAs is well suited with regard to  high electron mobility, device miniaturization and lower  operating current. However, until now there has been little  know-how pertaining to process technologies. Therefore, a  transistor which takes full advantage of the characteristics of  this material has not been achieve,d and the quality of the  material has been compromised.    By modifying the etching process during formation of the  device, NTT was able to achieve a transistor with three strong  points--high speed, low power consumption, and subminiature  device size. Not only is it the world's fastest operating  transistor, but achieving an operating frequency of 100 GHz on  one milliampere or less of current is also a first. More  specifically, at one milliampere of current, an operational  frequency of about 130 GHz is possible.    NTT plans to achieve an optical communications network which  can transfer 10 gigibits of information per second, and various  laboratories are involved in developing devices and exchange  equipment technology which allows transfer of 40 gigabits per  second.    The new achievement greatly promotes the practical use of  the  HBT in future optical communications systems. Applications of  the HBT are also likely to increase when it is incorporated into  integrated circuits.</p>

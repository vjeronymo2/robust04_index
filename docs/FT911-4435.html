			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Diversified Sage grows 29% AN IMPROVEMENT, from 31.3 per cent to 33.1 per cent, in operating margins pushed Sage Group, the Newcastle-based computing services company, to record pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.02m in the six months to March 31. The 29 per cent increase from Pounds 2.34m came on sales up 17 per cent from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 7.8m. Earnings per share rose 24 per cent to 11.98p (9.65p). The interim dividend is raised 15 per cent to 2.7p (2.35p). The company, whose core business is the provision of low-cost accountancy software for small firms, is benefiting from its diversification into networking software, while recurrent revenues from software maintenance, computer stationery, consumables and training have reached 33 per cent of total sales. Mr David Goldman, chairman, said the company had increased its share of the accounting software market from 39 per cent by volume in February 1990 to 55 per cent this year. Networking products were selling well in Europe, although the US subsidiary, while more than doubling sales, suffered a slight loss. Sage is paying Dollars 18m (Pounds 10m) for DacEasy, a loss-making US accounting software company, and on the basis of good first quarter results believes it will contribute both to sales and pre-tax profits this year. While Mr Goldman was cautious about second-half results he said that sales in the first few months of the year had become noticeably more consistent.</p>

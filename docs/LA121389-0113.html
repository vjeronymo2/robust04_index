			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Schering-Plough to Sell Maybelline: In another sign of the fierce competitive  forces now shaping the global pharmaceutical industry, Schering-Plough Corp.  said it would sell its Maybelline cosmetics franchise, the last of the big  mass-market cosmetics businesses to be put on the block. Schering-Plough said  it would sell Maybelline, possibly to the unit's management, to focus on its  prescription and over-the-counter drug, personal-care and vision-care  businesses. Analysts estimate Maybelline could fetch $420 million to $560  million, or 1.5 to 2 times its annual sales.  </P></p>

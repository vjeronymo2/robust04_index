			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In its March 1994 issue, TAP CHI CONG SAN carries  many articles on industrialization and modernization, socialist  economic orientations, cultural management, and the need to  strengthen the great national unity bloc for the sake of a  prosperous people, a powerful country, and an equitable and  civilized society.    An article written by Comrade Deputy Foreign Minister Vu  Khoan entitled "Experience Obtained in the World and the  Process of Industrialization and Modernization in our Country"  reads in part as follows: It is not that industrialization can  be carried out by any country at any time. Industrialization  requires certain conditions and premises. Therefore, as we  embark on the task of encouraging industrialization and  modernization, it would be useful to study the experiences of  other countries. What we need to study and how to apply it  will, of course, depend on the specific conditions of our  country and on the current international situation.    Dealing with the basics for industrialization, the journal  carries a number of articles critical of some incorrect views on  market economy and socialism, the historic mandate of the  working class, the issue of Marxist humanity, and so forth.</p>

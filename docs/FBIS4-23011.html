Solntseva, Brain Research Institute at </F> Russia's Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow; UDC  612.829:612.822:577.352.5]    [Abstract] Interest in biochemical and electric responses  of the nerve cell to application of antibrain antibodies is  attributed to the fact that such reactions serve as the  biological basis of nervous and psychological disorders, and  data on the intracellular mechanisms of the nerve cell's  electric activity behavior under the effect of antibrain  antibodies are reviewed. In particular, the electrophysiological  effects of immunoglobulines (Ig) and blood serum of  schizophrenia patients, electrophysiological effects of  antibodies to S-100 proteins, i.e., AS-100 or genus-nonspecific  proteins present in the glia or neurons both in the soluble and  membrane-bound form, and the role of intracellular mediators in  AS-100's electrophysiological effects are examined in detail. A  study involving snail and rat hippocampal neurons shows that  these antibodies suppress the action potential generation with  or without the membrane depolarization, decrease the membrane's  input resistance, and lower the amplitude of stimulating  postsynaptic potentials. AS-100 lowers the potential-dependent  inward current and induces steady-state inward current, yet  these phenomena can be neutralized fully or partially by  intracellular EGTA Ca[.sup]2+[/]-chelator or cAMP injection.  Under the effect of antibrain antibodies on the nerve cell,  events develop in its cytoplasma which are similar to those  occurring in the cytoplasma of immunocompetent cells during the  antigen-antibody complex formation in them. It is speculated  that AS-100's electrophysiological effect is due to an increase  in the Ca[.sup]2+[/] level and a decrease in the cAMP level  in the nerve cell's cytoplasma. It is further speculated that  these antibodies are also capable of inducing similar effects in  human brain neurons and leading to significant shifts in the  psychic status.

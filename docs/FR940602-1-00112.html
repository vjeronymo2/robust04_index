			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, today's proposal moves &sect;270.62(d) and &sect;270.66(g), which address interim status requirements, to proposed &sect;270.74, where the majority of the interim status provisions are contained. The wording is essentially the same, clarifying when the facility must submit the trial burn plan and emphasizing that the permitting authority must approve the trial burn plan before the facility may conduct the trial burn. The new language structure presents the requirements chronologically and makes the regulation easier to understand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also stating in &sect;270.74(c)(1) that interim status combustion facilities seeking permits must receive approval of the trial burn plan by the Director before conducting the trial burn. EPA believes that making the requirements more explicit will ensure that trial burn plans reflect EPA policy and guidance, and that the burns will be adequate to set permit operating conditions. As discussed in the cost analysis section, EPA is also proposing a revision of the provision for submitting data in lieu of a trial burn (&sect;270.19 for incinerators and &sect;270.22 for BIFs) to reflect current practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By specifying that a unit must be ``virtually identical'' to, and at the same facility as, a permitted unit, instead of ``sufficiently similar'', today's rule will remove any confusion surrounding the interpretation of the ``data in lieu of'' option and will reflect EPA's current interpretation of this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another aspect of the permitting process that may cause confusion is the fact that, although existing EPA policy allows the facility to conduct additional trial burns, current regulations do not specifically address permitting procedures following an interim status facility trial burn failure. Today's proposed rule, by clarifying existing EPA policy, will help state what actions follow a trial burn failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, today's proposed rule describes in more detail the phases of both shakedown and the trial burn permit modifications listed under section L.7 of Appendix I, and clarifies how a facility may implement and utilize section 270.42(d) of the modification procedures. This revision will simplify a facility's compliance with the modification process by making it easier for a facility to select the appropriate classification for the modification activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires Federal agencies to consider ``small entities'' throughout the regulatory process. Section 603 of the RFA requires an initial screening analysis to be performed to determine whether small entities will be adversely affected by the regulation. If the analysis identifies affected small entities, regulatory alternatives must be considered to mitigate the potential impacts. Small entities as described in the Act are only those ``businesses, organizations and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the proposed regulations for expanding public involvement in the RCRA permitting process, EPA was sensitive to the needs and concerns of small businesses. Therefore, the proposed regulations describe the minimum efforts necessary to fulfill the public involvement requirements. Additional examples of activities facilities may choose to conduct are provided in the preamble, rather than incorporated into the regulatory language. EPA's intent in doing so is to provide flexibility for a facility to determine how elaborate it wishes to be in conducting public involvement activities. In addition, EPA recognizes that, in some situations, an information repository could become resource intensive for a facility or for the local community. EPA has addressed this concern by providing discretion to the Director to determine whether to require a repository, rather than requiring it for all facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regards to the burden placed on facilities that burn small quantities of hazardous waste, EPA has already provided an exemption under section 3004(q)(2)(B) of RCRA. The Agency carefully evaluated the risks posed by small quantity burning and concluded that a conditional exemption for small quantity burners should be allowed where hazardous waste combustion poses an insignificant risk. This small quantity burner exemption would therefore reduce the burden placed on small entities from the revised permitting requirements for hazardous waste combustors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following sub-sections summarize the potential impacts on small entities of three aspects of today's proposed rule: expanded public participation requirements, revised requirements for ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn, and requirements following a trial burn failure. In summary, EPA has determined that there are no significant impacts on small entities from the requirements of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Small Entity Impacts of Expanded Public Participation Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The universe of facilities affected by the public participation requirements include all facilities submitting a new part B application. In the case of the repository requirement, facilities undergoing permit modification or closure may also be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determination of which facilities that submit new part B applications might be small entities is somewhat speculative. Assuming future RCRA facilities will resemble past facilities, approximately 12% of the estimated 53 to 127 new hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be ``small entities.'' <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In addition, 14 of the 159 interim status BIFs are owned by companies that are potentially ``small entities,'' based on current size thresholds established by the U.S. Small Business Association. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4,5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Hazardous Waste TSDF_Regulatory Impact Analysis for Proposed RCRA Air Emission Standards, Final Review Draft, USEPA, Office of Air and Radiation, August 1989. ``Small entity'' was defined as a company whose uniform annual sales cutoff is equal to $3.5 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 CFR part 121.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Employment, sales, industry category, and parent company information was obtained from on-line searches of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and the American Business Directory. In addition to the fourteen BIFs that were identified as potentially small entities, another four did not have enough information to make a determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned in the cost analysis section, the highest total cost of the public participation requirements is estimated to be $14,000 per facility. This cost includes setting up an information repository, translating public notices, and interpreting public meetings. Annualized over ten years at a discount rate of 7%, the cost for a facility, as the high end of the cost range, would be $1,900 per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This $1,900 per year may have a significant impact on a small entity if it is greater than five percent of the total cost of production. Thus a facility whose total cost of production is less than $37,000 may be significantly impacted. It is highly unlikely that the cost of production would be this low for a RCRA hazardous waste facility. Total sales for ``small entity'' BIFs range from $1.3 million to $87.3 million for the individual facilities and $19.1 million to $513 million for the parent companies. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Costs of production would presumably be in the same order of magnitude. Thus EPA has determined that there are no significant impacts on small entities from this provision of the proposed rule and that alternative regulatory approaches are not necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Ibid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

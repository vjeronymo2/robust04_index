			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 9-BALL IS THE GAME OF CHOICE; YOU CAN FIND IT EVERYWHERE  </P> <P> The most popular form of pocket billiards is 9-Ball. Almost any pool hall you  walk into plays host to 9-Ball tournaments.  </P> <P> "The game of the '80s and '90s," said Bob Johannis, day manager of College  Billiards Center on El Cajon Boulevard.  </P> <P> Nine-Ball is played in rotation with the balls numbered one through nine. The  lowest numbered ball on the table is the object ball, the player sinking the  nine-ball -- either directly or in combination -- winning.  </P> <P> There are a handful of pool halls in town. The biggest is the College Billiards  Center. Other top pool halls include Victor's Lounge, O'Connell's Sports  Lounge, Terry's Pool Place, the Hungry Stick, and the Clairemont Cue Club. Two  other hot spots in the area are Green Felt Downs in Vista and Embassy Room in  Oceanside. SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

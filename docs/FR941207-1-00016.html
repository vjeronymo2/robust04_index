			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Southwestern Region of the Forest Service establishes areas around known owl locations, called management territories (MTs). Each MT represents the occurrence of either a single owl or pair of owls, and is based on either confirmed nest or roost locations, or nighttime calling responses. Forest Service inventories through 1993 resulted in the establishment of 740 MTs in Arizona and New Mexico (Heather Hollis, Forest Service Southwest Regional Office, pers. comm., 1994). Four MTs have been established from the six sites with owl detection records in Utah (K. Grandison, pers. comm., 1994). No MTs have been established for the six owl sites in Colorado (John Verner, Pike/San Isabel National Forests, pers. comm., 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is potentially up to 435,000 ha (1,075,000 acres) of Mexican spotted owl habitat on Indian reservations. The actual amount of habitat may be lower because estimates supplied by the BIA Forestry Division were developed from timber-type maps containing little information about understory conditions or slope. The estimates may also omit minimally forested or nonforested canyon habitat acreage. Information available to the Service on owl survey efforts on Indian lands is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The White Mountain Apache Tribe's Mexican spotted owl conservation plan states that approximately 54 owl sites have been located on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Owl surveys on the Navajo Reservation have resulted in the confirmation of owls at 26 sites (13 pairs and 13 singles) (John Nysted, Navajo Fish and Wildlife Department, pers. comm., 1994);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Jicarilla and the Hualapai wildlife departments conducted owl surveys in 1993; however, no owls were detected; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Current owl records exist for the San Carlos and Mescalero Apache Reservations, but only limited information is available on population estimates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A total of 297,000 ha (734,000 acres) of potential owl habitat occurs on BLM lands in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico (BLM, Colorado State Office,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990; BLM, Utah State Office,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990; BLM, New Mexico State Office,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990; Ted Cordery, Arizona BLM, pers. comm., 1992). In 1993, a total of 25 owl records were known from BLM lands. There were 15 locations in Utah, 7 locations in Colorado, and 1 location in New Mexico. There are several historical records and two current records for sites on BLM lands in Arizona.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most Mexican spotted owl habitat in national parks and monuments consists of minimally forested, steep, shaded canyons in the northern part of the owl's range. It is difficult to estimate acreage for this type of habitat. The NPS estimated that 23 parks and monuments in the Southwest contained between 96,000 and 177,000 ha (238,000 to 438,000 acres) of Mexican spotted owl habitat (NPS, Southwest Region,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990; NPS, Rocky Mountain Region,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990; J. Ray, NPS, Grand Canyon National Park, pers. comm., 1990). As of 1993, the NPS had records of a total of 32 sites in Utah and 2 sites in Colorado.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between 72,000 and 82,000 ha (177,000 to 202,000 acres) of New Mexico and Arizona State lands contain forests and canyons that could be suitable Mexican spotted owl habitat. Several historical and recent records exist for New Mexico State lands. In Arizona, surveys conducted by the Arizona State Land Department and the Coconino National Forest resulted in the establishment of three MTs on Forest Service land. No information was available on suitable Mexican spotted owl habitat on State lands in Utah and Colorado. However, a single owl was recorded on Utah State lands in 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Private lands in Arizona and New Mexico are currently estimated to contain up to 53,000 ha (130,000 acres) of owl habitat (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). No estimates exist for owl habitat acreage on private lands in Colorado and Utah. This is partly due to the difficulty in assessing the extent of existing canyon habitat in the Colorado Plateau physiographic province, and partly a result of the insufficient amount of owl surveys accomplished to accurately determine the limit of the species' range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Economic consultancy says manufacturing output to stage robust recovery MANUFACTURING output will stage a robust recovery this year and next but the consequent economic upturn will be patchy and too weak to cut unemployment in 1993, says Oxford Economic Forecasting, an economic consultancy, Peter Norman writes. In its half-yearly review of UK industrial prospects, the consultancy says a rise in net exports this year and rising investment will lift manufacturing output while services lag. Capital goods industries such as engineering and vehicles will spearhead the recovery, while the chemical, textile and clothing industries will receive a temporary boost from improved competitiveness provided by the devaluation of sterling. The consultancy says longer-term prospects for metals, basic chemicals and textiles are poor because of low-cost foreign competition. Construction output will continue to fall because of overcapacity in the commercial property market. In the energy sector, rising oil and gas production will outweigh sharp declines in coal output. The review sees no strong recovery in consumer spending. Although there may be some growth in high-priced items, the consultancy expects that expansion of the leisure goods and services, distribution, and retail financial services sectors will be much reduced in the 1990s.

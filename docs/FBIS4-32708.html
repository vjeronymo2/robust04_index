			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic today received Italian Foreign Minister  Antonio Martino, who is paying a visit to the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia [FRY].    In the course of cordial and open talks the president of  Serbia and the Italian foreign minister exchanged views on  questions of interest for the further successful development of  bilateral relations and cooperation, as well as those of  significance for the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, and  peace and security in the region, reads a statement issued by  President Milosevic's office.    Foreign Minister Martino expressed the readiness and desire  of the Italian Government to become involved in activities aimed  at overcoming the crisis in the region. Italy is interested in  a stable development of cooperation and good-neighborly  relations with the FRY, with particular emphasis on the interest  both countries have in strengthening economic links. It is a  fact that the economic sanctions against the FRY delayed  realization of many joint projects, which has harmed not only  the economies of Serbia and the FRY, but also of a number of  other countries with which Serbia and the FRY are linked and  interdependent on, to a high degree. Economic sanctions are an  obstacle imposed on free exchange of goods, circulation of  people and ideas, their free exchange and communication, and for  this reason they have to be lifted as soon as possible as  unreasonable and discriminatory measures that affect the  interests of several countries, the statement notes.    The peace process and activities aimed at ending the war in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed in particular. It  was stated that the international community undoubtedly has the  responsibility and an obligation to use its influence in a  determined manner with the aim of having the Muslim side end  armed provocations and threats, and to finally give up  aspirations to achieve its goals by war.    In the interest of peace the international community has  high  responsibility for presenting an overall plan which would not be  based on an one-sided approach and favoring the interests of one  side in the conflict at the expense of the other, but on the  principles of equality, equal protection of their vital  interests and an unbiased treatment. In keeping with this,  Serbia believes that the principle of equality -- which has to  be respected -- also implies the lifting of the economic  sanctions.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also attended  the talks.</p>

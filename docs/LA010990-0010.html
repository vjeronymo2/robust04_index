			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZERBAIJANIS SPREAD PROTESTS TO TURKISH BORDER, SMASH BARRIERS  </P> <P> Azerbaijanis demanding free contacts with fellow Muslims across the border have  spread their protests to the Soviet-Turkish frontier, destroying border  fortifications, the government newspaper Izvestia reported Monday.  </P> <P> In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Communist Party officials met with  Azerbaijani activists in an attempt to find solutions to the ethnic,  nationalist and Muslim fundamentalist problems racking the republic.  </P> <P> Rafik Neshanev, chairman of the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet,  was present at the discussions during which, Tass said, "many speeches sharply  criticized the Communist Party of the country and the government's Council of  Ministers."  </P> <P> Shiite Muslim Azerbaijanis from Nakichevan province, who have destroyed 120  miles of fortifications on the frontier with Iran, streamed toward a bridge  over the Aras River at the frontier with Turkey on Sunday and gave guards an  ultimatum to let them pass, Izvestia said.  </P> <P> "The situation became explosive, and the soldiers decided to let them pass to  avoid the bloodshed," it said. "A minute later, the fortifications along about  one-eighth of a mile of the frontier with Turkey were destroyed."  </P> <P> The protesters want freedom to travel across the border to visit fellow ethnic  Azerbaijanis in the Iranian region of the same name. They also want the right  to freely cultivate land along the border, which is in a fertile valley.  </P> <P> Although Sunday's incident involved only a small portion of the southern  border, it was the last remnant of Nakichevan's southern frontier with Iran and  Turkey that had not been battered down by the Muslim Azerbaijanis.  </P> <P> In ethnic strife elsewhere in Azerbaijan, presumed Azerbaijani nationalists  blew up two main transport bridges at the edge of Nagorno-Karabakh, cutting  supplies to the embattled Armenian-dominated enclave, the official Tass news  agency said.  </P> <P> The incident appeared to be an attempt to reimpose a blockade by Azerbaijanis  trying to compel Armenians to drop their claims to the enclave. More than 200  people have died in nearly two years of strife over the enclave.  </P></p>

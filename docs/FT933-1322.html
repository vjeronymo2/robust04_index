			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / GPA Group finalises its last chance of survival GPA Group, the Irish aircraft leasing company which has been struggling with debt of Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.76bn), yesterday finalised plans for a Dollars 150m capital raising, the granting of options to GE Capital to take control of the company, and the deferral of Dollars 750m of debt repayments for three years plus the injection of Dollars 150m of new money. The deal was largely agreed in May, but the complexity of the documentation has delayed finalisation until now. It is designed to put the company on a stable footing, giving it time to reduce debt through aircraft sales within three years. Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman, who will retire when the deal is completed but is likely to remain a non-executive director, said 'the deal is not sufficient on its own but is essential to the survival of GPA. Without this there certainly isn't a future. There is no other plan behind this'. GE Capital is getting an option to buy up to 67 per cent of the company by March 1998 paying between Dollars 110m and Dollars 165m. For three years after that it can buy further shares and could take 100 per cent control of GPA. GPA will pass the management of its assets to a new GE Capital subsidiary, GE Capital Aviation Services under a 15-year contract. Mr Tony Ryan, founder, chairman and chief executive of GPA, and two other GPA executive directors will be employed by GECAS, leaving GPA. Mr Ryan and GPA will appoint an arbitrator to fix any compensation he is due for loss of office at GPA. The other two directors, Mr Colm Barrington and Mr James King, will not receive compensation but be given equivalent jobs at GECAS. GPA also revealed that exceptional costs of Dollars 737m relating to the group's restructuring contributed to an attributable loss of Dollars 993m in the year to March 1993, cutting the group's net worth from Dollars 1.23bn to Dollars 234m. Operating profits were Dollars 48m, down from Dollars 262m in the previous year. Of the exceptional costs Dollars 130m related to fees for the restructuring, of which Dollars 44m went to lenders and Dollars 86m to professional advisers including 22 firms of lawyers. A further Dollars 20m related to the costs of a flotation aborted in June 1992. The proposals will be put to shareholders at a special meeting on October 18. Existing shareholders who do not subscribe to the issue of convertible and non-convertible securities will see their holdings diluted to 10 per cent. Details, Page 23</p>

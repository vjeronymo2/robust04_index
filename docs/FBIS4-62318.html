			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 14 May carries a 2 1/2  minute video report by Dmitriy Voskoboynikov from Geneva on the  13 May meeting between Russian and Western foreign ministers to  discuss a settlement for Bosnia. Voskoboynikov, in a brief  interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, asks:    "Yesterday seven foreign ministers worked out a coordinated  position. Is it not the case that in a few weeks time, should  the situation deteriorate -- around Brcko, for instance -- this  coordination will completely disappear?"    Kozyrev responds, "Unfortunately, we should be prepared to  see our cooperation put to the test, but a fairly good basis has  been laid down for progressing forward. This is not a complete  answer to all the questions. These are only the basic elements  for going on to work out a joint approach which needs to be  worked on by the parties."    The report then continues with a round-up of the Geneva  meeting.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  PROTEST TRIES TO CAST SHADOW OF A DOUBT  </P> <P> It was a novel -- if short-lived -- way to protest a building.  </P> <P> Paula Achter, a film maker who lives in Santa Monica, led a group of residents  in erecting a sculpture to protest a condominium project proposed for 12th  Street.  </P> <P> The 40-foot sculpture, made of scaffolding and a tarpaulin, re-created the  amount of shadows and darkness that the condos will cast, Achter said.  </P> <P> She said she wanted neighbors to realize how the three-story building would  block their daylight so that they would fight the project.  </P> <P> Achter can claim partial success.  </P> <P> "The biggest comment everyone made was, will it really be that big?" she said.  "That was exactly the response we wanted to hear."  </P> <P> But within minutes of finishing the sculpture last weekend in an alley behind  the construction site, police arrived to tell Achter she had to take it down.  </P> <P> Achter admits she had failed to obtain a permit for the sculpture. She managed  to avoid taking it down, but finally removed it this week, cutting short her  planned protest.  </P> <P> The condo project has received unanimous approval from the city's Planning  Commission and goes before the City Council for final approval on Tuesday.  </P></p>

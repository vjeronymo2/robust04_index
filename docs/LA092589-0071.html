			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS TRIALS SHORTCHANGE MINORITIES AND DRUG USERS  </P> <P> Blacks, Latinos and intravenous drug users, the groups increasingly afflicted  with AIDS virus infections, are significantly under-represented in federally  sponsored AIDS clinical trials, according to a Times analysis of government  statistics obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.  </P> <P> As of the end of August, blacks and Latinos accounted for 42% of adult AIDS  patients in the United States but only 20.4% of patients that have been  enrolled in National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) AIDS  trials. Intravenous drug users accounted for 27.5% of adult AIDS patients but  only 11.3% of the participants in the federal studies.  </P> <P> "It has been a matter of frustration to us," said Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of  the NIAID AIDS program. "We want to change (the participation of minorities and  drug users), but you can't just push a button in Washington and have everything  change all over the country."  </P> <P> The low representation of members of minority groups and drug users means that  researchers cannot gather optimal information about new AIDS therapies for  these patients, according to leading AIDS researchers and federal officials.  </P> <P> "Drugs may behave differently in different racial and ethnic groups and in  women," said Dr. Richard Chaisson, director of the AIDS service at the Johns  Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. "Consequently, you can't generalize from studies  done in middle-class gay white men."  </P> <P> For example, blacks and whites have important differences in their response to  common high blood pressure drugs. Researchers will not be able to learn if  similar differences are important for AIDS drugs unless they study the drugs in  substantial numbers of whites and minorities.  </P> <P> Many intravenous drug users are also treated with other drugs, such as  methadone. Researchers will not be able to learn if AIDS drugs, such as AZT,  have beneficial or harmful interactions with methadone and other psychoactive  drugs unless they conduct studies of patients who are taking them.  </P> <P> In addition, members of minority groups and intravenous drug users may be  deprived of their "only opportunity to obtain access to a promising new (AIDS)  treatment" that may be very expensive and in limited supply, according to Dr.  Margaret Hamburg, a special assistant to the director of the NIAID program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inequity of Health Care  </P> <P> The causes of the problem are complex. They range from an insufficient number  of AIDS clinical research centers at hospitals and clinics that predominantly  serve minorities to inadequate recruitment efforts by researchers and the  general inequity of American health care, which favors the socio-economically  advantaged.  </P> <P> The government is taking remedial steps, such as sponsoring community programs  for AIDS research and funding projects designed to increase minority  participation in AIDS drug trials. Some universities have set up satellite  research sites at hospitals with large numbers of minorities; UCLA has  established sites at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance and Olive View  Medical Center in Sylmar, and Harvard Medical School has established a site at  Boston City Hospital.  </P> <P> So far, however, these and other corrective measures have had little overall  impact. Some say stronger actions are required.  </P> <P> "The federal government has its way of influencing you by the amount of money  they put in your pocket," said Dr. Lawrence S. Brown Jr., senior vice president  for research and medical affairs at the Addiction Research and Treatment Corp.  in New York City. "There need to be some incentives attached to those dollars  in terms of enrolling racial and ethnic minorities." The organization runs  clinics that treat thousands of drug addicts, predominantly black and Latino,  in Brooklyn and Manhattan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $57-Million Budget  </P> <P> The federally sponsored trials, known as the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, are  the nation's largest source of experimental AIDS care, with a 1989 budget of  about $57 million. They are conducted at academic medical centers throughout  the country, including five in California. Since the program began in 1986,  more than 7,500 patients have been enrolled. Currently, there are about 5,500  active participants.  </P> <P> The Times analysis concentrated on the 32 largest AIDS clinical trials units,  which primarily serve adult patients.  </P> <P> It showed that at six units, including Harvard Medical School in Boston and  Stanford University Medical Center, less than 10% of participants in trials are  black or Latino.  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas Merigan, director of the Stanford unit, said the medical center's  statistics reflect the location of its campus, in an affluent suburban area.  Merigan acknowledged that AIDS research centers need "to go where the patients  are . . . if we are going to be in business in five years" but said researchers  can't "do that overnight."  </P> <P> At an additional 11 units, including UCLA, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco and  two units in New York City, less than 20% of the participants are black or  Latino. By comparison, the majority of AIDS patients in New York City and about  24% of AIDS patients in California are black or Latino.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Blacks Near Campus  </P> <P> Dr. Samuel Bozzette, clinical director of the UC San Diego unit, said the  representation of Latinos and intravenous drug users is proportionate but  blacks are under-represented because most black residents of San Diego County  do not live near the medical center campus. Bozzette said the unit does not  "have the resources" to establish an off-campus clinic in a black community.  </P> <P> In contrast, four units have minority participation rates of 40% or more --  Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, Cornell University Medical  College and Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, and the University of  Miami. County-USC Medical Center ranked fifth, with a minority participation  rate of 38.1%.  </P> <P> In other findings:  </P> <P> * For intravenous drug users, 24 of the 32 units have participation rates of  15% or less, including three units in New York City, where intravenous drug  users represent more than 40% of newly diagnosed AIDS patients.  </P> <P> In contrast, intravenous drug users represent 25% or more of study participants  at four units -- the State University of New York at Stony Brook, the  University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Albert Einstein, and  Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.  </P> <P> Many researchers believe that current or previous intravenous drug users, by  the very nature of their addiction, may be less suitable for drug trials than  other potential participants. For instance, they may be more prone to miss  appointments or medication doses and to seek pain medications from their  physicians. As a result, researchers may need to give them more personal  attention to assure successful participation.  </P> <P> But Stanford's Merigan, who has studied the issue, said such concerns are often  blown out of proportion. While many intravenous drug users are reluctant to  enroll in AIDS trials, most of those who enroll turn out to be "excellent"  participants, he said.  </P> <P> * Women represent 6.8% of the participants in the trials, compared to 8.9% of  all adult AIDS patients. In part, the lower percentage of women in the trials  reflects the fact that most women infected with the human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS, are minority group members or intravenous drug  users.  </P> <P> Hoth said there is no "systematic exclusion of women" from the federal trials,  except for restrictions that women of childbearing age must not be pregnant and  use contraception.  </P> <P> This view was disputed by Iris Long, who directs an AIDS treatment registry  that monitors trials in New York City and northern New Jersey. Long said that  the women who have AIDS are almost all poor, and that "poor women do not have  access" to the teaching hospitals where the trials are primarily conducted.  </P> <P> * More than half of the nearly 300 children in federal AIDS trials are black or  Latino. Nationally, blacks and Latinos account for about 75% of pediatric AIDS  patients.  </P> <P> In general, members of minority groups are under-represented in clinical trials  of many diseases, compared to their proportion of the general population. But  the problem is considered particularly significant for AIDS, because HIV  infections are disproportionately common in minority groups. Moreover, many  HIV-infected members of minority groups acquired the virus through intravenous  drug use or sexual contact with an intravenous drug user.  </P> <P> The primary purpose of clinical research studies, according to Hoth, is not to  provide patients with access to experimental drugs but to find out as  "expeditiously as possible" which drugs work. On the other hand, as Hoth  explained at the international AIDS conference in Montreal in June, "clinical  trials represent hope," and "it is only equitable that there should be equal  access to clinical trials."  </P> <P> From a practical standpoint, the patients who are recruited into research  trials are those who receive primary health care at the hospitals where the  trials are conducted. But financial and geographic barriers may prevent many  HIV-infected individuals from seeking care at elite academic medical centers.  </P> <P> In addition, poor patients, intravenous drugs users and patients without health  insurance often do not have personal physicians at all. As a result, they are  unlikely to learn about the trials that might benefit them, according to many  of the researchers and government officials interviewed.  </P> <P> Some drug studies pay patients to participate, but the federally sponsored AIDS  trials do not. The AIDS clinical trials units do receive federal funds to pay  for their patients' medications and medical care, but they may still be  "reluctant . . . to accept responsibility" for patients without health  insurance or a personal physician, according to Hamburg of NIAID.  </P> <P> Several of those interviewed explained that a research center might have to  provide primary health care for patients who do not have personal physicians.  Moreover, if an AIDS patient without health insurance developed pneumonia and  needed to be hospitalized, the trials unit might need to use research funds to  pay for the hospitalization, thereby decreasing the total number of patients it  could enroll in studies.  </P> <P> Many affluent academic medical centers also have general policies that  discourage the admission of "uncompensated" patients. Enrolling a patient with  health insurance might seem more attractive, because the insurance would likely  pay for hospitalizations as well as routine physician visits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serve Own Patients First  </P> <P> "The major universities have done a good job of serving white gay men, but have  done less well serving blacks and Hispanics, particularly intravenous drug  users," said Chaisson of Johns Hopkins. "The hospitals who (were) funded take  care of their own patients, who happen to have insurance. They make an effort  to recruit other patients, but they take care of their patients first."  </P> <P> As an example, Chaisson said he had discussed a proposed study of tuberculosis  prevention in AIDS-virus infected individuals with about 70 other federally  funded AIDS researchers during an AIDS clinical trials group meeting in July.  The study would primarily enroll minorities and intravenous drug users; many  middle-class whites have never been exposed to the bacillus that causes  tuberculosis, and thus are not at risk. "Only three of the institutions said  they had the patient population or interest in participating," Chaisson said.  </P> <P> Another recruitment difficulty is that many minorities, unlike many  middle-class whites, do not view research as a "clearly defined benefit,"  according to Carole Levine, executive director of the Citizens Commission on  AIDS in New York City.  </P> <P> For example, many blacks still have vivid memories of the infamous Tuskegee  syphilis experiment. Between 1932 and 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service  deliberately withheld treatment from more than 400 black men with syphilis to  gather data on the unchecked progression of the disease, which can lead to  severe disability and death.  </P> <P> "A lot of (minorities) are suspicious of being used as guinea pigs even when  they are not being used as guinea pigs," said Dr. Bruce Soloway, a family  physician at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital in New York City, which serves a minority  population particularly hard-hit by the epidemic.  </P> <P> "Real-life barriers" such as a lack of child care or transportation are also  very significant, Levine said. Unlike medication and medical care, such  expenses are usually not covered. Because participants undergo frequent tests  and examinations, these expenses can be quite significant.  </P> <P> Hoth said the federal government has "no formal policy" on providing child care  and transportation for AIDS study participants but is studying the issues.  </P> <P> Many minorities are also reluctant to leave their communities. As an example,  Soloway said he had encouraged at least 50 of his patients over the last  several years to enroll in federal AIDS Trial 019, the study which demonstrated  that the drug AZT is effective in forestalling AIDS in some asymptomatic  individuals.  </P> <P> Although the research site, at Albert Einstein, was only several miles away,  only one patient enrolled. "It is only two or three miles, but for some (of my  patients) that is farther than they can possibly go," Soloway said.  </P> <P> Soloway added that trials at the five clinical trials units in Manhattan "might  as well be in Los Angeles," as far as his patients were concerned. "The  precondition of doing research in these groups is to bring research to the  patients, not the other way around."  </P> <P> The Times analysis also highlighted the lack of adult AIDS clinical trials  units in five of the 13 metropolitan areas with the largest number of AIDS  cases -- Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> The lack of an adult clinical trials unit is most striking in Houston, which  has had more than 3,000 AIDS cases. Houston now ranks fourth in AIDS cases,  behind New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Dallas, with 1,750 cases, ranks  12th.  </P> <P> In Pennsylvania, NIAID established AIDS clinical trials units in Pittsburgh,  which has had about 400 AIDS cases, and Hershey, a town of 13,000 people 100  miles west of Philadelphia. By comparison, no center was established in  Philadelphia, although it has five medical schools. Philadelphia has had about  2,200 AIDS cases and ranks ninth in AIDS cases nationally.  </P> <P> When asked about these findings, NIAID's Hoth said geographic factors were "not  taken into consideration" when most of the grants were initially awarded in  1986 and 1987. "We felt the most important thing for the country was to get the  scientifically best centers to get answers about which (AIDS) drugs work," he  explained.  </P> <P> In addition, Hoth said, the demographics of the epidemic, which at first  primarily struck white gay men in San Francisco, New York City and Los Angeles,  has shifted toward minorities and intravenous drug users and other metropolitan  areas.  </P> <P> Hoth said the federal institute is now turning its attention to demographic and  geographic factors. Earlier this month, for example, Hoth met with Texas  investigators about the possibility of establishing an AIDS clinical trials  unit there.  </P> <P> Asked if demographics will be considered when grants to AIDS clinical trials  units come up for renewal in 1991, Hoth said: "You better believe that  demographics will be a factor."  </P> <P> Over the next year, the federal government will spend between $5 million and  $10 million on projects designed to increase minority participation in AIDS  drug trials, Hoth said. It has plans to expand the number of minority health  professionals in AIDS research.  </P> <P> In addition, the NIAID AIDS program has hired Dr. George Counts, a senior  infectious disease specialist who is black, from the University of Washington  in Seattle, as chief of a new clinical research management branch. One of his  key tasks is to make sure that the AIDS clinical trials units do a better job  of recruiting minorities and intravenous drug users.  </P> <P> Another widely publicized program, federally funded AIDS community research  programs, may also help, but it is still in the planning stages. Although $6  million is available to fund between 10 and 20 community programs, the  government has yet to announce which programs will be funded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A WALK FOR AIDS  </P> <P> About 12,000 people walked in Hollywood, raising $1.8 million to fight AIDS.  Metro, Page 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AIDS CLINICAL TRIALS  </P> <P>  Blacks, Latinos and intravenous drug users are substantially under-represented  in ongoing federally sponsored trials of new AIDS drugs. As of Aug. 28, 20.4%  of the 7,659 patients who have been enrolled in National Institute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) trials were black or Latino. By comparison,  about 42% of adult AIDS patients in the United States are black or Latino. In  the trials, 11.3% of the enrolled patients were previous or current users of  intravenous drugs. By comparison, 27.5% of all adult AIDS patients report  previous or current intravenous drug use. Women represent 6.8% of the enrollees  in the trials, compared to 8.9% of all adult AIDS patients.  </P> <P>  These are the percentages of blacks, Latinos, intravenous drug users and women  in federal AIDS clinical trials, as well as comparable statistics for adult  AIDS cases in the United States and California.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:2.00IN:1.78IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %IVDRUG  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PATIENTS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %BLACK  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %LATINO  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> USERS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %FEMALE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Federal AIDS Clinical Trials  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7,659  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.1%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.8%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> AIDS CASES:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> United States  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 100,885  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15.2%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 27.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.9%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> California  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20,917  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13.9%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.9%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P>  Academic medical centers vary widely in the percentages of blacks, Latinos,  intravenous drug users and women they have enrolled in federal AIDS clinical  trials.

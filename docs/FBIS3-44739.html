The British Hong Kong Government, in the "White Paper on the  Draft Regulations on the New Airport Corporation" it publicized  on 3 January, proposes that the current provisional airport  administrative office be reorganized to become a commercial  corporation. Because of this, during its third meeting, the  Economic Subcommittee under the PWC of the HKSAR Preparatory  Committee requested the British Hong Kong authorities to send an  official to the PWC to explain the draft regulations on the new  airport in Hong Kong. But the British Hong Kong Government  openly rejected the request. Chen-Fang Ansheng, chief secretary  of the Hong Kong Government, said that there is "no need" for  the Hong Kong Government to send anyone to Beijing to explain to  the PWC the draft regulations because "the available channels  are sufficient."    In this connection, Zhang Junsheng indicated that because  the  issue of the new airport in Hong Kong is a matter that will  extend beyond 1997, it should be properly settled by China and  Britain through consultations. He said that the PWC has the  responsibility to study matters relevant to Hong Kong's smooth  transition and that its invitation to Hong Kong Government  officials to explain the draft regulations is something that  they should do because it is for the sake of Hong Kong's smooth  transition. He reiterated that the Chinese Government sincerely  hopes to cooperate with the British Hong Kong Government.</p>

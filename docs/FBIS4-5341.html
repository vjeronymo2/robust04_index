			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON Slams Kim Yong-sam Group's Dependence on </F> Outside Forces" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Our fellow countrymen  cannot live in peace nor can they avoid a nuclear disaster with  such traitors as the Kim Yong-sam group utterly devoid of  independence left in the nation, and must remove them in time,  stresses MINJU CHOSON today.    The news analyst says:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam during his trip to Japan asked  Japan  to "take responsible measures" over the "nuclear issue" of the  DPRK. He also called the U.S. President on the phone and begged  for "close cooperation" of the United States in South Korea's  campaign over the issue.    The South Korean "foreign minister" advertised the "need of  international sanctions" against the DPRK during his trip to the  United States and Japan.    This shows the South Korean puppet clique's dependence on  outside forces and flunkeyist treacheries against the nation  have been carried into the extremes.    The Kim Yong-sam group regards it as the only way of  prolonging its days to harm and stifle fellow countrymen as a  shock brigade in the anti-DPRK hostile policy of outside forces.  That is why the puppet clique is persisting in confrontation  and war moves against the North.    The Kim Yong-sam group must ponder over the grave  consequences that might come from its reckless act of driving  the situation to the brink of war in collusion with outside  forces.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jayme Brener, Luciano Suassuna, and Helio </F> Contreiras: "Kepi on the Forelock"; introductory paragraph in  boldface as published]    [Text] The military are criticizing the Federal  Supreme Court, reversing cuts included in the economic package  (with Itamar's support), and invading the political arena.    "If we should be forced to leave our bleached bones on the  desert trails in vain, beware the wrath of the legions!" That  simple expression of feeling to a cousin has lifted Centurion  Marcus Flavinius (a centurion was a kind of second lieutenant in  ancient Rome) from obscurity and given him a place of honor in  the most daring operation by the Brazilian military since the  end of the dictatorship in 1985. In only 36 hours--between  dinner on Tuesday the 7th and lunch on Thursday the 9th--the  high command used veiled threats to prevent a 40-percent cut in  its budget of 21.1 billion cruzeiros (at April prices). The cut  had been part of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic  package. In a pincer movement, the military condemned the  Federal Supreme Court's decision not to strip former President  Fernando Collor de Mello of his political rights and severely  criticized the immobilism of the CPI [congressional  investigating committee], which cannot decide how to punish the  corrupt deputies. The hardest blow in that operation--an  operation aimed at occupying space in the confused Brazilian  political arena--came in a speech by the Army chief of staff,  General Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel, on Thursday. He  resurrected Centurion Flavinius and the latter's threats during  what was supposed to have been a peaceable ceremony for  presenting commanders' swords to new general officers in  Brasilia. "It is essential that we--like our patron Caxias--know  how to protect the nation from itself," was the shot fired by  the general, 63, who served originally in the artillery.  Considered a hard-liner, he built his career alongside former  Minister of Army Leonidas Pires Goncalves, and he was selected  to add more, let us say, emphasis to the message. At the  commemoration of Air Force Day on 23 October, Fernando Henrique  had assured Minister of Army Zenildo de Lucena that the military  would not be affected by the cuts built into his budget package.  By failing to keep his word, Fernando became the most probable  target of the section of Gen. Benedito Leonel's speech in which  the latter talked about "irresponsibility, crooked dealing, and  disrespect for our most important values."    Benedito (or Benedictus) Leonel concluded his speech by  saying: "The time has not yet come for us to identify with the  anguish of Marcus Flavinius." But the high command's howitzer  had already hit its target: the government's strongbox. With the  support of President Itamar Franco, who chose to diminish the  credibility of his minister of finance and virtual candidate for  president of the republic, the military have guaranteed that  their uniforms will be safe from the effects of a package that  is going to tighten the belts of ordinary Brazilians. Whereas  the other ministries will have to work hard to stick to the $22  billion in cuts promised by the president, the Army, Navy, and  Air Force will keep their three strategic projects: the  nuclear-powered submarine, the space program, and the  Italian-Brazilian AMX fighter plane.    Operation "Kepi on the Forelock" was unleashed at the very  cabinet meeting where the budget cuts were discussed: on Tuesday  the 7th. "No, I don't agree. Would you like to have your pay cut  in half?" Minister of Navy Ivan Serpa asked the head of the  Planning Secretariat, Alexis Stepanenko. "I am doing what the  president ordered. Why should he spare you?" Stepanenko shot  back. He soon found out why.    The next day, Serpa made it a point to let his irritation be  known far and wide. Choosing Serpa to be the spokesman for  military discontent was a deliberate move: he is one of the  ministers closest to Itamar Franco. He headed a threat of  collective resignation by the military ministers, a resignation  that would have had unforeseeable consequences. And Gen. Zenildo  de Lucena, who had kept a low profile at the start of the  controversy ("we get along the best we can" was his comment),  delivered to the president a statement explaining why it was  necessary to stick to the original budget. In his document, the  minister warned that the cuts would cause a situation even more  serious than that in 1992, when there was not enough food and  soldiers were excused from duty early in the afternoon so they  would not eat a second meal at the barracks. For its part, the  Navy sent a lengthy document out in all directions explaining  the extent of its crisis.    Every officer and every barracks became a trench in the  operation unleashed by the senior officers. "The cuts will shut  the Army down," said Army spokesman General Gilberto Serra in  dramatic overstatement. "The Air Force's reserve supplies are  nil," said the presiding judge of the Superior Military Court,  General Cherubim Rosa Filho. "The FAB [Brazilian Air Force] has  reached the bottom of the barrel in terms of operational  effectiveness. It can conduct emergency operations only, and is  not in condition for combat," he said in conclusion. "In terms  of efficiency in Latin America, our Armed Forces are superior  only to the military of Uruguay, Paraguay, Colombia, and  Bolivia," said military analyst Roberto Lopes in agreement.  Brazil ranks 73d among 140 countries in terms of military  spending per capita. Each Brazilian spends $7 per year on his  uniformed fellow citizens, compared to $55 in Chile. Cutting off  military spending at the root would also throw a spadeful of  lime onto the reeling Brazilian arms industry. "We would  certainly have to close one of our firms: Aeroelectronics, which  manufactures components for the AMX fighter," said Claudio  Vianna, president of the Rio Grande do Sul group Aeromot.    At the Rio de Janeiro Military Club on Wednesday the 8th,  the  disagreement seemed likely to pass from words to action. Members  of the reserve joined with mothers, wives, and children in an  attempt to organize a march protesting low pay. A sergeant 3d  class in the Army was earning 80,866 cruzeiros in November,  while a private had to be content with 8,670 cruzeiros. The  protest was halted by the arrival of General Bayma Denis,  commanding officer of the Eastern Command. In accordance with  instructions from the minister of Army, he tried to calm people  down, but a degree of dissatisfaction remained. "There is no  reason for us to stifle all the anguish among the troops," one  officer commented.    Despite the rising temperature, almost no one mentioned a  coup during the crisis. "The military have no plan to take power  as they did before 1964, even though Brazilian society does not  know what it wants from the Armed Forces," says analyst Roberto  Lopes. The idea of a military mutiny was restricted to pockets  of radicals such as the group headed by reserve Colonel Pedro  Schirmer of Rio de Janeiro, who publishes the newspaper OMBRO A  OMBRO and supports "energetic and bold measures even if they  contradict false precepts that are allegedly democratic." In  recent months, Schirmer's little group has been lining up with  other coup-minded Latin American groups. His newspaper receives  articles from Argentine "cara pintada" Mohamed Ali Seineldin,  who is serving a life sentence, and General Francisco Efrain  Visconti of the Venezuelan Air Force, who is in exile in Peru.    But rejection of a coup did not mean that the high command  would no longer engage in politics. Quite the contrary. Minister  Zenildo de Lucena himself breached his strictly military image  by criticizing the Federal Supreme Court's vacillation about  confirming the revocation of former President Collor de Mello's  political rights. "As a Brazilian citizen, I was disappointed,"  the general said on Thursday the 9th. "We military men would  never do that," agreed Admiral Arnaldo Pereira, chief of the  EMFA [Armed Forces General Staff]. Taking advantage of that  instance of impunity, General Luciano Casales, deputy chief of  the EMFA, aimed a few projectiles at Congress. "The cost of the  Armed Forces to Brazilian society is less than that of the  corruption uncovered by the CPI's, including overbilling and tax  evasion," he told ISTOE.    The civilian politicians have acknowledged the truth of what  he says. "Their criticism is real. The country will not stand  for it if the CPI leads to nothing, but I find the tone of some  statements very worrying," said Deputy Jose Genoino (PT [Workers  Party], Sao Paulo), a former guerrilla fighter in Araguaia who  now has easy access to the military. And Senator Jarbas  Passarinho (PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Para), a colonel in  the reserve who went over to the legislative branch and now  heads the CPI on the Budget Committee, admits that "the major  new development is the fact that the military are talking about  politics, something that did not happen under the Collor  administration." True, but Operation "Occupy Space" began before  the crisis. At the end of November, a group of military  lobbyists coordinated by Gen. Benedito Leonel and his  legionnaires met with about 30 heavyweight businessmen at the  headquarters of the FIESP [Sao Paulo State Federation of  Industries] in Sao Paulo. The businessmen included the president  of the FIESP, Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira; and the president  of the National Confederation of Industry, Senator Albano  Franco. The purpose was to gain support among the businessmen  for some of the dogmas dear to the military, one example being  the continuation of compulsory military service.    The yearning by the military to enter deeply into the field  of politics seems to have grown stronger in response to the  absolute political vacuum accompanying the crisis following the  announcement of Fernando Henrique's economic package. Congress,  for example, has been unable to express itself as an  institution--unlike the situation during Jose Sarney's  administration, when Minister Leonidas Pires threatened the  Constituent Assembly and encountered resistance from Deputy  Ulysses Guimaraes at the head of the legislative branch.    President Itamar Franco's open support during the current  crisis has also encouraged the military. At the traditional  yearend luncheon for the chief of state and the principal  commanders of the Armed Forces, which was held in Brasilia on  Thursday the 9th, Itamar tried to belittle the civilian  government by overstating the role of the military. "I have been  trying to lead the administration in search of new paths, but I  am forced to confront terrible obstacles," the president said,  hinting that the terrible forces in question were impunity and  the selfishness of the politicians.    The mutual attraction between Itamar and the military is not  new. When he served two terms as mayor of Juiz de Fora in the  1960's and 1970's, he gained easy access to the commanders of  the 4th Army Division and the 4th Military Region, both  headquartered in that city. Itamar was elected by the MDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement], a party that opposed the  military regime, and he was a close friend of General Itibere  Gouveia do Amaral, commander of the 4th Military Region. At the  time, Municipal Councilor Francisco Fonseca of the rival Arena  [National Renewal Alliance] charged that the Secretariat of  Public Works in Juiz de Fora had diverted funds to pay for  improvements on the general's farm in Bicas, 33 kilometers from  Juiz de Fora. Over the past three weeks, Itamar has left his  isolation in Planalto Palace only to participate in military  ceremonies. Despite urging by advisers, the president has  refused to participate in any ceremony involving civilians.  Senator Jarbas Passarinho says sarcastically: "He is half  soldier."    Following the success of their Operation "Kepi on the  Forelock," the centurions in the three armed services certainly  agree with Passarinho. Minister of Air Lelio Lobo went directly  from the officers' luncheon with the president on Thursday to  the Brasilia Air Base. There he boarded an FAB aircraft and soon  landed in Sao Jose dos Campos, on his way to the office of the  director of the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA), General Nelson  Taveira. Lobo was there to give the go-ahead for continued work  on the AMX project and the space program. The Navy obtained a  promise that it could continue building its nuclear-powered  submarine (which is not expected to be completed before 2020),  and the Army will get funds for a new runway at the Agulhas  Negras Military Academy in Resende, Rio de Janeiro. That is  where the world pentathlon championship will be held in 1994.    The results of this military offensive did not stop there.  The officer class is now taking it for granted that civilian and  military personnel will be separated in the constitutional  revision, thus making it possible to approve separate pay  increases. The military adviser to Congress, Commander Sergio  Porto da Luz, says it is "practically guaranteed" that the  military will receive a 186-percent pay increase. That would  make up for the pay they lost in 1993. It would also strike  another very hard blow at Minister Fernando Henrique's policy of  lean cows.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Observer: Graphic example Only yesterday the FT was reporting how many companies illustrate their annual reports with graphs which flatter their performance. Take Scottish Metropolitan Property, which was singled out because of the generous use of its thistle logo to symbolise its profit growth. However, Vivien Beattie of Southampton University and Michael Jones of the University of Wales concluded that there were limits to this sleight of hand - companies with declining performance tend to dispense with graphs. How right they were. Scottish Metropolitan Property's latest accounts landed on Observer's desk yesterday showing a loss - and not a single graph.</p>

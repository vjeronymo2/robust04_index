			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rebound from support levels THE UK stock market con-tinued to trade nervously around its support levels yesterday as investors awaited developments at today's Pounds 3bn UK government bond auction and tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council. The equity market is now moving towards the end of the first quarter of 1993 and also the close of the UK financial year. Erratic trading left the FT-SE 100 Index finishing 14.5 ahead, but only after bouncing from the 2,850 support level in early dealing. Views on the near-term outlook for shares remained sharply divided, with the revival of interest rate speculation adding spice to the debate. While any repetition of the January drama, when base rates were cut on the eve of a gilt-edged auction, is already out of the question, market strategists will scan today's bond auction closely for signs of the views on interest rates held by the institutions. From the Bundesbank, nothing more than a further slackening in repurchase rates is thought likely, and that probably not this week. Equities opened firmly, helped by indications of a rally in the big pharmaceutical stocks in New York, which left some houses with orders to top up trading books in London. Heavy losses in the blue chip drug shares has been a significant feature in the recent slide in the UK market. The improvement put about 18 points on the Footsie, but the gain proved the best of the day and was shortlived. By mid-morning the index was only 3.5 ahead at 2,850, although from this level it quickly bounced. For the rest of the session the market advanced in modest trading to close at Footsie 2,861, a gain of 14.5 on the day. The erratic pattern reflected a generally cautious policy by fund managers, some of whom have virtually stopped trading until the new UK tax year opens on April 6. Seaq trading volume rose sharply to 734.7m shares yesterday, but was swollen by a big placing of Owners Abroad shares and by activity in two new issues. On Monday, Seaq volume of 487.2m shares was worth only Pounds 1.08bn in retail business, underlining the reduction in activity by the institutions; daily retail business has averaged around Pounds 1.5bn in recent weeks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less volatile than the FT-SE 100, added 4.7 at 3,096.3. Trading in non-FT-SE 100 stocks slipped to around 59 per cent of total volume. The traditional slowdown in equity trading ahead of the year-end has left some market strategists uncertain regarding the outlook for a market now little changed from the levels at which it started the year. Question marks still hang over the pace of the recovery in the domestic economy, and thus in corporate earnings. Funding pressure in the bond market is also seen as a competitor for investment cash, and some fear that other European stock markets offer greater prospects for the near term. However, Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research Institute remains firmly in the van of the bull charge, and last night reaffirmed his target of Footsie 3,500, in spite of the current struggle to hold 2,850. 'I am particularly bullish right now. The institutions are not sellers of this market and overseas buyers are poised to buy UK stocks when the end of the quarter influences are over,' he said.</p>

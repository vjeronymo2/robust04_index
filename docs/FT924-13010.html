			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE LONG expected cut in UK base rates was the trigger for an upsurge in activity in the derivatives markets yesterday, writes Steve Thompson. The December contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,590 and drifted back to 2,575 during a quiet early period of trading, reflecting the early weakness of the cash market which was attributed to a number of large blocks of stock being offered into the market. However, the future began to move up in mid-morning, regaining the 2,590 level and racing ahead to the day's peak of 2,655, a premium of 80 points over fair value, after the rate cut. The market's enthusiasm was short-lived, however, as the cash market encountered profit-taking caused by sterling weakness, as well as a poor opening on Wall Street. The future closed at 2,607, a premium of 11 points above fair value, currently estimated at 32. Turnover reached 11,364 contracts. In traded options, GEC topped the list of active stock options with 3,715 contracts traded, mostly accounted for by a spread trade involving the May 240 and 260 series. Option turnover totalled 32,364 contracts.</p>

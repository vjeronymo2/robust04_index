			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (5): Skiing gear - we're giving it away Hundreds of pounds to spend on ski gear - it could be yours when you book this winter's skiing holiday. The FT has teamed up with some big names in skiing to offer readers free skis, bindings, boots, clothing or other accessories. Collect tokens from the FT and book a skiing holiday through Page &amp; Moy with Bladon Lines, Club Med, Virgin Ski or Neilson, and you will receive vouchers to the value of about half the basic cost of your holiday. These vouchers can then be exchanged for goods from a range selected by the FT from Colorado, the direct mail ski retailer. Items range from a Pounds 5.99 pair of socks, to a Descente ski suit at Pounds 429.99. The first token and details of the offer will appear in Weekend FT next Saturday.</p>

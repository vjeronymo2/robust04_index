			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Yakovlev under the heading "Finance": </F> "Major European Bank Arrives in Petersburg"]    [Text] A St. Petersburg office has been opened by the Dutch  bank ABN AMRO, which is the fifth largest bank in Europe and the  16th largest in the world.    The Dutch were not deterred by the fact that last year  Russia  restricted foreign banks' opportunities to work with our  country's companies and citizens. According to information  obtained from Mr. Van Tets, a member of the ABN AMRO board of  directors, in the very near future negotiations between the  European Union leadership and the Russian Government should  result in considerable easing of the terms under which European  banks operate in our country. It is possible that within one  month ABN AMRO will be able to provide a full range of services  to residents of Russia.    The Dutch have outlined three main focuses of their  operations.    First of all, there is the capital market. With help from  ABN  AMRO leading Russian companies will be able to float their  stocks and bonds in the West. In this way the Dutch bank will  not be "siphoning off Russian resources to foreign countries"  (the fear that exists among many proponents of protectionism in  our country), but instead will help aid the influx of capital  into Russia. True, for that to happen our companies will have to  be competitive and attractive from an investment standpoint.    Secondly, ABN AMRO provides a whole range of services to  private and privatizing enterprises. The Dutch have gained a  great deal of experience working with countries that are  reforming their economies, as the bank is already active in the  Eastern European countries.    Thirdly, ABN AMRO handles project financing. It is possible  that major projects will be carried out with its aid in our city  as well. A particularly favorable environment for this is being  created by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,  which this week considered a number of projects in connection  with our city's development.    Of course, the instability of Russia's political and  economic  situation is hampering the influx of foreign capital, including  banking capital. But the arrival of ABN AMRO in St. Petersburg  on the heels of Credit Lyonnais and BNP-Dresdner Bank attests to  a revival of international business connections.</p>

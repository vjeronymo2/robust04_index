			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich registers its fourth all-time high of the week ANALYSTS fought a losing battle with dealers in the German equity market, while Switzerland continued to demonstrate its consistency, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH continued to find support in the dollar, ending at its fourth all-time high of the week. The SMI index rose 12.1 to 2,348.2, 1.3 per cent up on the week. Miss Michelle Doughty of Hoare Govette in London said that the market was also continuing to benefit from investors switching from other European markets. Continuing hopes of easier interest rates and expectations of strong profit rises in banks boosted the market. CS Holding rose SFr30 to SFr2,640 and SBC SFr6 to SFr402. Portfolio management banks were also in demand. Baer Holding added SFr60 or 4.5 per cent to SFr1,375 after Thursday's announcement that first-half profits would be above the level for the whole of 1992. Richemont bearers, suspended for the previous two sessions, eased SFr20 to SFr1,370. An initially positive reaction to plans to reorganise its tobacco and luxury goods interests was countered by disappointment with its results. FRANKFURT's DAX index rose 8.95 to 1,696.20, 0.5 per cent higher on the week, turnover falling from DM6.9bn to DM6bn. Its main winners were the banks, recouping some of their losses over the week as a whole. Bayernhypo and Bayernverein, the most interest rate-sensitive in the sector, recovered DM7.50 to DM401, and DM5.50 to DM420.50. Commerzbank put on DM3.50 to DM298 and Deutsche Bank DM6 to DM682.20. There was head-shaking over carmakers, winners over the week and strong again yesterday. Daimler rose DM3.50 to DM616.50 and put on another DM4 to DM620.50 after hours although its Mercedes-Benz unit forecast an operating loss for 1993. PARIS was dampened down by profit-taking, but it still had its rising stars as the CAC-40 index ended 2.46 lower at 1,960.84 on the day, and 2.6 per cent higher on the week. Turnover fell by FFr1bn to FFr3bn. Peugeot extended its gains on the week to FFr65, or 12.6 per cent with a rise of FFr19 to FFr582. Still in the automotive sector, Michelin put on FFr7.90 to FFr158.10 on the grounds that it was probably oversold. Matra-Hachette, rose FFr4.50 to FFr139.50. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the defence and communications group's chairman, repeated his expectation of 'significantly higher' net profits this year. AMSTERDAM saw limited gains which took the CBS Tendency index 0.8 higher to 111.5, up 2.1 per cent on the week. Philips rose 80 cents to Fl 29.20 after its German unit revealed lower 1992 net profits, and predicted break-even in 1994. A Fl 1.90 or 5.8 per cent rise to Fl 34.30 by Nedlloyd was attributed to reports that analysts were recommending the stock. Nutricia, the baby and hospital food group, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 132.50 after confirming rumours of a withdrawal of its powder baby foods across the US after a salmonella scare. MILAN made little headway in thin turnover as investors awaited the outcome of labour negotiations. The Comit index dipped 0.20 to 534.43, little changed on the week. Olivetti extended Thursday's gains, rising L55 to fix at L1,440 before L1,460 on the kerb on continued hopes that it will obtain a licence for cellular telephone operations. MADRID ran into doubts that the Socialists will be able to form a coalition government and the general index closed 3.41 lower at 258.60, 2.3 per cent lower on the week. Argentaria and Santander lost Pta75 to Pta4,625 and Pta 150 to Pta5,600 in banks and Cubiertas and Uralita shed Pta380 to Pta6,650, and Pta49 to Pta791 respectively in the more volatile construction sector. COPENHAGEN continued its advance amid widespread expectations of further sizeable rises next week. The KFX index added 0.25 at 89.19, in turnover of DKr644m. Moeller's D/S 1912 A and B shares both rose DKr1,000 to DKr109,000 and DKr108,500 respectively, while Danisco, the food, sugar beet and packaging group, ended DKr15 higher at DKr750.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 25                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1196.14    1198.68    1200.35   1201.39 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1249.18    1253.01    1252.48   1252.42  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1202.05    1202.26    1201.98   1202.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1253.96    1254.69    1255.46   1254.67  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 24    Jun 23    Jun 22    Jun 21   June 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1199.58   1197.17   1198.69   1193.31   1186.72 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1251.56   1249.23   1253.34   1250.44   1242.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1203.25; 200 - 1257.48 Low/day: 100 - 1196.14 200 - 1247.81  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A novel test system that facilitates fault  detection in a variety of materials and combinations of  materials has been developed, built, and tested by Battelle  Engineering GmbH in Frankfurt. Even molded parts with  complicated geometries can easily be inspected.    Cavities down to a minimum diameter of 3 mm directly below  the surface and larger faults deeper down can be detected, even  when there are local differences in foam hardness.    The system's capacity for detecting faults in glued joints  between one metal and another, metal and plastic, plastic and  wood, other combinations of materials, and honeycomb structures  has also been put to the test.    The system can be used, for example, for monitoring the  start  of a new series, optimizing foaming or bonding processes,  strength testing, random sampling during manufacturing, and 100  percent monitoring of critical sectors.    The range of potential applications is thus wide: The motor  vehicle and associated industries, the aircraft industry, the  wood and plastics converting industries, shipbuilding, and many  other areas can benefit from the new inspection system.    It holds out another advantage as well: It needs no  specialized personnel to operate it, nor does it require the  products to be pretreated in any particular way prior to  inspection. There is no need to use coupling [Koppel-] fluids  and pastes. The basic device incorporates the power supply, the  excitation and evaluation electronics, and the acoustic fault  indicator. An optical fault indicator is integrated into the  test head along with the electromechanical excitation system and  the sensor. The signal is given on-line when a fault is  detected.

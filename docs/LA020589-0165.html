			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS CONTINUE FALL, LOSE TO WARRIORS  </P> <P> Not even the Miami Heat has lost as many consecutive games as the Clippers.  </P> <P> The Clippers' spiral continued Saturday night as Chris Mullin scored 24 points  to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 116-107 victory. It was the Clippers'  18th straight loss.  </P> <P> Winston Garland, Terry Teagle and Mitch Richmond scored 18 points each and  Larry Smith had 16 rebounds for the Warriors, who got their eighth straight  home victory.  </P> <P> Ken Norman scored 28 points for the Clippers (10-35), who surpassed Miami's  previous National Basketball Assn. season high of 17 consecutive defeats. They  are one shy of the franchise record and two short of the league single-season  record set by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1972-73.  </P> <P> Quintin Dailey, the Clippers' leading scorer, hit his head on the court with  10:39 left in the second quarter and left the game with a mild concussion.  Teammate Tom Garrick left early in the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle.  </P> <P> Manute Bol came off the bench to block three shots and made a 3-pointer from  the top of the key as the Warriors began to pull away during a 38-point second  quarter.  </P> <P> Mullin scored 12 points in that period as Golden State built a 60-49 lead with  2:18 left in the half.  </P> <P> Otis Smith's two free throws with eight seconds left gave Golden State its  largest first-half lead at 66-53 before Norm Nixon made a 3-pointer with one  second remaining.  </P> <P> Norman scored 11 points in the third quarter, and the Warriors led 94-83 at the  start of the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

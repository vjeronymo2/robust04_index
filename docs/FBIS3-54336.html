Dear brothers and sons, soldiers, and officers of the police:    It was not strange for the Egyptian police to choose one of  the greatest days of national struggle to mark its day and for  us to remember the sacrifices of honorable men who gave their  lives in the line of duty. They defended their position to the  last man to make this day a national holiday for all Egypt, a  day that elevates the value of duty, shows the meaning of  sacrifice, and emphasizes the determination of a people to stand  fast.    The steadfastness of a limited number of policemen in  Ismailia on 25 January 1952 against the foreign occupation  forces and their courageous resistance of the aggression until  the end was a glorious chapter in the epic of our national  struggle. They stood fast in the face of military forces  equipped with all types of heavy weapons. They chose to die  defending their small post to show the steadfastness of all  Egypt in the face of the occupation's arrogance and violence.  They were a splendid symbol of the steadfastness of a nation  that rejects submission and surrender. They were an eternal  example of a splendid national courage that rejects coercion and  violence. They were a true embodiment of a great Egyptian call  to defend the dignity and honor of the homeland.    The Egyptian police chose this great day in the history of  Egyptian patriotism to emphasize the meaning of devotion and  sacrifice and to emphasize the commitment of this longtime  national institution to the objectives of national struggle.  Policemen are a part of the fiber of this people. Their duty  is to defend the people's hopes and aspirations; guard the  security of every citizen; protect citizens' honor, freedom, and  property; safeguard the country's stability; maintain respect  for the law; restrain the oppressor; assist the needy; defend  society against the evils of outlaws; and fight illegal  profiteers, drug traffickers, mishandlers of the people's  interests, and those who dare to tamper with the country's  security and stability.    This sublime and noble message is not easy to carry out.  Only those who are able to give of themselves and sacrifice can  shoulder its burdens and difficulties, those who are ready to  sacrifice for the sake of the country, those who do not hesitate  to confront the most difficult dangers to defend the security of  every citizen, and those who compete to sacrifice their lives to  fulfill their duty.    The sacrifices of Egyptian policemen, represented by the  events of January 1995, are continuing every day in numerous  forms of heroism and sacrifice while defending the people's  right to a secure and stable country, which should be not  affected by the designs of a deviated and blinded group. This  group has launched a war against its country, destroying its  economy, undermining its interests, and killing and wounding  many innocent victims without any restraint from religion or  conscience.    Righteous police officers and soldiers have been martyred.  They have offered their blood to defend the right of every  Egyptian to a safe homeland that protects his present and  future. Some of them were martyred in confrontations sparked by  the growing criminal inclinations of those groups. Others were  treacherously martyred, fired at while going about their daily  business only because of their affiliation with a national  agency whose primary responsibility is to maintain the  homeland's security and stability.    Brothers and sons, police officers, and soldiers: I am fully  confident that all of Egypt is joining us today as we celebrate  a national day associated, in history and meaning, with the  sacrifices of honorable men who were, and still are, pioneers in  confrontation and sacrifice. They are doing all they can to  confront an imminent danger that is laying in wait for the  future of the homeland, a danger linked to the conspiracies of  known foreign forces that do not want Egypt to have stability or  progress, forces that use local individuals and groups whose  conscience is blind to the interests of the homeland.    Society has discovered the truth of the police prediction  made long ago that those groups seek to impoverish Egypt and  hinder its progress in favor of foreign forces that want our  country to remain burdened with the problems of unemployment,  poverty, and a lack of job and investment opportunities so that  it will not contribute to human progress.    First and foremost, those groups are a tool of sabotage and  destruction. Their other role is to block Egypt's democratic  march and undermine the achievements of successive Egyptian  generations that have struggled throughout history to turn this  homeland into a beacon of faith and a torch of science and  culture. Their aim is to frighten and force darkness onto the  mind of the nation and turn the homeland into a large prison,  where there is no place for opposition or debate and no room for  divergent views or opinions except under guillotines.    The objectives of those groups have been revealed. They rid  themselves of any deterrent from religion or conscience and  continue with their growing criminal inclination, committing  extremely shameful and horrible acts. Their true face has been  flagrantly exposed to all: They are merely hired gangs shedding  the blood of innocent people and violating the interests of the  majority of our silent people. They kill for the sake of  killing, unconcerned with the fall of scores of innocent victims.    Police officers have never hesitated to confront the groups  of terrorists. They have waged the confrontation battle boldly  and courageously, enjoying the support of a great nation that  has realized the dimensions and dangers of the conspiracy. The  people have strongly supported their police officers, protecting  their backs, blessing their efforts, and helping them as much as  they could.    The people have helped chase the culprits and have led  police to the dens of saboteurs. At the decisive moments, the  people have closed their ranks in calling for uprooting  terrorists, who seek to impoverish Egypt, destroy its national  economy, and disrupt its security for external goals and do not  care about the interests of the homeland or the people. The  masses have closed their ranks while paying tribute to victims  from the police and the people, openly announcing their decision  to confront terrorism, the enemy of God and the homeland, while  condemning its abominable crimes and raising their voices  against its atrocities, which run contrary to heavenly messages  and human values, target innocent victims, and waste the  homeland's present and future.    This increasing cohesion between the people and the police  in  the face of terrorist groups shows whoever has vision and  insight that terrorism has no future on this good and tolerant  soil, that it is inevitably doomed to fail and recede, and that  it will remain isolated and besieged until it is uprooted.  Terrorism has no future on this ancient land because its  abominable deeds and crimes are carried out by aberrant groups  that have broken away from the national unanimity. They are at  odds with the spirit of the people, run contrary to the people's  nature, and undermine their interests. A minority who is  isolated from the national mainstream will not be able to  humiliate the will of the people or dictate to this noble nation  a fate that has nothing to offer but ignorance, despotism,  oppression, and poverty.    Brothers and sons: The Egyptian people's decision to side  with their police marks a decisive development in the  confrontation with the phenomenon of terrorism because the  security of any homeland cannot be fully and properly attained  without cooperation between the people and the police in  combating crime, exposing corruption, and uncovering criminals.  The awareness of each citizen of his responsibility for the  security of the country and his realization of the importance of  assisting police officers in their mission will ensure stability  in every part of the country, broaden the respect for the law,  and keep crime to a minimum. No matter how capable the state  may be in intensifying security measures on Egyptian streets, it  has limits that are difficult to go beyond. Police cannot put a  security guard in every part of the country, but each citizen  could contribute toward maintaining the security of the  neighborhood he lives in. By doing this we could contain  terrorism in limited areas that are easy to narrow down.  Cooperation between the police and people is important because  of several other factors. The most important factor is that it  is the duty of the police to provide security for each Egyptian  and that police officers are part of the people and are doing  their duty toward their families.    We all must remember that security is not just the  responsibility of the regime or of those in charge of it. It is  also the responsibility of each citizen to help protect his  livelihood, honor, children, life, and property. It is the  responsibility of society now and in the future.    Brothers and sisters. The arm of the state is strong and  capable of uprooting the terrorist elements in the quickest time  possible. But we do not want to invalidate the rule of the law  and we refuse to bypass our national commitment to let our ways  and means of combating terrorism remain confined to the  framework that protects our democratic choice.    Police behavior toward the enemies of the homeland will  remain civilized and governed by the rule of law and will remain  above the methods of revenge. The police will not punish anyone  for a crime committed by someone else but will put the whole  matter into the hands of a fair and honest judiciary that is not  subject to any authority other than conscience and the law.    The recent terrorist incidents that aimed to frighten  society  and to destroy the homeland's structures could have been the  excuse for stringent emergency measures that strengthen the  police force's ability to confront the terrorist elements and  cut short the time needed for the confrontation. But we refused  to do this out of respect for the rule of law, the authority of  the judiciary, and human rights. We refused to do so out of  belief in the ability of the democratic course to confront  terrorism if all the efforts of society combine to confront this  phenomenon and the political responsibility of the parties and  the national action institutions rise to the level of commitment  to the homeland's supreme interests. This great cooperation  between the police and the people is now available.    The fact is that some of our national parties have taken a  step in the right direction. They condemn terrorism and  strongly call for eliminating its lairs, causes, and roots.  Only some of the enemies of democracy, who still hide behind  false slogans that propagate terrorist ideas and actions, have  remained outside this national consensus.    Brothers, before the referendum on the new term of office, I  called for a statewide national dialogue in which all national  parties and forces take part in order to define clearly the  priorities of national action in light of the circumstances and  the challenges that the homeland is going through. My objective  from this dialogue -- and it is still my objective -- is to  reach a national agreement that will position the issue of  security and stability correctly among the national action  priorities because society will not have the opportunity to  advance along the course of economic or social reform in the  absence of stability. Stability is the basis and the support  for a democratic and capable homeland that is not distracted  from continuing its progress by ambition, the chaos of  conflicts, or the struggle between forces.    In my comprehensive speech at the recent opening of the  People's Assembly's parliamentary session following the  referendum, I urged that the objectives of the national dialogue  should extend to include a scientific, objective, and  comprehensive concept of Egypt's future at the start of the 21st  century. My aim has been and still is that this comprehensive  concept should lead to a widely based national accord committed  to the homeland's supreme interests and rallies the efforts of  all forces behind the homeland's strategic objectives about  which there can be no argument. The political parties, national  forces, public action establishments, intellectuals, and those  who care about the homeland's future responded positively to the  call for a national dialogue. I believe that this dialogue  could be a good opportunity to achieve a comprehensive vision  that goes beyond our narrow party interests, places our national  priorities in their right place, and draws the dividing lines  that no one should go beyond for the sake of protecting this  homeland's interests.    We are not trying to remove the differences among the  various parties, nor do we want to abolish points of divergence  in their views and programs. It is in divergent programs and  views that the meaning of democracy lies. In essence, democracy  is a dialogue between opposing views to attain the truth or  agree on common objectives.    From this national dialogue, we do not seek to abolish  differences in views, but we call for respecting the priorities  and principles of the democratic action, which suppose a minimum  level of agreement among the various parties on the homeland's  high interests when it faces one of its main challenges.    Brothers and sons, police officers and soldiers: We are not  the only ones suffering from terrorism. In many countries,  there are terrorist groups led by disobedient ones, mutineers,  and outlaws. Despair eroded their souls, and frozen minds  prevented them from keeping up with the developments of the age.  They were turned into a destructive force against their  homelands. They wanted to obstruct society, antagonize history,  and move backward to escape the burdens of the future.    But these groups soon disappear without achieving anything.  They are scattered remnants that do not represent a basic trend  in society. Perhaps the difference between one particular  situation and another lies in the ability of each society to  prepare itself to confront the phenomenon through firm,  unwavering national unanimity--one that does not tolerate  ambiguity or compromise, and is not spoiled by a sinful desire  to use the situation to achieve small party interests, often at  the expense of the society.    I do not need to stress the importance of our national  consensus on the issue of stability. The message of security  and stability is never separable from the message of economic  and political construction. Without stability, it is impossible  for democracy or the economy to flourish, and it is impossible  for us to aspire to a strong state capable of meeting its  people's demands.    This is the fact that we must keep before our eyes; it is a  fact that cannot tolerate denial or one-upmanship. I am  confident that the wave of terrorism will recede and vanish in  the face of our national consensus and the determination of the  great Egyptian people to eradicate this phenomenon. Then, Egypt  will continue the march of construction and development, more  strongly and vigorously, under a safe and stable umbrella where  investment capabilities are redoubled, the tourism boom is  restored, new projects are spread over every inch of this  homeland, and all efforts are devoted to a fair and continuing  development that takes into consideration Egypt's less-developed  geographic regions and the slums most in need of services.    The wave of terrorism will be broken and will disappear  through the sacrifices of the heroic men who offered their dear  souls so that this homeland will remain, as it has always been,  safe and stable, built by the hands of its virtuous sons--hands  that do not know destruction, only construction. The country  will continue its message as a beacon of light and culture, with  a history that has produced a succession of intellectuals,  thinkers, creative people, and esteemed ulema and judges. They  have been the conscience of this nation, spreading the values of  justice, enlightenment, and support for life.    The sacrifices of these martyrs will remain a beacon  exuding the values of sacrifice and loyalty, embodying the  offerings of brave men who defended the people's right to live,  and immortalizing the loyalty of a great people who will  continue to remember with gratitude their heroic and innocent  sons. Greetings to the policemen who continue to offer  sacrifices in defense of the security of every citizen.  Greetings to their innocent martyrs who offered their souls to  redeem a homeland aspiring to security, stability, and progress.  Greetings to other martyr citizens who treacherously fell  victim to abominable crimes, including innocent children in the  age of flowers, youths who were sources of hope for their  relatives and homeland, and ordinary innocent Egyptians.    Brothers, the forces of treachery and darkness cannot  undermine this high edifice built by the Egyptian people with  their sweat, sacrifice, and struggle. The Egyptians have  realized great construction and progress, which will not be  obstructed by terrorist crimes that the whole people have  denounced when they discovered they are seeking to ruin this  edifice and squander the homeland's interests. We have agreed  on building a free and democratic society that respects the  right to disagreement within the framework of a real multi-party  system and that gives full opportunity for opinion and  counter-opinion. The achievement of this goal has not been easy  under the difficult circumstances that could have eroded our  nascent democracy. However, we have stood fast and fought. We  now have a correct democracy, the course of which is being  strengthened day by day. This democracy is based on a  multi-party system, a free press, and an independent judiciary.  We have agreed on establishing a society capable of fulfilling  the people's demands and harnessing their resources. This  society is pervaded by mutual confidence and does not deny the  opportunity for participation to any citizen. The achievement  of this goal has not been easy in a society governed by vestiges  and shackles trying to pull it backward and squander its  strength.    We now have a society capable of shouldering the burdens of  the future, a society that opens the doors of participation for  whoever wants to enter, and that accepts any contribution that  increases its strength and potential. We have agreed to build a  society not governed by the complexes of the past. This society  looks forward to the future, upholds a just peace, seeks to  reclaim its pioneer position in the world, and extends bridges  of cooperation to all. The achievement of this goal has not been  easy in an Arab and international climate permeated by  apprehensions and doubts. We now have an open society that has  relations with all states and that plays its vanguard role in  the Arab world as a force for justice and solidarity. It  spreads the umbrella of peace over the whole region. It lifts  Egypt's banners high.    We have agreed to build a strong state having a national  deterrent force, thus preserving the homeland's destiny and  protecting its peace and security. Achieving this goal has not  been easy in difficult economic conditions. We now have armed  forces capable of undertaking their national tasks, defending  peace and participating with rare efficiency in preserving  national security and world peace.    Officers and men, let us be confident that falsehood will  retreat because truth is bound to triumph and falsehood cannot  survive in a country full of light, riches, and faith that  labors for a better future for its future generations.  Falsehood will not stand a chance of surviving in this good and  tolerant land. It will remain outcast and isolated and pursued  by the people's anger and wrath until it recedes and disappears.    The wave of terrorism will retreat and break by virtue of  the  valiant men's courage and the awareness of a nation that cannot  be deceived by falseness and perversion so that Egypt will  become again, as it always has, a safe and secure country. This  is Almighty God's promise. Peace and God's mercy be upon you.  [applause]</p>

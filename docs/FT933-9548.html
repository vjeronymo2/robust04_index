			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Bowthorpe seeks Dollars 75m through US placement BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group, plans to raise Dollars 75m from US institutions with a private placement of 10-year fixed-rate bonds. Mr Colin McCarthy, finance director, said he felt 'the timing was right to borrow US dollars long term', given that US interest rates were at their lowest levels in nearly two decades. The company expects to borrow funds at below 7 per cent. 'We have major investments in the US so we need dollars,' Mr McCarthy said, pointing out that proceeds of the bond issue would be kept in dollars. Bowthorpe has a five-year Pounds 100m borrowing facility - known as a multi-option facility, or MOF - which is approaching its maturity date and which allowed the company to borrow at 15 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). The US private placement of bonds is intended to replace this MOF financing, of which Pounds 60m was committed. UK companies have been flocking to the US private placement market in recent months, attracted by the availability of long-term funding at relatively favourable terms.</p>

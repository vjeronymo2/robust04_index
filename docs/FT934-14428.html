			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Markets: Life funds link-up worries investors - Serious Money THE PROPOSED merger of the life funds of Friends Provident and UK Provident has caused some disquiet among Weekend FT readers, who feel that the policyholders of the latter company are not getting a fair deal. The deal marks the end of a long process. An operational merger between the two companies was announced in 1986. A scheme of arrangement followed in 1988 which fully merged the businesses but kept the life funds separate. According to Friends Provident, there are a number of reasons why the fund merger is needed now: No new policies have been sold by the UK Provident fund for several years, and thus no new cash is coming in. Accordingly, when benefits are paid, the fund has to sell investments. This has led to reduced returns because shares may have to be sold at depressed prices and more of the fund needs to be invested in fixed interest securities. There is little scope for management expenses to be cut further. As the fund shrinks, the fixed costs have a proportionately greater impact on returns. UK Provident fundholders will benefit from the savings gained by eliminating the need for separate accounting for each fund and from savings in management time. So why are some readers upset? One key reason is a clause in the circular which says 'it would be equitable to expect the UKP fund policyholders to make some contribution to strengthen the financial position of the single fund arising as a result of the amalgamation in return for this benefit. It is proposed to implement this by reducing the rate of investment return used to calculate the asset shares (against which bonus policy will be determined) of UKP Fund policyholders by 0.25 per cent in each future year.' This is hardly an incentive to agree to the merger; after all, investors expect to be paid a premium for agreeing to a takeover, not to suffer a penalty. Friends Provident argues, however, that UKP policyholders will benefit from enhanced investment returns in the merged fund (because of the greater investment freedom). This factor, Friends Provident believes, will be worth around 1 per cent a year, more than outweighing the 0.25 per cent charge. This does not convince some readers. One writes that 'there seem to be few, if any, details on costs, bonuses, relative performance etc to back up the proposal.' Another dismisses the argument about the shrinking UKP fund, pointing out that the fund still has some Pounds 1.86bn of assets. 'It ought to be perfectly possible to run a fund of that size economically,' he contends. The arguments are complex. Some might say that closed funds are better for investors, since they are not bearing the costs (commissions etc) of acquiring new business. One reader was hoping to take advantage of the 'tontine effect' whereby as the fund shrinks, the biggest returns go to the last investors left within it. Friends Provident argues that the tontine effect only occurs if early-exiting investors are inadequately compensated; something they intend to avoid. A more fundamental complaint is that policyholders will not have a vote on the merger. Instead, an application has been made to approve the scheme in the High Court. This, argues a reader, makes it difficult for individual policyholders to oppose the deal, short of hiring a barrister. Friends Provident says a vote was taken in 1988, when it was made clear that the merger of the funds was a long term aim. A further vote would be too costly. The merger proposals have received the approval of an independent actuary. Nevertheless, it is at least arguable that the owners of a Pounds 1.86bn fund ought to have more time, and more consultation rights, about such a fundamental change. Policyholders who object to the scheme can write to the company secretary of Friends Provident, who will lodge all objections with the Court. Friends Provident has a helpline on 0722-413366. * * * How should unit trusts earn their annual management charge? The subject this week was brought into focus by a Securities and Investments Board consultation paper which suggested that the annual charge must be deducted from the income account. The paper was prompted by a Foster &amp; Braithwaite trust which planned, after agreement with the trustees, to deduct the charge from the capital account. Such a proposal was within the rules; but SIB saw some dangers. With current 6 per cent base rates, investors are eager to find any source of a high level of income. At the moment, if fund X buys bonds yielding 7 per cent and its annual charge (and other expenses) are 1 per cent, the yield to the investor will be 6 per cent. But if fund Y deducted its annual charge from capital, it could advertise a yield of 7 per cent. To the unwary investor, fund Y might seem more attractive, even though he would be no better off. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds wants its members to be able to deduct the annual charge from capital, provided investors are made fully aware of what is happening. My own view is that such trusts should not be permitted to advertise a yield which did not allow for the impact of the charge. Anything else would give too much scope to mislead investors.</p>

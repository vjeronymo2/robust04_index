			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / European Bonds: Traders wait for next turn of the monetary screw THE SPECTRE of German monetary policy looks likely to haunt European government bond markets this week ahead of the Bundesbank's regular bi-weekly council meeting on Thursday. Investors have been anticipating lower German interest rates since the start of the year but, so far, expectations have been misplaced. The Bundesbank has been more inclined to tighten policy rather than cut rates. By the end of last week, the market was bracing itself for another turn of the monetary screw. Stubbornly high money supply growth and consumer price inflation are the root causes of anxiety. The authorities' favoured measure of money supply, M3, is growing at a year-on-year rate of 9 per cent, against a target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. Most analysts think the Bundesbank will not raise either the discount rate or Lombard rate. However, it could still tighten money market conditions in an attempt to restrict broad money growth. For example, increased reserve requirements for banks - the amount banks must deposit with the authorities against loans - would increase the cost of credit. Alternatively, the Bundesbank could restrict the amount banks can borrow in the money markets at the Lombard rate - at 9.75 per cent its emergency funding rate for the financial system. The danger is that either move could squeeze money rates higher and possibly necessitate a hike in the Lombard rate anyway. Overnight money was already trading uncomfortably close to the Lombard rate last week. Against this background, German bonds prices were virtually static. The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond closed on Friday on a yield of 7.96 per cent, unchanged on the week. Moreover, nervousness did not prevent the Bundesbank from selling DM8bn in new bonds. This underlines that higher German interest rates could have a more serious impact outside the Federal Republic. For example, the strength of the D-Mark on the foreign exchange markets last week pushed sterling outside its notional narrow band limit against the German currency. Strains within the ERM have already kindled talk of a sterling devaluation, possibly disguised by moving to a narrow band at a central rate below the current DM2.95. It is unlikely the gilts market will prosper under these conditions.</p>

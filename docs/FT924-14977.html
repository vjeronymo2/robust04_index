			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: RVI chief gloomy on bus and truck sales THE MARKET for trucks and buses continues to deteriorate and an improvement later this year is out of the question, Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, chairman of Renault Vehicules Industriels (RVI), said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We can expect a result for 1992 that is below the extrapolations that we were able to make based on the first half,' Mr Capron said. RVI, 55 per cent owned by French state-owned vehicle maker Renault and 45 per cent by Volvo of Sweden, reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of FFr437m (Dollars 91.42m) for the first six months. In the first six months of 1991, RVI lost FFr128m. Last month, Mr Marc Randon, RVI's secretary-general, said the company would probably make a loss for the whole year after reporting a net profit of FFr23m in 1991. Volvo Personvagnar AB, the passenger vehicle producer in the Swedish AB Volvo group, said sales of new cars in the US market fell 15 per cent in September to 2,903 units, from 3,429 units in the same month a year earlier. Volvo noted the contraction in the US car market had been 4 per cent in the month. Mr Klas Magnusson, Volvo spokesman, said better sales could be expected in October. In the first nine months of the year, Volvo's US sales have declined 5.24 per cent, to 51,567 units.</p>

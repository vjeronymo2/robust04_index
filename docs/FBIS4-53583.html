			<p>BFN     [Text] Freed communist leader Wilma Tiamzon vowed  yesterday to continue supporting the underground movement.  Tiamzon was speaking during a news conference at the Philippine  Heart Center where she is confined. Tiamzon was released to  Bishop Alberto Ramento who represented the joint peace committee  of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines and the  National Council of Churches in the Philippines. Ramento said  Tiamzon could go anywhere in the country and do whatever she  wants to do. Ramento said that the custodianship is not  physical but legal, adding that he could not ensure Tiamzon's  security under his custody. He explained that it would not be  his responsibility if Tiamzon decided to go underground again.  At the news conference at the Philippine Heart Center, Tiamzon  did not say if she would continue running the Communist Party of  the Philippines.</p>

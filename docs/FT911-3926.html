			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (13): Consortia add to confusion - Standards, users wait in vain for common technologies THE COMPUTER industry is driven by fashion, and industry standards is the current craze. At one time, indeed, it seemed as if a genuine enthusiasm for common standards might result in lower costs and greater simplicity of operations for customers, a notion much promoted by the manufacturers themselves. The belief was that if manufacturers were prepared to agree common technologies for operating computers, connecting them together and running software, users would be saved the cost and complexity of connecting dissimilar hardware. At the same time, software suppliers would be able to write programs capable of being run on any machine, cutting the cost of the multiple versions they have to produce at present. That, however, has proved a vain hope. For most computer users, the standards issue has become hopelessly confused. The suppliers have done little to help matters, taking part in seemingly endless series of industry consortia to promote one standard or another. There are compelling financial reasons for this apparent waywardness - backing the wrong standards horse can be an expensive mistake. But somewhere along the line, the idea of common standards to which everybody in the industry adheres for the benefit of the customer has been lost. Common standards are crucial to the idea of open systems, which most observers believe will play an increasingly important part in data processing over the next decade. What is an open system? According a new handbook*, they are defined as: 'those that conform to internationally agreed standards defining computing environments that allow users to develop, run and interconnect applications and the hardware they run on, from whatever source, without significant conversion cost'. The author goes on to point out that the key factors for users are that no single supplier actually 'owns' (that is, has control of) the environments involved and that the mixing and matching of applications and hardware can be achieved without significant cost. The reality is that every supplier of any size is scrabbling to own, or at least share ownership, of any hardware or software element which looks as if it stands a fair chance of becoming a standard. The result has been a series of pitched battles which show no real signs of abating. Even the oldest standards war, the fight over how best to connect computers together in telecommunications networks, has yet to be resolved after more than 15 years. On the one hand, standards setting bodies are trying to establish a set of rules called Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) which they have now almost completely defined. On the other hand, International Business Machines (IBM) is insisting that its SNA rules will remain the way for its own machines to be connected together, while many customers are content with rules called TCP/IP devised by the US Defense Department. Or consider, for example, the latest industry initiative, a consortium of 20 leading suppliers including the US companies Compaq, the leading supplier of high performance personal computers, Control Data, the mainframe supplier and Digital Equipment, the world's principal minicomputer maker. It also includes the Japanese suppliers NEC, Nippon Kokan KK and Sony. The consortium has established what it calls an Advanced Computing Environment (Ace) whose elements include support for software operating environments from Microsoft (OS/2 version 3.0) and the Santa Cruz Operation (Open Desktop, a version of the Unix operating systems) and microprocessor chips from Intel (80/386, 80/486 and so on) and MIPS Computer Systems' (advanced reduced instruction set computing, or Risc) chips. The aim of the group is to 'unify' the industry by establishing standards combining software and hardware technologies from personal computers, computer workstations and multi-processor computers. The group does not include, however, IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, which frequently seems to behave as if it feels it has an inalienable right to decide which standards the industry will adopt. It is a leading light behind the Open Software Foundation, which has been developing its own Unix-like operating systems, OSF1. Some observers see the formation of the Ace consortium as a challenge to IBM; others as an attempt to displace Sun Microsystems from its dominant position in the Unix workstation market place. Sun, an ambitious, fast-growing company, has about two-thirds of the market for Unix workstations based on its proprietary Risc design called 'sparc'. It has been licensing this design widely in an aggressive attempt to establish it as the industry Risc standard. One of the first licensees was Solbourne, a workstation manufacturer. Mr Barrie Murray-Upton, its vice-president of European operations, said after the announcement of Ace: 'Why would 20 of the world's leading computer manufacturers band together to form a consortium unless they were seriously worried about the continuing success of sparc technology?' The Ace group's attempt to appear cohesive was not helped, either, by the emergence of a splinter group among the 20 declaring its support for yet another version of Unix. The upshot of all this wrangling is that customers' need for genuinely open systems has been hijacked and treated with contempt by rival industry gangs. Groups of users have attempted to establish their own ginger groups, but with only limited success - General Motors' attempt to set a manufacturing automation protocol (MAP) is one example. Earlier this year, in initiative sponsored by the user arm of X/Open, one of the earliest standards pressure groups,representing hundreds of users met in Dallas, Texas, to formulate plans to encourage manufacturers to speed up the introduction of open systems. They deliberated and drew up lists of their requirements. The resolutions, however, fell far short of an ultimatum to the manufacturers. Computer users, to some extent, have only themselves to blame for the way manufacturers treat them. *Practical Open Systems by Ian Hugo, NCC Blackwell, 108 Cowley Road, Oxford, OX4 1JF.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Zhaocheng (1728 0340 2052): "Inner </F> Mongolia Holds Meeting of Cadres of Regional-Level Organs at or  Above Department and Bureau Levels"]    [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 1 April, the region held a  meeting of cadres of regional-level organs at or above the  department and bureau levels to relay the guidelines of the "two  national sessions," the central rural work conference, and the  national family planning work forum; and also set forth,  according to the region's realities, specific opinions on  implementing the guidelines.    Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, chaired  and addressed the meeting. Wu Liji, chairman of the regional  government, made a report on relaying these guidelines. Present  at the meeting were Wang Zhan, Wuyunqimuge, leaders of several  regional-level leading bodies, and the veteran comrades who have  been working in the region for a long period of time.    Comrade Wang Qun pointed out in his speech: Comrade Wu  Liji's report on relaying the guidelines of the "two national  sessions," the central rural work conference, and the national  family planning work forum, as well as his opinions on the  next-step work made according to the region's realities, are of  extreme importance, are major issues relating to the overall  situation, and are related to not only the current situation  characterized by stability and unity, but also the region's  long-term development; and embody the central 20-character  policy of "grasping favorable opportunities, deepening reform,  expanding the scale of opening up, promoting development, and  maintaining stability."    Comrade Wang Qun said: The state has paid full attention to  Inner Mongolia's development. We have reported to the central  authorities on the economic development strategies of Inner  Mongolia and our region's plan and projects. The state  completely agreed to it. This embodies the central authorities'  concern over and assistance to Inner Mongolia and the border  areas inhabited by minority nationalities in northwest China.  We may see that the state has shifted the focus of the economic  development strategy on the western areas. Inner Mongolia has  very good prospects for development. The reserve strength for  our development is heartening.    Comrade Wang Qun emphatically pointed out after analyzing  and  introducing the current international situation: The central  policy on reform, development, and stability stands for the  strong aspirations and basic interests of the people of various  nationalities. All of our work should be submitted to and serve  this policy. We should unswervingly achieve the work in various  aspects but never do things that are not conducive to the  overall situation. Our region has this tradition and this kind  of foundation and conditions. The current situation is very  good. However, there are still many problems. The main factors  affecting unity and stability are problems concerning prices of  goods; wages; small, poor, and money-losing enterprises;  enterprises whose production is completely or partially  suspended; corruption; and social order. These are the problems  that the broad masses of the cadres and the masses are concerned  with. The party committees, governments, and leading cadres at  various levels should pay high attention to and conscientiously  solve these problems so as to make the people satisfied. We  must understand that the problems we come across are ones  cropping up in the course of advancement and development. For  instance, we should try every possible means to solve the  problems concerning wages. However, we should clearly  understand the problems relating to our understanding. Some  localities are unable to issue, according to schedule,  sufficient amounts of wages. This is not caused by our economic  situation but by various factors such as excessively increasing  expenses and providing for a excessively large number of people.  These problems are ones essentially cropping up in the course  of reform and development. Through collective study, the  regional party committee maintained that the wages can be issued  if efforts are made to carry out the wage reform. We are  confident of this. We are also going to extensively solicit  opinions on this issue. I hope that all of you, including  veteran comrades and democratic party comrades, will make  opinions. By so doing will we be able to seek unity of thinking  and work with one heart and soul to make development. In his  speech, Comrade Wang Qun set forth his new ideas, methods, and  specific opinions on enterprises' deficits, goods prices,  opposition to corruption, and overall improvement of social  order. He stressed that we should use new ideas and methods to  solve the problems cropping up in the course of development and  use the methods of expanding the dynamics of reform and opening  up to solve these problems instead of adopting a wait-and-see  attitude or blaming everyone and everything but ourselves.    He finally stressed the necessity to strengthen the  leadership of the party, to seek unity of thinking, to be  inspired with enthusiasm, to work with one heart and soul, to  overcome difficulties, to ensure the smooth fulfillment of all  tasks, and to ensure to make new achievements in reform,  development, and stability. [passage omitted]    Present at the meeting were principal responsible comrades  of  all departments and units directly under the regional-level  organs; the principal leading cadres of leagues, cities,  departments, and bureaus who were participating in the  theoretical study and discussion classes at the regional party  school; and the students participating in the classes for the  advanced studies of the cadres at league, city, department, and  bureau levels.</p>

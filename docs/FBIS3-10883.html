Concerning  the important issue of recruiting, we interviewed Colonel Jorge  Romero Alonso, chief of the Minfar [Ministry of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces] directorate:    [Begin Romero Alonso recording] The most significant aspect  concerning recruitment is that, in comparison with 1992 and  despite the situation in our country, we have achieved some  progress. For example, recruitment this year was 1-percent  higher and of better quality. We have had a better approach to  problems affecting personnel, giving better treatment to the men.    This means that, notwithstanding the tense situation, people  have increased their contribution of that which we already have:  the love of work, the dedication, and the care that have  characterized our workers.    This year we have had to make a tremendous effort concerning  recruitment. We had to create a division here in Havana to work  44 percent of the province's arable land. Today we have almost  6,000 men. This was not included in any plan; it was done  because of the emergency situation in the country.    This will help increase citrus production on the Isle of  Youth, under the Giron victory plan, and tobacco production in  Pinar del Rio. Thus, the growth of the EJT [Youth Labor Army]  has been considerable in helping meet all transportation needs  without causing any problems whatsoever for the personnel. [end  recording]</p>

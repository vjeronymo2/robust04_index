			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the </F> Salvadoran Legislative Assembly in San Salvador--live]    [Text] Legislative Assembly President Jose Roberto Angulo;  Mr. Vice President of the Republic, Messrs. Vice Presidents and  board secretaries; honorable deputies; Madame Foreign Minister  of Colombia; members of the government cabinet; members of the  diplomatic corps; Salvadoran friends:    It is a source of great satisfaction for me to stand here  today before the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly, the forum par  excellence of Salvadoran democracy. I have spent a major part  of my public life within the rooms of the Colombian Congress.  Many of the ideas and plans that have inspired my  administration were conceived during fruitful debates, harsh  controversies, nights and days of full devotion to the noble  task of legislating. I have also suffered defeats; who hasn't?  Defeat in the legislature, hammer pounding an anvil, does not  leave wounds, however, but forges and strengthens democratic  convictions.    In these times, when it has become so common to say that  legislatures are inefficient, archaic, and even unnecessary,  when authoritarian forces frequently blame deputies and  congressmen for all the ills that governments have been unable  to resolve, I must reiterate my faith in the validity of  Congress as an irreplaceable expression of popular will. I want  you to know that here, among you, I somehow feel that I am among  colleagues.    Last night, during a dinner in my honor hosted by President  Cristiani, I had the opportunity to praise the Salvadoran peace  process. There is no question that the end of the Cold War has  made peace possible in many places, because the people who  encouraged war and who with their hatred fed rivalries among  brothers were suddenly left without a purpose. Justifications  for arming insurgents, supporting tyrants, denying freedom, and  preventing coexistence ended, and an era of hope thus began for  our America.    Peace in El Salvador would not have been possible without  the  iron will of the conflicting sides, who were able to look beyond  themselves to discover what the future held for the good,  hardworking people of this country, the peace of mind and  prosperity they deserved for a thousand reasons and which for  such a long time had been denied them. The peace all of you  fought so hard to achieve is an example that shows the world  that reconciliation is possible if men undertake to achieve it  without revanchist designs. This is perhaps the most visible  success we have witnessed in the area of peace during these  post-Cold War times.    Undoubtedly, our region is undergoing a crucial period, and  in the days that lie ahead we will have to make important  decisions that will test our character and vision of the future.    I will not punish you today with an endless speech. I would  like instead to share with you some of my thoughts concerning  those issues which, in my opinion, will be among the major  issues on the hemisphere's political agenda over the next few  years. Among these are free trade, reformation and  modernization of the state, and the defense, strengthening, and  consolidation of democracy.    A few weeks ago our countries experienced considerable  uncertainty, because, on one hand, the fate of the North  American Free Trade Agreement was unclear, and on the other hand  the final result of the GATT Uruguay Round was still a mystery.    Today, fortunately, the panorama is much clearer; NAFTA's  approval has renewed our hopes for the creation sooner or later  of a hemispheric free trade zone, while the culmination of the  Uruguay Round not only guarantees the existence of the  multilateral trade system but provides the necessary confidence  and stability for the world economy to advance toward its  definitive recovery.    For our countries, which have believed in the goodness of  free trade and have thus struggled so much for its enforcement,  NAFTA is the best proof that we are capable of reading the  future and that we have managed to figure out the true signs of  the times from our history books. Free trade is the best way to  achieve economic growth and greater well-being for our people.    I have personally studied all the integration processes  under way on this continent: NAFTA, the Group of Three, the  Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Common Market, the  Andean Pact, the South American Common Market, and bilateral  processes. These are efforts that truly lead to the common  objective of building a great hemispheric free trade zone.    All of us have noted how Latin America has been for several  years involved in aggressive policies for the opening,  modernization, and internationalization of their economies,  increasingly betting on the benefits that the promotion of the  private sector, free trade, competition, productivity, and  efficiency offer.    In this regard, to mention the Colombian case, in only three  years we have made significant progress on many fronts. The  opening of our economy, by changing our former closed economic  model to one open to the world, was a result of the decline of  the model that called for the substitution of imports. This  opening took place in a context different from that of our  neighbors.    Our decisions were not the result of a crisis or of an  imposition. Our economy is the one that grew the most from 1980  to 1990. We knew, however, that to grow more rapidly and to  eliminate poverty in Colombia in a few years, it was necessary  to integrate our economy to the global economy, to open markets  for our export products, to compete, to open up to foreign  investments, and to create conditions to encourage private local  investments.    We reduced our customs and we adopted competitive labor laws  and foreign investment programs. The results have been  satisfactory. We have diversified and expanded our exports,  diminished inflation, reduced unemployment by 15 percent in the  past four months, and increased our economic growth to levels  above the 5 percent level.    We have adopted an aggressive commercial policy that has  yielded integration with Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia in the  framework of the revitalization of the Andean Pact; we signed a  trade agreement with Chile; concluded the Group of Three  negotiations; and have made much progress in the negotiations  for trade agreements with Caricom and the Central American  Common Market.    I have said that we are prepared to reach with these two  markets a two-way trade agreement that should mirror the various  economic development levels. This is usually called  asymmetrical relations.    There is no better opportunity than this one, here, in El  Salvador, to reiterate our political will and to ask the Central  American authorities to do so too in order to work jointly to  turn dreams of a great trade treaty between Colombia, Venezuela,  and the Central American common market into a reality to  encourage a new flux of trade and productive investments for the  benefit of our nations.    Much political will and a true commitment by all the  countries of this hemisphere will be necessary to give form to  the puzzle of a single market from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.    This is why I believe that in the next few months, the  continent must work to secure and recreate the integration  processes for the purpose, as I have said, bringing about a  grand hemispheric free trade zone.    This requires that our governments and the international  organizations to which we belong act vigorously and decisively  to turn what now appears an option we cannot ignore into a  tangible reality.    Preliminary studies indicate that with the culmination of  the  GATT Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organization round,  global trade will increase rapidly at an annual rate of 6  percent, approximately $200 billion annually.    Our challenge is to take advantage, as much as possible, of  this increase so that our countries, which belong to what is  nowadays viewed as the world's second most dynamic region in the  field of economic development -- second only to Asian South  Pacific -- may secure greater participation in world trade.    I am sure that we can attain higher achievements unitedly  rather than separately and that any increase in participation in  global trade will bring social and economic benefits to our  people in the form of jobs and new investment opportunities.    However, the truth is that this is only one of the basic  aspects our continent will have to face in the coming days and  months now that virtually all countries in the area have agreed  on an economic liberalization, which guarantees greater growth;  winds of commercial opening blowing from north to south; and  there is a relative consensus regarding the role the private  sectors of our countries will play in the struggle for  development and so on. Now that there is striking clarity on  the benefits of the market, Latin American politicians cannot  continue forever to discuss topics of which we are already aware.    When I refer to the pivotal role of the market, I want to  clarify that it is not that I am downgrading the central role of  the state. On the contrary, I want to emphasize that as it  happens in a game of cards, once the moment of shuffling and  dealing comes along, some cards will go to the market and others  to the state. In our countries, we should make sure that these  cards are divided fairly because a state without a market  generates inefficiencies while a market without a state results  in inequality.    We know that market laws are unable to solve the many  problems that still affect our society such as extreme poverty,  class divisions, and lack of opportunities. Consequently, we  need a strong state, that will not only control, on behalf of  the public interest, what takes place in the market, but that  will also lead a strong investment initiative to generate human  resources, that is, to invest in our people.    It is fair to recognize that our states still need to become  more efficient and competitive so as to strengthen the  democracies of the area. To enable our democracies to face  successfully the challenge of promoting an egalitarian social  development, it is necessary for states to modernize and for the  way politics is conducted to be changed.</p>

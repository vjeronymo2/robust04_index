			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] The National Council on Belize, which will be in  charge of conducting a general and thorough evaluation of the  dispute over that territory, was officially installed today.    An agreement to update and reorganize the National Council  on  Belize specifies that the entity will do studies and planning  and will advise the Foreign Ministry on all matters related to  the territorial dispute with Belize.    The Council will be headed by Foreign Minister Gladys  Maritza  Ruiz de Vielman and will be made up of the following persons,  who will work without compensation: Fernando Andrade Diaz  Duran, Roberto Bermejo Gonzalez, Eduardo Castillo Arriola, Erwin  Fernando Guzman Ovalle, (Alberto Errarte Gonzalez), Roberto  Herrera Ibarguen, Carlos Larios Ochaita, Jorge Lujan Munoz,  Oscar Clemente Marroquin Godoy, Gabriel Orellana Rojas, Mario  Quinonez Amezquita, Jorge Skinner Klee, and Francisco Villagran  Kramer.    The 8 June agreement states that the territorial dispute  with  Belize and the search for a solution within the framework of the  Constitution and the principles of international law are matters  of national interest. The document recognizes the  appropriateness of the Foreign Ministry receiving the advice of  qualified citizens who, based on their knowledge and  capabilities, can help formulate an adequate policy to resolve  the territorial dispute with Belize.</p>

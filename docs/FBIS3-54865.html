			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Shkhovchek: "Hopes for Cooperation </F> Will Die Last"]    [Text] The time when national democrats will unite their  efforts in the parliamentary or presidential election campaigns  will be an event comparable in significance to the first manned  space flight. Despite the fact that statements about the  "permanent cooperation of democratic forces in the face of a  communist threat" are predominant in the majority of national  democrats' speeches, optimistic voices are increasingly fading.  All the democrats declare their commitment to the idea of a  single bloc, yet every one of them acknowledges that such a bloc  is far from likely.    "The issue of forming blocs," says Ukrainian Republican  Party  Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, "is a very subtle one. Talks on it are  in progress. I guess that there will be several meetings, at  which we will try to come together. The main reservations with  regard to the formation of such a bloc are from the  left-centrist forces: the Labor Congress and the Party of  Democratic Revival of Ukraine [PDRU]. However, I think that the  last word has not been said, and we are still hoping to achieve  some type of accord. Especially as PDRU leaders are continuing  their consultations with us; I hope we will reach an agreement.  If this, to our regret, does not happen, then we will have  several blocs: left-centrist, right-centrist, centrist, and, as  usual, a socialist and communist bloc. If the extreme rightists  will form a bloc, I cannot say, but they are also preparing for  the elections."    The behavior of democratic forces during the parliamentary  elections is a point of great importance, because the electoral  campaign will reveal the actual state of matters in the camp of  Ukrainian democrats and become a "dress rehearsal" of the fight  for the highest state post.    Several months ago it seemed that an accord, at least among  certain national and democratic groupings, would be achieved.  Testifying to this belief was the joint declaration of 18  political parties and trade unions to create an electoral bloc.  However, several weeks passed, and some centrifugal trends have  become evident within the newly created democratic coalition.    At first, the leaders of free trade unions stated that their  representatives had not participated in the conference and,  therefore, they are not obliged to fulfill the conference's  resolutions. Soon afterward, democratic trade unions created a  new organization -- the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine -- which  is going to participate in the elections on an independent  basis. "I can say," says Serhiy Klimov, deputy head of the  Independent Trade Union of Miners of Ukraine and head of the  trade union at the production amalgamation Donetskivuhilla, who  can influence the distribution of 30 deputy seats, "that our  trade union, according to the resolution of member  organizations, will directly participate in elections. It has  been resolved, for the time being, to not attach ourselves to  some bloc or political party. We will support independent  candidates or put forth our own representatives. I am convinced  that 90 percent of those supported by us will win deputy seats.  In the future parliament, our lobby will influence the course  of legislative change in a direction more preferable to trade  unions."    This separate position astonished leaders of those  organizations which formerly tried to cooperate with trade  unions. The creation of the temporary Rukh and trade unions  staff on the eve of the adoption of a new electoral law boded  well for the permanence of such cooperation. "I do not  understand why trade union leaders have not decided to form a  single coalition bloc with us," says deputy head of Rukh  Oleksandr Lavrynovich. "Everywhere in the world, politics is  handled by parties, while trade unions are concerned with the  social protection of their members." It is no secret that Rukh  leaders cherished great hopes for the bloc with trade unions;  they expected to drive with trade unions some portion of the  Rukh candidates in eastern and central regions. However, the  Supreme Council has adopted a majority-type electoral law  entitling trade unions to field their own candidates on a par  with parties. It is clear that this circumstance has turned  them off from further cooperation with Rukh.    Still it seems that Rukh has not lost hope for an agreement  with trade unions. The draft electoral program, which was  submitted for approval by the Rukh Congress on 10-12 December,  devoted an entire chapter to trade union issues. "Trade  unions," reads the text, which was clearly intended to catch the  fancy of trade unionists, "should become the main guarantors of  obeying the law on hired labor, independently of the branch of  production or form of property."    Thus, while analyzing the formation of preelection blocs,  one  discerns without difficulty the lack of unity among the  democratic parties. At the same time, their political opponents  prefer more practical actions. The symptoms of that can be  traced in the selection of central and district electoral  commission members, as well as in the distribution of electoral  districts between the members of the Kravchuk-Plyushch team,  which is intended to remove unnatural competition between  representatives of this team. For instance, with the exception  of Ivan Plyushch, no one from the nomenklatura, which is  generally pacified both by its nonparty alignment and "scuffles"  between democrats and communists, is going to run in the  elections in Barishevski rayon of Kiev Oblast.</p>

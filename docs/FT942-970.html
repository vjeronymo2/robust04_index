			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Management: Sir John Egan - Desert Island Manager Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the airport operator, would like a theatrical accompaniment to life on a desert island. What would you need for your business ? 'I am not big on high-tech business aids. My desk doesn't have a single electronic device on it. I am not great on the telephone even. I like to talk to people face to face, to see the whites of their eyes. People are the essence of my job. I am good at getting plans into place and then getting the right people to implement them.' How would you keep your sanity ? 'By playing a church organ. My grandfather was the organist at our local parish church. He taught me to play the piano. I used to go into the organ loft to watch him play and since then I have promised myself I would learn. If I couldn't have an organ it would be a squash court.' Who would accompany you ? 'I would have to have the family; I couldn't imagine life without them. Then we would like to have Will Shakespeare but not to entertain us. I would like to find out if he really understood all the psychology behind those words. He shaped the agenda for our language for centuries and it would be fascinating to delve into his genius.' Would you turn into a beach bum ? 'No, I would have to stay out of the sun.' What about a book ? 'Stephen Hawkins' A Brief History of Time. I would like some brain work. I read his book a couple of years ago and I would like to fathom it out, so I would need some books on similar themes to cross reference it against. I read a lot, 20 minutes when I get up in the morning and before going to bed. I always have a novel on the go.' Would you cope being on your own ? 'I would not be good at being on my own, I think. But I would not become introspective or worry about myself. People start to worry about themselves only in relation to other people. If there are no other people to worry about, you will not worry about yourself either. So it would be quite calming. The least rewarding part of the day is when you think about yourself, how you look, your performance and your ability. It is much better to be off doing things.' What about food and drink? 'It would have to be Italian for both. I lived for a while in Italy. My favourite meal is pasta alla vongole in a restaurant in Rome and I would have to have lots of veal.' Any frustrations ? 'Yes we have a holiday every three months, just a week or a few days here or there. We would have to have the occasional holiday.'</p>

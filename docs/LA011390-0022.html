			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DECLINE OF DAN RATHER'S RATINGS AFTER THE BUSH INCIDENT  </P> <P> Bush's 1988 attack on Rather was in the same execrable taste as his  presidential campaign. Rather, after all, was not running for office, and his  walking off a TV broadcast set (an act pointed out by Bush) is not comparable  to lying or backing illegal and immoral activities.  </P> <P> Rather is not a news announcer -- he is a reporter, and a reporter's job is to  get to the truth. Unfortunately, many people can't stand truth when it hammers  on their petrified beliefs.  </P> <P> Some viewers may be alienated by Rather's deadpan (yet dramatic) style that  calls attention to program content, not to himself. This is in the best  tradition of TV journalism reverberating from Edward R. Murrow.  </P> <P> Viewers who abandoned Rather because he "abused" Bush forget that the role of  the press in a free society is to probe events, even when it embarrasses  government officials, and in so doing serve as the watchdog of democracy and  the conscience of government.  </P> <P> BARBARA K. SNADER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

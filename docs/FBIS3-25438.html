			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cape Town Feb 17 SAPA -- An international agreement  to transfer the South African military base and Rooikop airport  at Walvis Bay to the Namibian Government at the end of February  was signed at the Castle in Cape Town on Thursday. In the  process, equipment valued at R[rand]6.5 million will be donated  and transferred.    The agreement, signed by the defence ministers of South  Africa and Namibia, Kobie Coetsee and Peter Mweshihange, was  described by Mr Coetsee as signalling the end and beginning of  an era. "The new era represents the spirit of mutual  understanding that exists on defence matters between the two  governments. It also signifies the beginning of an era in which  southern Africa could proceed with security co-operation on a  country-to-country and on a multilateral basis. The time has  come for the countries of the region to work in earnest to  improve the quality of life of all our people, and for that  purpose mutual schemes and projects could be explored."    Mr Coetsee said he believed it would also enable Namibia to  have "a more appropriate window to the outside world" and add to  the completion of the country's international status.    Mr Mweshihange said the signing was a vindication that  peacefultco-existence could work where those involved were  committed. "What we have witnessed is a complete new chapter in  the relationship between our two countries and defence forces.  It is a chapter characterised by peace and mutual  understanding."    He said the fact that the two countries had had a  confrontational past had not overwhelmed their desire for good  neighbourliness and co-operation. The agreement was a key to  more co-operation agreements.    Both ministers said a formal non-aggression pact had not  been  signed because it was unnecessary.    According to the agreement, all functions and duties at the  military base and Rooikop airport will be handed over by the  South African Defence Force [SADF] to the Namibian Defence Force  [NDF] and to the Directorate of Civil Aviation on February 28.    It was specifically agreed that the SADF would:     -  leave shooting range boundaries and markers intact;    -  brief and train appointed members of the NDF in the  protection,  use and application of the shooting range;    -  hand over safety templates to the NDF;    -  donate and transfer to the NDF all furniture, kitchen  equipment, garden tools, camping equipment, linen and  labour-saving utensils in present use at the base and valued at  about R440,000;    -  transfer telecommunication equipment at the command and  control  centre at the base, valued at about R510,000;    -  transfer all flying-related equipment and existing aids  rendering the airport international and valued at R5.5 million.       Namibia has granted overflight and landing rights at Rooikop  airport to enable South African military aircraft to undertake  humanitarian missions.    South Africa will assist with search and rescue services  until Namibia can take over these responsibilities.</p>

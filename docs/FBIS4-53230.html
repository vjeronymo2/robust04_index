			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic  Party (DP) has decided to exclude former and incumbent  presidents as well as incumbent lawmakers and senior officials  from the former No Tae-u government in selecting witnesses for  the first stage of parliament's investigation into the Sangmudae  scandal.    Members of the Party's Supreme Committee met Monday morning  and agreed to make the compromise in an effort to get the  investigation started as soon as possible.    The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the DP have  held a series of consultations but failed to reach a compromise  on who should testify in the parliamentary probe.    Chongwoo Construction Co. allegedly set up a slush fund  while  carrying out an Army project to relocate training facilities in  Sangmudae, Kwangju.    The DP alleges that the fund was established to supply  bribes  to ranking officials of the previous administration and for  political contributions to Kim Yong-sam during the 1992  presidential election.    The opposition party plans to begin the parliamentary probe  first by questioning 30 witnesses that it agreed with the DLP to  question: It will demand that more people testify if it is  disclosed that those who were excluded from selection were  involved in the scandal.    Furthermore, the DP has decided to demand 20 more days for  the probe, in addition to the 20 days already agreed with the  DLP, considering that the period is too short for parliament to  conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

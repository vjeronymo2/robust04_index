			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO  </P> <P> A 22-year-old Escondido man has been found guilty of assault with a deadly  weapon in a drive-by shooting and in the attempted shooting of an Escondido  city councilman who pursued him.  </P> <P> Councilman Kris Murphy testified in San Diego Superior Court that he followed  the gunman after seeing the Nov. 25, 1989, drive-by shooting, which was  believed to be gang-related.  </P> <P> Martin Ramiro Ochoa was convicted of wounding 17-year-old Salvador Santoyo, who  also testified in the trial that began several weeks ago.  </P> <P> The jury also found Ochoa guilty of conspiring to commit an assault with a  firearm.  </P> <P> Judge Laura Hammes set sentencing for June 15.  </P> <P> Ochoa has been in County Jail since his arrest in lieu of $250,000 bail, but  Hammes ordered him held without bail.  </P> <P> Santoyo, who was shot in the back and in his leg, had been talking with his  brother while leaning against a car fender. He never saw his assailant.  </P> <P> "The victims were at the wrong place at the wrong time," Deputy Dist. Atty.  James Fitzpatrick said.  </P> <P> Santoyo is not a gang member, but apparently rival gang members were nearby  when the shooting erupted.  </P></p>

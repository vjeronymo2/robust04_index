			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (18): A Whirlpool romance - Corporate strategy, why a US appliance giant sided with Philips WHIRLPOOL is the largest large domestic appliance manufacturer in the world. Yet, by the late 1980s, the Michigan-based company had virtually no presence in Europe. This was an omission widely acknowledged at the manufacturer's top ranks. David Whitman, the company's chairman, has said that his company mapped out a long-term strategy in the mid-1980s which recognised that there was little growth to be had in the US appliance market, that there was more likely to be solid demand and future growth overseas, and that there would be substantial lowering, or removal of trade barriers in Europe by 1992. In fact, the company's internal estimates suggested that by 1993, western Europe would account for a larger proportion of global appliance demand than the US. By 1987, Whirlpool was talking to Philips, the Dutch electronics group and Europe's number one appliance manufacturer. Those discussions were interrupted by the crash in the world stockmarkets, but by August of the following year, the two companies had struck a deal. Whirlpool paid Philips around Dollars 500m for a 53 per cent stake in a new joint venture company, which - to all intents and purposes - took over Philips' large domestic appliance division. At the time, both companies envisaged that Whirlpool might become the sole owner of the European business - Philips with the right to sell its minority stake to the US company and the US company with the right to ask the Dutch to sell. Three years later everything went to plan; Whirlpool duly bought out the remaining 47 per cent of the equity for about Dollars 610m. The relatively slow handover of the Philips business was mirrored at the operational level. Whirlpool recognised at the outset that its own name - although extremely familiar to the average shopper in the US - would carry little weight in Europe, compared with the old-established Philips brand. With this in mind, Whirlpool was given the right to use the Philips name on appliances in Europe until 1998 - long after the potential buy-out of the remaining minority stake, and the date set for European harmonisation. Accordingly, the company decided, in early 1990, to adopt a 'dual-branding' approach to products marketed in Europe. It placed both companies' names on products it was selling in the European market, with a view to phasing out the Philips tag once its own name gained recognition. Alongside the middle-range Philips/Whirlpool brand, it continued to develop the 'Bauknecht' name as a premium high-end brand and to use the 'Ignis' and 'Laden' names for 'value-conscious' consumers. Brand transfers have worked in the past - and Whirlpool says its programme is ahead of schedule. It is now advertising solely under its own name in four European markets, including the UK, although product packaging still carries dual-branding there. It plans to move to pure single-branding in a few selected markets next year. On the operational front, Whirlpool's approach has also changed over time. In 1991, it effectively created two business units - one to support the Bauknecht brand and one to market Philips/Whirlpool, Ignis and Laden products. Marketing and sales activities for the brands were to remain separate in each country, while after-sales services were consolidated into single offices in each market. Last autumn, the company announced that it was creating three distinct sales regions within the EC. The first encompasses Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark; the second embraces France, Spain, Portugal and Belgium; Norway, Ireland, Finland and the UK make up the third. In addition, Italy remains a separately-managed area, as are the interests in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Support services and sales resources will be shared within these regions, and a new central logistics department would aim to maximise distribution efficiency. The aim is to replace the previous, fragmented national warehouse network with regional distribution centres, as the trade barriers between countries come down and Europe's transportation industry is steadily deregulated. Finally, on the manufacturing front, there has been a general reorganisation around product groups - a process which has been proceeding for some time. Laundry and dishwasher development centres will be located in Germany and refrigeration and cooking product centres in Italy.</p>

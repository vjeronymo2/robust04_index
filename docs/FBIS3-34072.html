The shopkeepers and the people of Khayyam Avenue confronted  and fought with the anti-revolutionaries who broke windows, tore  Iranian flags and attacked shops and storefronts.    "Those who are hired by the foreigners are trying in vain to  create a scene to make the active presence of the people look  pale in the ten-day dawn festivities," said Pir Muhammad Abu  Bakr, who fought against the anti-revolutionaries.    Despite the nuisance, the people of Zahedan here today  attended a grand ceremony at the 17th of Shahrivar Stadium to  comemmorate the victory of the Islamic Revolution of 1979.</p>

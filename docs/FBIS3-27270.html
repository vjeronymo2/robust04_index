			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The mainland's Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Straits [ARATS] yesterday [18 February] sent a message to  the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] in which it expressed the  hope that private visits to the mainland by Taiwan officials can  be arranged through the cooperation of the two organizations.  This is the first time that ARATS has ever made such a request.  It also shows that the Chinese Communists' departments in charge  of work toward Taiwan is trying to use this as a tool for  further strengthening official contacts across the Straits.    As the Chinese Communists do not recognize our country as a  reciprocal political entity, it has been learned that they  welcome Taiwan's high-ranking officials to visit the mainland as  long as their visit is of a private nature. The Chinese  Communist authorities have even openly indicated they welcome  President Li Teng-hui to visit the mainland on a private trip.  Moreover, after President Li Teng-hui paid an unofficial visit  to the three Southeast Asian countries, the mainland side's  suggestion, made through the ARATS, that intermediate  organizations of the two sides make arrangements for officials  of our side to visit the mainland on a private trip, affords  much food for thought.    It has been learned that the message faxed by the ARATS  yesterday was in the form of the script of talks by a person in  charge of the ARATS. The SEF has noted that the ARATS'  intention is to place Taiwan's officials' visit to the mainland  under its overall management. Regarding out side's reply, the  SEF said it will replay to ARATS after consulting with the  Mainland Affairs Council.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar up sharply on yen THE DOLLAR appreciated sharply against the Japanese yen yesterday, amid increasing signs that the authorities in Tokyo were looking at ways to reduce their trade surplus with the US, writes James Blitz. In European trading, the dollar opened very strongly at around Y105.60 and pierced the Y106 level in early trade. It failed to break through the Y106.65 level, which is seen by many traders as a key chart point. It later closed at Y106.25. In recent weeks, there have been increasing signs that the Japanese authorities are seeking another substantial fiscal stimulus to their economy later this year, a move which would allay US pressure to push up the yen as a means of reducing the trade surplus. The Bank of Japan's tankan report also showed weakness in the domestic economy, reinforced expectations of such a fiscal boost. It also led to renewed speculation of another cut in Japan's official discount rate, which is currently at 2.5 per cent. Another factor pushing the dollar higher may have been reports that the Japanese foreign minister had said that Tokyo could set targets for the reduction of the trade surplus. This was seen as another example of how accommodating the Japanese are proving to be on the trade issue. 'There has never been any suggestion thus far from Japan about targets,' said Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase Manhattan bank in London. 'There could be a lot of pressure on the yen next week.' Against the D-Mark, the dollar continued to look weak, hindered by producer prices figures which showed a 0.6 percentage point fall in August, compared to forecasts of a 0.2 percentage point rise. The very low level of inflation has added to the view that there is little upward presure on US interest rates. The dollar was more or less unchanged at DM1.5980. In the European exchange rate mechanism, most currencies performed a little more strongly against the D-Mark. On Thursday, the French franc and Belgian franc had been unchanged after the Europe-wide cuts in interest rates. Yesterday, dealers appeared to be taking the view that the monetary easing had been rather more modest than anticipated, giving them a reason to buy the currencies. The French franc closed at FFr3.511 from FFr3.525 while the Belgian franc closed at BFr21.47 from BFr21.75. Sterling closed at DM2.4750 from a previous DM2.4775. This was in spite of trade figures which showed that, in the three months to June, the UK imported Pounds 3.3bn more than it exported, a slightly narrower deficit than in the previous quarter.</p>

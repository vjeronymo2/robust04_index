			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WRITERS PROTEST THREAT TO RUSHDIE  </P> <P> Hundreds of authors marched outside the Iranian Mission to the United Nations  in New York today, and some of America's top writers, vowing not to show fear  "in the face of intimidation," read excerpts from Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic  Verses."  </P> <P> The members of the National Writers Union, on the sidewalk across from the  mission, carried signs saying, "Free Speech Is Fundamental" and "Hands Off Our  Constitution."  </P> <P> "I write controversial books. What publisher is now going to take chances with  a controversial book?" asked activist Abbie Hoffman, one of about 300 writers  marching in a driving rainstorm outside the Iranian mission.  </P> <P> Rushdie has been targeted for assassination by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, who considered the novel an insult to Islam.  </P> <P> Union President Alec Dubro was rebuffed by security officers at the mission  when he attempted to deliver a letter there expressing outrage at the death  threats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'So Cowardly'  </P> <P> The writers then marched on two Fifth Avenue bookstores -- B. Dalton's and  Barnes &amp; Noble. Both stores are owned by B. Dalton, one of the chains that  has pulled the book from its shelves in several cities.  </P> <P> "To see book stores caving in like that to demagoguery is horrifying. These are  the largest book-sellers in the country," said author Laura Shapiro. "They  exist in honor of freedom of the press. For them to be so cowardly is  despicable."  </P> <P> Later today in New York, almost 1,000 people jammed the outside of the Columns  meeting hall, where only 500 could be admitted under tight security, as  prominent writers read excerpts from Rushdie's book.  </P> <P> About 50 anti-Rushdie demonstrators marched across the street waving placards  that read, "Down with Satanic Voices" and "Boycott Viking Penguin," Rushdie's  publisher.  </P> <P> The meeting of members of the 2,200-member writers' group PEN American Center  included Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer, E. L. Doctorow, Joan Didion, Gay Talese,  Robert Stone and Larry McMurtry.  </P> <P> Sontag, president of PEN American Center, said the organization had been  involved in the Rushdie controversy since India banned the book last October.  </P> <P> Since then, she said, "We all have learned how easy it is to be afraid."  </P> <P> "But if we show fear in the face of this intimidation, all of our institutions  that support a free, literate society are hijacked," she said.  </P> <P> Rushdie sent his greetings to the meeting in a message delivered through his  British publisher in which his American wife, poet Marianne Wiggins, told the  group that she and her husband are in hiding.  </P> <P> "We writers are a dangerous breed and always have been, and only fear can stop  a writer writing and a publisher from publishing his work," she said.  </P></p>

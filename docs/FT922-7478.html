			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Governorship flutters Place your bets, please, on the next Governor of the Bank of England. Ladbrokes has already opened a book on who will replace Robin Leigh-Pemberton who will step down a year or so from now. Alas it's hard to imagine a duller set of probables. So in the hope of making it a sporting contest, Observer suggests a wager on a few outsiders. One leading question is whether Premier Major will dare to break tradition. Hitherto, with one or two exceptions, the governor has been chosen from one of the City's patrician merchant banks. If the prime minister really is intent on shaking up Britain's class-ridden society, the governorship would make an ideal start. This time John Major could demonstrate that the City's old boy net is no longer the key to the succession. Why can't an academic, an industrialist, or a politician, for example, be thought up to husbanding the Old Lady? Admittedly, the current governor was a rather daring choice. Whereas Labour cabinets have played safe and often appointed career central bankers as governor, Margaret Thatcher's selection of Leigh-Pemberton was seen as an overtly political move. However, the choice was equally unusual in that it also broke the unwritten law that commercial bankers were not even made Bank of England directors, let alone the governor.</p>

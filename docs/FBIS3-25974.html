The two held cordial  and friendly talks.    The seven-member Henan provincial delegation headed by Li  Changchun will make an eight-day friendly observation tour in  Singapore at the invitation of Minister of Information and the  Arts Yeo Yong Boon. Nineteen economic and trade officials and  entrepreneurs from Henan Province have come with the delegation.    During their talks, Li Changchun briefed Lee Kuan Yew on  Henan's ancient culture and history, communications and  transportation facilities, tourism environment, mineral  resources, and the current economic foundation and development  plans of the province. He invited Lee Kuan Yew to visit Henan  and hoped people from industrial and business circles in  Singapore would invest in Henan.    Lee Kuan Yew happily accepted the invitation and said he  might visit Henan this autumn. Lee Kuan Yew suggested that to  develop the economy and strengthen contacts with the outside  world, Henan should first improve its railroad, highway and air  transporation, and communications facilities. After the  improvement of transporation and communications facilities,  Henan will be closer to the outside world. With more people  visiting Henan, the province will have more opportunities for  economic and trade cooperation.    During the visit, the Henan provincial delegation will also  call on other Singapore Government officials and visit  Singapore's Yulang Town Industrial Administration, Civil  Aviation Bureau, Trade and Development Bureau and other  organizations. Li Changchun will hold a lecture meeting on  "opportunities for investment in and trade with Henan."</p>

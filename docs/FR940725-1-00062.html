			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Present &sect;23.177(b) is deleted, as previously discussed, because it applies to two-control airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.201&blank;Wings Level Stall <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would delete both two-control airplanes and altitude loss requirements and would make clarifying changes in &sect;23.201. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to &sect;23.201(a) deletes the applicability reference for an airplane with independently controlled roll and directional controls. The last word, ``pitches'' is replaced by ``stalls'' since stalls may be defined by other than nose-down pitching.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present &sect;23.201(b) is deleted since it applies to two-control airplanes. (See proposed change for &sect;23.177 for discussion of two-control airplane requirements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current &sect;23.201(c) is divided into proposed &sect;23.201 (b) and (c). Proposed &sect;23.201(b) covers stall recognition and proposed &sect;23.201(c) addresses stall recovery. Proposed &sect;23.201(b) clarifies that the test should start from a speed at least 10 knots above the stall speed. Proposed &sect;23.201(b) has no change in requirements. Section 23.201(c) is changed to specify how long the control must be held against the stop. This change would ensure that the procedure for determining stall speed is the same procedure used to test stall characteristics. The last sentence of current paragraph (c) on the increase of power is deleted because it would only apply to altitude loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present &sect;23.201(d) would be deleted, as suggested by the JAA, since the determination of altitude loss, and its subsequent furnishing in the AFM, is not considered information useful to the pilot for safe operation of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.201(d) would be based on present &sect;23.210(e) and would be revised to clarify that the roll and yaw limits apply during both entry and recovery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.201(e) is present paragraph (f) with some revisions. During FAR/JAR harmonization meetings, the JAA pointed out to the FAA that in high power-to-weight ratio airplanes, extreme nose-up attitudes were the principal criteria for use of reduced power, not the presence of undesirable stall characteristics. The FAA concurs and proposes to delete the phrase concerning stall characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.203&blank;Turning Flight and Accelerated Turning Stalls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;23.203 would be revised by adding the word ``turning'' before ``stalls'' and after ``accelerated'' in the heading, the introductory text, and in proposed paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(5). This proposed change clarifies that accelerated stalls are performed in turning flight. Also, it clarifies the definition to show that accelerated stalls are not intended to be performed in straight flight. This clarification reflects current practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.203 (a) and (b) would reference the stall definition in &sect;23.201(b), which is more specific than the present general words ``when the stall has fully developed or the elevator has reached its stop.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For clarification, current paragraph (b)(4) would be separated into proposed paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) without substantive change, and current paragraph (b)(5) would be redesignated as paragraph (b)(6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.203(c)(1) would clarify the wing flap positions by changing ``each intermediate position'' to ``each intermediate normal operating position.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to &sect;23.203(c)(4) would clarify the use of reduced power. (See the proposed change to &sect;23.201(f).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new paragraph (c)(6) has been added to be consistent with new &sect;23.207(c)(6) configurations (Amendment No. 23&hyph;45).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.205&blank;Critical Engine-Inoperative Stalls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would delete &sect;23.205. The present requirement to demonstrate stalls with the critical engine inoperative is restricted to the enroute configuration and to a level of power asymmetry with which the airplane is controllable with wings level at the stalling speed. As a result, the power on the operating engines at the stall is normally fairly low, and neither the configuration nor the power setting represent the conditions most likely to accompany an inadvertent stall in service. Reduction of power of the operating engine(s) during the recovery is permitted, and it is questionable whether such action would be taken promptly in an inadvertent stall in service. Experience shows that stalls with significant power asymmetry can result in a spin, even on airplanes that are certificated to the present requirement. Apparently the requirement for demonstrating one-engine-inoperative stalls is not effective in ensuring that inadvertent stalls in service with one engine inoperative will have satisfactory characteristics and be recoverable. Sufficient protection against the hazard of stalling with one engine inoperative is provided by the one-engine-inoperative performance requirements and operating speed margins, coupled with the requirements for determination of V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the addition of a directional and lateral control test under &sect;23.147(b), and demonstration of stalling characteristics with symmetric power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

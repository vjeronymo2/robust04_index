			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hydro seeks approval for Troll oil development Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, announced yesterday that it was seeking government approval to develop a thin oil zone in the south-west part of the Troll West gas province in the Norwegian North Sea. It said the plan, which is in addition to the approved development of the NKr7.4bn (Pounds 670m) Troll West oil province, comprises a NKr1.4bn four-well subsea development scheme, which is to be tied back to the Troll B platform. The company aims to bring the 12-14m thick oil zone on stream in October 1996, nine months after start of production from Troll West. Hydro said that to accommodate the additional oil production from the gas province, export capacity on the Troll B platform would be increased to 30,000 standard cubic metres from 25,000. Recoverable reserves of the potential new development are estimated at 6.8m standard cu m of oil and 8.5bn cu m of gas.</p>

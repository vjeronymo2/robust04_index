			<p>BFN     [Text] This is a military news report.    The 1994 reserve generals' advisory council meeting was held  on 14 June at the War Buddies' Hall in the War Memorial, where  some 200 people participated, including Yi Yang-ho, chief of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff; high-ranking Armed Forces leaders; and  reserve generals of the Army, Navy, and the Air Force.    The meeting was held to discuss pending military issues  through explanations about the National Defense policy and the  latest North Korean military situation. Our Armed Forces'  military readiness posture related to North Korea's nuclear  issue and major national defense policies were discussed at the  meeting.    In a speech delivered prior to today's meeting, General Yi  said: Under the circumstances in which tension is mounting on  the Korean peninsula because of the latest North Korea's nuclear  issue, our Armed Forces are completely equipped with military  preparedness on the basis of the ROK-U.S. military relations.    General Yi continued to say: The issue of redeeming the  peacetime operational command right--on which an agreement was  reached between high-ranking military officials concerned of the  ROK and the United States last year--seems to be settled before  the end of this year. We are planning to develop the Armed  Forces through the promotion of military exchanges and  cooperation with neighboring nations.    (Cho Song-tae), chief of the Policy-making Office of the  Ministry of National Defense, said that our Armed Forces'  military preparedness related to North Korea's nuclear issue is  solid. He added that we are mapping out all military  countermeasures against an emergency on the basis of the  ROK-U.S. combined military capability.    Cho analyzed: North Korea is now suffering from triple  hardships--an unrest inside its own system, an economic crisis,  and an international isolation brought about by the nuclear  issue. To solve these problems, North Korea is capable of  launching an accidental provocation at any time. Our Armed  Forces are building up military preparedness to give immediate  punishment against this.    In today's meeting, the director of the Intelligence on  North  Korea Department and the director of the Strategic Planning  Department of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Headquarters gave  explanations about pending military tasks and also had in-depth  discussions with the participants.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> POINDEXTER PROSECUTION RESTS  </P> <P> Prosecutors rested their case against John M. Poindexter today, 12 days into  his Iran-Contra trial on charges of lying to Congress.  </P> <P> The government, represented by independent Iran-Contra prosecutors, called 10  witnesses against Poindexter before ending its presentation shortly after noon.  </P> <P> The prosecution's final two witnesses were an FBI agent, who earlier testified  about her interview with Poindexter after he resigned in November, 1986, and a  former aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee who met with Poindexter in  late November, 1986, as the Iran-Contra scandal was emerging in public view.  </P> <P> Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, said the first defense witness would be a  White House lawyer. Beckler's strategy has been clear all along -- Poindexter  was only doing Ronald Reagan's bidding.  </P> <P> Beckler plans to play videotaped testimony from Reagan, but has not said when  the star witness will appear on a television monitor.  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: San Paolo ready for Spanish expansion ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin-based bank, is negotiating to buy Banco Catala de Credit, a medium-sized Spanish bank owned by Banco Banesto. The purchase would substantially boost San Paolo's expansion plans in Spain, where it bought a 35 per cent stake in Banca Matutes, a small 32-branch private bank, last year. Banco Catala de Credit has 105 branches, 26 of which are around its Barcelona base, and the remainder in Catalonia. It had net profits of L12.3bn (Dollars 9.59m) last year. Banca Matutes is concentrated on the Balearic Islands. San Paolo itself last year opened a Madrid branch. San Paolo could not comment on the likely price for the acquisition, but confirmed talks were under way on a letter of intent. Separately, the company denied recent Italian press reports that San Paolo had substantially raised its stake in Hambros, the UK merchant bank, following the sale by Baltica, the Danish insurance group, of a 14 per cent stake. San Paolo's holding has recently risen to about 14.9 per cent from 14.3 per cent, but this was due to the exercise of convertible bond holdings. Sasib, the quoted food, packaging and industrial group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's CIR holding company, raised net profits by 16.6 per cent to L70.2bn from L60.2bn last year. Total sales jumped by 22 per cent to L619.7bn, with foreign turnover, boosted by acquisitions, surging by 50 per cent to L439.2bn. The company is paying a dividend of L230 for ordinary shares and L250 for its savings shares respectively.</p>

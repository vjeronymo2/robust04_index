			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Go-ahead for Wellcome product Wellcome, the UK drugs group, received recommendation on Saturday for its Lamictal epileptic treatment from a specialist committee of the US Food and Drug Administration. Lamictal is one of Wellcome's most promising new compounds which the company believes could eventually generate significant revenues. Analysts expect the drug, currently licensed in only 10 countries, to generate sales of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 200m by 1995. The worldwide epileptic market, which mainly consists of generic low-price medicines, is worth between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m a year.</p>

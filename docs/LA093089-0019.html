			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A RAIDER MOVE WOULD BENEFIT TV VIEWERS  </P> <P> It really upsets me that some Ram home games will not be seen on TV, even if  the Rams sell out 72 hours before game time.  </P> <P> Why not? Because we are forced to see an away Raider game. I hope the  schedule-makers think about what they are doing before they make this mistake  again.  </P> <P> Another good solution would be for the Raiders to move.  </P> <P> BENJAMIN KARTER, La Palma  </P></p>

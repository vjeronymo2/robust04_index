			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Shows Canceled: Weekend shows by rock duo Bob Weir &amp; Rob Wasserman and  country singer Vince Gill were postponed after the newly reopened Raymond  Theatre in Pasadena was closed by fire marshals Friday because of inadequate  fire retardant.  </P> <P> The shows were the second and third bookings at the renovated movie house,  which reopened on Nov. 16. The Raymond marks promoter Gary Folgner's entry into  the Los Angeles concert market after his success with the Coach House in San  Juan Capistrano and the Ventura Theatre in Ventura. No new dates for the  postponed concerts have been announced, but a spokeswoman for Gill said that  the singer probably won't perform in the area until next spring. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Publication of Retail Newsagent is blocked A ROW between newsagents and The Daily Telegraph over the share of the newspaper's cover price kept by agents has led to a block on the distribution of a trade magazine. Retail Newsagent yesterday failed to overturn an injunction banning distribution of this week's issue. The dispute arose after the Telegraph unexpectedly cut its trade discount to 25 per cent on the Saturday newspaper only, starting last Saturday, at the same time as its price rose 20 per cent to 60p. Newspapers are normally sold to agents at a discount of 26.5 per cent on the cover price. Some shopkeepers responded by reducing their orders for the paper or keeping copies off shelves in protest. Late on Thursday The Daily Telegraph was granted an injunction against the magazine, banning distribution of this week's issue, which carried articles advising its readers not to sell The Daily Telegraph today. A front-page editorial comment said: 'Don't touch it with a bargepole'. The injunction also prohibited the National Federation of Retail Newsagents from encouraging its members to boycott the paper. Mr Steve Brennan, editor of Retail Newsagent, which has a circulation of more than 17,000, yesterday accused The Daily Telegraph of showing 'total disregard' for press freedom. He said: 'We must have the right to advise our individual readers to take whatever action they feel is in the best interests of their business.' Because the cover price of the Saturday edition of the newspaper has risen, newsagents will get slightly more in cash terms from each copy sold under the new rate, but they are concerned that other newspapers will follow suit, squeezing profit margins already affected by the recession. In 1990 the Daily Mirror cut newsagents' discounts from 28 per cent to 26.5 per cent. It was followed immediately by The Sun and within months by all the other papers. Newspapers are not allowed to consult about whether competitors will follow suit when one cuts margins. The Independent raised its Monday-to-Friday cover price to 45p last week but maintained margins, indicating that it is not certain that other papers will follow The Daily Telegraph. The Daily Telegraph would not comment yesterday.</p>

The bioactivities of the synthetic peptides were  examined in terms of indirect ELISA. The peptide 3 (30 amino  acid) ELISA assay has sensitivity of 100 percent and specificity  of 100 percent with 55 anti-HIV-1 antibody-positive sera and  sera samples from 150 healthy blood donors. Either peptide 3 or  HIV antigen inhibition assay also demonstrated that the peptide  ELISA was specific.    The results showed that the peptide 3 could be used as a  highly sensitive and specific reagent for diagnosis of HIV-1  infection.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Apple sharply down in second term Apple Computer reported sharply lower earnings for its second quarter, underperforming Wall Street expectations. Net income for the second quarter was Dollars 17.4m, or 15 cents per share, well below analysts' projections of about 24 cents per share and down sharply from Dollars 110.9m, or 92 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues increased 5 per cent to Dollars 2.08bn, from Dollars 1.97bn. Apple said that strong sales of its Power Macintosh models, introduced last month, had compensated for slow sales in January and February as customers anticipated the introduction of the new computers. However, the company's gross margins fell sharply, from about 38 per cent of revenue in the second quarter last year to 24 per cent. Macintosh shipments increased by 9 per cent in volume compared to the same period last year, the company said, with 145,000 Power Macintosh personal computers shipped during the quarter. 'We are very pleased with the early acceptance of Power Macintosh,' said Mr Michael Spindler, Apple's president and chief executive. International revenues were 52 per cent of total net revenues during the second quarter, up from 47 per cent a year ago. The growth in international revenues was driven by strong shipments in Japan. Apple said that Japan is now its largest market outside the US. Apple's results reflected a significant reduction in operating expenses. Operating expenses for the quarter totalled Dollars 464.3m, a reduction of Dollars 127.4m compared to the Dollars 591.7m in the same quarter a year ago. Research and development spending was also reduced. 'Since we announced our restructuring in July last year, we have driven down costs and increased Apple's efficiency while at the same time working to deliver important new products like Power Macintosh,' said Mr Spindler. For the half year period, revenues were Dollars 4.54bn, up from Dollars 3.97bn in the same period last year. Net income was Dollars 57.4m, or 49 cents per share, compared with Dollars 272.2m or Dollars 2.25 per share.</p>

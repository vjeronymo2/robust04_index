			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  JUDGE WON'T RELEASE ACCUSED DEA AGENT  </P> <P> A Los Angeles federal judge rejected electronic monitoring of John Anthony  Jackson on Friday and once again denied bail for the former Drug Enforcement  Administration agent.  </P> <P> "I'm just not of a mind to experiment with this monitoring," said U.S. District  Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. "You (Jackson) will remain detained."  </P> <P> Jackson's lawyer, John Robertson, proposed that his 39-year-old client wear a  monitoring bracelet, which would broadcast 24 hours a day. If the signal was  interrupted, Robertson said, a private monitoring service would notify  authorities.  </P> <P> Hatter refused to release Jackson last week, declaring that he was not  satisfied that Jackson could buy an expensive home and several businesses on  the $30,000 or $40,000 yearly salary of a DEA agent.  </P> <P> Jackson and two other former drug agency agents, Darnell Garcia, 41, and Wayne  Countryman, 45, were indicted by a federal grand jury in December on charges of  conspiring to evade Internal Revenue Services taxes by laundering more than  $600,000 through foreign banks. Garcia is still a fugitive. Countryman was  freed on $120,000 bail.  </P></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Revenues hit by duty-free shopping CROSS-CHANNEL shopping is costing the government Pounds 260m a year in lost excise duty and value added tax on wines and spirits - five times the amount forecast by the Treasury when the European single market was established in January. A survey by the Wine and Spirit Association suggests that every vehicle making the cross-Channel trip returns to the UK with an average 27 bottles of wine and two bottles of spirits. Just over a quarter of visitors to the Continent do not buy any wines or spirits. Of the rest, 93 per cent buy up to 10 bottles of spirits, and 64 per cent return with up to four cases of wine. The association has presented its survey results to Sir John Cope, paymaster-general, as part of its arguments against any tax increase on drinks in the November Budget. Mr Bernard Windsor, association chairman, said the Treasury had assured the WSA that any Budget changes in excise duty would not be implemented until January 1 next year to avoid pricing confusion in the pre-Christmas trading period. Mr Windsor said industry estimates suggested that the Treasury was also losing Pounds 100m a year from personal imports of beer. 'The only solution is to reduce the UK's level of excise on alcoholic beverages so significantly that cross-border shopping is no longer viable.' The increase in personal imports was hitting drinks retailers throughout the country, he said.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Bets on rate cut THE STERLING cash and futures markets started to bet on a cut in UK base rates before the March budget, following the release of extremely poor UK economic indicators yesterday, writes James Blitz. Both the larger than expected rise of 60,800 in the number of people out of work in December and the 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output in November persuaded many dealers that the UK government must urgently contemplate a cut in interest rates to stimulate the economy. Until yesterday, the market appeared to believe that base rates would not be cut before the UK chancellor's Budget in March, and that the reduction in rates might only be in the order of 50 basis points. However, a dealer said yest-erday: 'The market could not have been given a more dis-astrous set of figures than these.' The March sterling contract rose 18 basis points to close at 93.70, a level which supposes that three-month money at Budget time will be at 6.30 per cent. This is compatible with a 100 basis-point cut in base rate, which would immediately bring three-month money down to about 6 1/4 per cent. One dealer suggested yesterday that anyone buying the March contract from now on would be betting on an immediate easing in policy. That did not stop another dealer suggesting that 'March' still has 20 basis points to climb, because the market is so optimistic. 'I do not think there actually will be a 1 per cent cut in rates but, in this game, the journey is more important than where you arrive,' he said. The cash market now appears to be entering a period when prospects of a rate cut discourage dealers from tying up funds with the Bank of England through the offer of bills. Several dealers anticipated tight overnight lending rates from here to Budget Day. Three-month sterling cash fell sharply yesterday from around 7 per cent to 6 13/16 per cent. The decline was all the more remarkable considering the tightness of conditions in the discount market. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.9bn, there was late assistance of Pounds 350m and the overnight rate peaked at 10 per cent. The key issue for the UK government now is whether it cares enough about the sterling exchange rate to avoid lowering base rates.</p>

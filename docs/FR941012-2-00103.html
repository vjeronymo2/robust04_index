			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The sleeve sample size has been increased to a minimum of twenty (20) percent of the inservice sleeves. Increasing the sample size of the sleeves to be inspected will increase the monitoring of tubes using sleeves for any further degradation while they remain inservice. If the sample identifies a sleeve with an imperfection of greater [than] 40 percent depth, an additional 20 percent of the sleeves shall be inspected. The sleeves that have identified imperfections of greater than 40 percent shall be evaluated and removed from service. The inservice inspections and additional corrosion testing for the sleeves and welded joints will continue until the corrosion resistance is demonstrated acceptable to the NRC. If conformance with the acceptance criteria of section 4.4.5.4 for tube structural integrity is not confirmed, the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. Increasing the monitoring of the sleeved tubes will decrease the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of a corrosion testing program should determine the effects that material microstructure, chemistry, and joint crevices will have on primary water stress corrosion cracking initiation and growth. This program will not cause an increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated because the testing program is conducted in laboratory conditions. If the results of the testing program do not confirm the structural integrity of the tubes, the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. These changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of the proposed amendment will not introduce significant or adverse changes to the plant design basis. The proposed changes do not involve plant modification or changes to equipment, and consist of: reduction in allowable steam generator leakage limits, increase in the sample size of the steam generator tube sleeved and the addition of a commitment to perform a corrosion testing program on the sleeved tubes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reduction in TS leakage rate requirements from 500 gpd allowable per SG to 150 gpd further ensures that SG tube integrity is maintained in the event of a MSLB or under LOCA conditions. The 150 gpd limit is designed to provide for leakage detection and a plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in excessive tube leakage. The limit provides for early detection and a plant shutdown prior to a postulated crack reaching critical crack lengths for Main Steam Line Break conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the sample size of tubes sleeved during each scheduled inservice inspection will increase the monitoring of these tubes for any further degradation. The improved monitoring and evaluation of the tube and the sleeves assures tube structural integrity is maintained or the tube is removed for service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, corrosion testing to establish sleeve design life and corrosion resistance to confirm tube structural integrity will be performed. If the tube structural integrity is not confirmed, the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With these actions the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of the proposed changes will not reduce the margin of safety. This amendment involves the reduction of steam generator leakage limit, and increase in the amount of sleeved tubes inspected and the incorporation of a corrosion testing program for sleeved tubes. All of these actions will help ensure steam generator tube integrity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reduction of the leakage rate requirement from 500 to 150 gallons per day (gpd) per steam generator will continue to ensure steam generator tube integrity is maintained in the event of main steam line break or under LOCA conditions. The reduction to 150 gpd also limits the allowable primary-to-secondary leakage from 1 gallon per minute to 600 gpd for all steam generators not isolated from the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). This previous leakage limit, used in UFSAR accident analysis, ensured the dosage contribution from tube leakage would be limited to a small fraction of the 10 CFR Part 100 dose guideline values in the event of either a steam generator tube rupture or steam line break. Reducing these limits will not result [in] a reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The portions of the installed sleeve assembly which represent the reactor coolant pressure boundary can be monitored for the initiation and progression of sleeve/tube wall degradation, thus satisfying the requirement of Regulatory Guide 1.83. The portion of the tube bridged by the sleeve joints is effectively removed from the pressure boundary, and the sleeve then forms the new pressure boundary. The sleeve enhances the safety of the plant by increasing the protective boundaries of the steam generator. Keeping the tube in service with the use of a sleeve instead of plugging the tube and removing it from service increases the heat transfer efficiency of the steam generator. Monitoring for any increased degradation of a repaired steam generator tube shall be implemented at Byron and Braidwood by increasing the sampling size of inservice sleeves to include an additional twenty (20) percent of the sleeves inservice. During each scheduled in service inspection, each sampled sleeve evaluated and found to have unacceptable degradation shall be removed from service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of a corrosion testing program should determine the effects that material microstructure, chemistry, and joint crevices will have on primary water stress corrosion cracking initiation and growth. This program is conducted in laboratory setting; therefore, [it] will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In addition, the corrosion testing program will be performed to establish sleeve design life and corrosion resistance to confirm tube structural integrity. If the tube structural integrity is not confirmed, the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. These actions [do] not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the preceding analysis it is concluded that operation of Byron and Braidwood Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment does not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated, nor reduce any margins to plant safety. Therefore, the license amendment does not involve a Significant Hazards Consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

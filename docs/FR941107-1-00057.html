Containers holding stone crabs must be stacked in a manner that does not compress the crabs. A stone crab body from which a legal-sized claw has been removed must be returned to the sea before the vessel reaches shore or a port or dock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

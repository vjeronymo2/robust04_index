			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991, for the initial moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas must demonstrate that at least two milestones will be achieved (1st milestone: November 15, 1991, through November 15, 1994; 2nd milestone: November 15, 1994, through November 15, 1997).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the initial PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas that demonstrate timely attainment, the emissions reduction progress made between the SIP submittal (due date of November 15, 1991) and the attainment date will satisfy the first quantitative milestone. See 57 FR 13539. For areas that demonstrate timely attainment of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS, the milestones beyond the attainment achievement date should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance of the standards. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.'' However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation of an area as attainment is contingent upon several factors and future events. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable for States to initially address at least the first two milestones. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment. However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated previously, the SIP for the Libby nonattainment area demonstrates attainment of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS by December 31, 1994. The SIP also demonstrates that the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS will be maintained in future years by predicting a 24-hour design concentration of 137.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and an annual design concentration of 46.0  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the year 1998. Therefore, EPA is approving the submittal as meeting the quantitative milestone requirement currently due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assurance that milestones and reasonable further progress will be achieved is based upon the State adopting and implementing the particular control measures contained in the SIP which are addressed in Section II.A.3, ``RACM (including RACT),'' of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, once a milestone has passed, the State will have to demonstrate that the milestone was, in fact, achieved for the Libby area as provided in section 189(c)(2) of the Act. The State of Montana's PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP indicates that the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES) and the Lincoln County Health Department (LCHD) will submit to EPA a milestone report consistent with federal guidelines by December 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All exceedances of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard will be evaluated and a determination made as to the source of the exceedance. Changes in the air quality program to prevent further exceedances and a timetable for implementation will be developed. Any other EPA requirements for RFP reports will be incorporated as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Enforceability Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above in section II.A.3, ``RACM (including RACT).'' The Lincoln County air pollution control ordinances, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by LCHD. There are penalties for noncompliance with the mandatory solid fuel burning device regulation that are $25 for the third and subsequent violations. There are also penalties for violation of any provision of the open burning regulation that are: a fine not less than $10 and not more than $200 for each offense, except for burning hazardous wastes (as defined by 40 CFR part 261), which carries a penalty of a fine not to exceed $10,000 for each offense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program and the associated local regulations are also enforceable by the MDHES, if the LCHD fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the MBHES in accordance with section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act and effectuated by a MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce MBHES orders, the MDHES has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement provisions are found in the Clean Air Act of Montana, sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401&hyph;429, Montana Code Annotated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The emission limits for the Stimson Lumber Company facility are enforceable by the MDHES through air quality permit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2627&hyph;M with a final modification date of July 25, 1991. Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;401 of the Montana Clean Air Act allows the MDHES to seek civil penalties for a violation of a permit limitation. Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 16.8.1112 allows the MDHES to revoke a permit for a violation of a permit limitation. These regulations are contained in the ARM 16.8.101 through 16.8.1602 and violations of these rules are punishable by civil penalties in an amount up to $10,000 per day and criminal penalties in an amount up to $1,000 per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii) of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation when, for example, the State has the authority and resources to implement the provision, and the local entity has failed to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

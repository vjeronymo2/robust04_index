			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nicaragua in telecoms sell-off The Nicaraguan government expects to sell a 40 per cent stake in Telcor, the national telecommunications company, by the end of the year, in what will be the first telecoms privatisation in Central America. Six foreign companies - France Telecom, Korea Telecom, AT&amp;T, GTE, Telefonica de Espana, and Stet International - have pre-qualified for the sale. The government will retain a 49 per cent share and the remaining 11 per cent will be offered to Telcor's 3,300 employees on preferential terms. Nicaragua has about 70,000 telephone subscribers and, at less than two lines per 100 people, one of the lowest telephone densities in Latin America. Investors, who will have management control of the company, must expand the telephone network to 12 lines per 100 people by the end of the decade, says Mr Hjalmar Ayestas, a consultant to Telcor. The concession is expected to be granted for between 25 and 30 years, with exclusivity for seven years. Officials say the sale could raise more than Dollars 300m for the government. The Nicaraguan congress has yet to approve the sale. However, despite some union opposition and scepticism from the Sandinista party, the bill is expected to be approved next month. Telcor has embarked on an ambitious modernisation programme over the past three years, replacing an antiquated analogue network with a digital system.</p>

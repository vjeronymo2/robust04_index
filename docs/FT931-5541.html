			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: In search of Robert Campin - Patricia Morison turns sleuth at the National Gallery If conundrums are to your taste, Robert Campin, the latest exhibition in the National Gallery's Brief Encounters series, will have added zest. The title could perhaps have been Robert Campin?, subtitled 'A Fireside Mystery'. But the curators have presented a much simpler, safer story, perhaps wanting instead to concentrate the public's eye on the indisputable beauty of seven early Netherlandish panel paintings. Five come from the Gallery's own collection. The other two images, generously loaned by the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, are the 'Trinity' and 'Virgin and Child in front of a Fire'. The St Petersburg paintings, 28cms high, once formed a diptych joined with hinges so that its owner could fold it like a book. Perhaps the owner who commissioned it was a merchant, a nobleman, or one of those wealthy and cultivated Flemish ladies of the early 15th-century who we find bequeathing paintings in their wills. The National Gallery's 'Wilton Diptych' is an extremely well-known example of this quite common type of devotional image. However, its grand subject, the English king Richard II being presented to the Virgin and Christ-Child at the court of heaven, might seem to put it in a different world from the St Petersburgpanel. Yet this Flemish artist's theme is nothing if not grand, even though the response of some reviewers has implied that this exhibition consists solely of charmingly intimate, domestic images of the Virgin and Child. What has the holy infant seen there which has made him move so sharply to the right and hold his little hands in the air? In the left-hand Trinity panel, God the Father supports the broken body of the crucified Christ, whose eyes are closed. Christ faints with agony, yet evidently he is still conscious because his hand is cupped under the wound in his side. From that wound there had flowed both blood and water; Christ's blood, renewed through the sacrament of the Eucharist, is the pledge of man's redemption. Carved on God's throne is the familiar pelican slashing her breast to feed her chicks, as well as a less familiar family of lions. According to the tradition of the medieval bestiaries, lion-cubs are born dead but after three days their father breathes on them and they come to life. To eyes more attuned to Christian doctrine than our own, the diptych would have represented the Incarnation and Atonement. Mary wears red and blue, and so does God. The white cloth underneath the Child, whose genitals representing his full humanity are clearly seen, is a formal parallel to the loincloth of the crucifixion. Some say the Virgin holds her right hand up in order to warm it at the fire before swaddling her baby. But was the artist really evoking such a mundane process in a painting in which colours, objects, and structure all convey the symbolic journey towards sacrifice and redemption? Fifteenth-century images of the Virgin at home always portray her in thoroughly affluent surroundings, so it seems uncharacteristic to suggest Joseph had been mean with the heating. To my eye, the gesture is the Mother of God's response - a little fearful because she is only a woman - to a premonition of the pain and the glory yet to come. So let us not sell short this profound and wonderful image by Robert Campin of Tournai. Not that every scholar has agreed that the diptych is by Campin. Some have said it is by one of his assistants; Jacques Daret (not well-known, but certainly worked for Campin) or Rogier Van der Weyden (immensely admired, and probably a Campin pupil). 'The subject is very obscure', warned the NG's 1968 catalogue of Campin's putative paintings. He was a famous and admired master of Tournai, and he was convicted of keeping a mistress in 1432. Very little else, and not one single painting, is known definitely about Campin. It seems a pity that the exhibition did not let more obscurity steal forth, like smoke from behind an arras. For scholars, half the point of the exhibition is the opportunity it offers to decide whether the NG's 'Virgin and Child in an Interior' is indeed by Campin. This panel (half the size and in much better condition than the St Petersburg picture) was purchased as recently as 1988. It was totally unknown, but X-ray examination showed it was made from the same piece of wood as the small 'Portrait of a Man' which some learned authorities - including the author of the 1968 catalogue - have decided is by Campin. So is 'Virgin and Child in an Interior' by Campin? A virtually impossible question for a layperson, although had more of the kernel of 'secure' paintings been reproduced we might all have felt a little bolder. So try out another question; which of the paintings in the exhibition present enough points of similarity to be by the same artist? And while you are about it, go to the Sainsbury Wing and check out the Rogier Van der Weydens. An hour of this kind of ferreting is fun. Peering so closely, one appreciates all the more the realism and attention to detail which is a hallmark of Campin and the Campinesque. Through the window of 'Virgin and Child Before a Firescreen' we see the bustle of Tournai, people strolling, roofers up a ladder. Campin has been praised for pioneering the street-view, and no doubt his contemporaries were quite as amazed at his skill. So is it significant that whoever painted the little panel went for something easier, a view of a church and a golden cornfield? There are endless questions to ask, and it may be that a cloud of Campins hover in the air. The art-historians' business is to chase them and pin them down but thanks to this fascinating little exhibition, it is a hunt others too can enjoy.</p>

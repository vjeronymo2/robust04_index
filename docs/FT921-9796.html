			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Council tax in confusion, Blunkett says intended to be in force by April next year - has been jeopardised by the need for a register of households, Labour said yesterday. Mr David Blunkett, the party's local government spokesman, said 'the total confusion' now emerging over the tax meant the Tories would be forced to table additional legislation if they were returned to power. He was speaking at Labour's local government conference in Blackpool, which ended yesterday with the fervour of a pre-election rally. Earlier in the conference, Mr Blunkett had said Labour would use its first 100 days in power to reverse 13 years of growing centralism in Whitehall that had left the Department of the Environment 'riddled with Thatcherites'. Yesterday, his attention centred on a report by local government associations, discussed with environment department officials last week, that expresses serious unease over the 'collectability' of the new tax. The report, submitted by the associations of metropolitan, London and district authorities, casts doubt on whether regulations now passing through parliament give councils adequate powers to check households' eligibility for discounts. It also warns that, at the outset of the council-tax system, 'there will be a resistance to the payment of local taxes as part of the legacy of the community charge'. In reply, environment department officials have said that steps will be taken in the report stage of the bill later this month to empower councils to seek information from households. Mr Blunkett drew attention, however, to comments by a senior Department of Environment official reported in a local government journal. The official is quoted as warning that the legality of the use of the poll-tax register to judge eligibility for council-tax discounts may have to be tested in the courts. 'I suspect that if the Tories were re-elected further changes to the legislation would be inevitable,' Mr Blunkett said. That view is certain to be contested by ministers who have long promised that the new tax will be enforced by April next year.</p>

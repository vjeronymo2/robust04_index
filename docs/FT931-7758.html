			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MP survives legal challenge A LEGAL attempt to oust West Belfast MP Dr Joe Hendron failed yesterday after a special election court in the city ruled that he had made inaccurate election returns but was not guilty of corrupt practice. At the general election last April, Dr Hendron captured the seat for the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party by 589 votes from Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.</p>

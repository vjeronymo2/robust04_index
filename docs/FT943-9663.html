			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Peterborough rail strike services hit Train services which have run between London King's Cross and Peterborough during the recent rail strikes will not run during the signal workers' planned action at the end of this week and early next, it was announced yesterday. Otherwise, services will be similar to those during previous strikes with more trains in some areas, train operating companies announced. Hourly trains are expected between London Euston and Birmingham and between London Paddington and Bristol, Devon and south Wales. Some trains are expected to run between London Euston and Glasgow. Acas, the conciliation service, said last night that it was continuing separate talks with both sides in the nine-week rail signalling dispute but it was not yet in a position to decide whether joint negotiations could restart. Further talks will be held today through Acas, but there is still no sign of any breakthrough in the industrial conflict between the RMT transport union and Railtrack, the state-owned company running the network.</p>

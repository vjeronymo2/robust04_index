			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Brian Foster report: "No Less Super -- The Next Step for </F> Europe's Particle Physics"]    [Text] Last October the U.S. Congress finally pulled the  plug on the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). The SSC was  designed primarily to elucidate the mechanism by which  elementary particles acquire mass. In order to do this, the SSC  would have consisted of a large accelerator capable of colliding  protons at energies 20 times larger than currently available.  While almost no one in the U.S. questioned the fact that the  SSC would have been a superb scientific instrument, in the end  it was sacrificed on the altar of the budget deficit. It is  estimated that the final cost to the U.S. taxpayer could be as  high as $4 billion.    The termination of the SSC has thrown long-term plans for  the  future of particle physics into confusion. A series of meetings  in the last few months at CERN, the European centre for particle  physics research in Geneva, has surveyed the new landscape.  <H5>  Enter the LHC </H5>   The only proposal now capable of ensuring that we can throw  light on the origin of mass is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),  planned to be constructed at CERN. Since it will operate in the  same tunnel as the Large Electron Position (LEP) collider, it  will be much cheaper than the SSC was projected to be.    The LHC design document has now been produced and it is  clear  that there are technically no outstanding questions hindering  its approval. Chris Llewellyn Smith, an eminent UK physicist  and the new director-general of CERN, has outlined the project  strategy The intention is to construct the LHC from within the  current CERN Budget -- contributed to by all member states in  proportion to their net national incomes.    He believes that construction could be achieved without  extra  resources provided that CERN is allowed to take out small  "bridging loans," either from member states in the form of  advanced subscription payments, or from banks. These would  allow the smoothing out of the peaks in expenditure which are  inevitable in large projects and permit construction within a  constant budget. Completion would be in 2002 and any necessary  loans would be paid off by 2006. If extra contributions were  available, for instance from non-member states, then naturally  the situation would become even more favourable.    Llewellyn Smith has already warned that these timescales are  long ones, and that prompt approval is both desirable and  necessary to maintain momentum and to ensure that the essential  groups of engineers and physicists can continue work on the  project. Preliminary steps towards this goal were taken at the  CERN Council meeting last December and, although some  delegations -- including those of the UK and Germany --  expressed reservations, it currently seems hopeful that these  can be overcome and that approval for the project can be gained  at the next Council meeting in June.  <H5>  Attractive Proposition </H5>   Curiously, one problem which currently might stand in the  way  of LHC approval is the demise of the SSC. It might seem that  the disappearance of a competing project should make things  easier. But the problem lies in the attractiveness and  popularity of the LHC. Many U.S. and Japanese physicists who had  intended to work on the SSC now wish to work on the LHC.  However, CERN is primarily a European facility and the  admission of a large contingent of U.S. and other  non-member-state physicists is therefore far from simple.    An overview of the current state of U.S. particle physics  was  given at a meeting of the European Committee for Future  Accelerators in December by Stan Wojciki, chairman of the  prestigious panel which advises the U.S. Department of Energy on  particle physics. Clearly, the demise of the SSC, which was the  major future project in the U.S., has been a very traumatic  event. Many U.S. groups who were taking a lead in the SSC  experimental preparations are now searching for a future  activity. Although the U.S. is still operating successful  accelerators, particularly at Fermilab near Chicago, their  lifetime is limited to a few more years at best. New U.S.  initiatives will necessarily be on a much smaller scale than the  SSC. All of this points to increased U.S. participation in CERN,  in particular the LHC project. However, such participation  would have to be agreed upon by the U.S. Congress. Having just  cut off funding for a U.S.-based accelerator, it is difficult to  imagine Congress voting to bind itself to spending substantial  sums of money over an indefinite period to allow its physicists  to decamp to Europe and engage in high-tech activities with some  of its biggest economic competitors. Nevertheless, it is clear  that U.S. participation in the LHC can only take place if there  is an equitable financial contribution both to LHC construction  and to the running of CERN.    This is also true of Japan. Japanese plans for particle  physics imply no firm commitment to making an immediate  financial contribution to CERN, although this could well be  forthcoming in the longer term.    The problem of allowing access to CERN by scientists from  non-member states could be solved in a variety of ways. For  instance, CERN could be fully internationalized to become a  world laboratory for particle physics. Alternatively, a new  world organization, of which CERN would become one of a number  of regional centres, could be set up. Finally, the structure  and membership of CERN could be left essentially unchanged and  non-member states allowed to participate in any of all of the  CERN programmes by a number of ad- hoc bilateral agreements.    There are enormous problems with the first two options. Full  internationalization of CERN would produce an unwieldy  organization without a strong regional identity. Many member  states are understandably reluctant to sacrifice CERN's states  as one of the few unambiguously successful pan-European  institutions. The second option is likely to be a very long and  complicated procedure given that, as yet, there is no clear  blueprint for the form of such an international organization,  nor for any umbrella organization it might operate under.    Nevertheless, there is a growing feeling among the physics  community that this is a desirable goal for the long term, if  only to avoid the waste of resources inherent in disasters such  as the cancellation of the SSC. It is sobering to realize that  the amount of money which will have been spent by the time the  SSC is properly terminated would have sufficed to fund the  entire CERN programme, including the LHC construction, for about  a decade. Many physicists are now bending their minds to find  ways of achieving an organization which would strengthen the  international dimension of the subject while preserving the best  features of proven institutions such as CERN.    The third option -- concluding ad-hoc bilateral agreements  --  is the only practicable one in the short term. However, it is  essential that the approval of CERN's future programme is not  made contingent on the successful conclusion of any such  agreements. it seems very unlikely that, for example, U.S.  funding could be available for LHC participation before FY96.  <H5>  Positive Contribution </H5>   The LHC is technically now ripe for approval: It could be  built within CERN's own financial resources, to which any  non-member-state contribution would be helpful but not  essential, and it is imperative that it be approved soon if the  momentum and cohesion of the teams of physicists and engineers  who will build it and perform its experiments are not to be  lost. In the next few months European governments, the UK  prominent among them, will have the chance to approve a project  that will ensure the pre-eminence of European particle physics  for the forseeable future.    More importantly, a positive decision will result in timely  construction, at no extra cost to the taxpayer, and thereby  provide the only instrument that we can be certain will help us  to understand why the universe has mass.</p>

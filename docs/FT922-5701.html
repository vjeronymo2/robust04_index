			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI Thorn's restructuring has been well documented, but the size of the extraordinary items accompanying broadly unchanged full year profits yesterday still came as something of a surprise. The company, to be fair, is scrupulous about taking routine rationalisation costs above the line, has refused to join the pension accounting bandwagon, and can individually justify the component parts. A gross charge equivalent to almost 50 per cent of pre-tax profits nevertheless took some of the shine off an otherwise resilient performance. The weakness of Thorn's shares in the last week - in contrast to the immediate post Virgin euphoria - no doubt owes something to the second instalment on the rights. It may also reflect the market's uncertainty as to whether the stock is primarily a defensive or a recovery one. The improvement in music margins (ex Thames) vividly demonstrates its defensive appeal, but though US rental volumes now appear to be picking up the UK side looks set for another tough year. Thorn is solid, well-financed, and clearly has scope to improve the returns from non-core businesses like lighting and security. Until the much hyped benefits of the Virgin acquisition start to show through, however, the shares may struggle to live with a rating 16-17 per cent above the market average.</p>

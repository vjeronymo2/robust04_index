			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Moment of truth looms for Ferruzzi: Bankers and shareholders vote on the largest shake-up in Italian corporate history The next 72 hours could be decisive for Italy's Ferruzzi group as bankers and shareholders gather for a string of meetings to determine its future. The fate of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company and Montedison, its main industrial arm, goes much further than a tussle over debts. Ferfin and its subsidiaries, which include Edison (energy), Calcestruzzi (cement) and Eridania Beghin-Say (sugar), comprise Italy's second-biggest private company, with more than 52,000 employees and sales of L19,900bn last year. The rescue package prepared by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, and other big domestic creditors is easily the biggest restructuring in Italian  -and probably European - corporate history. Ferfin's net debt is now running at more than L22,600bn (Dollars 13.58bn), while group losses last year were L1,667bn. The decisive meeting will come tonight, when the boards of Ferfin and Montedison gather to assess creditor banks' response to the controversial rescue plan unveiled by Mediobanca in mid-October. The scheme involves interest moratoriums, restructuring of borrowings and the conversion of debt to equity. A few subsidiaries will be sold, others will go into joint ventures in a package designed to lighten Ferfin's interest burden, prune costs and concentrate on cash-generating subsidiaries. Gaining the banks' approval remains a cliffhanger, however. Although Ferfin's Italian bank creditors backed the plan early on, foreign institutions have been less malleable. The position of foreign banks may appear marginal, as they account for only a fraction of the group's total borrowings. However, they are in a strong position as their lending is concentrated on a handful of subsidiaries, such as Montedison, which has borrowed heavily in the US. Indeed they could scupper the scheme as they account for almost all the loans to Montedison's big US-based Himont polyethylene subsidiary, which they could put in default. Together, the foreign banks, which include Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS, are owed L6,500bn. The past week has brought a detente between Mediobanca and the foreign creditors. An updated plan has removed a number of contentious issues by taking some big US operations, such as Montedison USA and Himont, out of the restructuring. However, observers will only learn tonight whether the changes have proved enough. Foreign bankers have welcomed the changes, but stress that it is impossible to meet the deadline of today. The stakes are high. Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's tough chairman, who was brought in by Italian bank creditors after a boardroom shake-up earlier this year, has threatened to instigate bankruptcy proceedings and even to resign if he does not receive the support of banks representing at least 80 per cent of Ferfin's borrowings. The latest Mediobanca letter demands 85 per cent acceptance. Mr Rossi's challenges are taken with a pinch of salt by foreign bankers, who see the moves as part of the war of wills in recent weeks. But few care to brush off the challenge outright, especially as bankruptcy proceedings in the slow Italian courts could drag on for a decade. If enough banks agree to the plan, shareholders' meetings will be held tomorrow to approve Ferfin's recapitalisation and on Wednesday for Montedison. For Ferfin, the plan envisages raising L2,932bn via rights issues and warrants to buy new shares. The scheme is partly a book-keeping exercise, as creditor banks will largely be swapping debt for equity. Shareholders will also be asked to approve issuing a further L2,000bn in new shares and L800bn in bonds over the next 18 months. Similar action is in store for Montedison. The rescue plan contains measures to raise L5,172bn, assuming all warrants are exercised. The board will also seek approval to raise a further L1,000bn in shares and L500bn of bonds over the next 18 months. Even assuming a last-minute compromise is reached with the foreign creditors and enough banks accept the scheme, many details remain to be clarified. How Ferfin will pay to maintain a holding in Montedison is one. The Mediobanca plan envisages Ferfin paying L400bn for new shares. The cash will come from its own recapitalisation, and from a partial sale of its stake in Gemina, a big holding company. According to the plan, Ferfin's stake in Montedison will fall from 49 per cent to 30 per cent.</p>

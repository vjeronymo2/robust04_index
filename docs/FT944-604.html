			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: An old flame from Portugal - Antony Thorncroft salutes Lisbon, bowing out as this year's European City of Culture So it's farewell Lisbon, 1994, hello Luxembourg, 1995. The European City of Culture moves with the calendar and the artistic flame has been passed on from Portugal's capital to the Grand Duchy. Cities of Culture, an EC institution, attract little criticism; they also attract little interest. It would take a cultural junkie to remember which city glowed with creativity in 1989 (Paris) or 1992 (Madrid). Only Glasgow (1990) and Antwerp (1993) managed to change their popular image by having a heavy attack of the arts. In Lisbon, the ending of the cultural year affected citizens in two ways: a small group scattered around the Teatro San Carlos for the worthy congratulatory speeches - while thousands milled on the banks of the Tagus listening to Portugal's top rock band, watching fireworks, and patronising the bars that were kept open all night. In the immediate future there will always be a small audience for the high arts in Lisbon. Venues which hummed with performances for most of 1994 will return to weekly concerts and the short opera and dance seasons, but the audience will grow now there is an infrastructure in place to support it. The main tangible benefit is the way the authorities were forced to invest in new, or revamped, theatres, concert halls and museums. There were the usual sulks between a right-wing government and a left-wing city council about footing the bill, but in the end more than Pounds 30m was conjured up. The funds did not permit any splashy new structures, but the main concert hall, the Coliseu, now gleams with the intimacy of a musical bull ring and two of Lisbon's main museums, of modern art in the Chaido and of Old Masters along by the river, are marvellous examples of how old buildings can be decked inside with modern trimings without destroying the historic exterior structure. As Portugal, seaward-gazing and introspective, gradually absorbs European culture, the refurbished buildings will tempt a larger audience. Not surprisingly, with all the special exhibitions, there were 50 per cent more gallery visitors during 1994. In all, about 1.5m tickets were sold for more than 1,000 events, even though the organisers had to reduce seat prices by 20 per cent to attract decent audiences. There were the usual grouses: that too much money was spent bringing foreign creative artists to Lisbon and not enough on encouraging local talent; that the events charmed the sophisticated minority while the man on the tram was untouched. But visits from orchestras such as the LSO and the Philharmonia, the Concertgebouw and the Czech Philharmonic; from dance companies such as Pina Bausch and Merce Cunningham; plus the opportunity to see for the first time opera productions of Peter Grimes, The Makropoulus Case, and Julio Cesare must have opened the ears and eyes of many first generation EC Portuguese. There were setbacks, such as the cancellation of an exhibition by Portugal's leading artist, the London based Paula Rego, and a poorly received Carmen. Perhaps the biggest row was over the poor reception given to Wim Wenders' movie Lisbon Story. The city wanted the best European director to capture in fiction this significant moment in the history of Lisbon. Wenders was tempted with a budget reported to be in excess of Pounds 1m, but produced an over-long work which was as unimaginative as it was self-regarding. Shooting tourist Lisbon, he missed exciting developments such as the rediscovery of Lisbon's early 19th-century architectural grandeur in the 'Seventh Hill' sector. Lisbon worked as a city of culture because it gave a new angle on a little-known but fascinating capital. Lisbon is at its best when being itself, untouched by other-Europe: in the Museu dos Azulejos, attached to a spectacular convent with a church, in which secular 18th-century scenes of Lisbon in blue and white tiles compete with gilt baroque for wall space; and in the special exhibition of fado at the Museu de Etnologia. This describes how the spontaneous music of the street, the disregarded, despairing 19th-century voice of the brothels and the beggars, became gentrified as a tourist attraction in the 20th century. Its climax comes in a darkened room where the greatest fado singer of all, Amalia Rodrigues, sings of abandonment. It is a cultural experience of unrelenting power and passion, and quite a contrast to the formality which attaches itself to these cultural years. The statistical guru John Myerscough has evaluated the impact of cultural capitals. It is mixed: in Dublin only 5 per cent of those asked could remember an event they had attended; in Glasgow, 61 per cent of citizens voted it a success. Lisbon is happy that 48 per cent of the locals came down in favour; 32 per cent against. Capitals of culture are a good idea, but the idea alone is not enough. They need planning, a rationale, and money, too. They work best in over-looked cities like Lisbon.</p>

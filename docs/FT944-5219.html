			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Airport tube Heathrow airport's proposed Pounds 900m fifth terminal would be linked to the London Underground system. LU, together with Heathrow, has applied to the UK government for permission for a Pounds 70m extension of the Piccadilly Line, giving the airport its third tube station. The link would become operational in time for the terminal's proposed opening in 2002. The extension is likely to face strong opposition from local people.</p>

Sverdlovsk Oblast Deputies Want To Set Up `Urals Group' in  Federation Council"]    [Text] Eduard Rossel and Galina Karelova, Federation  Council deputies from Sverdlovsk Oblast, spoke to journalists in  Yekaterinburg on the results of the first meeting of the Russian  parliament's upper chamber.    Eduard Rossel said that he was astonished by the undisguised  pressure exerted on the deputies by the "top chiefs." The thing  is that on the morning before the vote 58 heads of  administration (they were lodged at the President Hotel, not the  "Rossiya") were invited to breakfast with Mr. Chernomyrdin,  where, to all appearances, they were given a directive to vote  for Vladimir Shumeyko. The same went for representatives of the  military-industrial sector, the deputy said. Given that 32  deputies from "Siberian Agreement," who had earlier decided to  vote for Mr. Romanov, general director of an association from  Krasnoyarsk, voted for Shumeyko, as a result the latter won by a  margin of eight or nine votes.    Galina Karelova, who was elected chairman of the Russian  Federation Council's social policy committee, sees the situation  somewhat differently.    "I think there was an element of persuasion," she told the  journalists, "but the voting was held by secret ballot, and  administration heads are exceptionally independent people who do  not seem to me very amenable to pressure from above. In  addition, Vladimir Shumeyko managed to impress the deputies: he  is very self- disciplined, restrained, and calm. He did not  leave an impression of a man lacking firm view or convictions."    Both Eduard Rossel and Galina Karelova spoke out for setting  up a deputy group comprising Federation Council members from the  Urals. Mr. Rossel plans to create it on the basis of the  Economic Cooperation Association of the Urals Region's Oblasts  and Republics. Ms. Karelova thinks that this group could operate  as a deliberative conference of deputies from the Urals that  would help them hold a joint, mutually advantageous stance in  parliament.</p>

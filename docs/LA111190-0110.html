			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSKIES DON'T KNOW WHAT HIT THEM;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON: CHANCES FOR NO. 1 GO UP IN SMOKE AGAINST UNDERDOG UCLA.  </P> <P> Greg Lewis sat motionless, his face fixed in a blank expression, then started  listing everything the Washington Huskies had just lost on a gray, windy  Saturday. He could have used a calculator.  </P> <P> "It really hurts," Lewis said, but he wasn't talking about his sore left knee,  the one covered with an ice bag. "We did lose, but I still feel we are one of  the best teams in the country. We just didn't play like it today."  </P> <P> The Huskies, the No. 2-ranked team in the nation, saw their hopes for a  national championship blown away by 21-point underdog UCLA, which pulled off an  improbable 25-22 upset before 71,925 at Husky Stadium.  </P> <P> Lewis gained only 50 yards, ending his streak of consecutive 100-yard games at  nine. He carried the ball only 12 times and played only parts of two quarters  after injuring his right knee in the second quarter.  </P> <P> "Going into halftime, I could barely walk," said Lewis, who felt his knee lock  after an 18-yard gain on a sweep when he was hit by UCLA free safety Eric  Turner.  </P> <P> "I couldn't plant my foot, cut or run with a lot of confidence," Lewis said. "I  wanted to continue to play, but Coach (Don) James had the team's best interests  at heart."  </P> <P> Lewis was on track to equal Marcus Allen's 1981 Pacific 10 Conference  one-season rushing record of 100 yards in every game, but he said the end of  his streak was not of primary importance.  </P> <P> "It doesn't really bother me as much as losing does," Lewis said.  </P> <P> For the Huskies, it was a monumental flop. Not only were they overwhelming  favorites, Washington would have remained in contention for a national  championship if Notre Dame faltered somewhere down the line.  </P> <P> The bottom line?  </P> <P> "Basically, it means our national championship dreams are dead," James said.  "That's what it means."  </P> <P> Washington had 146 yards rushing after averaging 254.7. The Huskies committed  three costly turnovers, including two interceptions by quarterback Mark  Brunell.  </P> <P> "Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong," cornerback Charles Mincy said.  "I don't know what to say. It's horrible."  </P> <P> James, however, knew what word to use. He picked "horrendous" to describe his  team's offensive show.  </P> <P> "If we couldn't get a running game going today, we had no chance the way we  were throwing the ball and catching it," James said.  </P> <P> Brunell competed only 10 of 34 passes for 137 yards, and his pass intended for  Mario Bailey that Eric Turner intercepted set up UCLA's winning drive at  midfield.  </P> <P> "What can you say?" Brunell said. "It's disappointing. Our chances for a  national championship are gone now. We've got just to bounce back now, I  guess."  </P> <P> James, who after the game instructed his players to give credit to UCLA,said  there was no clue in practices during the week that the Huskies would fall flat  with so much riding on the outcome of one game.  </P> <P> "First of all, it wasn't a very good day to play offense, but they played  better than we did," James said. "We didn't have much of a running game and we  had a horrendous passing game. But we live up here, we practice in it, so  there's no excuse about the weather."  </P> <P> The Huskies were reeling from the time Brian Brown broke loose for an 88-yard  touchdown run five minutes into the game. On that play, James said his defense  got caught sending its linebackers and free safety Tommie Smith on a blitz on  third and short yardage.  </P> <P> Once Brown crossed the line of scrimmage, he was gone. Little did the Huskies  know, so were their title hopes.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it was," Mincy said. "We just played flat."  </P> <P> Until Saturday, Washington had been flattening people in the Pac-10. The  Huskies led virtually every offensive and defensive category: rushing offense,  rushing defense, total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring  defense.  </P> <P> They were 8-1 overall, 6-0 in the conference and had their sights set on No. 1.  </P> <P> "We had the opportunity, but we let it slip away," Lewis said. "Maybe we will  take our frustrations out on Washington State. Yeah, I guess that's all we can  do now."  </P> <P> James sipped a soft drink and sat by himself. In 16 years at Washington, this  was his second legitimate shot at a national championship, the other in 1984  when the Huskies finished 11-1, beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl and still  finished No. 2 behind Brigham Young.  </P> <P> "You know, we read a lot of nice things about us last week," James said. "All  that talk about the national championship. Maybe the more good things you hear,  the softer you get and the more people get prepared to play you."  </P></p>

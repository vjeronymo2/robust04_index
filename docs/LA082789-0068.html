			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two Hungarians who took part in a Prague protest on the 21st anniversary of the  Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia were ordered by a district court in the  capital to stand trial. The decision to try Tamas Deutsch and Gyorgy Kerenyi  came after a prosecutor demanded that they be punished for violating public  order. The two were among a group of Hungarian activists who on Monday unfurled  a banner proclaiming "The Bolsheviks Came With Tanks, We Come With Flowers."  Thousands of Czechoslovaks cheered their action before police charged the  crowds and arrested 320 Czechs and 56 foreigners, including other Hungarians,  Poles, Italians and Dutch.  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Car sales rise of 4% forecast UK NEW CAR sales are expected to rise by 4 per cent to 5 per cent next year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. This would mean a 1994 total of 1.85m, after an increase of more than 11 per cent this year to between 1.77m and 1.78m. Motor industry leaders warned, however, that the economic recovery remained fragile and needed 'nurturing'. They expressed concern that any significant increase in taxation in the Budget later this month would halt the recovery in its tracks. 'The last thing we need as an industry or as an economy is a greater tax burden,' said Mr Geoffrey Whalen, SMMT president and managing director of Peugeot Talbot. In spite of the rise in domestic demand, most carmakers in the UK had been forced to cut production because of the steep fall in new car sales in mainland Europe. The drop in west European car demand had caused 100,000 cars to be lost from UK production schedules, Mr Whalen said. UK car output was still expected to rise to 1.35m this year - its highest level since the mid-1970s - from 1.29m in 1992, mainly because of the substantial capacity added by the Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda. Output next year was expected to reach about 1.45m. Marketing campaigns are also expected to increase in intensity. 'With the markets in continental Europe still suffering, manufacturers across the Channel are switching their attention to Britain in an effort to keep up their own production,' the SMMT said.</p>

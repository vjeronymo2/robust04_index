			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Demand for life policies shifts SALES OF single-premium life assurance and pension products grew sharply in the fourth quarter of last year while annual-premium business shrank, the latest figures from the Association of British Insurers show, Norma Cohen writes. Over the year single-premium business - in which policyholders make a one-off lump-sum investment - rose 29 per cent to Pounds 13.4bn while annual-premium business fell 4 per cent to Pounds 2.97bn. In the fourth quarter single premiums rose 16 per cent while annual premiums fell 13 per cent. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the association, said single-premium business had received a strong boost from policyholders investing redundancy money as well as from building society depositors switching to life policies as interest rates fell. He added: 'I don't think we will see growth in annual commitments for some time. It's not just the slowdown in the housing market but the fact that we need a pick-up in consumer confidence,' he said. Annual premiums have suffered because of fears about employment prospects.</p>

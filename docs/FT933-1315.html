			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Birkdale launches second rights issue to fund buy BIRKDALE Group, involved in advertising, public relations and marketing, is making a second rights issue in four months to help pay for an acquisition, writes Nigel Clark. It also announced the disposal of Lewis Broadbent, an advertising agency, and losses for the year to March 31 of Pounds 1.94m (profits Pounds 202,000). It is issuing 39.6m shares on a 1-for-1 basis at 8p to raise a net Pounds 2.78m. Of that Pounds 1.45m will form the cash element of the initial payment for M&amp;K Design-In-Store with the balance providing additional working capital and repay borrowings. M&amp;K, which provides marketing and design services, is being bought for an initial Pounds 2.7m and further results-related payments to a maximum Pounds 800,000. The balance of the initial payment will be satisfied in shares. Birkdale shares fell 2p to 12p. M&amp;K reported operating profits of Pounds 357,000 (Pounds 460,000) for the year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.23m). Lewis Broadbent is being sold to Martin Butler Associates for Pounds 127,000, including the repayment of intercompany debt. In the year to March 31 Lewis incurred a loss of Pounds 830,000 on Pounds 1.86m turnover. Turnover fell from Pounds 21.2m to Pounds 19.7m. Losses per share were 9.7p (1.5p earnings). The final dividend is passed (0.2p), there being insufficient distributable reserves. When the company raised Pounds 1.95m through a placing and open offer in June it said that the cash element of the M&amp;K purchase would be met from existing resources. However, the delay in two expected subsidiary sales and the continuing poor trading conditions resulted in the need for further strengthening of the balance sheet.</p>

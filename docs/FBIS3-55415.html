Brazauskas declared this to the Russian service of  Lithuanian  national radio, which he visited on Thursday together with Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius.    Brazauskas underlined that this political move should not be  viewed as an intention "to change or to toughen relations with  Russia and other states." In his words, leaders of all European  countries should have reached an agreement on creation of "a  single security umbrella."    Slezevicius added that "Lithuania's orientation towards the  West does not represent any innovation in our foreign policy"  and integration into the European security system, such as NATO,  "would be a premise for stabilizing the situation in the  region, and this is important both for Lithuania and all  neighboring states."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Xu Yang: "Call for Moderation on Nukes"] </F>   [Excerpt] China favours a "moderately-worded and  constructive" presidential statement from the UN Security  Council on the Korean nuclear issue, a spokesman for the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday.    China has said it cannot approve the UN Security Council  resolution on the issue and believes patient dialogue is the  best way to handle the crisis.    Wu said the government firmly supports a presidential  statement, adding that exerting pressure will only heighten  tensions.    He also said that ROK President Kim Yong-sam's recent visit  to China was "very successful."    During his visit, leaders of both countries called for more  cooperation, particularly in trade.    Both sides also agreed that:    -- Maintenance of peace and stability in the Korean  Peninsula  is essential.    -- A settlement must be reached through dialogue.    -- Increased tension and world pressure must be avoided.    Wu said China opposed any action that might jeopardize peace  and stability' in the region, including military exercises or  the deployment of Patriot missiles.    China would continue to develop friendly relations with both  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and ROK on the  basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.

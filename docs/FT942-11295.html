			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Cabinet approves Euro-manifesto The cabinet yesterday gave its stamp of approval to the Conservative manifesto for the European elections. In what was seen as a victory for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, over the party's hardline Euro-sceptics, the manifesto won unanimous approval from senior ministers. Mr Hurd will develop one of the key themes of the manifesto - the case for a wider, decentralised European Union, in a speech in Warsaw later this evening. In what is being billed as the first of a series of speeches on Britain's European agenda for the second half of the 1990s, he will press the case for enlargement of the European Union to include the former Communist states of eastern Europe.</p>

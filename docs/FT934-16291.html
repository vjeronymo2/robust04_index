			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / MoD official reveals details of secret unit A SENIOR Ministry of Defence official yesterday gave details to the Scott inquiry of a previously highly secretive Whitehall committee which was set up to control intelligence on sensitive defence exports to Iraq. According to documents made available to the Scott inquiry, the committee handled highly sensitive information relating to defence exports that the inquiry wishes to see. Mr Ian McDonald, head of the MoD's Defence Exports Services Secretariat, was asked what he knew about the Restricted Enforcement Unit which was set up in 1987 to supervise intelligence flowing between government departments. He said he had set up the unit together with Mr Eric Beston, a senior official at the Department of Trade and Industry, who ran the export licensing system. The unit was intended to 'supplement' rather than to 'take the place' of other Whitehall committees, he said. 'We thought it would be a good idea to have a small group of people who knew each other, who had worked with each other, and who could share information without letting it spread,' Mr McDonald told the inquiry. The unit - drawn from Customs and Excise, and members of M15 and its sister intelligence agency SIS - consisted of 15 to 20 people. Information was discussed in sessions restricted to few people and in premises that had been 'swept for bugs', Mr McDonald said. The existence of the unit first became known publicly during the trial last year of three executives of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands-based machine tools manufacturer. Copies of minutes of the unit's meetings carrying Whitehall's security classification 'secret - UK eyes only' were released only after a judge overruled an attempt by government ministers to suppress the documents on grounds of national interest. Mr McDonald is due to give further evidence to the inquiry today.</p>

It is uncertain,  though, that it wants something fundamentally different," Laszlo  Surjan, chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party  (KDNP) and welfare minister, told a rally marking the beginning  of his party's electoral campaign today.    The chairman of the smallest party of the governing  coalition  said the Christian Democrats rejected Prime Minister Peter  Boross's statement that the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) is  the only force able to govern the country. "We consider  ourselves fit for the task," Surjan said. He added, however,  that the Christian Democrats stand the closest to the MDF.    Outlining the priorities of the KDNP's electoral manifesto,  Surjan said that the Christian Democrats pressed for a  calculable legislature, and wished to guarantee a safe and  calculable future for the people.    Making a critical approach to the past four years, the KDNP  chairman said the state had got rid of its oversized tasks too  quickly and left society unprepared to face a multitude of  problems. The Christian Democrats wish that the state should  assume responsibility for, rather than intervene in, the  economy. "We want to have a strong rule of law and stable  public security," Surjan said.</p>

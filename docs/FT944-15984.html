			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar woes The dollar yesterday sunk to within reach of its 1994 low against the D-Mark as bearish sentiment continued to dog the US currency, writes Philip Gawith. No clear message emerged from the trifecta of important data released - retail sales, consumer inflation and capacity utilisation - but short term traders still sold the dollar. In London it touched a low of DM1.5175 - compared to a low for the year of DM1.5165 on July 12 - before closing at DM1.5201 from DM1.5423. Against the yen, it finished at Y98.285 from Y99.91 Elsewhere the D-Mark was stronger, helped by the weaker dollar and the expectation that Chancellor Kohl will triumph in Sunday's national election. It finished at L1,020 against the lira, from L1,016, and at FFr3.428, from FFr3.424, against the French franc. Sterling was a victim of the stronger D-Mark, slipping more than 1 1/2 pfennigs to a close of DM2.4207 from DM2.4386. Analysts remain pessimistic about the dollar's prospects. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, noted that the dollar was also close to lows against the Swiss franc, and this was often a useful leading indicator for the dollar against the D-Mark. 'If it can't go up against the Swiss franc, it certainly isn't going to go up against the D-Mark,' said Mr MacKinnon. He cautioned, however, against reading too much into the movement. 'Volumes are thin and the price action continues to be dominated by shorter term players. The fund managers continue to stand on the sidelines. They are unwilling net sellers of the dollar against the D-Mark.' Mr MacKinnon said the market remained broadly neutral on the dollar against the D-Mark. 'There is no indication that fund managers are going short of the dollar yet.' He said that with late German opinion polls showing the election promised to be a close affair, 'D-Mark bullishness may have to be curbed.' He said the dollar was probably at the bottom end of its recent DM1.52/1.58 trading range, rather than about to touch new lows. Mr MacKinnon was less sanguine about the outlook for the dollar against the yen. He said there were a number of prominent investors with 'very large' long dollar positions against the yen. If the yen continues to rise, forcing these positions to be liquidated to cut losses, the dollar's fall will only be accelerated. Citibank is holding by its view of further yen appreciation - to Y95 over three months, and Y90 in a year. The futures markets lost some of their recent momentum, with the December short sterling contract closing at 93.59, from 93.62. The top discount rate at the weekly tender of 91-day treasury bills fell to 5.4349 per cent, from 5.4951 per cent. Analysts said this reflected the market's increasing conviction that UK interest rates might not rise again this year. The Bank of England yesterday cleared a Pounds 1.1bn shortage in UK money markets, at established rates, with Pounds 1.112bn of assistance. Some leading German banks will open tomorrow afternoon to provide clients with a service from the time the first election results emerge. A victory for Chancellor Kohl is heavily discounted in the market, though opinion polls show the result is likely to be close. The Finnish markka was steady, trading at around FM3.09 against the D-Mark ahead of Sunday's referendum on EU membership. A 'yes' vote is expected.</p>

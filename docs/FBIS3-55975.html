The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told on the phone  by the press service of the headquarters of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Defense Army that in the afternoon, two assault aircraft tried  to bomb Stepanakert, but after response actions by Karabakh  antiaircraft forces, they were forced to leave the airspace of  Nagorno-Karabakh. But today the Azeri forces' offensive on most  sections of the front continued.    According to a report by the press service of the military  department, on Tuesday evening [11 January], subunits of the  Karabakh Defense Army repulsed all attacks and maneuvered  successfully, managing to surround a group of the Azeri Army in  the area of the village of Akop Kamari in the north of  Mardakertskiy [Mardakert] Rayon. Forty-six Azeri soldiers were  killed and control was reestablished over a number of heights  previously seized by the enemy. In the course of repulsing the  attacks on other sections of the front, three infantry companies  (up to 270 men and officers) of the Azeri National Army were  destroyed, mainly by well-aimed artillery fire.    The Karabakh side's losses amounted to six killed and 15  wounded.</p>

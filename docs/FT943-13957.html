			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Spreadsheet simplicity: Computing Do not assume that spreadsheets are only for serious number-crunchers: they are the simplest type of personal database available. Once you understand how a spreadsheet package works you will find it useful for all sorts of tasks. Invoices and statements. For accounting, the spreadsheet will make all the calculations automatically, including 17.5 per cent VAT. Quotations for jobs. If you issue quotations you can produce them on a spreadsheet, then amend them into an invoice once the job is done. A sales or purchases daybook. Your spreadsheet can also be used to analyse invoices into total, VAT, stock, telephone, fax, rent etc, automatically adding up and cross-casting the columns. Cashflow and Sales forecast. Spreadsheets are handy for forecasting cash and profitability. Type anticipated weekly or monthly cash receipts and expenses into a cashflow forecast and the spreadsheet will automatically calculate the running balance on a bank account - or enter the number of units you expect to sell and the spreadsheet will calculate monthly income and gross profit. Of my own 200-odd spreadsheets, the great majority are simple lists, all of which can easily be amended and a fresh copy printed. The main benefit of these lists is that they pull together a large amount of information into one place. Virtually every one is in condensed print, so I can fit 132 characters across the page. Contacts list. In such a spreadsheet, the column headings might be 'company name', 'contact', 'phone no', and 'comments'. With about 60 lines per computer page I can get 60 contacts and telephone numbers into a single page of printout. Product price list. Perhaps the most important list for any company. Record on your spreadsheet the part number, description, cost price and selling price of each product you sell. It is easy to keep the price list up to date as prices and products change. When stocktaking, type in the quantity counted of each product, then multiply by the cost price field for an instant year-end stock valuation. Foreign currency. For example, if your base prices are in sterling and you need to convert to D-Marks, the spreadsheet will automatically apply the latest exchange rate. Importing / Property / Portfolio valuation. A spreadsheet is ideal in importing, for converting prices into sterling and working out the landed cost. In the property business, multiply the square footage of each building by the latest insurance or rental rates per square foot to calculate annual insurance cost or rental income. If you own shares, enter the name of each security and the number held into a spreadsheet, then enter the share price each week to calculate your current portfolio valuation. Then enter the Inland Revenue's latest indexation factor to work out capital gains tax liability. Retail businesses. Shop owners unsure how to use a conventional sales ledger such as Sage, should forget sales ledgers which deal in credit sales. Instead, they should use a spreadsheet to reconcile cash takings with the till roll each day. Add up the totals each month, then divide the till roll total by 1.175 to work out VAT. Then post as a single journal direct to the nominal ledger. Daily till roll sales by department. Another retail application. The columns of the spreadsheet would be the days of the week; the rows would be the departments ('food', 'confectionery', etc). Enter the departmental totals each day from the till roll and the spreadsheet will add up the total weekly sales by department. With a conventional spreadsheet package you would create separate spreadsheets for each week and would end up with 52 by the year end. Three dimensional spreadsheets. A 3-D spreadsheet can consolidate all 52 into one spreadsheet, tucking them in one behind the other and allowing you to flip quickly from viewing one week's sales to the next. Which spreadsheet do you buy? You may find that the Excel or Lotus 1-2-3, are more than you will ever use and that an integrated package such as MicroSoft Works is more suitable (Pounds 84 by mail order from Guardian Computing, 0753-516959, Dos or Windows). For retailers, the best 3-D spreadsheet package is Borland's Quattro Pro 5.0 for Dos (Pounds 38, also from Guardian). Its manual (page 48) contains an excellent tutorial showing how to set up a daily expenses analysis.</p>

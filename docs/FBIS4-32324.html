			<p>BFN     [Text] A Turkish military delegation led by Deputy Defense  Minister General Toman Erkan arrived in Albania today. General  Erkan was received by Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, who  welcomed him and wished him a pleasant stay in Albania.    Then a meeting was held, in which Minister Zhulali appraised  the relations and cooperation between the two countries in the  field of defense and paid tribute to Turkey's contribution to  the education and training of personnel, as well as its  assistance in various fields.    Mr. Zhulali went on to stress that, in view of its  modernization and Partnership for Peace, our army requires more  help and stronger support in the fields of communication, food,  medicine, the military industry, etc.    For his part, after conveying greetings from the Turkish  defense minister to Zhulali, General Erkan confirmed that Turkey  would help the Albanian Army in accordance with the bilateral  agreement. The cooperation and support that we render to the  Albanian Army, he said, is a question of mutual assistance.

In addition to other activities, the Turkish military  delegation held working meetings with Lieutenant General Ilia  Vasho, chief of the Army General Staff, Deputy Defense Minister  Bashkim Shehu, and other top officials to pinpoint possible  avenues for greater assistance to the Albanian Army.</p>

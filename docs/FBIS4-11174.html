			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis is in  Chiapas. He says he will not meet with PRI candidate Ernesto  Zedillo, that the dialogue with the Zapatist National Liberation  Army [EZLN] is still open, and that significant agreements could  be reached soon.    Messages of concurrence between the EZLN and the government  continue to be released. This will enable an announcement of  progress in the Chiapas peace accords very soon, Camacho Solis  said.    [Begin Camacho recording] Through the mediator, I have  received an EZLN communique from from which I am able to report  the following:    1) the EZLN's clear determination to maintain a cease-fire;    2) the certainty that channels of dialogue with the EZLN  are fully open; and    3) the EZLN's awareness that the government has issued  messages of harmony backed by evidence in the past few days.    This prompts us to reactivate this form of communication,  which has proved so effective. [end recording]    Asked on whether he would meet with PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo, who  initiated his political campaign in this state, Camacho said  this:    [Begin Camacho recording] It is also important for the  commissioner to remain politically impartial, so the  negotiations can reflect a national consensus rather than the  position of one, two, or three political forces. [end recording]    Camacho said that he will continue to seek the consensus of  all political forces in the country regarding the Chiapas  conflict and that the solution to the problem must come from a  true national agreement.</p>

E.": "The Czech Army Does Not Shop in </F> Vlasim"]    [Text] Vlasim--Yesterday, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys  festively launched the production of the newly developed NATO  5.56 x 45-mm cartridges at the Vlasim enterprise Sellier &amp;  Bellot. This cartridge is standard issue in the NATO member  countries, and we are the first former socialist country to  produce something like that. The Vlasim enterprise used to  supply ammunition to the Czechoslovak Army, but the shipments  completely stopped after 1989.    To the question of where the Czech Army gets its ammunition  now, if not in the Czech arms factories, Minister Baudys replied  that our oversize Army has a large stockpile of ammunition and  is gradually using it up. It is necessary also for the sake of  expediency--many of the older cartridges will not fit future  modern equipment. "If the Czech Army will have arms of this  caliber, one that is used by NATO, it will certainly purchase  its ammunition in Vlasim," the defense minister added.    Sellier &amp; Bellot is a stockholding company privatized  in the  first wave of coupon privatization. The company has not made  use of the originally considered stock reserved for a foreign  partner and recommended that the shares be placed in the second  wave of coupon privatization. It has successfully made up for  the decline in domestic demand by exports. "Today, we do not  need foreign capital, although the munitions business is not as  lucrative as people believe," said the chairman of the board of  the stockholding company, Jiri Hanak.</p>

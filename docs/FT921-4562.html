			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / The economics of a Democratic victory: America It would be a mistake to exaggerate the economic merits of Governor Bill Clinton and former Senator Paul Tsongas, the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination. But if either ended up in the White House, the US economic outlook could brighten noticeably. After a decade of divided government, control of Congress and the White House by the same party would offer great advantages. In recent years, crippling federal deficits have partly reflected deep disagreements over the appropriate level of taxes and spending. Given full accountability, either party would probably have made a better fist of fiscal policy. Unified government would also allow the development of a coherent longer-term strategy for economic growth, something which political divisions, as much as political ideology, have made impossible. The merits of the leading Democrats are best compared by examining their stance on three key issues neglected by the Republicans: The need to increase the US national savings rate by converting budget deficits into surpluses and eliminating fiscal incentives for consumption and borrowing. The need to address rapid increases in income and wealth inequalities that are threatening social harmony. The need to improve industrial performance, for example by lengthening the time horizons of managers and improving training and education. On the deficit, Mr Tsongas offers the greatest hope of progress. Courageously rejecting conventional wisdom in Washington, he has built his campaign around opposition to income tax cuts. On the stump, his case for fiscal responsibility is reduced to a few short phrases: 'I'm not Santa Claus. We're adults. Just tell us the truth. We can handle it.' In his 86-page pamphlet, A Call to Economic Arms, he calls for a steady increase in petrol taxes towards international levels and discusses the merits of real cuts in entitlement programmes such as health care and pensions. Given such candour, it is surprising he is still in the race. Mr Clinton is less convincing on the deficit, although he does promise to restrain government spending to no more than the rate of economic growth. But he comes into his own on the 'fairness issue', arguing for a 10 per cent tax cut for middle-income Americans to be paid for by higher taxes on families earning more than Dollars 200,000 a year. If you instinctively bristle at plans for more redistribution, consider what has happened in America. As the New York Times reported last week, pre-tax incomes of the top 1 per cent rose 77 per cent in real terms between 1977 and 1989. The top fifth saw incomes rise 29 per cent. Everybody else did badly: the second, third, fourth and bottom fifths saw real income gains of 9 per cent, 4 per cent, minus 1 per cent and minus 9 per cent respectively. After allowing for taxes, the top 1 per cent has pocketed an amazing 60 per cent of the total increase in income over the period. The top 5 per cent gained 74 per cent of the increase; the bottom 80 per cent a mere 6 per cent. You do not have to be a socialist to believe that some rejigging of the tax burden is overdue. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas have something to offer on the third issue - improving industrial performance. Mr Clinton has focused mainly on improving worker skills through better education and training. He deserves great credit for stressing the importance of a national apprenticeship programme for non-college bound youths - a group central to economic performance yet long ignored by much of the educational establishment. He also favours national exams to raise school standards and radical measures to make higher education more affordable for the middle classes. Mr Tsongas makes encouraging, if conventional, noises on education. But he comes alive when discussing ways to strengthen America's manufacturing base, including industrial policies. He infuriates many liberal Democrats by advocating lower capital gains taxes on long-term equity investment, and arguing that the party must pay more attention to the 'original act - the creation of national wealth'. Yet while criticised for being aggressively pro-business, he is far from an uncritical believer in market forces. 'Adam Smith was a marvellous man but he wouldn't know a superconductor or memory chip if he tripped over one,' he says. He regards the post-war success of Japan as proof that intelligent government intervention can help. He sees an industrial policy as less an alternative to the market than a means of improving on it, especially in high technology where huge investments are required. He advocates strategic investments in emerging technologies, a modernisation of anti-trust laws to permit more joint ventures, and efforts to lengthen the time horizons of managers, for example by scrapping quarterly financial returns. By stressing fairness, Mr Clinton is attracting strong support from blacks and poorly educated blue-collar workers. Mr Tsongas's blunter message about the importance of wealth creation is playing well with white-collar Democrats and, one suspects, many moderate Republicans. Neither can be dismissed as an old-style 'tax and spend' Democrat. With the support of Congress, either would probably do more to raise national savings, heal social divisions and address structural economic failings than a second Bush administration. There is little to fear economically - and possibly much to gain - from a Democratic victory in November.</p>

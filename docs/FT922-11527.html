			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Observer: Boy George When Graeme Gilchrist, Union Discount's former boss, left in February after unveiling hefty losses, a first stab at mending fences was the arrival, as joint deputy chairman, of Sir George Blunden, highly respected former deputy governor of the Bank of England. Now George Blunden junior, who has been running S G Warburg's discount operation, turns up as chief executive. Do not assume it was merely the name. Central banking relationships have their uses - as John and James, two of BoE governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton's five sons, respectively at Smith New Court and Warburgs, would attest. But it seems that Blunden, earlier the bright boy at Seccombe Marshall &amp; Campion, quickly earned himself the reputation at Warburgs as being too big for the job. He apparently understands the market, is tough - but his route to the top, including three years' community work with the London Adventure Playground Association, is hardly the most conventional. Sir George resigns because he feels it is 'inappropriate to remain following the appointment of his son'. Young Blunden may be an excellent choice and even if it sounds a touch nepotistic, discount houses always have been rather odd animals.</p>

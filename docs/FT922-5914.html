			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Italians may buy Del Monte Foods NEGOTIATIONS are under way for the sale of Del Monte Foods, the US tinned foods group formerly part of RJR Nabisco, to Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment (C&amp;P), the Italian financial concern trying to create a new international operation in the foods sector. Some industry sources said a preliminary agreement could be ready for signing next month but others suggested that the deal was not so advanced. A Dollars 300m price tag was put on Del Monte in an Italian newspaper report yesterday but the full price, including assumption of debt, seems likely to be significantly higher if a deal goes ahead. Under the broad outlines of the deal, confirmed by C&amp;P yesterday, the Italian company would take control of Del Monte through the transfer of its recently-acquired Cica tinned foods subsidiary in Brazil, as well as the purchase of a direct stake. Part of the enlarged Del Monte group would then be floated in the US. Del Monte Foods was created in 1988 after the leveraged buy-out of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out specialists, as one of four divisions of the original Del Monte company, which had been acquired in 1978 by R. J. Reynolds. In 1990, Del Monte Foods, based in California, went through a further change of ownership after a Dollars 1.54bn Merrill Lynch-backed management buy-out. Since then, further disposals have taken place. However, sales for the San Francisco-based business amounted to Dollars 1.4bn last year. C&amp;P denied that a planned L250bn (Dollars 206m) bond issue was also destined to finance the transaction. The Italian company, headed by Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former chief executive of the Ferruzzi group, was set up in early 1991 with L450bn in launch capital. Its aim is to establish three international areas of operation in the foods, detergents and packaging sectors. Acquisitions so far have concentrated on packaging. In March 1991, it took a majority stake in Lawson Mardon, the Canadian packaging group, and six months later bought 50 per cent of the Ja-Mont paper joint venture. The purchase of Cica late last year was its first venture on the foods side. C&amp;P has been negotiating with Del Monte's management and owners for some months, and is now thought to be the only company in the running to buy the company, which is now owned by a consortium including management and Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank.</p>

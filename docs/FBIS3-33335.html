De Leon Carpio said: In line with the situation Guatemala is  facing, I will not commute the death penalty if it is applied  against kidnappers. The appeal for commuting the death sentence  is unfair in this case. Kidnapping is one of the most abhorrent  crimes and it must not go unpunished. I am ready to present a  draft bill to Congress to reform the Penal Code and the law.    He added: We are preparing a draft bill that contributes to  stopping the wave of kidnappings unleashed in Guatemala -- a  bill that would prove to be a high risk element for those who  commit this crime.    Meanwhile, Jose Gutierrez, president of the Chamber of  Industry of Guatemala, stated that the security issue has become  a major concern of all Guatemalans, adding that slayings,  kidnappings, and assaults have grown to frightful levels.    "The destruction of the national infrastructure has surfaced  once more; again we are living amid the chaos of insecurity and  terrorism, which have harshly struck the Guatemalan family, the  economy, and the contry's stability," the industrialist remarked.    In his speech, the president of the Republic said the role  of  his government is focused on laying the foundations for changing  our country through appropriate measures that will permit  national development.    De Leon Carpio stressed the need to share responsibilities,  because the future of Guatemala is a duty of all citizens,  government, businessmen, union members, cooperative members, and  other sectors. The Great National Accord establishes the goal  of achieving governability [gobernabilidad] without resorting to  force.    President de Leon invited the Chamber of Industry to form a  delegation to accompany him to Mexico. In Mexico, De Leon will  conduct economic talks designed to benefit industry and the  population in the wake of NAFTA's going into force in January.    Finally, the president explained that he will soon appoint a  Guatemalan ammbassador to GATT, because this is of vital  importance to the economic and productive development of the  country.  <H5>  Industrialists Undertake Path of National Rescue </H5>   Juan Jose Gutierrez affirmed: We industrialists view  President de Leon as a capable and honest man with the  sufficient determination and moral capacity to change the course  the country is following. We are confident the president is  ready to make the necessary decisions and implement the  necessary measures, no matter how difficult they may be.  Guatemalan industry supports De Leon and is at his side to  begin the long path of national rescue -- a task we deem to be  the responsibility of all Guatemalans.    Gutierrez added: A country can achieve development through a  process of industrialization. As Guatemalan businessmen, we  clearly understand our role and commitment to Guatemala. Our  sector is making long-term plans; it is carrying out large  productive investments and capital investments. It generates a  significant amount of jobs and has the most skilled workforce in  the country.    The industrialist added: We sometimes have criticized the  government and listed our demands, but we also have made  specific proposals to resolve the nation's problems. A  macroeconomic policy is necessary to promote productive  investments instead of speculative investments, as well as to  generate healthy and sustained growth. This will permit us to  make up the great amount of the time we have lost. Our economy  is tainted and distorted by corruption, the large fiscal  deficit, high interest rates, the foreign debt, the  concentration of foreign currency, and the subsidizing of the  exchange rate.    According to Gutierrez, foreign trade requires special and  responsible treatment. Trade policies have to be guided to go  hand in hand with achieving the highest levels of productivity  and competitiveness. As a country we must avoid being run over  commercially due to nonreciprocity in our trade relations with  other countries, Gutierrez stressed.    The country's infrastructure network is very weak,  especially  in areas such as energy, telecommunications, roads, ports, and  airports. These problems compete directly against the country's  efficiency, productivity, and development possibilities. The  solution, as we have said before, is to do away with the  monopoly of these services and allow free competition to make  them efficient and profitable, he said.    The CIG president said that contraband has become one of the  biggest stumbling blocks for national production. Without  strong and effective actions against this crime, many industries  and businesses have no hope of surviving in the market for much  longer.    The labor outlook is dismal due to the high rates of  unemployment and underemployment, which can only be fought by  creating conditions that restore confidence to investors and  encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, he concluded.  <H5>  Effort and Commitment, Requirements To Be Guatemalan </H5>   According to the Commitment 1994 video exhibited during the  meeting between the president and the industrialists, "today  more than ever, everyone's efforts and commitments are  necessary, because if we are going to call ourselves  Guatemalans, we must justify this." The documentary highlights  the importance of improving Guatemalans' quality of life through  an efficient program that directs public investments and  expenditures toward the reduction of problems in education,  health, and security. It suggests implementing a decentralized  and regionalized education program and increasing construction  of housing and latrines in poor villages in the area of health  to define basic sanitation programs.    The economic aspect is dealt with by the documentary in a  detailed fashion, stating that Guatemala needs sustained,  accelerated economic growth, which is achieved through fiscal,  monetary, exchange, and credit policies that encourage real and  productive investments, generating health and sustained  employment.    The documentary stresses the need to repay the public debt  in  advance in order to eliminate excess circulating currency. The  authorities should privatize public utilities, improve tax  collection, modernize customs services by decentralizing them in  order to eliminate corruption, and rationalize public  expenditures.    Regarding exchange policies, the documentary says that  foreign exchange concentration should be eliminated and that the  market should be allowed to set the exchange rates. A foreign  trade and long term investment policy must be defined to allow  successful entry into the international market. To this avail,  specific funds should be assigned within the government's budget  which will permit the negotiation of free trade treaties.    As for competitiveness, it is necessary to improve the  infrastructure. At a Central American level we must promote a  0-percent tariff on raw materials and capital assets.    In view of the demands to form trade blocs, it supports the  idea of being competitive by guiding the technical training of  workers toward greater productivity and efficiency, which means  reorganization of the Intecap [Technical Institute for Training  and Productivity] is necessary. It also states that breaking up  the monopoly of services provided by the Guatemalan Social  Security Institute is necessary.

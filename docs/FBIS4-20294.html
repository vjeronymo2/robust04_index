[Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur has apparently issued  no specific guidelines for his ministers to follow in European  councils. In prime ministerial circles, comments are heard --  although these are only preliminary thoughts, not decisions --  that the French Government's attitude will vary depending on the  positions adopted by those Italian ministers who happen to be  MSI [Italian Social Movement] members. If they advocate  neofascist positions, France should fight them, we are told, but  otherwise, EU rules include no provision for boycotting a  democratically elected government.    Although [former Socialist Culture Minister] Jack Lang  championed a boycott before the national convention of the  Socialist Party on 17 April, the party's leadership argued that  this position lacked realism. [Socialist Party Secretary  General] Michel Rocard felt the need to issue a press release  stating that the presence of neofascist ministers, should it be  confirmed, would be "a serious cause for concern." "The very  notion is unacceptable," he added. "Fifty years after World War  II, it is not possible to forget what became of Europe under  fascism and Nazism." The Socialist Party decided to start talks  with other European socialist and social democratic parties  "with a view to adopting a common position in European  institutions, especially at the European Parliament."    Charles Millon, president of the UDF [French Democratic  Union] group in the National Assembly, also mentioned the  prospect of an Italian government including neofascist  ministers. On 24 April on Radio J [private station], he said he  wished "that EU members would make it very clear to the  president of the Italian Republic that the government he is to  call to office (must be) devoted to the values of the European  civilization, that is, respect for human rights, for the  individual, and for democratic principles."    Mr. Millon added that should the values "still be fascist  values, which do not square with European philosophy (...),  there will be a major problem." "The EU is like wedlock; to be  married, the partners should have common social and political  views," he concluded. He has been so far the only UDF member to  take a stand on the issue.    At the RPR [Rally for the Republic], people close to  [National Assembly President] Philippe Seguin noted that Jacques  Chirac has had telephone conversations with Gianfranco Fini, the  former MSI national secretary and the founder of the National  Alliance; that Isere Deputy Richard Cazenave has attended the  founding conference of Mr. Fini's new party; and that [Interior  Minister] Charles Pasqua has said that he maintains a close  relationship with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi.  However, Mr. Seguin has never been shy of admitting that in his  eyes, "the only noteworthy party in Italy is the PDS"  (Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communist Party). And  neither has he tried to hide his affinity with Giorgio  Napolitano (PDS), the former speaker of the Italian House of  Representatives, who has now been replaced by Irene Pivetti  (Northern League).</p>

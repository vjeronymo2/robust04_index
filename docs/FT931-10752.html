			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FEARS of a rights issue in the banking sector led to a decline in stock index futures that was only curbed by a strong opening on Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract on the FT-SE started firmly at 2,877 and advanced on good buying, reaching 2,897 by around 10am. The contract had been expected to continue moving forward but around mid-morning speculation of a rights issue in the banking sector surfaced. This caused a retreat in March with sentiment also hurt by continuing worries in the food sector of an imposition of VAT on food. The early gains in New York, however, helped the contract claw back some of the earlier falls and March finished at 2,871, just ahead of Thursday's close, with turnover reaching 11,251 lots. The traded options saw business of 32,639 lots, down on Thursday's 43,859 lots. Some 7,027 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and among the stock options, GEC traded 4,118 contracts with Trafalgar House and Barclays also busy.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Adviser considers sale of Heron A full sale of Heron International is among the options being considered for a further restructuring at Mr Gerald Ronson's troubled property and trading group. UBS, the group's financial adviser, has sent out confidential information memoranda to interested parties. The bank is understood to favour a solution involving a new investor taking control, but not buying the whole group. The company is technically in default following the failure earlier this month to win approval for the deferral of more than Pounds 52m in interest payments. Creditors will meet again on May 4, when only two bondholders need to be present for a quorum. The new moves come only seven months after the group completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing. The recession in Spain has badly affected property values, leading Heron to ask for interest payments to be deferred. Meetings of senior and junior bondholders were adjourned earlier this month after failing to meet the necessary quorum, leaving creditors in confusion. The group had asked for deferral of more than Pounds 52m payments until the end of June, warning that it might otherwise be unable to continue trading. Receivership would follow a petition by 25 per cent of the bondholders. In contrast with the problems in Spain, Heron has made good progress with its disposal programme in the UK. It expects to receive Pounds 75m by the end of June  - Pounds 31m from the sale of Heron Homes and Pounds 44m from the sale of the Heron Suzuki motor distributor to Suzuki Motor Corporation. Under its complex banking arrangements it cannot use this cash to meet head office obligations. Some bondholders, while broadly supportive of continuing last summer's restructuring plan, are thought to be putting pressure on the banks to send some of the money upstream so that coupons can be paid. UBS is understood to believe that the core portfolio of Heron properties could be used as a vehicle for a sound European property company.</p>

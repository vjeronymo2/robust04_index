			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Montague told of loan plans says Royal Bank The Royal Bank of Scotland claims it held lengthy discussions over its Pounds 2.3m loan to Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook's founder and chief executive, and gave him one week's notice before issuing its bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy proceedings were revealed to Mr Montague by a shareholder's representative at Thursday's annual meeting, where he had been attacked for his excessive remuneration. Mr Montague appeared shaken by the news. He is adamant that he is not in financial difficulties, and had no forewarning of the bank's move. He has retained the support of Tiphook's own bankers and Mr Ian Clubb, its newly-appointed chairman. Both confirmed that their commitment to the group was unaffected by Mr Montague's personal financial position. However, if he were to be declared bankrupt, he would have to step down from the board which has declared that he is key to its survival. The loan is understood to be linked to Mr Montague's farming businesses in Oxfordshire. It appears that changes in the terms of the loan had been under negotiation for some time. Mr Montague has sold his Highland cattle breeding activities due to high costs. But with homes in Oxfordshire and Knightsbridge, London and a notoriously-high salary, he was always considered a man of substantial means. The petition was announced by Mr Paul Snook, an accountant with Buchler Phillips, who said he was acting as proxy for Lehman Brothers, and had learnt of the moves through standard enquiries. It appears that Mr Snook also held a proxy on behalf of Ms Carole Ritchie, as a representative of Pickering Kenyon solicitors, who are retained legal advisers to the plaintiffs in the US class action against Tiphook. Mr Montague has six weeks to resolve his differences.</p>

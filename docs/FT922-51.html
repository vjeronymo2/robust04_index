			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories open fresh battles on Europe  -Government facing further party wrangling during EC presidency PRIME MINISTER John Major's dogged defence yesterday of his government's stance at the Lisbon summit signalled a new round of trench warfare in the Conservative party's internal wrangling over Europe. Both in the Commons chamber and outside there was clear evidence that the whips had been at work, although less with the thumbscrews than with the firm hand on the shoulder. Last night opponents of the Maastricht treaty sought to dramatise comments reportedly made to a backbench Tory committee by Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, that Denmark might not take up the EC presidency, after the UK, in January. With some Conservative MPs interpreting that as a sign of Britain wanting to punish the Danes, the Foreign Office issued a statement saying it had 'heard nothing' from Denmark to suggest it would not become president. But, aware on both sides of the European battlefield that the latest phase in the civil war is destined to be a long campaign, even well known Euro-sceptic MPs were keeping some of their powder dry. While one described as 'ludicrous' Mr John Major's reported hint of resignation if the Maastricht terms were not agreed, he went on to concede that Mrs Margaret Thatcher's weekend outburst had also been 'over the top'. Another long-time supporter of the former prime minister argued that a clash of personalities between Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major was not one that opponents of Maastricht could hope to win. 'She would be better advised to take up gardening,' he said. The Euro-sceptics of the new intake also appeared to have tempered their opinions markedly as the mood has changed. Mr Bernard Jenkin, the 32-year-old MP for Colchester North, merely expressed surprise at the uproar that her television interview had provoked. 'Her views are well known and consistent,' he commented. 'If they are so wrong they will be ignored.' In the Commons chamber, it was almost exclusively the old guard that was prepared to express carefully modulated dissent. Sir Teddy Taylor, the veteran Southend MP, used eastern Europe's experience of undemocratic centralised government to argue the case for a free vote or referendum. Mr Major gave him short shrift. 'I do find it inconsistent that such a firm advocate of the parliamentary system should also be an advocate of referenda,' he said. Earlier, Mr Nicholas Budgen MP, Mr Richard Shepherd MP and Mr John Biffen, all long-time opponents of the treaty, attempted to press the sceptics' case without any palpable successes. Former Tory Cabinet minister Mr Biffen also attacked the recent EC agreement on the Common Agriculture Policy, saying it was clear the mechanics of administration of the policy were 'wholly in disarray'. The prime minister, however, defended the 'remarkable achievement' of agriculture minister Mr John Gummer saying there had been substantial reform of the CAP. When Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath, accused the prime minister of having 'bullied' Mrs Thatcher into the exchange rate mechanism, he was brusquely crushed. 'I can only assume you have not met my noble friend,' Mr Major told the recently elected MP, to the mirth of both sides. Privately, government loyalists and rebels alike believe the real struggle will not come until the autumn. While Thursday's back-to-back debates in the Commons and Lords promise some fireworks, - particularly from a newly ennobled Baroness Thatcher  - an uncontentious Commons motion will put the As for the autumn offensives, government ministers believe an expected 'yes' vote in the French referendum and Mr John Smith's accession to the Labour leadership will further strengthen the prime minister's hand. Nonetheless, Tory ultras are hopeful that with luck and unforeseen developments on their side, Labour's quandary over tactics might give them the blocking power they need to halt the treaty ratification process in its tracks.</p>

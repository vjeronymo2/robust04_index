			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Moriyasu Okazaki; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 Mar </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar -- At a luncheon meeting with Prime  Minister Hosokawa on 20 March, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  touched on Japan-China cooperation in the field of automobiles  and urged Prime Minister Hosokawa to promote the Japanese auto  industries' access to the Chinese auto parts market, including  engines. At the same time, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stressed  that China will guarantee the quality of Chinese-made rice to be  imported by Japan.    With regard to the auto issue, Vice Premier Zhu said that  since Japanese companies were reluctant to establish joint  venture projects in the 1970's, China asked for the cooperation  of such auto manufacturers as Germany's Volkswagen; that the Big  Three of the United States have recently started producing auto  parts in China while Korean companies have indicated their  intention to produce auto parts; and that Japanese industries  now can probably afford to cooperate in the area of auto parts  production.</p>

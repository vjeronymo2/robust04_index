			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Lloyd's may lift offer to Names Lloyd's of London last night revealed that it may have a proposal for a fresh settlement offer to loss-making members who are suing agents represented at the insurance market for billions of pounds in damages, Ralph Atkins writes. Executives at Lloyd's suggested discussions between action groups representing Names, individuals whose assets have traditional supported the insurance market, and Lloyd's members and managing agencies may have reached a point where a new attempt at a deal - possibly worth Pounds 1bn or more - was conceivable. An outline plan could be considered when Lloyd's ruling council meets on December 7, raising the prospect of resolving the bitter disputes which have plagued the insurance market since the early 1990s. The market confirmed that any proposed out-of-court settlement would have to be approved by both the Names action groups and the defendants in the many court cases pending - by no means a certainty. The 'errors and omissions' insurers who provided cover for many Lloyd's agencies against negligence claims have been reluctant to disclose how much may be available to fund any settlement, but in a possibly crucial step, a High Court judge earlier this week ordered full disclosure of E&amp;O cover, estimated to be up to Pounds 1bn. Names action groups would also have to be persuaded that a settlement offered comparable returns to pursuing legal action. In February, Names rejected an earlier attempt at an out-of-court deal that was worth Pounds 900m, and it is unclear whether a new deal could exceed that total unless Lloyd's agreed to make a significant central contribution. In October Names in the Gooda Walker Action Group won damages they estimated at Pounds 504m, though a final total has not yet been agreed. Lloyd's said it was no secret that it has been maintaining a dialogue between action groups and those members and managing agencies and their insurers who might provide some recompence for court judgments. Meanwhile, many Lloyd's members being pursued by the insurance market's financial recovery department are either disputing or unaware of their obligations, statistics released yesterday suggested. Lloyd's said the department's strategy of trying to enter into a dialogue with lossmaking Names was working. But more than 330 out of 1,300 who had responded by earlier this month, either disputed or did not recognise the figures supplied. More than 100 rejected liability.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A memorandum of understanding was signed today in  Lilongwe between the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, and Malawi  Congress Party, MCP, under which the two parties will be working  closer together to defend and preserve what they termed the  endangered national unity and security of the country.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, the vice president of the  MCP, Mr. Gwanda Chakuamba, urged people of this country to  support the MPC-Aford national security initiative so as to  achieve the desired result. Mr. Chakuamba gave credit to the  Aford leadership for what he called their vision that the two  parties should work together for the sake of national unity.    And in his remark at the same ceremony, the president of the  Aford Party, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, pointed out that Aford and  MCP had no intention of derailing the democratic change now in  Malawi, and called on all the people to work together in  creating what he called a common security for every Malawian.  The Aford president said he was mindful that democracy is a  delicate thing and that his conviction was that this country  should not be divided just because someone wants to be a leader.</p>

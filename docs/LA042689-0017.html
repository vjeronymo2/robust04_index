			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB ALLEN; BAND SINGER OF '30S AND '40S  </P> <P> Robert (Bob) Allen, a vocalist with the old Hal Kemp band whose rich, romantic  voice made him a favored performer of the lazily arranged vocals of the 1930s  and '40s, died Monday at his home in Stockton.  </P> <P> He was 75 and died of cancer. Until his health began to fail he had been living  in Encino, where he had retired from music but was successful in woodworking.  </P> <P> Allen was the second featured male vocalist in the sweet-sounding Kemp band,  behind Skinnay Ennis, who also doubled on drums.  </P> <P> Ennis went on to lead his own orchestra on the Bob Hope Pepsodent radio show  which, sadly for Kemp, was broadcast at the same time as Kemp's Chesterfield  program.  </P> <P> Kemp was in the process of re-forming his orchestra when he was killed in an  automobile accident in 1940. Allen and others took over the band briefly, but  it soon faded from memory.  </P> <P> Allen then took over Vince Patti's band in Cleveland but gradually moved away  from music and into retirement.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and three sons.  </P></p>

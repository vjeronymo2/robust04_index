			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Birmingham Tories urge land deals to aid schools Derelict or under-used public land should be made available at no charge to construction companies if, in exchange, they repair and refurbish rundown schools, Birmingham Conservative councillors suggested yesterday. Mr Bernard Zissmann, leader of the Conservative group on Birmingham city council, advanced the idea to put pressure on the Labour-led council and to offer 'a new dimension in tackling a national problem'. The city council has been told by a commission of advisers of its own choice that it has been under-spending on education. The commission noted that over the past five years the council has pushed money into projects such as the International Convention Centre but spent Pounds 236m less on education than the government thought it should have done. The advisers called for a Pounds 250m five-year programme to repair the city's schools. Mr Zissmann said: 'I don't think the city council will ever commit enough money, not because it doesn't want to, but because it hasn't got the money.' He said the Conservative suggestion would improve the infrastructure without increasing the public sector borrowing requirement. Derelict land would also be developed and the public stock of land reduced, in line with government wishes. Under Mr Zissmann's plan, a school needing repair would be identified and a nearby vacant site located. A tender among construction companies would be held and the land provided with outline planning permission as a quid pro quo for the refurbishment of the school. The council dismissed the scheme as one of 'Heath Robinson complexity which will only increase red tape and bureaucracy'. All the council wanted, it said, was an increase in its borrowing limits so that it could have the same kind of rolling programme for school repairs enjoyed by the shire counties. 'The idea has the smell of a pre-election gimmick,' the council said. The Conservatives need to gain four seats at next May's elections to take control of the city - the UK's largest metropolitan authority - for the first time in 10 years. The land-for-school-repair scheme is, said Mr Zissmann, 'the main plank of our election platform. If we can't get education right, there's not much point in bothering about anything else'.</p>

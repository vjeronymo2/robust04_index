			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 30 (AFP) -- The following is the  text of the Brussels declaration on voting rights in an enlarged  European Union [EU].    1. Declaration of the 12 present Member States of the  European Union.    The representatives of the 12 states referred to above have  adopted the following declaration at the end of the Conferences  having elaborated the text of the Treaty on Accession of Norway,  Austria, Sweden and Finland to the European Union:    a. The 12 present Member States of the European Union have  agreed that, in the hypothesis where four new Member States will  join the Union, the threshold necessary for a qualified majority  required by the treaties shall be fixed at 64 votes. They have  also agreed that the question of the reform of the institutions,  including the weighting of votes and the threshold of the  qualified majority in the Council, shall be examined during the  Conference of representatives of the governments of the Member  States which shall be convened in 1996, in accordance with  article N, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on European Union.    b. Besides, they have agreed to invite the European  Parliament, the Council and the Commission to establish a report  on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union. These  reports will provide input for the work of a Reflection Group of  Representatives of the Foreign Ministers which should be created  by the European Council in Corfu and start its work in mid-1995.  This Group will work in association with the European  Parliament. It will, inter alia, prepare options based on the  positions and arguments of all Member States on the weighting of  votes and on the threshold of the qualified majority decisions,  taking into account future enlargement.    c. They have taken note that the Council has decided that,  if Members of the Council representing a total of 23 to 26 votes  indicate their intention to oppose the adoption by the Council  of a decision by qualified majority, the Council will do all in  its power to reach, within a reasonable time and without  prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down by the Treaties and  by secondary law, such as in Articles 189b and 189c of the  Treaty establishing the European Community, a satisfactory  solution that could be adopted by at least 68 votes. During  this period, and always respecting the Rules of Procedure of the  Council, the President undertakes with the assistance of the  Commission any initiative necessary to facilitate a wider basis  of agreement in the Council. The members of the Council lend him  their assistance.    d. They have finally agreed that the different elements of  the present Declaration shall continue to be in operation until  entry into force of an amendment to the Treaties, following the  1996 Conference.    2. Declaration by the four applicant States.    The four applicant States, i.e. Finland, Norway, Austria and  Sweden, have expressed their agreement on the above texts of the  Declaration by the 12 Member States of the European Union as  well as on the text of the Decision by the Council.</p>

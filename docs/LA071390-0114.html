			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE AGAIN SHOT AT IN WILMINGTON PROJECT  </P> <P> For the second time this week, Los Angeles police have been shot at in a  Wilmington housing project in apparent retaliation for the recent death of a  gang member who was fleeing from police.  </P> <P> Although no one was injured in the shooting at 2:30 a.m. Thursday, the incident  prompted Los Angeles police officials to temporarily assign additional officers  to the Harbor area, where gang violence has been escalating for months.  </P> <P> The first of those two dozen officers arrived Thursday night.  </P> <P> The latest shooting at Dana Strand Village, and one Sunday morning that grazed  an officer, follow the death last weekend of John Santos of Wilmington. Gang  members have blamed the death of the 21-year-old gang member on police,  although an autopsy Wednesday showed he choked to death on a tiny plastic bag,  believed by police to contain drugs.  </P></p>

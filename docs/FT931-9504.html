			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Man in the News: Mission to mend fences - Dieter Bock Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier appointed joint chief executive at Lonrho with Mr Tiny Rowland, has set himself a challenging task. He wants to bring one of the most independent-minded British companies back into the City fold. 'We have to repair the image of the company; it has to become an equal member of the business community' he says. This can only be achieved, he feels, if Lonrho 'plays by the book', becomes 'more open with the investment community' and appoints non-executive directors. In short, Mr Bock says he wants the company, effectively run by a rebel tycoon for 31 years, to become viewed as part of 'the establishment'. To many Lonrho watchers Mr Bock's ambition may sound implausible. This is partly because the diversified conglomerate finds itself so far from the establishment and partly because the company is perceived as Mr Rowland's vehicle. There are few other UK companies where the mark of a single man has been so strongly imprinted. In 1973 the affairs of Lonrho were famously described by Edward Heath, then the prime minister, as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. Since then Mr Rowland has repeatedly enraged the financial establishment. Last year, while the west sought to treat Libya as an outlaw because of its alleged involvement in the Lockerbie air disaster, Lonrho sold a one-third stake in its Metropole Hotels to the government-controlled Libyan Arab Investment Company for Pounds 177.5m. 'Tiny has been trapped into a fight with the establishment; it is a bad situation,' says Mr Bock. 'But I hope my presence will give him more freedom to move.' He does not expect, however, to bring Lonrho back into the City fold within a few weeks. He thinks it could take as long as a year and a half. He cannot simply remove the Rowland imprint, and he does not want to minimise the role Mr Rowland has played in building the group. But the 53 year-old Mr Bock has served notice to the investment community that he is not about to play a subservient role to the 75 year-old Mr Rowland. 'As much as I respect Tiny, he respects me. I can bring in more new ideas than any of his board members can. If someone is new he is more able to develop new ideas than someone who has been in the same position for a long time.' For the moment, he is somewhat guarded about what such plans may comprise. What he does say is that Lonrho must reduce its borrowings which, at the year to the end of September 1992, were about Pounds 850m. That figure has recently fallen as a result of disposals, and he favours further small divestments to ease the debt burden. He says that he and Mr Rowland agree that the company should remain focused on its core businesses - mining, trading, agriculture and hotels - in an attempt to improve its performance. Last year's collapse in pre-tax profits, which fell to Pounds 80m from Pounds 205m the previous 12 months, show the scale of this task. Equally difficult will be his more immediate aim of establishing ties with the City. Mr Bock could not be described as a pillar of the establishment. He is more renowned in Germany for being an effective, if mysterious, Mr Fixit. Indeed, there are two big mysteries surrounding Mr Bock: where he gets his money from; and whether he is acting in partnership with anyone else? Mr Bock's main business interests are his commercial real estate activities in Advanta Management, of which he controls a majority of the issued share capital. In 1991, Advanta reported pre-tax profits of DM63m (Pounds 27m) and its net assets were around DM200m (Pounds 85.8m). Last October, Advanta, in a high-profile deal, brought a 50 per cent stake in the Kempinski Hotel chain after the failure of attempts to merge Kempinski with Air France's Meridien business. The deal, worth about DM300m (Pounds 128.7m), again raised questions about the source of Mr Bock's finances. He is listed in the German edition of Forbes magazine as number 380 of the country's 400 richest people, with an estimated net worth of DM200m (Pounds 85.8m). Yet Mr Bock's purchase of an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho - made through his privately owned company Laerstate, registered in the Netherlands  -cost him Pounds 135m. When pressed about the state of his personal finances the financier has a look of exasperation. 'I have already told everyone that I am not paying for my Lonrho stake out of cash.' He dismisses the Forbes estimate of his wealth as 'bunk' and says he has made some short-term borrowings while negotiating the sale of 20 to 25 per cent of his holding in Advanta. As to whether he is acting with anyone else, Mr Bock laughs off the idea as ridiculous. 'I am acting for myself, not with or for anyone else. I have never been a front for anyone. My friends in the German community know that I act for myself.' Mr Bock says there is no secret about where he has come from and how he made his money. Born in Dessau in the former state of East Germany, his family moved to what was then West Germany in 1953. He studied law at Marburg University followed by accountancy at Munich University, and worked as an apprentice for the Frankfurt law firm Boesebeck &amp; Bart. He moved on to a small accountancy firm which was taken over by KMPG Peat Marwick. In 1973, struck by how many Germans were investing in property to save taxes, he formed his own consulting firm in Frankfurt. The next year he established his first partnership for real estate investment in Munich. Later he expanded his property interests to South Africa and the US, and formed Advanta. An intensely private man, Mr Bock is married with four children. He is a patron of the arts and established a charitable foundation to help German museums fund their exhibits. Regardless of Mr Bock's background there remains the question of whether Mr Rowland will be supportive of Mr Bock's plans. What if the joint chief executives were to fall out? Mr Bock admits that there is always a risk, but dismisses it as insignificant. He says he is confident that he can change the public's perception of Lonrho without alienating Mr Rowland.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Calling the accountants to account - The latest move in the Lasmo/Enterprise Oil bid battle Late 1980s accounting met with old-style aggressive 1980s acquisition battle tactics yesterday as the escalating war of criticism by Lasmo in its defence from Enterprise's hostile bid switched to its predator's financial reporting policies. In a 12-page document called 'Enterprise Oil: the financial myth', Lasmo accused the oil company of a series of manipulations and of contravening UK accounting standards. 'This goes to the heart of (Enterprise's) value,' said Mr Rudolph Agnew, Lasmo's chairman. 'They have overstated profits, have an uncovered dividend and an unsustainable share price.' Enterprise lost no time in fighting back. Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said: 'This is incredibly mischievous. We have absolutely not broken the rules. To get a lecture on accounting from Lasmo given their history is a bit rich.' The company's auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, also issued a statement saying: 'We have signed an unqualified audit report and in our opinion the accounts of Enterprise Oil do and have complied with UK accounting standards.' The document represents the outcome of work conducted by teams from Ernst &amp; Young, Lasmo's auditors, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Both firms said yesterday they stood by the accusations made. Lasmo's central attack is that Enterprise has not recorded the assets bought in large acquisitions at their purchase price, which would then require substantial depreciation. Instead, it has written them down immediately against reserves in the balance sheet, which it argued 'contravenes' accounting standards. It highlights two examples. In 1988 Enterprise bought an interest in Beryl Properties for Pounds 158m and wrote the assets down against reserves by Pounds 149m to leave a recorded value of Pounds 9m. In 1989 it acquired assets from Texas Eastern Corporation for Pounds 442m, and wrote down their value by Pounds 386m. The document also shows that Enterprise used merger accounting when it bought ICI Petroleum in 1987, and that if acquisition accounting had been used instead, net assets would have been recorded at Pounds 109m higher. Mr Shilston said that the company had used merger accounting, which allowed it to 'add the balance sheets together' without the need to readjust for the fair values of the assets. He said he believed this was more prudent. 'We took the view that the substance of the transactions were as mergers,' he said. 'We abided by the rules that existed then. This was not a mindless interpretation but a commercially-based decision.' Fred 6, a draft new accounting standard which will become mandatory this autumn, will prevent Enterprise's approach to the acquisitions in the future. Lasmo criticises Enterprise for 'opaque accounting' in its presentation of Elf Enterprise Petroleum, a joint venture one third owned by Enterprise created in 1991, which in turn acquired an interest in the Piper Field in the North Sea and has so far been heavily lossmaking. However, Mr Shilston said that Lasmo had itself acquired a direct interest in the field 'at a slightly higher price'. 'We would not disagree that the Piper field took longer and cost more than expected. But Lasmo has been subjected to it infinitely more directly and materially than us.' Finally, Lasmo attacks Enterprise's dividend policy, saying it is overdistributed because its earnings are inflated and because it is using a higher proportion of its cash flow to fund the dividend payment; and of raising its dividend while its underlying earnings have fallen. Mr Shilston said the relatively high dividend paid by Enterprise reflected the company's strength. 'We are quite happy to be associated with the quality end of the market. What's the embarrassment?' He stressed that the company had adequate cash flow to fund the dividend payments, which was far more important as a measure of its ability to pay than the earnings figure. Enterprise is believed to have written to the Takeover Panel complaining about the accusations. However, Mr Agnew stood by the charges. 'We have laid out all the facts. Now it is for the market to study them. If they believe we have made a telling point Enterprise will be severely damaged. If they ignore them God help us all.'</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unwelcome local surprise Sir, You are quite right to report that the Local Government Commission's proposal for a unitary council for the New Forest came as a surprise - an unwelcome surprise. Your report perhaps lets us guess at how the commission came to make what, on any reasoned consideration of the facts, seems completely the wrong decision. You report Sir John Banham, the commission chairman, as saying that members were swayed by 'overwhelming support for a unitary authority independent of Hampshire, with 60 per cent of residents in the New Forest in favour of this option'. He must have meant 'respondents' - those writing to the commission with views - because there is no 'overwhelming support'. About 6 per cent of the New Forest electorate sent comments to the commission. Some 4,700 people, 3.5 per cent of the electorate, supported the commission's second-choice for an all-unitary structure of local government replacing county and district councils throughout Hampshire. A separate survey for the commission showed, from a sample of New Forest residents, that a third wanted no change and only 37 per cent, not 60 per cent, wanted a unitary structure. The changes proposed by the commission would add up to Pounds 5m a year, every year, to the cost of running local government in Hampshire. That is what it costs to run two big secondary schools a year. On top of that, council taxpayers would have to find up to Pounds 12m to pay the one-off costs of making the change. That is more or less what it costs to build a new secondary school. And the commission's report accepts the problems the councils will face in trying to prevent service quality falling. If Sir John and the commission have so misinterpreted the data before them, it is no wonder we have a recommendation which many Hampshire residents find so unacceptable. The simple facts are that of the 55,000 comments made to the commission, more than half supported the commission's earlier proposal for no change except in Portsmouth and Southampton. Another 8,500 wanted no change at all. That, Sir John, is the voice of the clear majority] Mike Hancock, leader, Hampshire County Council, The Castle, Winchester SO23 8UJ</p>

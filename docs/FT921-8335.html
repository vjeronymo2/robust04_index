			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Tokyo sells Dollars 500m to strengthen yen THE Bank of Japan sold about Dollars 500m on Tokyo's foreign exchange market yesterday in a co-ordinated move with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which helped push the dollar down sharply against the yen. The unusually large sale brought the dollar down from Y128.28 to Y126.93 against the yen. The move comes at a time when Japan's trade surplus has been surging to high levels, to the embarrassment of the government, and highlights attempts by authorities to alleviate foreign criticism by strengthening the yen. A Ministry of Finance official said later that the yen had deviated from Japan's economic fundamentals. Financial policymakers of the Group of Seven agreed a range of Y123 to Y124 for the dollar at last month's meeting in New York. The Tokyo stock and bond markets reacted favourably to the move, as market participants associated the higher yen with lower inflationary pressure, and lower interest rates. The No 129 10-year benchmark bond closed down 8.5 percentage points at 5.375 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 index closed above the psychologically important 21,000 level. The bank hinted at further dollar sales if necessary. World stock markets, page 43 Capital markets, page 29</p>

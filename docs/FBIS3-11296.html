A majority of La Paz newspapers said in their front pages on  20 March that Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle his cabinet,  dismissing some of his ministers and changing the assignment of  others, possibly on 22 March.    The sources consulted by EFE said the ministers who will  almost surely leave the government are Defense Minister Antonio  Cespedes, Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Interior Minister  German Quiroga.    The same sources said the "super ministers" of economic  development, Fernando Illanes, and human development, Fernando  Romero, will have their assignments changed.    The sources also said that current Minister of the  Presidency  Carlos Sanchez Berzain and an outstanding entrepreneur and  political leader from Santa Cruz are the leading candidates to  replace Interior Minister Quiroga if he leaves the cabinet.    Sanchez de Lozada's government is formed by a coalition of  his party, the liberal Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR),  the populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS), and the social  democratic Free Bolivia Movement (MBL).    The UCS, the party granting the MNR control of the absolute  majority in Congress, presently has one of its members as head  of the Defense Ministry. The post was assigned to Antonio  Cespedes, but he is expected to leave the government because his  own party has requested that he be removed.    The MBL, whose votes in Congress are not essential, was able  to get the Foreign Ministry for its leader Antonio Aranibar. His  continuation is assured because he seems to be Sanchez de  Lozada's government's most popular minister.    Sanchez de Lozada formed his government on 6 August 1993  after his victory by a relative majority in the 6 June 1993  election.    In these seven months of government, Sanchez de Lozada's  cabinet has established the legislative basis for a future  absolute transformation of the Bolivian economy and  administration.    The key instruments in this transformation are the  Capitalization Law to privatize public companies, and the  People's Participation Law to give more power to citizens in the  political and administrative decisionmaking process and the  allotment of state resources through the country's  municipalization.    Sanchez de Lozada also has reorganized the executive branch  by significantly reducing, among other things, the number of  ministries.</p>

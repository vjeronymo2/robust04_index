			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Moreira sees debt deal soon MR Marclio Marques Moreira, Brazilian economy minister, expects to conclude an agreement in principle, during the next six weeks, on the restructuring of Brazil's commercial bank debt. He also said for the first time that Brazil would be willing to contribute part of its foreign reserves to support the agreement with banks. This should ease the path to an accord over the Dollars 42bn (Pounds 23.7bn) in medium- and long-term debt. A sharp rise in Brazilian reserves over the past six months has helped allay fears that there would be insufficient resources to back the debt agreement. Finance is necessary to pay for collateral to guarantee concessional bonds to be issued under the agreement. Mr Moreira insisted in an interview that the guarantees would still have to be phased in over time, as the volatility of reserves did not permit an immediate earmarking of the funds. He said the growth in reserves was now beginning to flatten out, although they had risen significantly since the last published figure of Dollars 11bn at the end of February. Inflows of capital had subsided since the government restricted, late last month, the ability of Brazilian entities to borrow abroad. The Brazilian economy, in a three-year recession, was bottoming out, he believed. This was suggested by several factors, including a 2 per cent increase in energy consumption over the first quarter of last year in Sao Paulo, responsible for 40 per cent of Brazil's gross domestic product. He denied that he was under pressure to relax the government's tight fiscal discipline by releasing more money to the states and to the armed forces. There has been growing discontent over the low level of pay in the military, particularly in comparison to that of the executive and legislature. A fighter pilot earns the same as a lift operator in Congress, Mr Moreira admitted, and said that such anomalies would have to be corrected over time. He said his priorities for the coming year included a reduction of inflation, to 2 or 3 per cent a month from about 20 per cent now, and overseeing a sustainable return to growth. The minister wanted to complete the agreement with banks and to secure legislation, among other things, for port deregulation, an end to some state monopolies, and fiscal reform. Last week, the government confirmed it had not met its first-quarter targets under a stand-by programme with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Pedro Parente, Brazil's planning secretary, indicated the extent to which government spending had been compressed during the first quarter, in a vain attempt to meet the target for the operating deficit (current revenues less current expenditures and debt interest). He said the government had foreseen expenditures of five trillion cruzeiros (Dollars 2bn at the present rate) in the first quarter of the year, but had spent only three trillion - a cut of 60 per cent in real terms compared to the first quarter a year earlier. However, there was an operating deficit of Cr10.8 trillion, the target having been Cr5.6 trillion. This was because interest payments on internal debt were Cr2.8 trillion above target - interest rates were higher than expected - while government revenues were Cr4.4 trillion less than expected because of legislated delays in the collection of some important corporate taxes. The government hopes the delayed tax payments will begin to flow this month, interest rates having already fallen from first-quarter levels. Mr Parente said he was thus still convinced the government could meet half-year targets.</p>

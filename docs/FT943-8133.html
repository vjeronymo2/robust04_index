			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / J. Rothschild fined Pounds 100,000 by life industry regulator J. Rothschild Assurance, the life insurer which Sir Mark Weinberg helped to set up, has been fined Pounds 100,000 and told to pay Pounds 40,000 costs for failing to monitor its sales force properly and to keep adequate records. Lautro, the life insurance industry's self-regulatory organisation, said it had identified a number of cases where JRA sales agents had given unsuitable advice or in which there was not enough justification for selling customers a product to replace one already held. JRA had not ensured that sales agents had complied with regulatory requirements, and had not kept records which could show that best advice had always been given, Lautro said. Sir Mark, one of the UK's leading innovators in the sales of financial products, was the prime mover behind the successes of Abbey Life and Allied Dunbar. Abbey Life, set up in 1961, was one of the first companies to introduce unit-linked assurance policies. He set up JRA in 1992. The charges relate to JRA's first months of operation, and follow the first routine inspection visit by Lautro, in October 1992 and an advisory visit in May. Mr Mike Wilson, JRA's chief executive, said that the company had undertaken an extensive sampling of sales made in 1992. In fewer than 10 cases, JRA had felt it necessary to compensate customers by changing the policy which had been sold or by refunding premiums paid. While the fine is well below Lautro's record of Pounds 300,000 - levied on Norwich Union and on Premium Life earlier this year - it is among the higher penalties for failings revealed by the first round of inspection visits. Mr Wilson said that since 1992 JRA had improved its record-keeping and compliance procedures. JRA's policy is to recruit only sales agents who have had significant financial services experience, and Mr Wilson admitted that this carried a risk of unjustified 'replacement selling' as clients moved with their advisers. He argued, however, that the customer was better off with experienced sales staff than with a new recruit 'let loose' after a training course of just a couple of weeks. JRA currently has 570 sales agents. Sir Mark, JRA's chairman, said that Lautro's penalising of some two dozen companies was a sign that self-regulation was effective.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT FACING 12 FELONY CHARGES  </P> <P> Three Huntington Beach police officers testified Wednesday at a court hearing  for David Edwin Wilson, 41, a tree-trimmer with a long record of drunk-driving  arrests.  </P> <P> Wilson was in West Orange County Municipal Court for a preliminary hearing to  determine whether there was enough evidence of a crime to bind him over for  trial in Superior Court.  </P> <P> He is charged with 12 felonies and seven other offenses, including driving  under the influence four times last summer, driving with a suspended license,  giving a false name to police in order to escape prosecution, and leaving the  scene of an accident.  </P> <P> A tangle of police and court records indicate that Wilson has at least a dozen  arrests for drunk driving and other crimes -- and possibly as many as 19 --  under several different aliases dating back to 1978. Wilson has served at least  two terms in Orange County Jail, records show.  </P> <P> But in this case, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. James F. Bacin seeks to  prove only four drunk-driving cases still pending against Wilson, as well as  six prior offenses since 1983.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's hearing, the Huntington Beach officers testified that on May 13  they spotted Wilson driving erratically, pulled him over and arrested him,  Bacin said.  </P> <P> Police have said Wilson was often released after arrest despite his long record  and a revoked license because he gave them names of other people who had valid  drivers' licenses, including his brothers.  </P></p>

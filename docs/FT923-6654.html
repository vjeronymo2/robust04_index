			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures surrendered early gains as concern over sterling once again dominated the market, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,385 on the back of the overnight firmness in Tokyo, gently creeping forward reaching 2,395 just before the mid-morning expiry of the FT-SE 100 option at 10.30am. Concerns about sterling then gained the upper hand and September slipped back, trading in a narrow range of 2,380 and 2,387 for the next few hours. The additional weakening of sterling and the other fixed interest markets sent September into further retreat. There was also sizeable selling, particularly by independent traders, unwilling to go long at the end of the account. September eventually finished at 2,374, down 5 on its previous close and around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover was a moderate 7,668. The main feature in the traded options was the 10.30am expiry of the August FT-SE 100 option. Turnover reached 22,572, with the FT-SE 100 trading 6,648 lots.</p>

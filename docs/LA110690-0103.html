			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE AGREES TO BACK PAY FOR 8 INSTRUCTORS;  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY: THE ACTION ENDS A SIX-YEAR BATTLE. A STATE COURT OF APPEAL  PANEL RULED THAT THE NURSES HAD NOT BEEN COMPENSATED PROPERLY.  </P> <P> The governing board of Antelope Valley College, having lost a six-year legal  battle that was one of the longest and costliest in its history, agreed Monday  to pay more than $350,000 to eight women nursing instructors who claimed they  had been wrongfully underpaid.  </P> <P> The instructors -- seven who still work at the college and one who has retired  -- sued in 1984, contending that they had not been given proper salary credit  for work experience and academic credits. A state Court of Appeal panel sided  with the instructors in August, capping the long legal battle.  </P> <P> The lawsuit involved the school's two-tier salary tables, for academic and  vocational instructors. The suit contended that some of the nursing instructors  had been wrongly placed on an academic salary schedule, instead of on the  higher-paid vocational schedule, and that others were ranked too low on the  vocational schedule. The college has since ceased using the split-salary  schedules for instructors, but college officials have continued to defend their  salary practices.  </P> <P> The college board approved the payments by a 5-0 vote -- with no discussion in  public session -- after emerging from a closed-door meeting with its attorney.  </P> <P> Nancy Hoverman -- one of the instructors and president of the faculty union,  the Antelope Valley College Federation of Teachers -- said she was pleased with  the outcome but frustrated that it took such a long fight against the college  to prevail.  </P> <P> Hoverman said the women in her group, which includes all but one of the  full-time faculty members in the college's Allied Health Division, began their  lawsuit alleging gender discrimination. But she said they later learned that  male vocational teachers at the college also had similar problems.  </P> <P> "I guess it's just been a whole, big, unfortunate situation that could have  been settled years ago for much less," Hoverman said. "They would have saved  the public quite a bit of money had it been settled in-house."  </P> <P> The court-ordered direct payments amount to $325,273, about two-thirds back  salaries and about one-third interest on the back salaries. The college also  will have to pay $9,054 in attorneys fees and court costs for the nurses and an  estimated $18,000 in added retirement fund payments for them. The women  received their interest payments last week, but have yet to receive the back  salary.  </P> <P> The salary and interest payments ranged from a low of $3,916 for Hoverman to a  high of $91,153 for instructor Emily Pack, according to college officials. The  payments represent salary adjustments for the instructors for five to 13 years  of work.  </P> <P> Larry Rosenzweig, the Santa Monica attorney who represented the instructors on  behalf of their parent union, the California Federation of Teachers, said the  back pay owed Hoverman is still a subject of dispute with the college and he is  seeking at least an additional $20,000 for her.  </P> <P> At issue in the case, which the Lancaster-based community college fought  stubbornly through a change of its president and several shake-ups in its  governing board, was whether administrators had followed a uniform salary  schedule in deciding nursing instructors' pay.  </P> <P> In its August ruling, the Court of Appeal found that "there was no consistency"  in the college's salary decisions. In a July, 1989, decision, Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel found the college had been "careless and  inconsistent."  </P></p>

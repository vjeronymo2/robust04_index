			<p>BFN     [Text] Unable to face the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops and disappointed that  their parachutes should be falling in UNITA-controlled areas,  the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party,  MPLA-PT, forces went on the attack and started shelling Bie  [Cuito] yesterday.    Civilian sources in the area of Bie have told the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, that large explosions  were heard in the city. Despite the worrisome situation,  sources in humanitarian aid organizations in Huambo have told  Vorgan that World Food Program aircraft carrying aid have been  able to land at Bie.    Those sources also said that the UNITA armed forces in Bie  have been instructed to remain calm, but the situation could  deteriorate if Luanda does insist on bombing the city. Two  MPLA-PT attempts to provide parachute assistance to the People's  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola were thwarted this  week. It would seem, though, that Luanda wants to expand the  area it controls. Such a move would not appear to be peaceful.</p>

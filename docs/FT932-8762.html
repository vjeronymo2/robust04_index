			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Spain's right quits Franco's shadow WHEN Spain's ruling Socialists, from prime minister Felipe Gonzalez down, are out on the election campaign trail, they never mention General Francisco Franco by name. But they assume everyone knows who they are talking about when they refer to their conservative opponents in the Partido Popular (PP) as la Derecha - the Right. 'The Right have never trusted Spain,' Mr Gonzalez shouted to an appreciative audience recently. 'They ruled for a century and now they can wait awhile.' Reference to la Derecha is supposed to send shivers down the spines. The clear threat is that if la Derecha won the general election on June 6, there would be a taking of account, as there was after the Spanish civil war. People who have run with the Left would be marked and suffer discrimination. Who, after all, could forget the nearly 40 dark years of dictatorship under Franco? So far, the scare tactic has worked. In three successive elections since 1982 Spaniards have returned the Socialists with overall majorities. This time it may not work. The Partido Popular is neck and neck with the Socialists in the polls and is doing well among young voters and students who, the Socialists have begun to realise only recently, have no memory of Franco and see nothing shameful in supporting a conservative party. The devaluation last Thursday of the peseta and a big rise in unemployment may also strengthen the view that a business-oriented party might be able to run the country better than the Socialists. Mr Rodrigo Rato, a leading PP MP and a possible finance minister should the party win on June 6, says: 'We ignore it now. We are another generation and the public just don't buy it. If the Socialists go on playing this game they are making a big mistake. We have become a mix of liberal and Christian Democrat.' The PP is a curious animal. It is a recent mutation of the former Alianza Popular, founded by one of General Franco's most famous ministers, Manuel Fraga. He created the AP in 1977 after refusing to serve under prime minister Adolfo Suarez, whom he considered too progressive. When Mr Suarez's centrist UCD government collapsed in 1982 and the Socialists won their first election, the AP became the standard bearer to the right of the government. While Mr Fraga was a visible presence in the AP, he was a convenient demon for the Socialists. It was widely assumed that, in a country with a natural majority to the left of centre, the conservatives could never progress far. But in 1989 the old man shuffled off to be elected president of his native Galicia and the AP began vigorously to shed itself of its Francoist heritage. It is a job not yet quite done but it would be foolish to question the PP's attachment to democracy. 'When Franco died (in 1975) the leadership of this party was 18 or 20 years old, for goodness' sake,' says Francisco Alvarez Cascos, 45, the PP secretary general. 'It is ridiculous to burden us with a memory that has nothing to do with us.' The patient re-positioning of the PP, bringing it closer to the vital centre of Spanish politics, is paying off. Largely because of the Socialists' inability to fight off recession and their unconvincing denials of corrupt party financing, young conservatives such as Mr Rato, Mr Cascos and the PP leader, Jose Maria Aznar - who were brought into politics by Mr Fraga but have made themselves independent of him - suddenly find themselves tantalisingly close to power. 'Nowadays,' says Mr Cascos, 'the only leader young people are able to use as a reference when they think about their problems is Felipe Gonzalez. He has no credibility when he invokes the memory of Franco in front of these people.' The prospect of power seems to have softened them. 'The Socialists are not the devil and we are not going to throw everything out of the window when we take power,' says Mr Rato. Not everyone believes that, but the PP and the Socialists agree more on policy than either would like to admit. Both claim they will freeze taxes after the election and then try to cut them. Both want a 'social pact' with the unions and employers to help wrestle the country out of recession. Both want to keep the peseta in the exchange rate mechanism of the the European Monetary System. Both would actively use public spending to create jobs. There are differences of style - the PP would privatise quicker and try to cut taxes deeper than the Socialists, but where the PP scores now is that it is a more united party than the Socialists. 'I'm saying what all of my party is saying,' says Mr Rato, 'but Mr (finance minister Carlos) Solchaga cannot get his policies past his party.' That division lies behind the Socialists' likely electoral disaster. While the government has been chasing its vision of a modern, vibrant state rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful, the party has had to struggle to hold its core vote in the forgotten and poverty-stricken countryside. The government and the party have different agenda and it has begun to show. The conservatives have no such problem. They have an enthusiastic constituency and are rapidly building support among women and students. Nevertheless, the PP knows it cannot win an overall majority and it is by no means certain that it will even win as many seats as the Socialists. But the election will almost certainly result in a hung parliament and, in order to govern, the PP would have to do deals with the leading parties from the two regions of Spain most brutalised by Franco - the Basque Country and Catalonia. 'Perhaps,' ventures Mr Rato, 'we might even do deals with the Socialists.' Any of those combinations would put Socialist demonology to the test and if even one of them worked, Spain might at last be able to get on with being a democracy without constantly being reminded about when it was not.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bonanza for Chicago exchanges - Surging volumes fuel the profit-sharing debate Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, toasted a year of record volume in December with the prediction that 'under the right conditions, like the Fed changing its interest rate policy, the roof could blow off this place'. Last Friday the Fed struck, reversing its five-year-old policy of easier credit, and Mr Sandner got his volume explosion. In the biggest single day in futures industry history, the CME turned over an estimated 2.5m contracts, exceeding the previous record by nearly 1m contracts. The surge of business at the CME, which was echoed in the financial futures pits at the its big futures rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, and in over-the-counter interest rate swaps dealings, came as money managers rushed to re-adjust their interest rate hedges. Since interest rate risk products account for more than 80 per cent of their business, this upsurge in volatility was a bonanza for the two big Chicago futures exchanges. But it not only translates into higher income for the exchanges: it is bound to accelerate the debate over who gets to share in those profits. Unlike their much newer European counterparts, the CBoT, the CME and the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) are owned by their individual members, for the most part a tightly-knit cadre of independent futures traders and trading companies. The exchanges are non profit-making entities, organised more like private clubs than businesses. Members benefit from exchange success indirectly. They do not collect dividends from the exchange. When fees exceed expenses, exchange profits are invested in the exchange or put into an equity fund. To this end the CME last year spent Dollars 28m to double the size of its trading space and is investing Dollars 20m to upgrade trade clearing technology. The CBoT and the Nymex each have multi-million dollar building plans in the pipeline. Members' equity at the CBoT topped Dollars 128m last year, and was over Dollars 100m at the CME. Exchange leaders are now looking for a way to unlock some of those dollars. Mr Sandner believes the inability to distribute profits discourages investment in the exchange. At the same time, the CME's success in the form of seat prices is keeping new blood away. Seats, changing hands for Dollars 650,000 or so, are beyond the pocket of young traders. He thinks a profit-making structure that separates trading rights from equity ownership, and prices them separately, would benefit the exchange, and has ordered a comprehensive examination of the issue. The plan looks set to be controversial in that it could eventually end floor trader control over exchange governance. However, the promise of cash returns - dividends - could dispel any exchange dissent. At the CBoT, an internal study last year criticised the exchange for strategic blindness and disorganised governance. Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, the management consultancy, has studied alternatives to the existing operating structure in the wake of that report, and will produce its findings later this year. Mr Daniel Rappaport, chairman of Nymex, has asked the exchange's lawyers and investment bankers to draft a for-profit ownership plan. Having a means to distribute exchange profits is important, he says, because the interests of the exchange are no longer tied exclusively to the floor. Nymex, the central marketplace for world energy trading, sits at the edge of an information highway it is anxious to explore. It already has a computerised after-hours trading system, Access, and will soon launch Enersoft, an electronic information service for the natural gas industry. To support these off-floor investments, Mr Rappaport says, members must be able to share in their profits. Mr Rappaport says the switch to profit-making status, long avoided because of its income tax liabilities, will not change exchange ownership. 'We are not intending to go public,' he says. 'The same people will own the exchange.' However, he admits that the trading and ownership rights now bound into a Nymex membership could be 'unstapled' some time in the future. Plans for dividend-paying futures exchanges, however, could run foul of an important constituency - the exchanges' public customers. Mr Hal Hanson, chairman of the Futures Industry Association, a trade group for broker-dealers who represent public customers, contends that rather than pay dividends to self-interested traders, exchanges should lower customer trading fees and other costs. 'These exchanges ought to be in business to meet their customers' requirements,' Mr Hanson says. 'If they're successful doing that it has an enormous benefit to the floor trader, because it is the public orders that make this trading system work.'</p>

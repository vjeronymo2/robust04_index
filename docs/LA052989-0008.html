			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Funding for some non-classroom operations may have to be cut this summer at Cal  State Fresno in order to repay the state $2.9 million mistakenly allocated to  the school, officials said. An audit found the error in budget calculations,  and the school has agreed to repay the money by June 30. Examiners from the  state chancellor's office found that school budget officials had miscalculated  several key projections used by the state to determine fiscal year funding. The  shortfall represents 3% of the school's $100-million annual budget.  </P></p>

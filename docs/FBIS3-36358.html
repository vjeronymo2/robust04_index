Three people died, and seven were injured.    If the explosion had happened some 20 minutes earlier or  later, the scale of the tragedy would have been more  considerable. By a lucky chance, however, by the time the  delayed-action mine placed in the second car went off, the  passengers who had just arrived on this train from Kislovodsk  had already got off and all those who were to set out in it for  Astara at 2307 hours had not yet had time to get on.  Nevertheless, material damage (considerable damage!) was  caused: In addition to the two cars blown to smithereens,  windows were blown out in the nearby Baku-Tbilisi and Baku-Ganja  trains.    A. Bagirov, the republic's transport prosecutor, has said  that an investigation has started. "This is not the first act  of terrorism," he remarked. "Whereas in previous instances we  were dealing with explosive devices with a clockwork mechanism  restricting their operating time to 12 hours, a mine has now  been used which, thanks to special chemical fillers, can be set  off two or three days after being put in position."</p>

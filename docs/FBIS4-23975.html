			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko  today signed the decree appointing the new prime minister, Kengo  Wa Dondo, who was elected on 14 June by the High Council of the  Republic-Transition Parliament, an official source disclosed.  The ordinance was signed in line with the transitional  constitution that will regulate the functioning of the Zairian  institutions up to the adoption of the new constitution which  will mark the advent of the Third Republic.    Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's election has already been rejected by  hardliners of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR]  which supports Etienne Tshisekedi whom they consider the sole  "legal" prime minister of Zaire. Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo belongs to  the moderate group of the USOR led by the Union for the Republic  and Democracy.</p>

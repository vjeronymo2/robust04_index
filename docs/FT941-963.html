			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Green shoots start to appear in Japan: Conditions for economic recovery 'in place' Japan's economy appears to have touched the bottom of its two-and-a-half-year downturn, according to a growing number of private and public sector forecasters in Tokyo. Their cautious optimism is based on a series of encouraging economic statistics over the past few weeks, showing a pick-up in consumer demand, a slowdown in the decline of corporate profits, and a reduction in the ratio of companies feeling gloomy about the future. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan - one of the most cautious forecasters - believes the conditions for a recovery are in place, though he sees no sign yet that a rebound has begun. The bank's latest monthly economic report says the economy 'appears to have stopped weakening'. Japan's green shoots, as recorded by various government departments and agencies, include a 0.7 per cent increase in consumer spending between the third and fourth quarters of last year, and a 6.2 per cent year-on-year decline in average corporate profits in the final quarter, compared with a 21.6 per cent fall in the previous three months. There is also a fall in the relative balance between businesses feeling optimistic and pessimistic. In December, the share of companies feeling negative exceeded those feeling positive by 13.1 percentage points, down from 22.1 points in November. There was a 0.9 per cent increase in industrial production from December to January. Output in January was still 3.1 per cent down on the month in 1993, but the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the central bank both think that industrial production will show a year-on-year rise in the first quarter of 1994, which they would recognise as the first sign of an upturn. The mean forecast is for a rise in gross domestic product of 0.3 per cent this year, after the near stagnation of 0.1 per cent in 1993, according to the latest quarterly survey of economic surveys by Consensus Economics, a private consultancy. Within this, 12 of the 19 economists questioned believe growth will be above the mean forecast. Mr Brian Rose, senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research, which is forecasting 0.9 per cent growth this year, said that up to December, most monthly data were negative, but from January, most numbers have been positive. 'The numbers could not have gone on going down for ever, but the recovery will be weak,' Mr Rose said. Sunrise approaches, Page 13</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The up and down world of savings rates  -Investors have faced a rollercoaster ride in the past few weeks. Philip Coggan and Scheherazade Daneshkhu explain what is on offer SAVERS CAN be forgiven for being confused. Most UK financial institutions seem to be reducing rates at present, with the Halifax and the Alliance &amp; Leicester leading the pack this week. But in the midst of the cuts, the Skipton building society raised its rates, citing the need to keep competitive. Meanwhile, many commentators believe that interest rates will fall in the 1990s as the world moves into an era of low growth and low inflation. But in the short term, the UK government cannot reduce rates until the Germans do so. The result is an enormous range of choice for the average saver, depending on how much he wants to invest and for how long. Nor is choosing the highest rates necessarily the best decision. Often the best returns are offered by some of the smallest names. Some may be doing so because they have lower costs; others may offer high rates because they urgently need to attract funds. While there is no point in risking capital to chase an extra half of a percentage point of interest, it is difficult for the small investor to tell whether an institution is 'safe'. There is some comfort in the compensation schemes. Sterling bank deposits are covered up to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, and building society deposits 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. A policyholder's protection scheme offers 90 per cent cover (without limit) on insurance company policies such as guaranteed income bonds. So, with the important caveat of safety, here is a guide to products and rates on offer. VARIABLE RATES Instant access The market is fluid at present and banks and building societies may yet react to this week's changes. Halifax has cut the rate on balances of Pounds 500 and above in its Instant Xtra Plus account to 7.15 per cent gross from 7.5 per cent and, on balances of Pounds 25,000 - wary of losing 'high net worth' customers - there is a smaller drop from 8.9 per cent gross to 8.8 per cent. Alliance &amp; Leicester's rates on its Instant Access account fell from 7.5 per cent gross to 7.3 per cent on Pounds 500 and from 8.4 per cent gross to 8.2 per cent on Pounds 25,000. However, savers with Pounds 25,000 in Skipton's Sovereign Shares account saw an increase from 9.2 per cent gross to 9.6 per cent gross, although those with Pounds 500 saw no increase in the rate of 7.5 per cent gross. Elsewhere, the highest rates are to be found on postal accounts. Investors are pre-issued with withdrawal and paying-in slips and deal with the institution by first class post. On Pounds 5,000, Moneyfacts (0692-582103) says the highest rates are being paid by Bristol &amp; West on its Balmoral postal account, with 10.45 per cent. North of England's Edinburgh (postal) account pays 10.25 per cent, while the rate at Norwich &amp; Peterborough on its Postmaster account is 10.05 per cent. You can get 10 per cent gross interest with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's London (postal) share account and Scarborough's First Post. On Pounds 25,000, Bristol &amp; West's Balmoral account pays 10.9 per cent, North of England's Edinburgh account pays 10.75 per cent, while the rate at Confederation bank is 10.25 per cent on its Liquidity account. Other high rates are available from Leeds &amp; Holbeck (10.5 per cent) on its Albion postal account and Norwich &amp; Peterborough (10.3 per cent) on the Postmaster account. Notice accounts On Pounds 5,000, only Allied Trust Bank beats the postal rates, paying 10.91 per cent on its three month notice account; Teachers building society, which is run from a single office in Dorset to help members of the teaching profession with their mortgages, is paying 10.4 per cent on its Minster 90 (a 90 day notice account). The highest rates on Pounds 25,000 are from Allied Trust, 10.91 per cent; National Counties building society, paying 10.75 per cent on its 90 day notice account; City &amp; Metropolitan building society, Exeter bank, Julian Hodge bank and Greenwich building society are all paying 10.5 per cent gross. The first is a 60 day notice account, the others are 90 day accounts. Tessas Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts are a five year commitment. Interest is paid tax free subject to the capital being left untouched for the full five years The annual limits on deposits are Pounds 3,000 in the first year and Pounds 1,800 in the subsequent four years, subject to a Pounds 9,000 ceiling. Apart from the headline rate, investors should consider other factors. These include the minimum investment required, the effect of bonuses and any penalties involved in transferring to another operator. Remember that the worst that can happen if you withdraw capital from a Tessa is that you pay tax on the interest and have to close the account. Since many Tessa rates are higher than savings accounts, the canny saver can open a Tessa even if they are unlikely to last the full five year term. Allied Trust Bank, which is owned by Barclays Bank, has been paying a consistently high rate, now of 12.68 per cent on its Premier Tessa. However, you need to provide the full Pounds 9,000 upfront - the annual limits are put into the Tessa and the rest earns 10.36 per cent gross in a feeder account. Two months notice is required for a transfer, plus an administration fee of Pounds 25. National Counties has offered a consistently competitive rate since Tessas were launched. You have to put in the annual maximums to earn the present rate of 12 per cent. The notice period is 90 days. Cash Unit Trusts These offer money market returns by investing in the deposits of large banks. Rather than paying interest to unitholders, the value of the units rises steadily as the fund accumulates income. Current gross rates range between 9.5 and 9.9 per cent; in net terms, this is between 7.125 and 7.275 per cent. An investor who put in Pounds 10,000 at the start of the year would expect his holding to be worth about Pounds 10,720 at the end. Returns are paid net of basic rate tax, but non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax. Most cash unit trusts have no bid-offer spread; the only charge is an annual management charge which is deducted before the quoted yield. The advantage of such trusts is that they are likely to offer a return close to money market rates. There is a slight risk of loss of capital if a cash unit trust invests in a bank which fails, such as BCCI. The best cash unit trust over the year to August 1, according to Micropal, was Prudential Cash Haven with a net return of 8.33 per cent. FIXED RATE PRODUCTS Gilts Gilts are bonds issued by the UK government. Most pay a fixed rate of interest, with the exception of index-linked issues where the income rises in line with the Retail Prices index. Buying a gilt at current prices allows you to lock in a return of between 9 and 10 per cent. If interest rates fall, you will have an above-average income and a modest capital gain; but if rates rise, you will have a below-average income and a capital loss. Most gilts have a face value of 100 and will be repaid at that level (again, index-linked are an exception; their repayment value is linked to the RPI). So, if you buy a gilt priced at under 100 and hold it until it is repaid (the maturity date), you will be certain of a capital gain. Profits on gilts are exempt from capital gains tax; income tax is payable on the interest. However, a gilt trading at below 100 will offer a lower income; whereas if you buy a gilt trading above 100, you will receive a higher running income at the expense of a probable capital loss. National Savings The First Option Bond now pays a fixed rate for one year of 7.25 per cent net, equivalent to 9.67 per cent gross on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. The rate increases to 7.55 per cent net on Pounds 20,000 and above. Interest is paid net of basic rate tax; non-taxpayers can reclaim it. National Savings certificates are tax-free and are therefore well suited to higher rate taxpayers. The new 38th issue certificates, which go on sale from August 24, will pay 7.5 per cent per annum, if held for five years. The maximum investment has been cut to Pounds 5,000 from Pounds 7,500, although an additional Pounds 10,000 from matured certificates can be reinvested. A new series E of Capital Bonds, also available from August 24, will pay 10 per cent compound per annum when held for five years. These are particularly suitable for non-taxpayers as interest is paid gross. Taxpayers are liable to pay tax on the accrued interest each year. Tessas There are a limited number of fixed rate Tessas on the market. According to Moneyfacts, Britannia is paying the best rate - 10.25 per cent - but you have to find Pounds 8,250 for a feeder account. The penalty for early closure or a transfer is 90 days loss of interest; withdrawal of interest is not allowed. Confederation Bank offers 10 per cent on its fixed-rate Tessa provided you invest Pounds 8,350. The transfer or closure penalty is stiff, with a requirement for a six month notice period and loss of six months' interest. National &amp; Provincial will pay 9.7 per cent on a minimum of Pounds 100 in its fixed-rate Tessa. You suffer 180 days loss of interest for early closure or transfer. Guaranteed income bonds Buying a GIB involves investing a lump sum with an insurance company for a fixed period, and in return being paid a guaranteed rate of interest. The original sum is returned at the end of the period. The interest paid is net of basic rate income tax; higher rate taxpayers will normally have to pay the extra 15 per cent. The basic-rate tax cannot be reclaimed, so Gibs are not suitable for non-taxpayers. Interest can be paid at monthly intervals but the highest rates tend to be on those paying annual interest. The rate depends on the amount invested and the length of time the capital is to be tied up, usually one to five years. Rates are tracked regularly by Baronworth (081-518-1218). The highest rates available on Pounds 5,000 this week are: Acuma 7.16 per cent (one year); General Portfolio 6.99 per cent (two years), 7.15 per cent (three years) and 7.37 per cent (four years); Hill Samuel 7.6 per cent (five years). Better rates are available on bigger sums - see the table supplied by Moneyfacts on Page V. Building societies Most building society fixed-rate investments require a large initial deposit but on Pounds 500 you can get 10 per cent gross interest from the Portman building society on its one year Fixed Interest Bond and the same rate at National &amp; Provincial fixed until March 31 1995. The highest rate on Pounds 5,000 is from Chelsea building society which is paying 11.75 per cent gross on its Premier Account 111, fixed until October 1. The interest on Woolwich's Premium Investment account is 10.2 per cent gross on Pounds 25,000 and 10.5 per cent gross on Pounds 50,000. Both rates are fixed until January 1 1993.</p>

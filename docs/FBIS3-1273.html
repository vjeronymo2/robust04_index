Addressing IEC Chairman Justice Johann Kriegler and his  delegation in the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly, Mr Buthelezi  said: "You have come today with a long list of requests for full  participation in preparation for elections and the holding of  elections, with which we disagree".    He explained that the IFP had advised its members not to  vote  in the poll, while Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini had also  desisted from advising his subjects to vote. "We now face the  difficult realities that these decisions...are now going to have  to be adjusted to meet the requirements of your commission," he  told Judge Kriegler.    Mr Buthelezi said however that he was aware that the IEC  Chairman "can bring the full might of the law to bear upon us".  But, "nothing would suit the purposes of destabilising kwaZulu  more than IEC action against myself, the kwaZulu government, and  the IFP".    In terms of the IEC operating in the territory, the kwaZulu  cabinet had resolved, among others, that:     -  government buildings could be made available for election  purposes on a selective basis. This excluded buildings used for  essential services;    -  community based institutions and tribal authority buildings  could only be used if those communities or tribal authorities  gave their blessing;    -  damage to kwaZulu government property during elections would  be  the responsibility of the IEC; and,    -  both the kwaZulu Police and the SA Police jointly man polling  stations.       Mr Buthelezi was at pains to explain his difficulty in  trying  to reconcile his party position against the April poll and the  IEC's interests to secure free and fair elections for those who  wanted the vote.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAII'S CHOCOLATE EXPERIMENT;  </P> <P> COCOA COULD PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE FOR TROUBLED SUGAR GROWERS  </P> <P> Can Hershey Foods help give a Hawaiian punch to the beleaguered sugar growers  of the Aloha State?  </P> <P> The Pennsylvania candy maker has produced a test chocolate bar made from the  first cocoa beans ever to be grown on the islands. Sugar farmers have their  eyes on the cocoa, not the sweetener, in the five-pound Hawaiian chocolate bar  presented to Gov. John Waihee.  </P> <P> Cocoa beans might provide a viable alternative to sugar. Hammered by foreign  competition, artificial sweeteners and depressed prices, sugar growers are hard  pressed to diversify into new crops.  </P> <P> Hershey Foods has teamed up with Kalela Enterprises to explore the agricultural  and economic possibilities of growing cocoa beans in Hawaii. So far, their  joint venture, known as Hawaii Cocoa, has invested about $3 million in the 2  1/2-year-old project, which has about 400 acres under cultivation.  </P> <P> The first harvest last November produced about 15,000 pounds of the beans. "We  consider the first not worth selling. We're using it for tests," explained Jim  Walsh, president of Hawaii Cocoa. "We sent a lot of it to Hershey."  </P> <P> Hershey, which provides only technical expertise to Hawaii Cocoa, has developed  a chocolate using the Hawaiian beans, but it does not plan to use it in its  products. "We consider this to be very early in the experimental stage," said  Carl Andrews, a spokesman for the company in Hershey, Pa.  </P> <P> Hawaii's maximum annual production of cocoa beans is projected at 15,000 tons,  according to Andrews. That is minuscule compared to worldwide production of 2  million tons. Hershey, the largest cocoa user in the United States, imports its  cocoa from South America and Africa.  </P> <P> For Hawaii Cocoa, the idea is to produce a specialty or novelty chocolate  product unique to the islands. "What we're telling people is that in six  months, we'll start seeing it in better restaurants as desserts made from  Hawaiian chocolate," Walsh said. "In a year, it will be in better chocolate  stores. You'll see it in L.A. in three months."  </P> <P> The cocoa experiment began when Amfac, a major Hawaiian sugar producer and  former partner in Hawaii Cocoa, began a search for crop alternatives. "Hawaii  has a sugar problem," explained Walsh, "We have 235,000 acres in sugar, which  is primarily supported by price supports. It is the largest agricultural  industry in Hawaii, employs 7,000 and is endangered of going out of business in  1991" when the price supports are lifted.  </P> <P> The price supports at 21 cents a pound are running about twice as much as the  world sugar price. "That is quite a discrepancy," he pointed out.  </P></p>

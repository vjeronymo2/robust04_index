			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Futures plunge Fears of an imminent rise in UK base rates caused panic selling of short sterling futures yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. Massive volumes were traded and price movements were also exceptionally large. The December contract traded nearly 110,000 lots and there was a 48 basis point spread between the high and the low prices for the day. The December contract settled at 93.27, suggesting the market believes interest rates will rise by 1.5 percentage points by the end of the year. These developments over-shadowed the release of the US 2nd quarter GDP figure, which rose by 3.7 per cent. This was below market expectations and this took some of the sheen off the dollar which had risen above Y100 on Thursday evening for the first time in a month. The dollar finished in London at Y100.175, down from a high for the day of Y100.57 . Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5888, off a high of DM1.5985 before the GDP release. The prospect of higher interest rates bolstered sterling which rose more than two pfennigs on the day to finish in London at DM2.4413 from DM2.4195. It was also  1/2 cent firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5366 from Dollars 1.5319. The market's problems arose from confusing interest rate signals emanating from the Bank of England. In its weekly Treasury bill operations, the Bank accepted a highest bid of 5.7558 per cent -  1/2 per cent above the current base rate, and around  3/4 of a percentage point up on the week. This led the market to believe that the Bank of England was signalling an imminent tightening of policy. In its daily operations, however, the Bank provided assistance at the established rate of 5 5/32 per cent. This left the market totally confused as to what the Bank was trying to tell it. The net effect of yesterday's transactions is that the Bank has borrowed money at 5.75 per cent and lent it at 5 5/32 per cent. This is an untenable situation beyond the very short term, and either market rates will have to drop back towards the Bank rate, or it will have to be raised. Analysts were split as to whether the Bank was trying to signal higher rates, or had made a mess of the Treasury bill tender by not realising the confusion it would create by accepting a 5.75 per cent rate. Although interbank rates had climbed sharply during the days following the CBI survey, and a buoyant purchasing managers index yesterday, the Bank's hands were not tied. It could either have pulled the auction, as it has done in the past, or intervened on its own account to knock out the highest bids. Traders in the futures market said the market went 'absolutely ballistic'. Trading conditions were 'right up there with the ERM chaos' said one dealer. Sterling rose on hopes of higher rates, but analysts warned that it was vulnerable to a heavy sell-off next week should the Bank disappoint the market by not tightening policy. Not only would rates be lower than expected, but the Bank's credibility would be damaged. Similar confusion in February about the handling of a base rate rise led to heavy selling of sterling.</p>

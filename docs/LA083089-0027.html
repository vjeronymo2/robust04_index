			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DETERRENTS TO SLAUGHTER  </P> <P> Celebrations, such as birthdays, tend to bring out the best in people. But the  emotions that soar during these normally happy occasions can also swing low and  turn dangerous.  </P> <P> Sadly for Maria Navarro, her 27th birthday party in East Los Angeles turned  into a blood bath as her estranged husband, Raymond Navarro, burst in and shot  and killed her, her two aunts and her friend. He killed them after Maria  Navarro had done her best to keep away a man with a history of threats and  violence. She got a temporary restraining order and called 911 after a  brother-in-law called her with a grim message: "Your husband is coming to kill  you." The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told a frantic Maria Navarro  that officers were helpless until her husband showed up to make good on his  threat. He did.  </P> <P> The most tragic aspect of these murders is that there were some things  dispatchers could have done. One possibility is obvious: Since Navarro told the  department that she had a temporary restraining order against her estranged  husband, that information should have prompted the dispatch of a unit to drive  by. Since 1984, New York City police have been required to respond to all 911  domestic cases.  </P> <P> There is another less obvious but valuable resource that the sheriffs failed to  employ: Alittle-used state law allows for something called a telephonic  temporary restraining order that makes it possible for officers to arrest a  potentially violent person before he strikes.  </P> <P> According to Hugh McIsaac, director of family court services of the Los Angeles  County Superior Court, this is how it would typically work: After a threat of  violence, a woman would call 911. The law enforcement agency would dispatch an  officer, then call a family court services "referee," who can be reached  nights, weekends and holidays, and ask for a temporary restraining order that  would be in effect until 5 p.m. the next day or the next court day. If the  person who made the threat showed up while the officer was there, he could be  arrested on the spot if he refused to leave. In Los Angeles County alone, there  were nearly 40,000 domestic violence- related calls in 1987. Yet this year  through July, telephone restraining orders were requested only 39 times.  </P> <P> Getting a restraining order by phone takes only 5 to 10 minutes. Enough time,  perhaps, to save a life. Maybe not. Law enforcement authorities argue that a  person with a history of violence, in possession of the ubiquitous handgun and  hellbent on murder will find a way to do it. That may well be. But we can't  help thinking of what might have been for Maria Navarro, her two aunts, her  friend -- and thousands of women like them.  </P></p>

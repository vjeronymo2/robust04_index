			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (8): People in glasshouses . . . - Conservatories / If you are thinking of building a conservatory, Gerald Cadogan has some advice If you missed Chelsea Flower Show, you have not lost your chance to see one of the show's best houses in glass. Alitex is giving its glasshouse to the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, in Surrey, for the national collection of carnations which the society and the National Carnation Society maintain. It is now being reassembled and will reopen early next month. We think of conservatories as a wholeheartedly Victorian comfort. In fact, they go back to the 17th century, as greenhouses for rearing tender plants. Conservatories were for rearing orphans and foundlings. (The use of the word conservatoire - conservatory in the US - for a music school has the same origin: the Italians started music conservatories in Naples in 1537, teaching the orphans to sing and play.) In the 19th century in late Georgian times, conservatories caught on. In 1824 Walter Scott wrote in Redgauntlet of rendering 'the parlour more cheerful by opening one end into a small conservatory I have never before seen this'. They stayed popular in Victoria's reign, when the advances in glass and iron technology led to such free-standing glories as Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the Palm House at Kew Gardens, or the conservatory at Mentmore, Mayer Rothschild's grand stately home, which linked the morning room and the smoking room. The development of central heating meant that, regardless of the weather, these house-annexes could be used to rear the exotic plants that poured into Britain from the rest of the world. No wonder Charlotte M. Yonge gushed in The Daisy Chain: 'A real bower for a maiden of romance, with its rich green fragrance in the midst of winter A picture in a dream A fairy land, where no care, or grief, or weariness could come.' Such attitudes explain a traditional function of conservatories. Lush and warm, and full of hopeful light even in winter, they are ideal places to propose in. If you are adding a conservatory to your home, make sure you have the technology which allows automatic control of light and ventilation. If possible, have a look at several companies and ask what is included in the price: preparation of site, delivery, erection, etc. Prices below are rough guides, and do not include VAT. Check also if planning permission and / or conservation area consent are needed. If the host-house is listed, you probably need listed building consent for altering the character of the house. This brings a bonus. The work should be free from VAT. Most important of all, especially if you choose the more personal and expensive companies, think about what you will use the new room for. 'One must make sure the layout works,' say Peter Marston, of Marston &amp; Langinger, author of the useful The Book of the Conservatory (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 1992, Pounds 18.99). 'Conservatories usually go at the back, which is often a jumble of pipes. So one has to think out the arrangement of the house, such as access to the kitchen, and the plumbing. For Pounds 40,000, you do not buy just a conservatory. In London it may be a dining room. And for Victorian houses in the country, which usually have plenty of space, you are buying a different type of room.' Alitex (Alton: 0420-82860) is primarily a maker of glasshouses, which includes a Victorian-style range with outside cold frames as an extra. Besides its new glasshouse for Wisley, it has rebuilt the Victorian glasshouses at Sir George Staunton Country Park at Havant in Hampshire, using old photographs and paintings. Prices for glasshouses start at around Pounds 7,000. The Wisley building would cost around Pounds 11,000. Some private customers spend Pounds 20,000-Pounds 40,000. Amdega (Darlington: 0325-468522, or US: 800-9220110) is the largest maker, offering standard designs that can be adapted. Typical prices run from Pounds 2,947 for a porch to Pounds 19,183 for a Gothic design with a clerestory lantern, and do not include installation or building work. Glass Houses (London: 071-607 6071) is unusual. It is basically an architectural practice designing every conservatory individually for its host-house. It takes about three months from order to completion. The company also specialises in orangeries (which differ from conservatories as they have some stone in them), roof lanterns and summer houses and garden pavilions. Their cheapest conservatory is about Pounds 10,000. Some cost Pounds 100,000. A typical price is Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 30,000. Marston &amp; Langinger (London: 071-823 6829) finds that all its host-houses are pre-first world war and 30 per cent of them are listed buildings. Prices range from Pounds 10,000 to over Pounds 300,000. An excellent handbook covers a full variety of smart architectural designs and details, and furnishings. Oak Leaf (York: 0904-690 401 or US: 800-226 1248) also designs individually, in a modern style as well as Victorian, using Canadian western red cedar. Oak Leaf recently rebuilt much of the 19th century conservatory of Broughton Hall in Yorkshire. Typical price for a 20 x 25 ft conservatory: Pounds 22,000 (including erection and leadwork). Portland Conservatories (Salford: 061-745 7920) is another maker of individually designed conservatories. Prices start at Pounds 8,000. Room Outside (Goodwood: 0243-776563) emphasises the durability of its individually-designed conservatories, which cost from Pounds 4,000 to, say, Pounds 30,000. A typical price is Pounds 15,000. The company also has a cheaper range called Highlife, from around Pounds 3,500. Two important fitted accessories are blinds and tiles. Here are some stockists: Blinds. Appeal Blinds (Bristol: 0272-637734) makes blinds to keep the heat in or out, according to the season. It uses several artificial fabrics and pinoleum - reeded pine wood which has been made in France for 100 years, and costs from Pounds 95 a square metre (including fitting). A thermostatic motor is available from Pounds 680. Tiles. Sussex Terracotta (Burgess Hill: 0444-241236) produces hand-made tiles in orange, yellow and brown Wealden clays dug from a pit at an old brickworks. As the tiles dry for several weeks before firing, they are all slightly different but mix well and wear well. To design your own floor costs from about Pounds 44 a square metre. Paris Ceramics (071-371 7778) sells tiles from all over the world, and old tiles that have been salvaged. Finally, those looking for a house in London with a large conservatory could consider 8 Monmouth Road, W2, on offer from Winkworth (071-727 3227) for Pounds 485,000.</p>

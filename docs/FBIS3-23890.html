			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Yemuzov, by Z. Malbakhova: "A. Yemuzov: </F> There Is No Alternative to Goodneighborliness, Friendship, and  Cooperation"]    [Text] In April of last year, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs was created in Kabardino-Balkaria. The formation of that  foreign-policy department was not only a step in the development  of the republic's state system, but also a vital necessity that  was dictated by the new political realities. The role and  importance of the ministry are difficult to overevaluate. It has  been given the functions of using diplomatic and political means  to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, security,  inviolability of the republic's borders, and its political and  economic-trade and other interests, both within the framework of  the Russian Federation and on the international scene, and of  creating favorable conditions for carrying out the reforms that  the nation needs.    We have asked A. G. Yemuzov, KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria  Republic] minister of foreign affairs, to discuss the  high-priority trends in the work performed by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, its affairs  and plans, and to answer a number of other questions.    [Yemuzov] Taking into consideration the political situation  that has been created in the Caucasus, the KBR MID [Ministry of  Foreign Affairs] considers that one of its most important tasks  is the creation of a "goodneighborliness zone" around  Kabardino-Balkaria. With this purpose, Treaties of friendship  and goodneighborliness have been signed with the Republic of  Adygey, the Karachayevo-Cherkess Republic, Stavropol Kray, the  Republic of Dagestan, and the Republic of Kalmykia -- Khalmg  Tangch. Treaties with Krasnodar Kray and Rostov Oblast have been  prepared and coordinated. In order to restore the economic and  cultural relations with subjects of the Russian Federation, a  Treaty has been signed with Yaroslavl Oblast, and one with Perm  Oblast has been extended. Treaties with the Chuvash Republic and  with Tambov and Donetsk oblasts are being prepared for signing.  Close contact is being maintained with Abkhazia, including  contact along the diplomatic channel -- through the permanent  representative of that republic in KBR.    Any understanding is always taking the first steps toward  cooperation. The further development of relations depends on  many factors. But what is required of us is that the initial  ties are well thought-out and have the potential for growth. If  one speaks about concretizing the content of the treaties, the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs has rendered assistance in  concluding an agreement among Adygey, Kabardino-Balkaria, and  Karachayevo-Chekesia concerning cooperation in training  specialists with higher education, and the Treaty of cooperation  between the KBR and Adygey ministries of the press and  information in creating a single information space.    [Malbakhova] Do you see any difference between politics and  diplomacy?    [Yemuzov] I would not oppose them to one another, since a  country's foreign policy is a continuation of its domestic  policy. Politics and diplomacy are two sides of the same coin.  Ideally, any politician must be a diplomat, and vice versa. If  that is not so, then large mistakes can occur in the work being  performed by both of them.    [Malbakhova] What role has your ministry been called upon to  play in the matter of restoring foreign-economic ties?    [Yemuzov] At the present time the KBR Committee on  Foreign-Economic Ties is working on these problems. But,  inasmuch as the question has already been raised, I can reply.    For diplomacy, the normal role is that of an icebreaker that  is opening up a sea path in the shoreless ocean of world  business. One of the basic tasks assigned to our ministry  consists in creating the best conditions for the work of the  entrepreneur with a foreign partner. However, the misfortune --  but not the blame -- of the subjects of the Russian Federation  consists in the fact that all the foreign-economic activity used  to be centralized and used to be carried out by way of Moscow.  As a result of this policy, the outlying areas lack various  capabilities, experience, and a sense of business organization.  Today our initiative finds support and understanding in Moscow  --it is precisely here that one can see the pledge of success  and stability in the business and other spheres.    [Malbakhova] Could you discuss the path along which our  republic should proceed in restoring foreign-economic relations?  What can we offer our foreign partners?    [Yemuzov] When restoring business relations it is necessary  to act not spontaneously, but in a "normal sequence," that is,  in accordance with the traditional scheme that is well known in  international practice -- "trade-- tourism -- investments."    In this question it is not only our republic, but all of  Russia, that is displaying impatience, wanting to begin "at the  end" --with investments. Actually, the normal sequence probably  would not be successful. If only because we are facing an  abnormal situation. Even in order to begin to develop trade and  tourism seriously, it is necessary to have investments in a  system of hotels, sanitoriums, rest homes, tourist centers,  transportation, communications, supporting production entities,  etc. Consequently, we could propose to our foreign partners that  they take out long-term leases for some of our sanitoriums and  recreational centers, and that we operate others jointly. In  both instances it would be on mutually advantageous terms. We  could propose to our foreign partners the output from a number  of our industrial enterprises, for example, the Tyrnyauz  Combine, the diamond cutting-tool plant, the synthetic leather  combine, as well as everything that nature has lavishly bestowed  on us -- the therapeutic factors of our health resort.    [Malbakhova] You are a doctor of sciences and a professor,  you have been in many countries, and you have a large amount of  work experience abroad. Last year, nevertheless, you attended  classes in Moscow. Could you discuss that?    [Yemuzov] It's never too late for anyone to get an  education.  Therefore, actually, in 1993 I took special training at the  one-year refresher courses for managerial diplomatic cadres at  the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, where the subjects taught were questions of  international law, diplomatic protocol, the concept of the  Russian Federation's foreign policy, the philosophy of politics  and diplomacy, foreign languages, and other disciplines. I  completed the courses three months ahead of time, with  distinction.    [Malbakhova] What are the realistic possibilities that the  KBR will appear on the world scene?    [Yemuzov] Last year the KBR Ministry of Foreign Affairs did  a  definite amount of work to establish relations and strengthen  the existing ones with the distant foreign countries and their  subjects. In March 1993 a KBR delegation made an official visit  to the Turkish Republic. The delegation was received by Minister  of Foreign Affairs (Hikmet Cetin). He was given a message from  KBR President V. M. Kokov to the President of the Turkish  Republic. In the course of the visit, Agreements were signed --  between the Union of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and  Exchanges of Turkey, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, and the  KBR. There were meetings with activists from associations of  people of Cherkess nationality in Ankara and Istanbul.    As a result of the preliminary negotiations between the  Kabardino-Balkaria government and the Alberta (Canada)  commissioner for culture and tourism, a Treaty of friendship and  cooperation was signed. Agreements concerning the formation of  sister cities Nalchik and Kaiseri (Turkey), as well as a Treaty  of friendship and cooperation between them, were signed.    Ministry employees were part of delegations that went to  Turkey, Syria, and Jordan to carry out work to expand ties in  the area of economics, culture, and education. Meetings were  held with a delegation of the International Islamic "Salvation"  organization from Saudi Arabia, headed by Imam Abdul-Hamid Jafar  Dagestani. Three meetings were held with secretaries of the  American Embassy and embassy employees. We were visited by a  French delegation from the French Ministry of Defense, workers  from the Israeli Embassy, and a plenipotentiary from the  "Sokhnut" organization in the North Caucasus, as well as the  commissioner for culture and tourism from the province of  Alberta, Canada.    Assistance was provided in the creation of six  commercial-production firms by compatriots. As a result,  equipment with a total value of more than $200,000 (U.S.) was  shipped into the republic.    We feel that there is no alternative to goodneighborliness,  friendship, and cooperation. Otherwise we shall not succeed in  getting out of the crisis and guaranteeing the normal  socioeconomic development of our republic. Therefore we shall  continue to increase the work in this area.    [Malbakhova] So far as we know, the KBR Ministry of Foreign  Affairs engages in problems of repatriating our compatriots.  What do you consider to be the chief factor in that work?    [Yemuzov] In order to render realistic assistance to  compatriots who are returning to their homeland, information  pertaining to the restoration or acquisition of citizenship has  been systematized. That is one of the important factors in our  work, since it is precisely in this matter that difficulties  have arisen. Our ministry prepared 285 findings at the OVIR  [Visa and Registration Department] of the KBR Ministry of  Foreign Affairs to provide permits for residency in the  republic; received more than 150 foreign citizens with various  questions; and legalized 69 documents. The Commission on  Questions of Citizenship, under the republic's President,  considered 104 appropriate cases. That means that the fates of  those individuals were determined.    [Malbakhova] Could you discuss briefly the basic areas of  your work during the new year?    [Yemuzov] If we are to speak about the program for our work  during the current year, it is extremely broad. I shall not  enumerate the measures that have been planned. That would take  up too much newspaper space. We shall continue the work of  restoring and strengthening the traditional relations of  goodneighborliness, friendship, and cooperation with the peoples  of the North Caucasus and the other regions of Russia. We are  taking specific steps to establish new ties and to strengthen  the already existing ones with the nearby and distant foreign  countries, and have planned the preparation and carrying out of  political actions aimed at resolving conflicts and moot  questions and at stabilizing the sociopolitical situation in our  region.    We intend to direct special attention to analytical work, to  studying the domestic political situation in KBR, and to the  placement of forces in the region. Our recommendations to the  republic government will be formulated on that basis.    In a word, the main task of the KBR Ministry of Foreign  Affairs is the protection of the republic's national interests  by diplomatic means and methods.</p>

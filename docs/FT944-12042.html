			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Power cable conduct The world's first prototype superconductor power cable is to be made by a consortium of companies and laboratories with backing from the US Department of Energy. American Superconductor, a leader in the development of superconducting wires, Pirelli Cable, a division of the Pirelli group, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), which is funded by US electrical utility companies, will undertake the project with researchers at three of the US National Laboratories. The goal is to make a 30m superconductor underground power transmission cable, to be tested under real operating conditions by EPRI. The Dollars 5.8m (Pounds 3.7m) project will be funded jointly by the Department of Energy and the companies. Superconductor materials lose resistance to the flow of electric current at low temperatures. The first metal superconductors, discovered early this century, had to be cooled to nearly 4` Kelvin, or or -454`F. In 1986, however, 'high temperature superconductor' (HTS) ceramics were discovered. These materials exhibit superconductivity at temperatures up to 130`K or -225`F, substantially reducing the costs of cooling. The cable will be made by stranding HTS wires round a hollow core. The superconducting material is cooled by running liquid nitrogen through the cable. 'We are truly approaching the commercialisation of HTS power transmission cables,' says Giuseppe Morchio, general manager of Pirelli's cable operations. 'The cables demonstrated under this programme will show the improved performance and reliability that HTS technology can provide.' The prototype cable will be able to carry more than twice the power of conventional copper cables of similar size. Ultimately, superconducting cables are expected to be able to carry many times the power of copper cables with lower energy losses.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS CONTEND HONECKER AND TOP AIDES ARE TOO ILL FOR TRIAL;  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY: THE FORMER HARD-LINE RULER IS CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION. HE HAS  CANCER.  </P> <P> Ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker and his former key aides are too feeble  to answer corruption charges and will likely never go to trial, prosecutors  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> A team of "prominent, independent" doctors, including a psychiatrist, examined  the cancer-stricken Honecker and his deputies, said Dieter Platt, spokesman for  the state prosecutor.  </P> <P> "The final decision is up to the court," Platt told The Times in a telephone  interview, "but at this point, it (prosecution) doesn't look likely."  </P> <P> Only two of the 10 former Politburo and parliamentary members under criminal  charges are in jail, Platt said. The rest, including former Prime Minister  Willi Stoph, are considered too sickly or senile.  </P> <P> Honecker, 77, is recuperating in a village outside Berlin from surgery to  remove a tumor. Doctors have advised that he be moved from the cramped garret  room where a village pastor gave has given sanctuary, but angry citizens  hounded him away from a more spacious government villa.  </P> <P> "Feelings here are very complicated," Platt said. "For many reasons, not the  least of which is German character, the people long for accountability."  </P> <P> Hundreds of citizens have called or written the prosecutor, Platt said.  </P> <P> On the streets of East Berlin, people expressed anger at the possibility of no  trials.  </P> <P> "I'm not satisfied," said auto mechanic Andreas Kloebbe, 30. "It's not right.  How come they're all suddenly at death's door? They weren't too old or too sick  to commit the crimes."  </P> <P> Werner Michael, 68, a Leipzig resident, agreed.  </P> <P> "They had so many luxuries and lived so well, while all the time the majority  of people were struggling for a decent life," he said. "Yes, there should be  trials -- fair trials, though you could say we were all guilty. We're all  part-victim and part-participants."  </P> <P> Such sentiments are common here these days. East Germans find themselves  curiously frozen in history, unable to fully account for their Stalinist past  or fully plan their democratic future.  </P> <P> First steps toward forming a new government have proved shaky since the  country's first free elections March 18. Rumors of secret-police collaboration  have dogged newly elected Parliament members and stalled coalition talks, which  are now scheduled to begin in earnest today between the Christian Democrats and  the runner-up Social Democrats.  </P> <P> Grass-roots citizen groups have called for mass demonstrations today to demand  that all 400 deputies in the new Volkskammer, or Parliament, be checked for any  ties to the dismantled Stasi security police. The state prosecutor's office has  said that such an investigation must be left to the Volkskammer itself, since  deputies enjoy immunity.  </P> <P> Officials say the Stasis once numbered 85,000, with 109,000 informants. Files  were kept on about 6 million of the country's 16 million citizens, whose  everyday lives were often scrutinized for even the slightest hint of disloyalty  to the hard-line regime.  </P> <P> The former Stasi chief, Erich Mielke, is among the ex-Politburo members  reportedly unfit for trial. The 82-year-old general, described as "a senile old  man" by deputy prosecutor Lothar Reuter in the West German daily newspaper  Sueddeutsche Zeitung, is accused of wrongfully imprisoning people and theft.  The latter charge stems from the routine Stasi interception of mail, Platt  said.  </P> <P> Treason charges were dropped earlier this week against Honecker and his aides,  but they are still charged with misuse of power and corruption. The others  include former Economics Minister Guenter Mittag, who remains imprisoned but is  said to suffer from severe diabetes; former Parliament President Horst  Sindermann, 74, who has heart disease, and former Central Committee secretary  and Politburo member Hermann Axen, 74.  </P> <P> The prosecutor's office declined to provide further details about their health  problems, citing doctor-patient confidentiality.  </P> <P> No court dates have been set, but the official news agency ADN said a final  decision about their fitness to stand trial is likely next month.  </P></p>

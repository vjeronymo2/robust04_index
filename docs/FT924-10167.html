			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Treasury seeks to retain fiscal grip THE TREASURY is already laying plans to ensure that it keeps tight control of fiscal policy when the reformed budget system - combining government decisions on taxation and on spending - is introduced in just over a year. The department is pleased with the work of the new cabinet committee on public spending, which includes heavyweights Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke. However it is adamant that the committee's role will not be extended to fiscal policy, although the unified system will make the trade-off between spending and revenue measures more explicit. One minister said: 'There will be no committee enabling Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine to suggest tax changes.' The change in timing, with the Budget statement made in early December rather than mid-March, also means that increases in excise duties will no longer be introduced with just a couple of hours' notice. Ministers are aware that raising duties on alcohol just a few weeks before Christmas would be politically inept. Instead, increases are likely to be imposed from January. Most tax changes will still come into effect on April 1, when, under the new system, parliament will already have passed the finance bill. The Treasury views with some anxiety the greater opportunity that this will give MPs to force changes in the proposals, especially since the Tory majority has been reduced so much - to 21 - since the idea was put forward in the pre-election budget. In spite of their determination not to allow departmental ministers into the budget-making process, Treasury ministers still believe the new arrangements will mean a loosening of the traditional secrecy surrounding the budget. That is unless the government decides that it likes the idea of a chancellor unable to deliver a speech at the annual party conference in October because he is in pre-Budget 'purdah'.</p>

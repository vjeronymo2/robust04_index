			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Company law reform fails in Brazilian congress Brazil's congress has failed to approve a constitutional amendment designed to make Brazilian and foreign companies equal before the law. Under the widely criticised 1988 constitution, Brazilian companies enjoy some advantages over foreign-controlled competitors, and these will now be maintained. The decision, which foreign and business interests said was disappointing, is the latest in a series of setbacks for Brazil's constitutional revision, under way since last October. The revision process, seen by many analysts as crucial to restoring the government's ability to govern, has so far failed to make any meaningful changes. Congress voted on the latest proposal late on Wednesday but fell three votes short of the necessary 293 for the measure to be approved. As a result, it will lapse. The lack of support, blamed on congressional apathy and internal party politics, also threatens other proposals to modernise the economy, such as allowing entry to foreign controlled mining companies. Proposals to open up Brazil's petroleum and telecommunications monopolies have virtually been shelved. Party leaders, who have been unable and sometimes unwilling to mobilise their parliamentarians to vote because of electoral considerations, were due to meet again yesterday to try to agree a basic list of constitutional amendments. But the period reserved for the revision, which lasts until the end of this month, is nearly over and few if any important changes are likely. The law which Wednesday's vote maintained establishes that Brazilian companies with Brazilian capital are assured benefits and protections, theoretically temporary, to develop 'activities considered strategic'. It also establishes that government agencies buying goods and services should give preference to Brazilian companies.</p>

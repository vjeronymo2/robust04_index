He blamed that on "the improper editing of the  program, as a result of which his phrases were taken out of  context, and that distorted their meaning." Despite that,  Poltoranin brought apologies to "all who could have been  affected by his words.    According to a spokesman for the faction, Poltoranin had to  give explanations on a demand from a number of faction officials  because of the public response to one of his statements. He  declared on television several days ago: "Here in Russia,  newspapers have always written in Russian. Today, in all this  bacchanalia a new language of the press is being spread. I call  it "camp Ivrit," an explosive mixture of russophobia, hatred for  traditions, lies, and contempt for human dignity. If that flow  goes further, we will simply blow up the nation and cause a huge  tide of anti-semitism."    In the words of a popular Russian TV commentator, the  reaction of the public and press has been prompt and  unequivocal: Poltoranin's remark on "camp Ivrit" smacks  disgustingly of anti-semitism.    At the end of the session, the leadership of the "Russia's  Choice" faction asked its members to be as tactful as possible  in their statements and always think before they say anything,  especially on ethnic matters.</p>

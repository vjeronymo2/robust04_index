			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Basim Abu-Sumayyah in "the occupied territories"] </F>   [Excerpt] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, a Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] official in Gaza, has stated that Israeli officials'  statements that the Hamas movement receives funds from Saudi  Arabia are groundless slander to bring pressure to bear on Saudi  Arabia. In reply to a question by Radio Monte Carlo, al-Zahhar  said that Saudi Arabia, as a government, has not offered any  financial assistance to the Hamas Movement. Al-Zahhar said that  Saudi Arabia is committed to the Arab stand of supporting the  PLO.    Al-Zahhar explained that Hamas receives donations from  private persons as Zakat [alms tax] funds, which are collected  from Muslims and offered to the mujahidin in all parts of the  world. These also include donations to the poor, and to the  families of martyrs and detainees. He said that these donations  are received from many countries, not just from Saudi Arabia and  are not government funds. [passage omitted]</p>

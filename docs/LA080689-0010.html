			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAINTING THE LANDSCAPE  </P> <P> Re: Elizabeth Becker's review of Susan Fromberg Schaeffer's "Buffalo Afternoon"  (Book Review, June 11), Where were Richard Eder, Carolyn See or Charles  Champlin when we needed them? What does Becker, an expert on the Vietnam War,  know about the art of fiction writing? Has she ever read Schaeffer's previous  works, such as "Anya," "Love," or "Madness of a Seduced Woman"? Has she ever  written a novel?  </P> <P> Becker seemed overly concerned about the author's inaccuracies regarding facts  of the war and the author's inability to give the right answers to the problems  the war created. As a fiction wrier, this shouldn't be Schaeffer's  responsibility. She is an artist painting the landscape the way she sees it.  She is allowed that freedom. Schaeffer, a fine writer, deserves better.  </P> <P> IRV HONER  </P> <P> STUDIO CITY  </P></p>

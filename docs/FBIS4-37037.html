			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 15 Jun (MENA)--The Central Cairo Prosecution  Office will issue a decision tomorrow morning, Thursday,  concerning the continued detention of 33 lawyers, including two  members of the Bar Association's board. The lawyers are held in  custody in connection with investigations concerning the  demonstration that took place at the Bar Association on 17 May.  In another development, Higher State Security Public Attorney  'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf today decided to remand Ahmad Nasir, a  former member of the Bar Association's board, and four other  lawyers for 15 days pending investigations. The attorney  accused the defendants of distributing leaflets hostile to the  regime and urging lawyers to demonstrate and disturb public  order. The lawyers were arrested after distributing leaflets at  South Cairo court during the questioning by Central Cairo  Prosecution investigators of some of the lawyers detained in  connection with the demonstration at the Bar Association on 17  May.    [Paris AFP in English at 1900 GMT on 15 June in a  Cairo-datelined item adds the following:    ["Egyptian security services have arrested five lawyers just  hours after the prosecutor's office refused to release 33 others  being held on public order charges, a human rights body said  Wednesday.    ["The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said the five  were arrested overnight and condemned the measure, saying it  could only aggravate the tension between the government and the  bar association.    ["Earlier the prosecutor retained in custody 33 lawyers  arrested during a rally organised by the bar association to  protest the death in custody of colleague 'Abd-al-Harith Madani,  a legal source said.    ["Most of the 38 now being held belong to the outlawed but  tolerated Moslem Brotherhood.    ["The human rights group said the lawyers had been accused  of  "disturbing public order, inciting demonstrations and holding  leaflets they intended to distribute.    ["In a statement it condemned the fact that such acts were  banned although they "form part of the right to non-violent  expression.    ["The group also called on the government to release its  findings into Madani's death. Lawyers have charged Madani was  tortured to death in April, but the prosecutor's office has said  he suffered an asthma attack."]</p>

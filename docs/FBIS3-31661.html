According to foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman, Boross  told Kozyrev that Budapest looks forward to the visit of Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.    Regarding the south Slav crisis, Boross stressed Hungary is  glad that the planned military intervention in Bosnia had become  unnecessary, and recognizes the role Russia played in this.    Kozyrev expressed the hope that Russia and Hungary would  soon  work out a number of agreements giving business links a new  impetus. Recent positive movement in bilateral economic ties  provides a good basis for Chernomyrdin's trip to Hungary, he  added.    The Russian foreign minister sees good chances for  ratification of the Hungarian-Russian basic treaty, which  complies with Russian interests.    Kozyrev concluded his two-day state visit to Hungary and  left  Budapest today.</p>

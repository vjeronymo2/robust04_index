			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: The impossible can be done at once, but miracles take longer - Shareholders, bondholders and 60 banks all had interests to protect. Maggie Urry unravels the saga of Brent Walker's financial restructuring LITTLE SHORT of miraculous, was the final verdict of Brent Walker's chairman on the group's Pounds 1.65bn financial restructuring, completed on the last day of March. As other companies - like Heron, Olympia &amp; York and Speyhawk - begin the same process, there are lessons to be learned from the Brent Walker experience. The restructuring plan - the biggest in UK corporate history - envisages the group trading its way to a position by the end of 1997 where it can repay or refinance its debt again on a normal commercial basis. Like so many events in the 18-month-long process of sorting out the leisure and property group's financial difficulties, the restructuring was completed at the eleventh hour. A delay beyond midnight on March 31, when shareholder approval for the restructuring ran out, could have pushed the group into receivership. From the autumn of 1990, when Brent Walker's difficulties became apparent, until the restructuring was completed, the threat of receivership hung over the group, its 14,000-plus employees, its unsecured trade creditors, and its shareholders. There was no doubt that receivership would leave the banks little, and the other interested parties nothing. Throughout the process, banks were calculating whether they would be better off approving a refinancing or calling in a receiver. Mr John Leach, Brent Walker finance director, says that, even in the days before the banks signed the final restructuring plan, they were reworking their sums on the value of the two options. What made the company capable of salvation, according to Mr Nick Lyle, a partner in Touche Ross, the accountant, was that it had two businesses - its pubs and its betting office chain - trading profitably and generating cash. Mr Lyle, who headed the team employed by the banks to help produce a business plan for the company, says that these two operations could service a bit of the debt and hold out hope that one day they would be worth enough to repay the principal. By comparison, he says, on an insolvency basis 'the numbers looked pretty disappointing'. A forced seller in the middle of a recession would get little for the businesses. The task of sorting out the mess was phenomenal. But even so, there is a belief among many of the participants that much time was wasted along the way. Indeed the original plan was for the restructuring to be finished by February last year, three months after the company's banks agreed to a standstill on the debt in November 1990. The restructuring plan was thrashed out by June last year but it took 10 months to get it agreed by shareholders, bondholders and banks. In the period between, the debt mounted as interest rolled up. When the standstill was signed, debt stood at Pounds 1.4bn but by the end it had reached Pounds 1.65bn. The business plan written in spring last year had to be rewritten by the autumn as trading conditions deteriorated. One of the group's advisers blames 'the intransigence and inefficiency of the banks. A lot of issues which could have been settled in a day or two took weeks to resolve.' The greatest problem was the large number of banks involved and the variety of their interests. This was inevitable given the way Brent Walker had financed its expansion. The story of how Mr George Walker, one-time boxer, built the group through the 1980s is now well known. A series of acquisitions - such as the Pounds 685m purchase of the William Hill betting office chain from Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing company, late in 1989 - and property deals like the developments at Le Touquet in France and Puerto Sherry in Spain - left the group with a range of different banks, with different exposures, terms and security. In all there were about 60 main bank lenders, with exposures ranging from less than Pounds 1m to more than Pounds 100m, as well as bank groups such as those in France and Spain which lent on particular property developments. This became a common problem in the 1980s as old-fashioned relationship banking was undermined by competition between banks frantic to lend. One foreign bank, says Mr Nicholas Ward, Brent Walker's group managing director, had opened a London office and headhunted a three-person team from a bank which had already lent to Brent Walker. One of the team's first moves in its new home was to ring Brent Walker and offer a loan. The company found that it was usually the banks with the smallest loans which caused the biggest problems. But the leading banks with the larger exposures could not buy out the small ones without other banks wanting to get out too. Lord Kindersley, who became Brent Walker's chairman in January last year, says that when he arrived he thought that the banks would have a common aim. But, he says: 'You would not have been aware of an identity of interest from the difficulties raised along the route.' Mr Lyle says that the banks involved came from all over the world and had 'different cultures, different lending philosophies and different attitudes'. Two of them were close to insolvency themselves. Many of the banks, he says, had not done a detailed assessment of Brent Walker, but merely lent because they knew that if they did not, then another bank would. Those philosophical differences were on top of the variety of commercial interests the banks had. 'Some banks were better placed than others,' says Mr Lyle, 'some had security over a particular asset and could see that asset covering their debt.' All the banks had to be persuaded to take a common view. This divergence between the banks was most obvious in the case of William Hill. Brent Walker had bought William Hill using an off-balance sheet company, which had a Pounds 350m loan from a syndicate of 30 banks, of which 17 were also in the main 47-bank group. But the interests of the two sets did not always coincide. As one of the two core businesses, William Hill is an essential source of cash and future value for the lenders to Brent Walker. But banks which had only lent to William Hill felt that they owed nothing to the Brent Walker banks. Those which were in both would want to favour one side or the other depending where their larger exposure was. 'A lot of the last three months has been wasted on William Hill,' says one adviser. Trading had deteriorated as the recession worsened and people cut down on gambling. The non-Brent Walker banks in the syndicate, which had lent about 40 per cent of the total, threatened to pull out if they did not get extra protection. In the end a compromise was reached under which the maturity date of the William Hill loan was shortened from December to March 1994. At that point the loan could be refinanced or the Brent Walker banks might be prepared to fund it. The greatest setback, say the company's directors, was last summer when the steering committee of banks, headed by Standard Chartered, accepted an amendment to terms offered to bondholders on behalf of all the banks. But then a handful of the banks refused to agree and another arrangement had to be dreamt up. Critical issues arose frequently, any of which could have pushed the group over the brink. 'It was crisis management all the way through,' says Mr Leach. Every morning there was an 8am meeting to review the current crises and at midnight there would be another meeting to decide if people could go home. Some problems were almost comical. Mr Ward tells how one day a man turned up in the group's French office saying he had been appointed by the commercial court in Boulogne as a kind of receiver-in-waiting. Mr Ward had to fly over to France to explain why the whole company should not be put into receivership. The court appointee was not satisfied until he saw the sale of the Le Touquet development completed. Many others were distractions from the negotiations with the banks. The removal of Mr Walker from the board was one such, as was the arrival of the Serious Fraud Office, the proposed - but, as it proved, unrealistic - bid for the company from Lonrho, the international trading group, and the unravelling of the Walker Power joint property ventures. Throughout, the negotiations and documentation work demanded long hours, often late into the night. In the last week before the restructuring was completed, a lawyer arrived for a meeting on Tuesday having had eight hours sleep since the previous Saturday. The story is typical. Mr Ken Scobie, chief executive, describes the process of producing listing particulars for the new shares to be issued through the restructuring, as a pantomime. The legal fees involved were greater than the market capitalisation of the company, he says. Directors had to verify everything in the 188-page document and would spend whole Sundays at the task. By the end, Mr Scobie says, 'the only thing I had not done was produce my grandmother's birth certificate'. Every stage of the restructuring involved huge amounts of paperwork, with teams of lawyers each vetting them all and duplicating effort. Brent Walker paid for the agent banks' lawyers, all the banks' lawyers and the bondholders' lawyers, but some banks were also employing further teams of lawyers. Now that the restructuring has been completed, Lord Kindersley hopes that life will be simpler - although the banks will have to be kept informed on a regular basis of progress. He believes that now the banks have a majority of the group's equity - because Pounds 250m of debt has been swapped for shares  -there will be an identity of interest at last, with everyone working to create value for shareholders. The group's new management team believes that the banks did not move fast enough to bring in professional management. It is also now widely agreed that the entrepreneur who builds up a business is unlikely to have the skills to manage it in crisis. Brent Walker's internal financial reporting had been weak, Mr Leach says. And under the November 1990 standstill agreement, it was 'obliged to provide monthly accounts that ICI would have had difficulty producing'. Mr Lyle says that the banks were slow to accept the principle that the company would have a good chance of surviving if it did not have the burden of servicing its debts entirely in the short term. The debt-to-equity swap resulted. He says that banks must be prepared to lend not simply on security but by taking a view of their borrowers' likely profit and cash streams. He works Brent Walker's numbers out thus: of the Pounds 1.65bn debt, Pounds 250m has been converted into equity. Another Pounds 400m will be paid off through asset sales made over the next few years. That leaves Pounds 1bn of debt - still high, but 'William Hill and the Brent Walker pubs could be worth more than that by the end of 1997'.</p>

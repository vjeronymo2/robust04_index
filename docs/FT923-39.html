			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (13): Corporate computing keeps software developers busy - Companies want to connect their PCs THERE is much to occupy personal computer software developers nowadays. They must keep pace with changes in hardware technology. They must allow for advances in infrastructural software, such as operating systems and graphical user interfaces (GUI) while, at the same time, anticipating shifts in emphasis in an increasingly competitive market. But the most important item on the agenda for PC software companies in the 1990s is the transition from 'stand alone' computing to corporate computing. There is strong evidence that companies want to connect their PCs to each other - and to their central corporate computer resources. According to IDC, the market researcher, around 1bn PCs will be connected to some sort of network by 1995. This means that both the infrastructural software and the application software, which turns the technology into a usable and useful system, will go through fundamental changes. The changes are more than technological. They are also cultural. PCs have become a window on the world of corporate computing and applications software must change to accommodate this. 'We are now going through the same level of change as we did when we moved from punched-card input to character-based visual display screens in the 1970s,' says Mr Robin Bloor, chief executive of ButlerBloor the UK-based research and consultancy company. 'This time the change is from character-based input to bit-mapped input.' Mr Bloor believes that PCs are the catalyst which has stimulated the change. They have provided users with the power to run local processing and GUIs - which in turn allows them to handle new types of data. Bit-mapped input, which includes images, audio and video, would be almost impossible to process with character-based software. But individual personal computing must be supported by the corporate network which must be able to offer centralised storage and processing services. Mr Bloor suggests that the so-called client/server model of computing offers a way forward. This approach separates the 'front-end' software associated with GUIs and personal computing from the 'back-end' software such as database management and corporate transaction processing. 'Few PC software companies have realised the implications of the change. Client/server system bring in issues such as security, data integrity and system recovery - issues that few PC companies understand,' says Mr Bloor. In spite of this, however, some PC software companies have begun to take notice of the issues and build software which can meet both the local demands of personal computing and the global needs of corporate systems. Lotus Development, the originator of the ubiquitous 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, has led the way with its Notes 'groupware' package - one of the first programs to exploit the advantages of the client/server model. Notes has attracted wide support from leading systems integrators and software consultancies - including all but one of the 'big six' accountancy companies. It offers a way to build applications which can use both the front-end processing power of PCs and the back-end processing power of more traditional mainframe and minicomputer-based systems. 'There has been a major change in our business and how we sell our products,' says Mr Paul Bailey, European vice-president of Lotus. 'With Notes we are no longer selling a commodity - a single, shrink-wrapped product off the shelf like the original 1-2-3. 'We must now work with third-party consultants or integrators to provide a service which can help build and then support applications,' says Mr Bailey. As a result, Lotus has had to take notice of the broader corporate issues and build its software to accommodate them. 'Notes has features which ensure that data is replicated through the database and synchronise changes so that everyone sees the same data,' explains Mr Dieter Geisebrecht, managing director of Lotus UK. 'The synchronisation rate can be pre-set by the user. This lets Notes give users a broad platform for corporate communications,' he says. Lotus is, of course, not alone in recognising the changes that result from integrating personal and corporate computing. Other leading PC software developers have also seen the technology and cultural problems involved in bringing the two together. Microsoft's Windows NT operating system software - scheduled for release by the end of this year - is another example. When it is complete, Windows NT will incorporate many of the features which are usually associated with a minicomputer or mainframe operating environment with those now well established in personal computing. In parallel, Microsoft is building applications software which allow user to share resources across a network and take in data from other systems. Borland International, a challenger both to Lotus and Microsoft, is also working on software which will bridge the gap between personal and corporate computing. Borland has been a leading innovator in application-building tools for PCs since it was founded in the early 1980s. In the past two years it has concentrated its efforts on what is called object-oriented technology - a new way of thinking about information technology systems which is quickly gaining credibility among manufacturers and software suppliers. Object-oriented technology breaks systems down into a objects which can be related easily to working practice. An object can be anything from an invoice to a profit and loss account. This approach makes it easier for non-technical users to build their own small-scale applications without the need to understand complex programming techniques. This does not mean, however, that there will be no need for professional programming expertise. But it opens up opportunities to spread the load. 'Professional staff can concentrate on the large-scale infrastructural stuff  -but with object-orientation, users can build their own interfaces and processes based on their knowledge,' explains Mr Mike Hill, marketing director at Borland UK. 'They don't have to understand the runes to build effective applications,' he explains Like Lotus, Borland has recognised that it must also offer the background technical support for corporate computing. One of the prizes of its takeover of Ashton Tate, the database market leader, in 1991 was the advanced Interbase database management technology. 'Interbase can offer a consistent view of data - regardless of what is going on in a system,' Mr Hill says. 'If someone wants to invoke a large transaction - like a bank account summary - they can do it while other users continue to update the data. Usually it would have to be locked out - but Interbase's multi-generational features let the software keep track of changes easily and apply them when the transaction is completed.' There is no doubt that all PC software developers will increasingly be forced to take account of the corporate-wide issues highlighted by Lotus's work with Notes and Borland's work with Objectvision and Interbase. The days of the isolated PC are by no means over. But this is not where the action - or the profits - will be found in the 1990s.</p>

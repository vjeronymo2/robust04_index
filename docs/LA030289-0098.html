			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIP TO S. KOREAN 'STUPID,' DERWINSKI TESTIFIES  </P> <P> Veterans Secretary-designate Edward J. Derwinski on Wednesday described as  "rather stupid" his tipping off a South Korean political minister that a Korean  CIA official was defecting to U.S. authorities, but told a Senate committee he  did so without "malicious" intent.  </P> <P> Derwinski, testifying in detail publicly for the first time about the 1977  incident, appeared certain to win approval by the Senate Veterans Affairs  Committee when it votes today on his nomination. But the panel's hearing  disclosed that conflicts exist between Derwinski's current explanation of the  incident and what he told FBI agents about it after it occurred.  </P> <P> Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), the committee's ranking minority member,  made the sharpest reference to the conflict in citing Derwinski's "seeming lack  of directness" about the incident. Further, he advised him to tape record his  answers the next time he talks to FBI agents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees 'Nothing Malicious'  </P> <P> But Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) seemed to be speaking for most committee members  in telling Derwinski there was "nothing malicious or intentional to what you  did."  </P> <P> Specter said he had concluded that the tip to the South Korean official, "when  contrasted with your long and otherwise unblemished, distinguished record" as a  12-term congressman and then State Department official, should not stand as a  barrier to confirmation as the nation's first secretary of veterans affairs.  </P> <P> Under questioning by Specter and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), committee  chairman, Derwinski said he still does not think his conversation with the  South Korean official "endangered anyone . . . or obstructed justice in any  way." He said he did not know the name of the defecting intelligence agent, his  rank or location.  </P> <P> Federal sources familiar with the incident, however, say that the defector and  his family could have been harmed if the FBI had not escorted them to safety  only half an hour before Korean CIA agents arrived at his home in the United  States.  </P> <P> At the time of the incident, Derwinski was ranking Republican on a House  subcommittee that was looking into allegations of influence peddling by South  Korean agents. The subcommittee had opposed the so-called Koreagate  investigation as damaging to U.S. security interests in South Korea.  </P> <P> In written responses to questions by Cranston and in testimony Wednesday,  Derwinski said he mentioned the impending defection to the Korean Embassy  official when he ran into him in front of a House office building.  </P> <P> He said he told the South Korean official, whose name he could not recall, that  there was going to be "the added PR problem of the subcommittee's receiving  testimony" from a defector.  </P> <P> Derwinski said he was speaking to the official, whom he described as "political  minister at the embassy," in the "supercharged atmosphere involving anything  Korean" and that in hindsight he should have never made the comment.  </P> <P> Derwinski's tip became known to federal authorities through electronic  monitoring of the South Korean Embassy that picked up a reference to his  conversation with the Korean official, a source familiar with the matter said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conducts Closed Session  </P> <P> As a result of the security surrounding that monitoring and related classified  matters, the Senate committee questioned Derwinski for 90 minutes Tuesday in a  closed session held in a special "bug proof" room in the Capitol.  </P> <P> Wednesday's testimony confirmed that Derwinski's account of the incident now  and the one he had given earlier to the FBI differed in some respects. However,  those conflicts were not aired at the hearing and the nature of them could not  be learned.  </P> <P> Derwinski sidestepped a question by Cranston on whether his leak had prompted  intelligence agencies to refuse for six months to give the House subcommittee  any more sensitive information for its probe.  </P> <P> Derwinski said he recalled working "to obtain a better flow of information  relevant to the subcommittee's investigation from federal agencies."  </P> <P> The hearing disclosed that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh declined to support a  committee request for information from a federal grand jury that investigated  the defector warning. The grand jury ended its inquiry without action on  grounds that such action could reveal sensitive sources and intelligence  methods.  </P> <P> Under questioning by Cranston, however, Derwinski said he had declined to  answer the grand jury's questions in 1977, citing the Constitution's "speech  and debate" clause as grounds for his refusal.  </P> <P> Cranston noted that a subsequent decision of the Supreme Court had narrowed use  of that clause, which protects federal legislators from being held legally  accountable for matters in connection with their speech or debate, and that it  would no longer cover Derwinski's refusal to testify.  </P> <P> Derwinski said it was not his "decision or strategy" not to testify, but that  he had done so on the advice of his counsel, Thomas A. Kennelly.  </P></p>

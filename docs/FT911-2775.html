			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UN may start taking over Kurdish camps within days THE United Nations may start taking over Kurdish refugee camps in northern Iraq from allied troops within days, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary general, said yesterday. But President George Bush said US troops would stay in northern Iraq as long as they were needed to guard Kurdish refugee camps. Western diplomats say it could take weeks to complete a UN takeover. 'We intend to take over as soon as possible,' Mr Perez de Cuellar told reporters. 'We are working on it. It is a question of days.' Mr Bush, speaking separately at a brief news conference, agreed that the UN had a key role to play and said he did not want US troops 'hauled into some conflict that's been going on for years'. But US soldiers would 'stay there as long as it takes to make sure these refugees are getting taken care of, and not a minute longer'. He said he hoped President Saddam Hussein had learned a lesson about the consequences of aggression, but he still wanted 'somebody with a little more compassion as president of Iraq'. Until then, there would be no normalisation of US-Iraq relations. 'His people don't like him, and it's only terror that's keeping him in power,' Mr Bush said. 'But history has a way of taking care of tyrants.' UN officials said yesterday that the death rate among Kurdish refugees pouring into Iran had risen to nearly 2,000 a day, but many Kurds are still fearful of returning home to Iraq following last month's failed uprising against Mr Saddam. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has offered sanctuary to Iraqis on the Iraq-Kuwait border who fear the loss of US protection as American troops withdraw. US military aircraft will fly about 500 refugees a day from the southern Iraqi town of Safwan to a camp at the Saudi town of Rafha. It could hold as many as 20,000 refugees as well as thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war reluctant to go home. Mr Saddam and his ministers have opened negotiations with Kurdish guerrillas and announced plans for nationwide political reforms since the allied victory over Iraq in Kuwait. Yesterday Mr Saddam lifted a ban on foreign travel, and his ruling Revolutionary Command Council announced the disbanding of the 1m-strong 'popular army', a militia of teenagers and elderly men. He also appointed Gen Hussein Kamel, the defence minister who is his son-in-law, to repair Iraq's telephone network. Mr Jalal Talabani, the Kurdish guerrilla leader who announced an agreement in principle on Kurdish autonomy after a meeting with Mr Saddam this week, was quoted as saying yesterday that negotiations had only just begun.

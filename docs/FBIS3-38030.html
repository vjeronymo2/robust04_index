			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> rubric: "Federation Council Does Not Act Telegenically"]    [Text] The head of the Federation Council staff has  directed that the operation of the International Association of  Radio and Television [IART], based in the former House of the  Russian Press, be discontinued.    Association employees who reported to work yesterday were  not  admitted into the building by security. They had their passes  seized and were advised to take it easy until 1 March (when the  Federation Council winds up its work), explaining that entry was  denied them for their own safety. The employees were even  barred from making sure their studio, with equipment worth more  than 150 million rubles, was quite safe. The Federation Council  apparatus does not seem to worry about how dozens of Association  members up and down the CIS are going to get programming and how  much IART losses will be -- chiefs of the Association cannot get  any answer out of it.</p>

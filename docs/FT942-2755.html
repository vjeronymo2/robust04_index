			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Penna Pounds 309,000 in red Penna, the USM-quoted holding company for the Sanders &amp; Sidney outplacement consultancy, blamed strong competition in a less active market for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 309,000 for the year to March 31. This compared with a Pounds 1.94m profit. Turnover dropped from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 8.02m. The company also announced its first strategic acquisition outside its core outplacement activity, with the purchase of GHN, a specialist in career management for senior executives. Consideration is Pounds 385,000 cash and 656,250 new shares. At December 1993, GHN's net assets totalled Pounds 267,000 and it reported annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 102,000. Mr John Beard, chief executive, said that with the GHN acquisition 'we will begin to implement our declared strategy of broadening the earnings base of the group through expansion into related sectors'. He said that although the loss was 'clearly disappointing', the Sanders &amp; Sidney business remained a strong cash generator. Cash in the year-end balance sheet was Pounds 904,000. Losses per share were 4.8p (26.4p earnings). The recommended final dividend is 3p, making a total of 4p (10p) for the year. The shares fell 5p to 103p yesterday.</p>

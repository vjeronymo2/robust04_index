Stressing that the question of cross-border operations is  always on Turkey's agenda, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said:  "However, the latest operation must not be regarded as one  specially planned for Syria."    Meanwhile, Internal Affairs Minister Nahit Mentese has also  denied the reports on a cross-border operation into Syria.  Stressing that the security forces launched an operation the  night before last in the Suruc District of Sanliurfa, which is  on Turkey's border with Syria, Mentese said: "The operation in  Suruc is continuing. Suruc and Syria may have been confused.  Six terrorists have been killed or captured in the operation  thus far."    Mentese also said an operation was carried out in Tunceli at  about the same time. Five terrorists were killed or captured.    The officials affiliated with the General Staff have said  the  operation in Suruc may have been regarded as one aimed at Syria.

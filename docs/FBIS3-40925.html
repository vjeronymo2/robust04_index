			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Akimov and Amangeldiy </F> Akhmetalimov]    [Text] Almaty January 31 TASS -- The foreign minister of  Kazakhstan denied allegations that his country is revising its  nuclear-free status and said republican authorities will probe  all circumstances which led to a publication in the Iranian  "JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" newspaper which said that the Central Asian  republic will not give up its nuclear arsenal.    "This is a newspaper canard which does not deserve any  attention," Tuleutay Suleymenov said on Monday.    The newspaper quoted Kazakh Ambassador in Tehran Myrzatay  Dzholdasbekov as saying that Kazakhstan does not intend to  eliminate or relocate its nuclear weapons to any other place  until non-use of such weapons is guaranteed at the world level  and the planet gets rid of them.    It was stressed that this was the official position which  was  to be conveyed to the U.S. Administration during a visit of  President Nursultan Nazarbayev to the United States which is to  take place in two weeks.    Kazakhstan "joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last  December and ratified it, as well as the Start I treaty,"  Suleymenov said adding that instruments of ratification will be  exchanged with the United States during the visit of Nazarbayev  in mid-February.    "Moreover, Kazakhstan together with Belarus made a  considerable contribution to the work which was completed in  Moscow by Presidents of Russia, the United States and ukraine,"  Suleymenov said referring to the trilateral agreement according  to which Ukraine gives up its nuclear weapons.    "Our republic never strived to be a nuclear state. It has  experienced its deadly danger. Five hundred nuclear tests have  been conducted at the Semipalatinsk range which is closed now.  Hundreds of thousands of Kazakhs are still suffering from their  aftermath and we all view disposing of the weapons as a  benefit," the minister said. He added that Kazakh official  authorities are trying to probe all the circumstances which  resulted in the publication in "JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" which "rudely  distorted the republican position on nuclear weapons." Most  evidently, the newspaper is guilty of wishful thinking, but it  is not ruled out that the words of the ambassador were distorted  for some reason.</p>

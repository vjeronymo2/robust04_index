			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Observer: Bristol fashion George Mathewson is not the only ex-3i veteran at the Royal Bank who clearing bankers love to hate. Derek Sach, recruited by Mathewson to run the bank's intensive care ward after 20 years at 3i, has even dared challenge the usefulness of the floating charge, an ancient banking method whereby banks can get their money back even if no one else can. He told the FT earlier this week that it should be abolished. As one pained clearing banker noted yesterday, this would mean that students of Institute of Bankers exams would no longer be able to answer the stock question: 'How do you secure a ship mortgage?' with the hoary old answer 'with a floating charge and a sinking fund'.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Commission in retreat on mergers THE European Commission yesterday bowed to opposition from the UK, Germany and France and staged a tactical retreat in its campaign to expand its powers to vet large mergers. Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian Commissioner responsible for competition policy, said he hoped member states would reconsider their opposition to lowering thresholds above which the Commission investigates deals affecting the EC. Mr Van Miert said business was generally in favour of the Commission proposals but governments and national competition authorities had resisted because of fears of transferring power to Brussels. At present, Brussels looks at all mergers involving companies with a combined world turnover of Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.77bn) . The Commission originally wanted to a reduce this threshold to Ecu2bn. It also wanted to lower the threshold on combined sales within the EC from Ecu250m to Ecu100m. If the Commission had won support for lowering the thresholds, the Merger Task Force's workload would have doubled to around 110 cases a year. Mr Van Miert made clear, however, that he did not wish to introduce uncertainty by forcing the issue - a reference to the 17 years it took for member states to agree to EC merger regulations. The Commission now intends to take further measures to promote greater transparency and efficiency in its rules. It would like to publicise commitments made by parties to remedy clear-cut competition problems after the initial one-month vetting period. Subject to business confidentiality, it would like to introduce prior publication to commitments offered by parties in so-called Phase Two cases.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A WARMER WEEKEND IS ON THE WAY  </P> <P> Possible overnight drizzles should be gone from Southern California by this  morning, the forecasters say, giving way to wind and to warmer weather that  should be even better by the weekend.  </P> <P> Today's west-to-northwest winds, expected to gust to about 20 m.p.h., "ought to  die down" tonight and shouldn't be too much of a problem after that, said  meteorologist Pat Cooper of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The  Times.  </P> <P> "It will be very cool in Orange County because you will be having that wind  coming in off the ocean during the day, keeping temperatures in the upper 50s  to mid-60s Friday," Cooper said.  </P> <P> With a large low-pressure system to the north continuing to move inland and a  high-pressure ridge building up off Baja California, Southland temperatures are  expected to rise from today's cloudy mid-60s to low 70s on Saturday and  slightly warmer on Sunday.  </P> <P> Cooper said the weekend's warming trend should bring temperatures back into the  70s and possibly the 80s by Sunday.  </P> <P> "It looks like a pretty nice weekend for the county," Cooper said.  </P> <P> The cold front that brushed the Southland on Thursday brought winds whipping up  to more than 30 m.p.h. in the Antelope Valley. Edwards Air Force Base had  southwest gusts of 37 m.p.h. and parts of the Owens Valley had gusts of more  than 40 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Stiff winds also hit the deserts of San Diego County and Kern County. Motorists  with high-profile vehicles were warned to be careful driving around the Mojave  Desert.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said Thursday's high temperature at Santa Ana was  68 degrees. The low was 50. Relative humidity was 69%.  </P> <P> The storm front dumped heavy rain on Northern California, snow and strong winds  in the Sierra Nevada and high winds in Nevada.  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / People: . . . but loses top-rated media analyst Meanwhile, James Capel has lost another top-rated analyst as Neil Blackley, whose specialty is the media, leaves to join Goldman Sachs from the beginning of September. 'Goldman may not have the same distribution and research capabilities in the UK as Capel, but it has the strength in corporate finance throughout Europe,' says Blackley, who will be looking at all of Europe. At Capel, Blackley became well known for his early bearish stance on Maxwell Communications Corporation, so it is ironic that he should be moving to a firm that has just been fined Pounds 160,000 by the regulatory authorities for its activities in relation to the late Robert Maxwell. 'Capel got offered the MCC brokership twice and turned it down,' says Blackley who acknowledges Goldman's association was a concern initially. 'But I am now convinced that Goldman is a very ethical firm and that this was an aberration occurring as the company was developing in a new area.' Blackley, 36, says one of the attractions is the prospect of working, in conjunction with the telecommunications analyst, on a study similar to one already produced for the US on the effects of digital compression on the media and other aligned industries. 'I have had quite a few offers over the years (though not from Goldman) but I had not felt inclined to leave until now,' adds Blackley, who has been at Capel for the last decade. Having sustained the number one slot for research in the Extel survey for 11 years, Capel has slipped in the last two years and now stands at number three.</p>

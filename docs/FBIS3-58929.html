			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri is continuing his  visit to Britain. He met yesterday with British Prime Minister  John Major, leaders of the Lebanese community, and members of  the Lebanese businessmen association.    Prime Minister al-Hariri affirmed that Lebanon can only  survive on the basis of partnership, balance, and coexistence  and that whoever tries anything else will fail. He said that  without the cooperation of all Lebanese, the country cannot be  rebuilt or achieve complete sovereignty and independence. He  hoped Lebanon will be a vanguard country in the fields of  culture, democracy, liberties, economy, trade, finance, and  tourism.    Speaking at a reception held last night at the house of  Lebanese Ambassador Mahmud Hammud, and attended by leaders of  the Lebanese community and a number of Arab and foreign  diplomats and officials, Prime Minister al-Hariri said: Lebanon  needs your contribution. It cannot be rebuilt by an individual,  a group of people, a party, a community, or a sect. It will  only be rebuilt by the people from the different sects and  communities.    Regarding the peace negotiations, the prime minister said  that they may produce a result. Lebanon, he said, can face the  challenges of peace. If peace does not take place and the  Israelis do not withdraw, Lebanon can also face the challenges  of steadfastness. We are preparing the country to face both  possibilities. Through unity and cooperation of all Lebanese,  we can face the cultural and all other challenges.    Prime Minister al-Hariri expressed his confidence in the  Lebanese people's ability to overcome all difficulties. He  expressed the belief that if peace is established, Lebanon will  be an important center in the Middle East and the spearhead in  the cultural and economic competition in the future. He said:  The big loss is for us to enter the multilateral negotiations  before the Israeli withdrawal takes place. Lebanon must not be  deceived by Israeli enticements because Israel has not yet made  a decision to withdraw. What happened after the Geneva summit  proves this point.    Following his meeting with Prime Minister Major in the  presence of the members of the Lebanese delegation, Prime  Minister al-Hariri met in the Manchester Hotel with members of  the Lebanese businessmen association in Britain and informed  them of the British Government's readiness to support Lebanon  and its position in the negotiations with Israel. Britain also  supports the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory and is  eager to see peace established and Lebanon regain its role in  the area.    Al-Hariri described his talks with his British counterpart  as  successful and very positive. He explained that Major informed  him of his government's agreement to provide 50 million pounds  in credit guarantees for British exports to Lebanon. He  affirmed that Britain expressed readiness to contribute to  Lebanon's reconstruction, equip and strengthen the capabilities  of the Internal Security Forces and the Lebanese Army, and  participate in electricity and development projects.    The prime minister invited his British counterpart to visit  Lebanon, and he promised to do so. [passage omitted]</p>

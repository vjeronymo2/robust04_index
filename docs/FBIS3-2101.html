Last year Qingdao's import and export volume was 1.388  billion U.S. dollars-worth, 56.7 percent higher than in the  previous year.    Its export volume was over one billion U.S. dollars-worth in  1993, 50.9 percent more than in 1992.    The city government has made special efforts to attract  overseas funds.    Early last year Mayor Yu Zhengsheng led a delegation to Hong  Kong where he announced a package of projects available for  investors.    Later, Qingdao sent missions to countries including the  United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Singapore, Russia  and Germany for the same purpose.    At the same time, foreign trade companies in Qingdao have  reformed and readjusted their operation and management methods  in their accounting, labor and distribution systems.    Various contract forms have been set up by companies,  linking  enterprise efficiency with employees' incomes.    Experiments in joint-stock systems and setting up foreign  trade groups engaging in industrial, agricultural and technical  production have been made in this port city in a bid to expand  markets internationally.    Light industry, food and edible oil, and textile companies  have set up permanent offices in Russia, the ROK, Japan and  Argentina. The city now has over 30 sales agencies overseas.    Last year 17 trade and industrial enterprises in the city  each exported over 10 million U.S. dollars-worth of goods.    Qingdao now has over 300 foreign-funded enterprises which  are  export-oriented.    Qingdao exports mainly to Hong Kong and developing countries  in Latin American, African and Asian countries.    Last year its exports to Japan reached 230 million  dollars-worth, exceeding the value of exports to Hong Kong and  making Japan Qingdao's biggest foreign trade partner.    The year 1993 also witnessed a big increase in foreign  investment. Some 1,629 foreign-funded projects were approved by  the city, with contracted foreign funds totalling 1.85 billion  U.S. dollars.    Some 68 projects approved in 1993 each had a total  investment  exceeding 10 million U.S. dollars, 66 percent more than the  average in 1992.    The investors are from 41 countries and regions. The  investment from Taiwan, the ROK, Singapore, and the United  States increased by 166 percent, 167 percent, 597 percent and 13  percent, respectively.    By the end of 1993 Qingdao had approved 2,420 foreign-funded  enterprises with total contracted capital of 3.32 billion  dollars, and the actual use of foreign funds was 790 million  U.S. dollars.    Last year 581 foreign-funded firms went into operation in  Qingdao, bringing the total to 847. They made a total export  volume of 460 million U.S. dollars-worth and made profits of 210  million yuan (about 25 million U.S. dollars).    In the field of technical co-operation Qingdao signed 112  contracts with other countries on construction projects and  labor service. The contracted volume was 49.745 million U.S.  dollars.    The city now has 1,878 workers working abroad. It has  invested 3.218 million U.S. dollars to set up 13 firms overseas.

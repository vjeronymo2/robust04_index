			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ilva names Nakamura managing director ILVA, the heavily loss-making Italian state steel group, has appointed Mr Hayao Nakamura, a Nippon Steel executive, as its new managing director following Friday's resignation of Mr Giovanni Gambardella. The appointment of a foreigner to such a senior public-sector post is unprecedented in Italy. It reflects the deep difficulties in which Ilva, which lost L1,750bn (Dollars 1.1bn) in the first eleven months of 1992, now finds itself. In 1991, Ilva reported a loss before minority interests of L498bn, after putting aside L411bn in extraordinary gains in a special restructuring fund. Mr Nakamura, currently the representative in Italy of Nippon Steel, is one of just a handful of Japanese executives with a close knowledge of the Italian market, especially the state sector. He was closely involved in the mid-1970s in the extension of the Taranto integrated steel plant, Italy's biggest, and also worked with Ilva on its Novi Ligure rolled coils facility. One of his first tasks will be to prepare a restructuring plan for the group, which has been devastated by the fall in European steel prices and extremely heavy debts, believed to have reached L8,300bn last year. Last November, IRI, the state holding company which controls Ilva, called on its management to propose a new restructuring plan by mid-1993. The surprise resignation of Mr Gambardella and other senior board members, coming just a day before IRI examined Ilva's 1992 accounts, may have been linked to the fact that its financial performance was found to have deteriorated beyond even the worse expectations. Ilva's new management have only limited room for manoeuvre. After embarking on a highly aggressive expansion drive under Mr Gambardella in the late 1980s, Ilva, which rose from the ashes of the loss-making Finsider state steel group, was forced to trim its sails in the face of high debts and increasingly difficult market conditions.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIFTIER CONSUMERS SPUR FEARS OF RECESSION IN 1990  </P> <P> After years of spirited spending, U.S. consumers are showing new restraint in  their purchases this year, a trend that could nudge the economy toward a  recession if it persists, analysts say.  </P> <P> "If consumer spending continues as it has in the last three months, we could be  headed for a recession in the next three months," warned Bruce Steinberg, a  senior economist with the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New York.  </P> <P> Economists are far from ready to declare America's 90-month economic expansion  to be over, but increasingly they are asking: Is the free-spending,  luxury-loving consumer of the 1980s pooping out in the 1990s?  </P> <P> The question is important because spending on autos, furniture, appliances,  clothing, entertainment and other consumer products and services accounts for  two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Confident consumers are willing to part with  cash; their spending has propelled the longest peacetime economic expansion in  the United States since World War II.  </P> <P> Worried consumers, by contrast, hold their dollars with great care, depriving  the economy of a basic source of growth. And recent signs suggest that worries  are on the rise.  </P> <P> In May, for instance, retail sales dropped 0.7%. It was the third consecutive  monthly decline -- and the longest downward streak in nine years, the Commerce  Department reported. The government's broadest gauge of consumer spending,  which also includes dollars spent on services, also has been falling in recent  months.  </P> <P> "It's been tough," said Bill Dombrowski, vice president of corporate affairs at  Carter Hawley Hale Stores, a Los Angeles-based retailing company that owns the  Broadway department stores. "It was a tough quarter for everyone."  </P> <P> The firm, along with other major retailers, has had disappointing sales in  furniture and other "big-ticket" items, Dombrowski said.  </P> <P> "Consumers are being a little more cautious," said Rosalind Wells, chief  economist with the National Retail Federation in New York. But she added  quickly: "I don't think things are falling apart."  </P> <P> There is no shortage of explanations for the consumer malaise. Sluggish  employment growth is often cited. So is the real estate slowdown in the  Northeast and California. Some economists take the long-term view, pointing to  the aging of the baby boom generation and, with it, a growing emphasis on  saving instead of material indulgence.  </P> <P> Even the weather, which was unseasonably cold and wet in much of the country  last month, gets its share of the blame. "The normal summer goods didn't really  sell in a big quantity," said Thomas E. Swanstrom, chief economist with Sears  Merchandise Group in Chicago.  </P> <P> Meteorology alone, however, does not explain the chillier consumer. Employment  growth, for instance, has been weak to nonexistent in certain key sectors of  late. In May, for instance, factory jobs fell for the seventh time in nine  months. Such declines not only injure those affected directly but also spread  ripple effects of anxiety.  </P> <P> "You get eight to 10 people scared for every one laid off," said Donald  Ratajczak, an economic forecaster at Georgia State University.  </P> <P> Gradually, the fears may be spreading. A year ago, 34% of Americans polled by  the Conference Board described jobs as "plentiful," with 21% responding that  jobs were hard to get. By contrast, in a similar survey last month by the New  York research organization, just 27% said jobs were plentiful and 23% said jobs  were hard to get.  </P> <P> The comfortably employed have other concerns. Many have watched with dismay as  a chill in housing markets has spread from the Northeast to California and some  other regions. New York median housing prices, for instance, are running 5%  lower than a year ago, according to the National Assn. of Realtors.  </P> <P> In California, median home prices overall are down 2% from a year ago, although  they are up about 2% in Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the  California Assn. of Realtors. Still, the modest gains are a jolting turnabout  from the heady real estate appreciation of the recent past.  </P> <P> "I think the No. 1 thing that's causing middle-class households concern is the  slowdown in housing prices," said Robert H. Dugger, chief economist at the  American Bankers Assn. in Washington. "So many of them viewed their home equity  as an important indicator of their household wealth."  </P> <P> Other indicators suggest that consumers are changing for reasons more basic  than housing prices. In the go-go 1980s, wealth -- or the illusion of it -- was  fueled by a rapid rise in borrowing. This year, household borrowing is going up  more slowly than in the past, and many consumers appear to be paying back their  debts, Dugger said.  </P> <P> Some experts contend that this phenomenon might partly reflect the aging of the  population, especially the baby boom, which is pushing into its 40s. Consumers  typically save more as they settle into middle age and start to plan for such  long-term expenses as retirement.  </P> <P> "They've got their houses. They've got their cars. They've got their furniture.  They're pretty well set," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at  Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. "As they get older, they realize  they're not immortal and start putting money aside for their children's  education."  </P> <P> Consumer saving rates -- computed as a percentage of disposable income -- have  edged up to 5.6% in the first quarter of this year from 3.2% in 1987, according  to the Commerce Department. The view that a long-term spending shift has  started to affect the economic statistics is in dispute, however. For one  thing, the 1990 savings rate figures may be reduced next month because of lower  official estimates of income growth, economists said.  </P> <P> "Savings is maybe edging up a little bit -- from a very, very low level," said  Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Inflation also has created uncertainty about consumer attitudes. Earlier this  year, it soared to an 8% annual rate, pushed by cold-weather-related increases  in the prices of heating oil and food. Although it eased to less than 3% in  April and May, some say government officials are underestimating the price  pressures that consumers now face.  </P> <P> The consumer price index, for example, does not sufficiently weigh such  expenses as insurance, state and local taxes and utility bills, many of which  have been moving up, Albert E. Sindlinger, an economist who runs a consumer  research firm in Wallingford, Pa., contends.  </P> <P> Using his own formulas, Sindlinger calculates that income gains -- averaging in  the 4.5% range -- have lagged behind inflation -- at more than 7% -- for  several months, causing a crunch that is damaging the U.S. economy in many  regions. "Eight of 10 people now are telling us their income is down because  their fixed costs are up," Sindlinger said.  </P> <P> Despite the rising concerns about the consumer, the economy retains strength in  exports and manufacturing. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence  has dropped from a level of 116.7 last May to 107.3 this May, but it remains  substantially above levels associated with a recession.  </P> <P> New signs of weakness may prompt the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest  rates, which could spark a rebound in the housing industry. And economists  point approvingly to lean inventory levels in the auto and other industries, a  situation that reduces the possibility of harmful industrial bottlenecks.  </P> <P> "This is unusual and very scary," Wahed said of the three-month series of  retail sales declines. "But I still lay odds of 4 to 1 that this will not cause  a recession in the near future."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONSUMER SPENDING GROWTH SLOWS  </P> <P> Annual rate of growth of personal consumption expenditures.  </P> <P> 1985: 4.7%  </P> <P> 1986: 3.9  </P> <P> 1987: 2.8  </P> <P> 1988: 3.4  </P> <P> 1989: 2.7  </P> <P> 1990 (first quarter): 2.4  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Department  </P></p>

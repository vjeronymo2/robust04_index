			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / SPD sees Hesse result as warning to main parties THE FUTURE of Germany's democratic system is threatened by voters' disaffection with the two main political parties, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), warned yesterday. A slide in the fortunes of both the SPD and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's rival Christian Democrats (CDU) in local elections in the state of Hesse at the weekend indicated a 'deep crisis of confidence' in the parties which have dominated Germany's post-war political system, Mr Engholm said. The poll saw the lowest turnout in Hesse since 1948, with a vote of 71.3 per cent, and a drain of support from the main political parties to the left and right. The extreme right-wing Republicans picked up 8.4 per cent of the vote, and the left-wing environmentalist Greens took 11 per cent. Mr Kohl, however, dismissed the vote for the Republicans and two other neo-Nazi splinter groups as a temporary phenomenon. He blamed the protest voting on the 'extremely difficult situation' in the German economy and on political divisions following the country's unification. The chancellor called for all political parties to speed up the decision-making process in Bonn. He also urged the SPD to agree this week on a comprehensive 'solidarity pact' to finance the rising costs of unification. The two sides meet for further talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr Kohl's CDU polled 32 per cent in the Hesse elections, down 2.3 percentage points on its result in the last local elections in 1989, and 8 points down on the Hesse state election result in 1991. However, the biggest loser was the SPD, which is the majority party in the Hesse government, in coalition with the Greens. The party saw its support fall from 44.8 per cent to 36.4 per cent compared with 1989, with particularly bad results in big urban areas such as Frankfurt, Wiesbaden and Kassel. The swing to the Republicans was smaller than many commentators had feared. The party gained almost 11 per cent of the vote in last year's state election in neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg, campaigning against immi-gration. However, Mr Engholm warned at growing insecurity in the German population, with rising unemployment and threats of further public spending cuts. He said that there was a clear shift to the right in voting patterns, with the Republicans picking up support among 'the weakest levels in our society'. 'It is not the first time we have seen this,' he said. 'There is a great danger of people who are suffering in our society turning to those who promise them the most.'

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed fall after Wall Street opens STORM CLOUDS over the US economy overshadowed the UK stock market yesterday, and a rally from bearish pressures in the new issue sector was abruptly reversed after Wall Street and the US dollar began to slide. London responded well at first to the overnight strength of other world markets, and the Footsie 2,500 level was quickly recovered, albeit in thin trading. The shine was taken off share prices, however, when it was confirmed that the issuing price for MFI, the furniture retailer created by a management buyout from Asda, had been sharply reduced in view of conditions in the UK stock market. An early gain of 12 points on the Footsie disappeared, but the market was holding steady until mid-afternoon when London heard the news from across the Atlantic. The Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut the discount rate by  1/2 percentage point to 3 per cent, in the face of the rise in US unemployment to 7.8 per cent of the workforce in June, was widely seen as an act of near desperation rather than of reliable economic stimulus. Traders said London was particularly unsettled by the political implications for President Bush of the new signs of US economic weakness. London's nervousness increased as Wall Street turned from a gain of 17 Dow points to a net drop of 25 points early in its new trading session. Meanwhile, the fall in the US currency was swiftly feeding through to dollar-orientated stocks in London and the Footsie fell sharply. Downward pressure was emphasised by a setback in stock index futures. At the day's low, the FT-SE Index was down by 22.7 but a rally took the final reading to 2,476.1, a net loss of 17.8. The fall to below 2,500 has left the Footsie suspended nervously in thin air, with no visible support above the 2,436 area recorded on the eve of the UK general election in April; on the day after polling, the index jumped 132 points. However, market turnover was light again with Seaq volume at only 394.5m shares. On Wednesday, when equities suffered badly, turnover reached 495.1m shares, but Stock Exchange statistics show that retail, or customer, business in equities was worth only Pounds 982.7m, not an exciting total even by recent standards. The reduction in the planned issue of MFI from an expected worth of Pounds 750m to only Pounds 669m was seen as a further indication of the problems of the new issue sector, and of the UK stock market as a whole. Fund managers are currently apprehensively regarding the short-term outlook and will only put new cash into equities at discounts to market levels. The Pounds 3bn offer for sale by Wellcome closes at the end of this month, and there have also been hints of impending rights issues from other leading companies. Most of yesterday's losses came in the US-orientated stocks. ICI sharply extended an early fall and BOC, Reckitt &amp; Colman, BAT Industries and Reuters all suffered for their Wall Street associations. However, shares in BP continued to steady, against the market trend, as investors tried to assess the dividend prospects.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 7 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The presumed  mastermind of the plot to assassinate Honduran President Carlos  Roberto Reina has voluntarily surrendered to a court in this  capital on 7 April, a judicial source has confirmed.    Luis Hernandez Sosa, 30, surprised the security corps when  he  arrived unexpectedly at the First Lower Criminal Court in  Tegucigalpa at 1600 local (2200 GMT) accompanied by human rights  leaders.    Sosa is linked to a plot to assassinate President Reina  uncovered on 13 March when Nicaraguan citizen Luis Rene Quintero  confessed his participation to the Nicaraguan Government  Ministry.    According to Quintero, Honduran Hernandez Sosa hired him  along with Nicaraguan citizens Santiago Rivas and Roger Arguello  to kill President Reina for $400,000, as confirmed by Honduran  military spokesman Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar.    Members of the Human Rights Commissioner's Office and of the  court confirmed to ACAN-EFE that Hernandez turned himself in to  the First Lower Criminal Court in Tegucigalpa. In a brief  statement to judicial reporters, Hernandez said he is "innocent"  of all charges.</p>

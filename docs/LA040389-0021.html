			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEST MUST DECIDE IF IT WOULD FEEL SECURE WITH AN INDEPENDENT EASTERN EUROPE  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III's remark last week that he is considering  a proposal that "a new political arrangement for Eastern Europe" be discussed  with Moscow brings Henry Kissinger back onto the U.S. foreign-policy scene. The  proposal is Kissinger's. It has not been made public.  </P> <P> Baker characterized the proposal as offering the Soviet Union a "type of  formalized status in Eastern Europe" in exchange for greater freedom for the  East European governments to run their own affairs. The West would promise not  to exploit the situation to the Soviet Union's disadvantage.  </P> <P> Baker went on to ask, however, if this is a sensible thing to do "when  countries in the region, like Poland and Hungary, are already moving towards a  more Western orientation in their economies and political systems." His evident  inclination to leave well enough alone is defensible, but possibly too  complacent.  </P> <P> It is true that the overactive and overambitious approach to complicated  problems is dangerous, and has produced much grief for America. It is also true  that the tide is running in the West's favor in Eastern Europe. But this is a  turbulent tide with an undertow; it could, to press the metaphor, end in a  riptide.  </P> <P> There is merit in Kissinger's concern that the United States look for a way  constructively to influence events in Eastern Europe and reduce some of the  risks there. The question is how best to do it, and that depends on how you see  the future of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> There are two fundamentally different views of Eastern Europe held in the West.  One says that the Soviet Union is there to stay. Like it or not, Eastern Europe  is part of a Soviet ideological and security system that Moscow will not alter.  As Leonid Brezhnev said to Alexander Dubcek after the 1968 Soviet invasion of  Czechoslovakia, "Your frontier . . . is that of the Socialist camp. It is the  result of the Second World War for which the U.S.S.R. paid a high cost. The  Soviet Politburo does not have the right to place in jeopardy the results of  that war."  </P> <P> This view of Eastern Europe was held in the State Department a decade and a  half ago, when Kissinger was in charge of U.S. foreign policy. At that time one  of his associates described the aim of U.S. policy thusly: to "strive for an  evolution that makes the relationship between the East Europeans and the Soviet  Union an organic one" -- hence more stable, less prone to crisis.  </P> <P> The other view of Eastern Europe holds that it is unreasonable and unhistorical  to think that ancient and culturally autonomous nations -- Hungary, Poland and  Bohemia (Czechoslovakia) -- historically linked to West European civilization,  can indefinitely be deprived of their independence by the Soviet Union. The  attempt to do so, in this view, is the cause of enduring instability in Europe,  and in East-West relations.  </P> <P> Despite 40 years of military occupation, the Soviet Union has failed to win the  allegiance of any significant part of public opinion in the region. It enjoys  less sympathy today than it did in the 1940s, when there were real,  revolutionary Communist parties in Eastern Europe that genuinely believed in  the Soviet Union as a workers' state and as the promise of a new and more just  human order. Nothing remotely like that exists today. Every vital political  force in Eastern Europe is directed against the Soviet Union and toward  national independence.  </P> <P> If you hold this view, you must conclude that the proper objective of the  Western policy-maker is to bring about a replacement of the European security  system, which rests ultimately on military compulsion, by one based on consent  and mutual interest.  </P> <P> Western guarantees of legitimate Soviet security concerns, and of NATO  non-interference and non-exploitation of a changed situation, with mutual arms  reductions, troop withdrawals, confidence-building measures, etc., all are ways  to achieve that objective. But the objective must be clearly understood. It is  not to make it possible for the Soviet Union to safely stay in Eastern Europe.  It is to make it possible for it to safely leave.  </P> <P> The lack of policy initiative from Washington has produced an uneasy situation  in Western Europe, hinging on the debate -- or the lack of an open debate --  over Germany's role in Eastern Europe's evolution. The situation is developing  more rapidly than Washington seems to appreciate, and West German and French  policy-makers are concerned.  </P> <P> Even if Baker chooses to let the situation develop without American  intervention, the question of objective still must be answered. Do we look for  security in an independent Eastern Europe? Or do we see an independent Eastern  Europe as a threat to stability, hence to security? Kissinger has one answer.  Others have another. The merit of his proposal is that it has confronted us  with that question.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by commentator Aleksandr Timoshkin entitled The </F> Arab-Israeli Talks Should Continue; read by announcer]    [Text] The Middle East peace conference co-sponsors, Russia  and the United States, think it indispensable to continue these  talks. Moscow has sent the deputy foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,  on a special mission to the Middle East. The aim of of the  visit, during which Ivanov will meet President Yasir 'Arafat, is  to give the peace process in the region a fresh impetus. Russia  continues to stimulate mediation efforts aimed at ensuring the  success of the Arab-Israeli direct talks. Moscow has agreed to  Washington's proposal of sending out an invitation to the  negotiating parties to resume the talks in the U.S. capital.    After meeting the Palestinian president in Tunis, Ivanov  will  go to Israel to hold talks with officials there. In the light  of these talks, Moscow will decide its subsequent steps in its  Middle East foreign policy.    This is what Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  announced at a news conference yesterday. He had a phone  conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Shimon Peres, who  informed Kozyrev of Israel's agreement to allow foreign civilian  observers to visit the Palestinian occupied territories. In the  meantime the Israeli Government is taking some measures to  reduce the gravity of the negative impact of the Hebron massacre  on the talks process. For example, the release has started  today of hundreds of Palestinians from prisons, and the policy  of limiting contacts between Jewish settlers and the  Palestinians to avoid new bloody clashes continues.    Representatives of the PLO in the occupied territories think  that the release of a few hundred Palestinian prisoners is not  enough, because the heart of the matter is the release of all  the 10,000 prisoners.    On its part, the United States was busy coordinating with  the  Palestinians and Israelis on the Security Council draft  resolution, the main aim of which is to put an end to the bloody  acts of violence exchanged in the Palestinian occupied  territories.    The U.S. permanent representative at the UN said that the  agreement on the text of the document [UN Security Council  resolution] is being finalized word by word to avoid a different  interpretation in the future.    The Security Council will continue discussing the  consequences of the Hebron massacre today. Representatives of  more than 30 UN member states have asked to address the session.  Therefore, it is possible that the Security Council's meetings  could last several days.    The current circumstances indicate that the international  community is concerned that the Middle East peace process should  continue until a just and lasting peace has been established in  the region, and until a secure and peaceful situation has  developed for all the peoples and states of the region.    Obsessed extremist terrorists from both sides must never be  allowed to hinder or stop the progress of the negotiating  process, the final aim if which is to reconcile between Israelis  and Arabs on a basis acceptable equally to them and to the  international community.</p>

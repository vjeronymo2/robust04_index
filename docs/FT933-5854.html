			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Harmony prevails in Bechstein rescue BECHSTEIN, one of Germany's oldest piano manufacturers, was yesterday rescued from bankruptcy after Berlin's ruling Senate bought the company's headquarters in the capital, clearing the way for banks to arrange a refinancing package. Bechstein, which has debts of more than DM38m (Pounds 15m), will sell its headquarters in western Berlin for DM30m and rent the space from the Senate. The Senate, which originally sold the property to Bechstein in the mid-1980s, had an option to buy it back. Its value, because of its location between eastern and western Berlin, is estimated at much more than DM30m. Bechstein said: 'We could have done with a bit more money from the Senate, but at least we are now on the road to a secure footing.' Bechstein, which also owns Zimmermann, a quality piano maker in Saxony, has been suffering from a decline in sales. Last year, turnover fell 15 per cent to DM20m and is expected to fall short of DM15m this year. In 1990, the company was making 350 grand pianos and 600 uprights a year. Under a cost-cutting programme, Bechstein itself will produce 200 grand pianos and 450 uprights. Its subsidiaries, Zimmermann and W. Hoffmann, which produce 2,000 pianos a year, will try to challenge the growing presence in Germany of pianos from south-east Asia and other parts of Europe.</p>

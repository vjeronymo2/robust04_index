			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Henry Becker] </F>   [Text] Tegucigalpa -- General Finlander Armijo Ucles,  inspector general of the Armed Forces, has warned that announced  personnel and budget cuts in the Armed Forces place state  security at risk. After noting that the government and the Armed  Forces are in charge of keeping public order and preserving  state security, he said this duty is being reduced more and more  with each budget cut and every time a combat unit is disbanded.    He said those who have suggested such cuts have not taken  into account the great harm being done to the country. "But we  obey all orders from the president without question," he added.  He also said there are no disputes within the Armed Forces over  the crisis that the institution is experiencing. "There are no  blocs that either favor or oppose the restrictions."    All of the men have become highly professional because of  the  training of troops in several exercises conducted jointly with  the U.S. Army support. No special training for troops or  officers can be completed if U.S. economic aid is reduced, he  said.    Gen. Armijo Ucles said the equipment used by the Public  Security Force belongs to the Armed Forces. Therefore, these  arms will have to be returned to the Army once the Attorney  General's Office takes control of the police. He added, "The  decision could be changed, however, providing the government and  the Higher Council reach a better understanding."    He said he wished the new police force a good start. "We are  awaiting the results. We hope the crime rate will not increase,  because this would present problems for a new and inexperienced  police force."    Gen. Armijo Ucles also expressed his concern for the members  of the National Investigations Directorate [DNI], "most of whom  will enter the ranks of the unemployed." He warned about the  possibility of jobless DNI agents being hired by drug  traffickers or becoming ruffians whose activities could disrupt  the country's order and democratic system.    He said the Armed Forces General Command will soon meet with  the executive to outline a plan to hire the dismissed police  officers. Otherwise, the people will have to deal with criminal  gangs in which Armed Forces-trained agents could become death  squad members or drug traffickers.</p>

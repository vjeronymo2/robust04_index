			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMELESS CLASSICS  </P> <P> There is a choice group of dishes from restaurants that have left an indelible  mark on the Los Angeles culinary scene.  </P> <P> They are dishes you would drop a date with a best friend to taste. They are  dishes with an illustrious past and bright future. They possess a bold  character and unmistakable charm -- along, of course, with exceptional flavor.  They have survived the test of time.  </P> <P> They are, in fact, a class unto themselves, defying description. Each dish  stands on its own, as proud of having originated in a diner as in a chi-chi  bistro.  </P> <P> Shall we name a few? Maestro, please:  </P> <P> The Brown Derby's Cobb Salad and Grapefruit Cake, Chasen's chili, Scandia's  Gravad Lax or Pumpernickel Toast, La Scala's Chopped Salad, Madame Wu's Garden  Chicken Salad, Musso and Frank Grill's Chicken Pot Pie and Flannel Cakes,  Smokey Joe's Garlic Toast, the Original Pantry's Coleslaw, Marie Callender's  Corn Bread. There are dozens more in all categories of cuisine, but in the  interest of space, we shall confine our interest to a handful.  </P> <P> How did we obtain the recipes for these local restaurant specialties? Readers  have requested their favorite restaurant recipes over a period of three decades  in columns written by The Times Food staff. We, in turn, asked restaurants to  share these recipes, and most of the restaurants approached have complied  graciously. We have reprinted many of these recipes repeatedly because of  popular demand.  </P> <P> Some restaurant recipes, however, could not be obtained. For those we developed  similar recipes, reconstructing the recipe in The Times' Test Kitchen to appear  and taste as close to the original as possible.  </P> <P> While the copied recipes cannot actually be named after the restaurant, some,  such as the chili from Chasen's that was renamed Chasing Chili, are  identifiable. The chili, as one can imagine, is typical of the California  variety made with chunks of meat and pinto beans in a rather thick, tomato  sauce. It's hot with chile taste but not as hot as you might find chili in the  Southwest or Texas. Chasen's chili, although not on the menu, is served as a  side dish from a copper saucepan warming on a brazier at the table. Crackers,  cheese and sour cream are add-ons.  </P> <P> The development of these copies has a diverse history. Some were simply  reconstructed by one of The Times' Food staff and tested in The Times' Test  Kitchen, while others were sent to us by readers.  </P> <P> The chili is such an example. Numerous readers sent us copies of recipes that  credited Chasen's. Each time, Chasen's denied having shared the recipe with  anyone. We picked the best of those submitted, tested a bit and adapted a bit.  We now feel we have a most reasonable copy of the real thing.  </P> <P> Most of the recipes from restaurants come directly from the restaurant chefs or  owners themselves upon request. Jean Leon, owner of La Scala Boutique, Beverly  Hills, has graciously shared recipes from his restaurant, including the salad  nibbled on by movie stars stopping at the boutique for lunch.  </P> <P> The chopped salad contains Italian-style ingredients, such as salami and  mozzarella cheese. The dressing has a French touch with the addition of dry  mustard to a basic vinaigrette.  </P> <P> Sylvia Wu also graciously shared her prized recipe for Chinese chicken salad,  which, says Wu, was fashioned, with assistance from her chef, after a similar  but more complex Chinese cold dish. Hundreds of restaurants nationwide --  Chinese and otherwise -- now serve similar chicken salads. The Madame Wu's  Garden, Santa Monica, version is outstanding.  </P> <P> The Cobb Salad, which originated at the Brown Derby, also has become a generic  favorite nationwide. It was Bob Cobb, one of the original operators of the  Brown Derby, who created the legendary salad made with lettuce topped with  strips of chopped avocado, tomatoes, bacon, chicken and cheese. Cobb salad has  become a generic dish found on just about every American salad menu nationwide.  </P> <P> Satisfied Cobb salad fans, who frequented the Brown Derby since its beginnings  in 1926 when patrons such as Mary Pickford, Louella Parsons and Loretta Young  dined there, have spawned an huge Cobb salad-eating population.  </P> <P> The Grapefruit Cake, also served at the Brown Derby, has been a long-time  favorite of Los Angeles Times readers. It still is served in its original form  -- with grapefruit segments glistening on top of a cream cheese frosting. It's  a beautiful cake to serve for special occasions or on an especially festive  coffee or tea table.  </P> <P> Scandia, a Los Angeles' landmark restaurant since 1946, has delighted diners  with numerous favorites, particularly Scandinavian Gravad Lax (cured salmon)  served paper-thin sprinkled with French-fried tidbits of salmon skin and a  superb mustard dill sauce on the side.  </P> <P> Scandia also was among the first restaurants, according to Raymond L.  MacCurtin, executive chef, to serve Pumpernickel Cheese Toast, which has since  made the rounds of bad and good restaurants nationwide. The toast should be  served crisp and hot from the oven, never soggy or soft. If you want to reheat  pumpernickel toast, use a conventional oven, not the microwave, which produces  a soggy, soft toast -- unless, of course, you prefer soft toast.  </P> <P> Musso and Frank Grill, touted as the oldest restaurant in Hollywood, has,  according to long-time maitre d' Philip Cano, served the same menu since its  opening in 1919. The Flannel Cakes are a daily breakfast favorite developed by  Jean La Rue, former chef, as an Americanized version of the oversized French  crepe. Today, Bob Wootten, grill chef, turns out the Flannel Cakes at Musso and  Frank Grill, dousing them with melted butter and syrup as they are served.  </P> <P> Chicken Pot Pie is a Thursday special at Musso and Frank Grill. The pie,  chock-full of large nuggets of chicken, potatoes, carrots and peas, is covered  with a flaky pastry and baked to a golden tinge. The pie comes to the table  already dished up but we suggest allowing dinner guests to have a view of this  American classic in the baking dish before it is served. We give a similarly  reconstructed recipe.  </P> <P> Reader requests for a recipe from another old landmark restaurant in the  downtown area of Los Angeles -- the Original Pantry Coleslaw -- keep coming,  making the recipe an annual favorite of The Times' Culinary SOS column. The  slaw is a simple, creamy type made with mayonnaise and seasoned with garlic,  onion and mustard powders. A touch of sugar adds a sweet note.  </P> <P> The Tony Roma restaurant chain cannot share their recipe for the onion rings,  but a close facsimile was developed by Donna Deane, home economist, in The  Times' Test Kitchen. Tony Roma's staff did, however, offer a tip: Pack the  onions loosely, not firmly, in the loaf pan so they will not become soggy.  </P> <P> Marie Callender's restaurant officials could not part with their secret corn  bread recipe either, but readers persisted. Taking a tip from a reader who  suggested we combine yellow cake mix and corn bread mix, we decided to test its  merits. The result of combining a yellow cake mix with a corn bread batter  works just fine, and the recipe has been printed as a reasonable substitute  ever since. It's a rather sweet corn bread that is particularly favored by  diners in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MADAME WU'S GARDEN CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD  </P> <P> 3 chicken thighs  </P> <P> Oil for frying  </P> <P> 8 (3 1/2-inch) square won ton noodles, cut into 1/8-inch strips  </P> <P> 3 ounces rice sticks  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons dry mustard  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons water  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons light soy sauce  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons sesame oil  </P> <P> 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, shredded  </P> <P> 1/3 cup chopped toasted almonds  </P> <P> 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions, white stem only  </P> <P> Chopped sweet red pepper  </P> <P> Cook chicken in water to cover until tender, about 20 minutes.

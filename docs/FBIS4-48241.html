			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Serge Marti: "A Market of 115 Million </F> Inhabitants"]    [Text] Installed to collect information needed in the  struggle against the communist enemy back in the Cold War days,  the computers at the Silvermine defense intelligence station  situated near the Simon's Town naval base, about 20 km from the  Cape of Good Hope, are now obsolete. But the "Cape route" for  shipping and the 3,000 km of South African coastline are still  of prime geostrategic importance and a major economic asset.  Located at the confluence of major commercial routes, the  country has port, road, and rail infrastructure that is both a  gateway to the rest of the African continent and a natural  outlet for southern African countries that have no direct access  to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.    Despite--or perhaps because of--the relative international  isolation forced upon it as a result of its policy of "separate  development," South Africa also has become a true regional  economic power. Sitting on a vast heap of gold (the country has  50 percent of global reserves) and diamonds (25 percent), it  furnishes 52 percent of the electricity, 83 percent of the  steel, and 97 percent of coal products for the whole continent,  and provides half its industrial production.    Now that the country is committed to the path of  democratizing its institutions and opening up to the outside  world, the wealth that was built on a foundation of racial  inequality and discrimination is both seductive and worrisome to  its neighbors, who are frightened at the hegemonic tendencies  that might emerge in the "new South Africa."    The international community, deaf to misgivings frequently  articulated by experts on the region--"Southern Africa stands to  South Africa in the same relationship that Europe would stand to  Germany, if Germany were all Europe had"--is trying once again  to evoke that "Afro-optimism," which so often miscarried in the  past as one African country after the next fell into insolvency.  And it dares to hope that this "politico-socio-economic  laboratory" with its eyes turned (at least for the moment)  toward Europe, its principal trading partner--a laboratory  situated midway between two high-growth zones, Asia Pacific and  Latin America, whose future seems assured at least for a  generation---will be the engine of economic development that  sub-Saharan Africa so desperately needs. "Nigeria and South  Africa are the only big economic powers capable of stabilizing  the African continent," says one observer familiar with these  countries.    It is an observed fact that South Africa's trade with its  neighbors comprises only a very small part (less than 7 percent)  of its total external commerce--the country's inward looking  orientation was deplored by the African Development Bank in a  recent report prepared at the request of Egypt's Husni Mubarak.  All the more reason to expect, now that South Africa has turned  over a new ideological leaf and the former so-called frontline  states opposed to apartheid have done the same, that trade will  expand among the southern African countries with their combined  population of 115 million inhabitants--who represent 115 million  potential consumers--however slowly the economic capacity of  their respective countries might grow.  <H5>  Regional Integration </H5>   The next phase should be real regional integration, in  stages, by means of economic cooperation instruments whose role  now needs to be reexamined. This is the working hypothesis  advanced by Alan Hirsch, assistant director and economics  instructor at Cape University, one of the architects of South  Africa's future commercial policy, which was drawn up for  Mandela's ANC.    "Our neighbors have no reason to fear economic domination  from our side. On the contrary, it is in our interest to help  them expand their own economies," he says. This white official,  head of Cape's development policy research unit, developed the  theory at the meeting in Gaborone (Botswana) last February, in  collaboration with the ANC's "external trade relations" team and  representatives of the southern African countries.    This regional miniconference afforded an opportunity to see  the extremely cautious approach taken by both sides. While the  other countries in the region may favor increased cooperation  with Pretoria, they realize very clearly that in many product  areas, competition is likely to prevail over complementarity.  "There is such a gulf between South Africa and its neighbors  that there is a risk of killing embryonic industries in Namibia,  Botswana, and Zimbabwe," one expert confirmed.    On the South African side, the "Mandela team," and hence the  future government of national union, although describing itself  as intensely interested in relations with its neighbors, does  not intend to be diverted from the top priority of the hour,  amelioration of the country's domestic situation. However,, the  ANC has not ruled out consideration of other partners. "We do  want access to other markets besides Europe and southern  Africa," says Mr. Hirsch, adding that ANC already has made  contacts with the United States to ask for most favored nation  [MFN] status. The big lesson learned from the Gaborone meeting  was that if integration is going to happen, the panoply of  regional accords now in force will have to be revised.    These agreements come in several different forms, from  simple  free trade area to customs union, and even the beginnings of  what might evolve into a regional common market--"our own  version of the European Union," as President de Klerk puts it.  Already the region has a Common Monetary Area (CMA); a monetary  union comprising South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland; and a  South African Customs Union (SACU) that includes South Africa,  Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia (since its independence in 1990), and  Swaziland.    In addition to these monetary and customs institutions,  there  are economic cooperation agreements. The most important of these  is the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) that encompasses 18 central  and east African countries but until now has excluded South  Africa. The Southern Africa Development and Coordination  Conference (SADCC) composed of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,  Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe  has set its sights higher. Revamped in 1993 as the South African  Development Community (SADC), it intends to put its political  past behind it.  <H5>  Immigration Issue </H5>   In all likelihood, the future integration of the region,  with  Pretoria as catalyst, will be grafted onto PTA and SADC. But do  not forget: It is not going to happen in the immediate future.  "Hopes of seeing South Africa play a major role in the region  are probably exaggerated," says the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a study on the country's  future that appeared in the house magazine, OBSERVER. "The  private sector is clearly less committed to investing in the  region than was hoped, if only in terms of the small volume of  investments in South Africa itself," add the authors of the  article, underscoring the country's need to resolve its own  internal problems before anything else.    One of these is the increasing volume of immigration from  neighboring countries, which certainly will add new  complications to future commercial or economic negotiations  among the southern African countries. Mandela warned some time  ago that South Africa could not afford to become "the job market  for the entire region." More bluntly, his entourage has openly  admitted it will be necessary to "deport 2 million undesirables"  hailing from such places as Zaire and Mozambique. The future  government of national union may adopt legislation to this end.    Meanwhile, an ANC delegation visited France early this year  for talks with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. No doubt  Pasqua's lieutenants provided the ANC representatives with some  "tried-and-true" prescriptions in this domain.</p>

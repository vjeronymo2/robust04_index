			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has put  forward certain conditions for the continuance of the  India-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir, because India has weakened  the atmosphere in spite of the formal understanding between the  two countries to improve the situation in occupied Kashmir. He  said Pakistan considers fulfillment of some of the conditions to  be imperative -- the reduction in the forces in occupied  Kashmir, the release of Kashmiri leaders, and an end to brutal  repression -- for the continuation of the dialogue. The foreign  minister stated this at a news conference in Islamabad  yesterday, during which he commented on the upcoming  India-Pakistan foreign secretary-level talks on the Kashmir  issue beginning in Islamabad on 2 January. He said that  massacre, molestation of women, and the burning of villages all  continue in occupied Kashmir with no abatement of Indian  brutalities there.    Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that during the next round of  negotiations, comprehensive and detailed discussions will be  held on the Kashmir issue and Pakistan will approach the talks  with the utmost sincerity in spite of the grave situation  prevailing in the occupied valley, because Islamabad believes in  the negotiated settlement of this problem. He reiterated  Pakistan's commitment to hold talks on all aspects of the  Kashmir question and said, unlike New Delhi, Islamabad will  fulfill its commitment. India had a long time to improve the  situation in occupied Kashmir, and if New Delhi does not take  steps to improve the situation in the valley, there is no use  holding negotiations on the issue.    The foreign minister clarified that Pakistan has not asked  China to play the role of intermediary between India and  Pakistan. He added that China has expressed profound grief and  concern at the atrocities and violation of human rights  committed by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir. China, he said,  has welcomed the upcoming foreign secretary-level talks between  India and Pakistan.</p>

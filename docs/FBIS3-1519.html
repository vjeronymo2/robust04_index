The ad hoc commission has  been meeting behind closed door. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel  reports from Lusaka.    Good evening! The Ad Hoc Commission for the Conclusion of  the  Electoral Process continues to work for an agreement. What the  negotiators are doing is to define all issues connected with the  second round of presidential elections. So far, there is total  secrecy and nothing is known about the discussions, although  observers feel this issue will be easy to resolve.    This afternoon, while the commission was carrying out its  work, the remaining members of delegations from the government  and UNITA decided to meet alone, without third parties,  somewhere here in Lusaka. The objective of the meeting is not  known, but this is not new. Even in Abidjan, during situations  of impasse, the delegations met at secret venues in search of an  agreement. Taking this into account, it is very probable that  today's meeting was connected with the country's governance.  Although the parties are presently working on the conclusion of  the electoral process, the truth is that there is an impasse  with regard to the country's governance.</p>

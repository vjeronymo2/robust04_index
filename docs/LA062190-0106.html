Larry Lucas said. Lucas said the survey is the first stage in  determining "the community's willingness and ability to provide funding beyond  the state's support."  </P> <P> The district is facing an estimated $2.5 million in cuts from its 1991-92  budget and must find ways to finance school programs and capital improvement  projects, he said.  </P></p>

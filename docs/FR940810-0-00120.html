OSHA agrees that it is unnecessary to build lunchrooms in shipyard facilities, so long as the area provided for food consumption is not so close to the work area that asbestos contamination is likely. In that case,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> areas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are insufficient and an enclosed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> room <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  must be provided which is free of contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (11) Communication of Hazards to Employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (j) General Industry. Paragraph (k) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``communication of hazards'' provisions of the standards contain many revisions. The Court in 1988 had remanded two information transfer issues for OSHA's reconsideration. These were to extend the reporting and information transfer requirements and to require construction employers to notify OSHA of asbestos work. As discussed earlier, OSHA has decided not to require general pre-job notification to the Agency. However, the Agency has expanded required notifications among owners, employers and employees. Basically, the general industry standard has been upgraded to the more extensive notification requirements of the construction standard and the shipyard employment standards. Consequently this preamble section discusses the issues together. In the shipyard standard the ``building owner'' may be a vessel owner or a building owner. OSHA notes that in shipyards vessels undergoing repair may be owned by foreign entities, as well as by entities subject to the Act's jurisdiction. When a foreign-owned vessel is repaired in an American shipyard, the employer (either the shipyard or an outside contractor) must either treat materials defined as PACM as asbestos-containing or sample the suspect material and analyze it to determine whether or not it contains asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An overview of these revisions follows. The construction and shipyard standards now require that employers who discover the presence of material which is ACM or is presumed ACM (PACM) on the worksite, must notify the project or building owner. On worksites having multi-employers, the person who discovers the material also is to notify the other employers. An employer on a multi-employer worksite who is planning Class I or Class II asbestos work is to inform all the other employers on the site of the presence of ACM to which employees of those employers might reasonably be expected to be exposed. They are to be informed of the location and quantity of these materials and the measures to be taken to protect them from exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1986 construction standard required employers to notify other employers on multi-employer worksites of the existence and location of asbestos work, but was silent on the notification role of building owners. OSHA was concerned that building owners were ``outside the domain of the OSH Act.'' As noted above, this is a specific issue remanded for reconsideration by the Court of Appeals. Now, upon reconsideration, OSHA believes that it has authority to require building owners [as defined in paragraph (b)] who are statutory employers, to take necessary and appropriate action to protect employees other than their own. In the 1990 proposal OSHA pointed to other standards in which it has required building owners and other employers who are not the direct employers of the employees exposed to particular hazards, to warn of defects, take remedial action, or provide information to the directly employing employer. It cited the Hazard Communication Standard's requirement that manufacturers provide information to downstream employers (29 CFR 1910.1200) and the Powered Platform standard which requires the building owner to assure the contract employer that the building and equipment conform to specified design criteria as examples (29 CFR 1910.66(c).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that the building or project owner is the best and often the only source of information concerning the location of asbestos installed in structures; therefore, OSHA is requiring the owner to receive, maintain, and communicate knowledge of the location and amount of ACM or PACM to employers of employees who may be exposed. OSHA acknowledges that in shipyards, foreign vessel owners are not ``statutory employers'' and thus, are not covered by these standards. In such cases, the employer performing the ``refit'' must either presume that TSI and surfacing material are asbestos-containing, or have the material tested. When turn-around time must be minimized, the case in many overhauls, OSHA expects that the jobs will be performed in conformity with this standard without testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule provides a comprehensive notification scheme for affected parties_building owners, contract employers and employees, which will assure that information concerning the presence, location, and quantity of ACM or PACM in buildings is communicated in a timely manner to protect employees who work with or in the vicinity of such materials. Before Class I, II, or III work is initiated, building and/or project owners must notify their own employees and employers who are bidding on such work, of the quantity and location of ACM and PACM present in such areas. Owners also must notify their own employees who work in or adjacent to such jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (13): Stock market is in limbo - Growth is still being held back After its heady post-Gulf war bull run, Saudi Arabia's stock market finds itself in a state of limbo. Much of the speculative froth which followed the war has been knocked out of the market - though the past two years' often frantic activity have nonetheless turned it into what is by far the most vigorous market in the Middle East. However, it remains unclear where its growing maturity will take it. In particular, it is an open question whether the market is moving naturally towards any greater role as an intermediary between Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of privately-held wealth and the financing of domestic business and industry. It was essentially the repatriation of billions of riyals' worth of private Saudi wealth after the Gulf war that revived the market, which had tarried in the doldrums up to the war and after the oil price slump of the mid-1980s. Some economists in the kingdom calculate that up to SR30bn returned to the country, a repatriation inspired both by the fall in returns available in broader world markets and by unprecedented confidence in the financial security and potential rewards available at home. In a land officially based on Islamic law, and where interest-bearing accounts or financial instruments attract religious opprobrium, much of this money found immediate homes in real estate investments and the stock market, both of which subsequently roared ahead on a speculative wave. The effect on stocks was startling. The official market index, which had been stuck minimally above its 1985 base level of 100 at the immediate end of the Gulf conflict in February 1991, had by April the following year reached a record level of 233.82. The number of transactions rose from 10,790 in the first quarter of 1991 to 67,017 in the same period of 1992. Into this tide of speculative interest and available capital most of the country's joint stock banks and a small handful of industrial companies saw an opportunity to recapitalise - raising in the process what one banker estimates to have been around Dollars 3.5bn in new issues. That, in turn, considerably boosted the market's overall capitalisation and liquidity. Since then, the market has turned down considerably, though while the official index has bobbed along at around 180 for the past few months now, the volume and value of trades have remained substantially above pre-war levels and the new share-trading salons in the country's 12 commercial banks have never been more popular, or social, haunts. Even in its newly slimmer guise, the market's vital statistics still dwarf those of any other regional equity market. At the end of last month, the total value of quoted shares stood at around Dollars 50bn, a league ahead of the Middle East's second biggest capitalised market in Jordan, which had a total share value of just over Dollars 3bn in 1992. The value and volume of trades also considerably outstrip the comparatively sleepy markets in, for instance, Bahrain or Kuwait. In 1992, a total of 35m shares was traded in 272,075 transactions amounting to a gross value of more than Dollars 3.4bn. The banks, which alone are authorised by Sama, Saudi Arabia's central bank, to trade directly in what has evolved as a floorless market, are predictably delighted with the fee income the market has offered, which one describes as a 'gold mine'. They are also cheered by what they consider to be the market's maturity in having weathered the past year's downturn without this having turned into a panicky sell-off. 'People are beginning to make rational appraisals of stocks rather than try to take purely speculative gains,' says the general manager of one Riyadh bank. 'They're beginning to know the concept of book value and understand earnings per share - it's becoming a normal market.' But there remain features in the market, and for that matter the Saudi economy itself, which some critics believe are likely to impede much immediate further growth. For one thing, the sum of actually traded shares represents only between 7 and 10 per cent of the market's gross capitalisation and, according to bankers and economists, the great bulk of the country's total stock lies in the few hands of the kingdom's wealthiest individuals where, for the most part, it stays. For another, activity is highly concentrated in a small clutch of the 58 listed stocks. By virtue of the flood of scrip made available by the banks' recapitalisations, the banks alone account for six of the kingdom's top 10 capitalised joint stock companies, around 40 per cent of the market's overall capitalisation and, in 1992, 51 per cent of the value of all trades. Outside the banking sector, shares in only a couple of industrial companies  -the 70 per cent state-owned Sabic holding company and Savola, the vegetable oil group - could be considered liquid blue chips. The market's other sectors fall well behind. The seven quoted cement sector stocks make up just 6 per cent of total trades by value, the nine agriculture companies half that, while the five regional electricity utilities a mere 2 per cent of the value of trades. These, which pay a government regulated 7 per cent dividend annually, are widely regarded as the equivalent of fixed interest stocks. For the moment, there are no signs of other companies rushing to market. One reason for this is the possibility of an economic downturn over the next year - something traders say has already made the market twitchy. Only three companies are presently making arrangements for new issues. According to Mr Abdul-Aziz al-Dukheil, chairman of the Riyadh-based Consulting Centre for Finance and Investment, only three of the kingdom's 2,000 manufacturing groups have so far made use of the market to raise capital. Another reason, however, is the predominant structure of Saudi Arabia's biggest trading and contracting companies, which for the most part are tightly and privately owned by the kingdom's richest families. To date, most of these have preferred the privacy of their family ownership and demurred at the reporting requirements of the stock market. Moreover, most of these groups appear able to finance their business expansions themselves. Some analysts also point to the nature of the market as an impediment to growth. Although informal brokers do operate in the large 'grey' market outside the banks, they are actually forced to make trades through the banks, which have exclusive rights to use the three-year-old Electronic Securities Information System, the screens of which are proliferating across the country's banks. But some of these brokers claim that while the market is so decentralised, and while there is no central floor to serve as an open arena for market information, the present structure facilitates trading on privileged information. There is at the moment no real prohibition on insider trading. It is more the norm than the exception for well-placed investors to discover leading company results before they are formally reported. Such imperfect knowledge, suggest several brokers, makes for an imperfect market.</p>

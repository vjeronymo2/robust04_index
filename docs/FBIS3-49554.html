			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] At the HSP [Hungarian Socialist Party] delegates'  assembly in Miskolc it was finalized that the party's election  list in the county will be led by Sandor Nagy, chairman of the  largest Hungarian trade union grouping. Peter Juhasz reports.    [Juhasz] Today it was decided that Sandor Nagy, chairman of  the MSZOSZ [National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions], will  run in the parliamentary elections under the colors of the  Socialist Party. This was announced by Imre Szekeres, deputy  chairman of the party, in Miskolc after the HSP county  organization's session, adding that the regional list will be  led by Sandor Nagy.    [Begin Szekeres recording] I presume that behind this  decision lies the fact that in the past three and a half years a  political cooperation developed between the Hungarian Socialist  Party and the trade union organization in which both  organizations preserved their independence. We, the leaders of  the HSP and the Borsod county organization, believe that this  should also be signalled when putting forward candidates. We  appointed to the head of the list of a very important county  like this a well-known and popular person who represents  people's interests not only in the trade union movement but also  in social insurance, Dr. Sandor Nagy.

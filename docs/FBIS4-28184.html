			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  staged a joint air strike exercise in the skies above Oeyon and  Tokjok Islets and Wonju of South Korea on June 4 by massively  mobilizing some 20 fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes and  VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes based in  Japan proper and Kadena, Okinawa, and flying groups of the U.S.  Air Force present in South Korea, according to military sources.    In separate action on the same day, formations of  overseas-based pursuit-assault planes and fighter jets of the  U.S. Air Force present in South Korea flew in a ground-attack  support of puppet army units in a war exercise staged with  Pochon, Chunchon and Kapyong areas as operational theatres.    Their ceaseless war rackets clearly show that the U.S.  imperialists are rushing headlong along the road of military  adventure against the northern half of Korea.</p>

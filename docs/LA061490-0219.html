			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GETTING HELP IN TURNING OUT WELL-BEHAVED CANINES  </P> <P> Is your best friend addicted to jumping, chewing and barking?  </P> <P> Is he an obsessive people-pleaser?  </P> <P> Dogs have yet to join 12-step recovery groups, and they can't attend Chewers  Anonymous meetings. But the right dog trainer can curb most types of  dysfunctional behavior.  </P> <P> "A dog needs direction and needs to know how to please its master," said Jeff  Hoffman, senior officer in charge of the Humane Society of Ventura County.  "Without direction, a dog never knows what to expect."  </P> <P> When choosing a trainer, check references and sit in on a class, since trainers  are not required to be licensed. Some trainers use food as a reward, but  Hoffman and others caution that too many treats can produce a "counterfeit  dog," programmed to respond only to bribes. Praise, what dogs crave most,  should be the foundation of a trainer's work.  </P> <P> The following area dog trainers should be able to assist in turning out  well-behaved canines. All classes are one-hour sessions unless noted otherwise.  The sessions teach the basics of come, stay, heal, sit, stand, down and lie  down. Puppies are accepted into most classes at 3 to 6 months of age.  </P> <P> * Tony Rollins K-9 Academy in Port Hueneme offers nine-week group sessions for  $70. The groups meet at the academy, 278 S. Surfside Drive, each Saturday at 9  a.m. and Thursday at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Private, in-home sessions are held twice a week for six weeks and cost $300.  Kennel training, consisting of private, daily sessions held over three weeks at  the academy, cost $700. Brushup sessions are free during the first 10 days  after dogs have returned to their owners. Tony Rollins got his start training  dogs with a New York security firm in 1974. 986-3216.  </P> <P> * In-Home Professional Dog Training in Ventura offers 20 private lessons in a  four-week course priced at $350. Peggy Davis, a California state certified  trainer, said the 20-minute lessons are geared toward a dog's concentration  span.  </P> <P> "I put a heavy emphasis on socializing dogs," said Davis, who has trained dogs  for 25 years. "I want to make sure that dogs are comfortable around animals,  people, places, noises. I teach tricks after that or work on problem behaviors,  like chewing, barking or running out the door. But I tell people not to expect  their dog to act like Lassie after I'm through with him." 647-8853.  </P> <P> * Inglis Pet Hotel in Oxnard offers six-week group classes for $50. The classes  are held in the parking lot of the First Baptist Church on Saratoga Avenue and  Ralston Street in Ventura each Tuesday and Thursday at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Inglis employs three trainers who provide private lessons in residences or  parks for $20 per hour.

The dogs are trained at Kingsley's 45-acre ranch on Pine Mountain.  </P> <P> Kingsley also instructs six-week group classes on Saturday mornings at 8:30.

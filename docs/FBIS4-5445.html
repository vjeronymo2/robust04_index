			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, has  arrived in Vietnam for last stop on an Asian tour which has also  included Laos and Thailand. Mr. Keating is the first Australian  leader to visit Hanoi. Tomorrow, he will hold talks with top  Vietnamese leaders including President Le Duc Anh, the Communist  Party General Secretary Doi Muoi, and the Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet.    Australian officials say Mr. Keating will take a low-key  approach to human rights issues despite calls for a strong  statement from Vietnamese Buddhist group and some Australian  parliamentarians. The officials say they hope Vietnamese  officials will finalize arrangement for an Australian  parliamentary human rights delegation to visit Vietnam later  this year, but diplomats say the visit will concentrate on  expanding economic links with Vietnam. Australia is currently  the third largest investor in Vietnam taking $620 million  [currency not further specified], mostly for oil and  telecommunications projects. Two-way trade last year was worth  $366 million with Vietnam running up a $136 million surplus  through crude oil sales to Australia.    Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating has spent his first  afternoon in Vietnam sightseeing in Hanoi. The formal part of  the visit will begin in the morning with an official welcome  before beginning talks with Vietnamese leaders. Graeme Well  reports Mr. Keating's main purpose in going to Vietnam is to  assess the potential for economic development and what further  role Australia can play.    [Begin recording] [Well] Mr. Keating says Vietnam has a  great opportunity to develop and he believes Australia can help  make a difference in areas like aid programs, education, social  policies, and commerce. Responding to a call for him to change  his itinerary to acknowledge Australians who died in the Vietnam  War, Mr. Keating said he does not discriminate in commemorating  Australia's war dead. He repeated comments he made last year at  the opening of the Vietnam Memorial in Canberra.    [Keating in progress] ...[Words indistinct] same faith in  Australia and the same belief in our values as every other  service person did in other (?theaters) of the war. But  again.... This in Hanoi and, really, in places I am visiting  there is no natural opportunity as there was in Thailand. [end  recording]</p>

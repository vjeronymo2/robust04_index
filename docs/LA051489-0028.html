			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACKHEAD MANIACS: BIG ISSUES: POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE ****  KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * AIN'T THAT A  SHAME  </P> <P> 10,000 MANIACS "Blind Man's Zoo." Elektra ****  </P> <P> The soothing, distinctly unmaniacal single "Trouble Me" is a real salve for  damaged ears and emotions, as Natalie Merchant sweetly coos, "Trouble me,  disturb me with all your cares and your worries . . . Why let your shoulders  bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?"  </P> <P> It's a wonderful invitation to gentle, unburdened intimacy -- and a misleading  </P> <P> one. For Merchant spends the rest of 10,000 Maniacs' third album troubling us  with a litany of societal evils. And her lilting voice is such a captivating  instrument -- and the pop setting so deceptively pretty, yet structurally  unusual -- that even the socially unconscious may be a captive audience for her  horror stories.  </P> <P> The album begins bittersweetly with an accidental pregnancy (the bouncy "Eat  for Two") and ends in an inferno with a demented church janitor torching an  interracial nightclub (the string-laden "Jubilee"). In between these short  stories come big issues: covert "freedom-fighter" missions, Vietnam, the  American slave trade, the environment. Set in prose form on the lyric sheet,  the almost impossibly unwieldy verses read as fine as they sound.  </P> <P> Warning to hepsters: This is a pop album, elegantly produced by Peter Asher,  who has carefully loosed the "alternative" shackle and made the group suitable  for VH-1, to much elitist consternation.  </P> <P> Easy listening it's not; the content is as harsh as the style is non-abrasive.  A spoonful of Merchant's tender voice makes her bitter, medicinal words go down  quite beautifully, till we're ready to let her trouble us all the more. CHRIS  WILLMAN  </P></p>

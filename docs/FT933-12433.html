			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Major's victory fails to end leadership doubts: Confidence motion carried by 40 votes - Euro-rebels fall in line but threaten revenge MR JOHN MAJOR'S threat of a general election yesterday pulled the Conservative party back from the brink of self-destruction as the House of Commons finally gave its approval for ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But the prime minister's easy victory in the confidence motion following Thursday night's humiliating defeat over the treaty's social chapter failed to remove the question mark over his premiership. With Tory Eurosceptics threatening revenge after being forced to abandon their rebellion and ministers acknowledging that Mr Major's authority had suffered another blow, there was speculation about a leadership challenge in the autumn. Mr Major was joined by a phalanx of senior ministers in insisting that the final parliamentary debate on the treaty  - only a legal challenge could block ratification  - had drawn a line under the Tory civil war over Europe. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the government was at a turning point and predicted a decisive change in the political mood of the country after 'the last speech in the last debate on the ratification of Maastricht'. In public, both sides in the Conservative battle stressed their determination to put behind them the bitterness of the past year. After talks with the rebels, Mr Hurd acknowledged the strength of their conviction that the treaty would erode Britain's sovereignty, while Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said there would be no 'witch-hunt'. The prime minister, speaking after the government had secured a majority of 40 in the crucial confidence vote in favour of ratification of Maastricht with Britain's social chapter opt-out, denied that his position remained in peril. Stressing that the government would now move on to a domestic political agenda designed to sustain the economic recovery and step up the fight against crime, Mr Major said: 'I don't expect a leadership challenge in the autumn.' Echoing Mr Hurd's comments, Mr Major continued: 'I think the line has been drawn today . . . as far as the Conservative party is concerned the matter (Maastricht) is done and gone.' But his optimism was not echoed among the ranks of ministers and Conservative MPs packing the Commons chamber for the first confidence debate called by a government in recent political history. Mr Bill Cash, a leading Euro-sceptic, said in a TV interview: 'The whole question is going to continue because now people are going to have to see if the landscape that Maastricht does represent can actually work.' Senior ministers said they expected a crushing defeat for the Tories at the hands of Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats in next Thursday's by-election in the once impregnable stronghold of Christchurch. They conceded their hopes the government would regain its balance rested on the respite offered by the long parliamentary recess which begins next Tuesday. At least one cabinet minister was ready to predict 'a very rough autumn' unless the economic recovery gathers further pace. But Mr Major's tactics in threatening a general election if the Maastricht treaty were not ratified successfully forced the Tory sceptics to abandon the alliance with the opposition parties which triggered the government's earlier defeat. With their arguments against Maastricht dismissed by Mr Major as 'nonsense', the 23 rebels who had voted against the government on Thursday all reversed their allegiances. With the government retaining the support of the Ulster unionists, a Labour amendment to the confidence motion demanding that the government embrace the treaty's social provision was defeated by 339 to 301 votes. The motion of confidence was then won by the government by 339 to 299 votes. Only one Conservative MP, Mr Rupert Allason, did not vote after failing to return in time from abroad. The confidence debate, while something of an anti-climax, underlined the determination of Mr John Smith, Labour leader, to focus his party's attacks on Mr Major's leadership. In a savage assault, Mr Smith said the prime minister's 'authority and credibility' had been destroyed by his handling of the Maastricht legislation and by his refusal to embrace the treaty's social provisions.

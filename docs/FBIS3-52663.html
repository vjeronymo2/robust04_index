			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Most Israeli dailies on 5 January offer  extensive coverage of the Israeli negotiations with the PLO.  They report that progress has been made and two sides are  coming closer together, allowing for the probable resumption of  the Taba talks by next week.    Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English, in a page 1 report  compiled by Alon Pinkas, Batsheva Tsur, and news agencies,  writes that "Senior sources in Jerusalem said progress has been  made on several points, which were contained in the fax sent to  the PLO." The POST details some of the controversial points.  Concerning control of the Jordan River bridges the report  states: "the compromise will allow for a symbolic Palestinian  presence." On the issue of international supervisors at the  checkpoints, "the PLO will accept Israel's refusal to allow any  international force or observers to be present." Regarding  Palestinian access to the Dead Sea the sides will agree that  "the issue be further negotiated." On the issue of private  land, the POST writes that "the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] --  in the areas which it controls -- will respect privately owned  Palestinian land."    Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew, in a page A1 report by Aluf  Ben,  Gay Bekhor, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Gid'on Alon, reports on  yesterday's fax and phone contacts between Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres and Nabil Sha'th, in which two issues were  discussed: "How to define the Cairo understanding, and whether  this understanding stands on its own or should be seen as part  in a series of contacts. Israel has expressed willingness to  soften its definitions and no longer demands to define the Cairo  draft as an 'agreement'.    "According to political sources, the Palestinians are no  longer referring to PLO Chairman 'Arafat's demands for  introducing substantial changes into the Cairo understandings.  This is construed as a concession to the Israeli position."    Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew, in a page 1 report by  Avner  Regev, reports that "last week PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat phoned  Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and asked him to  tell Prime Minister Rabin that the Cairo talks entanglement can  be solved if Rabin agrees to enlarge the Jericho area. In  exchange 'Arafat will give Israel what it wants on the Jordan  bridges." The paper goes on to say that Darawshah relayed this  message to the prime minister.    Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew, in a report on pages 1  and 15 by Shim'on Schiffer and Nahum Barne'a, states that  despite progress, "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin rejected an  offer by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to meet on 15 January, a day  prior to the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva."    Senior political sources, who commented on this issue  yesterday, said that "'Arafat requested a meeting with Rabin on  15 January to reach an understanding on the implementation of  the self-administration in Gaza and Jericho prior to the  Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva on 16 January. According to  many assessments, the Clinton-al-Asad summit could place the  Syrian talks at the center of the political negotiations at the  expense of the Palestinian track.    "It has further been learned that Rabin also rejected  'Arafat's suggestion that they join Clinton and al-Asad at the  Geneva summit."    The report adds that "the prime minister asked the MK's and  ministers who plan to meet 'Arafat in Tunis to stop these  private initiatives which harm the negotiations between Israel  and the PLO'."    YEDI'OT also writes that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  yesterday reiterated his opposition to U.S. mediation in the  current controversy between Israel and the PLO." Rabin, in a  farewell party to outgoing U.S. Ambassador Bill Brown, said:  "We cooked this dish together with the Palestinians, so now we  will fix it without outside intervention."</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP AND L.A. SCHOOL BOARD BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE  </P> <P> Why haven't city officials offered a portion of the Central City West  Development Project (Part A, May 22) as a possible school site? With Los  Angeles' need for new schools coupled with the controversy surrounding the  23.5-acre Ambassador Hotel site, our city would surely make room in this  355-acre area for at least one new school.  </P> <P> GARY GARCIA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

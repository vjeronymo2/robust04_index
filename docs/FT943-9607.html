			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union While the details of Commercial Union's purchase of Groupe Victoire have barely changed since the deal was announced in June, there is nothing in yesterday's funding package to worry shareholders. Gearing of around 50 per cent looks comfortable, especially since UK insurance operations are close to their profitable peak. Although the deal will dilute earnings this year and next, investors looking for a decent long-term return might welcome the addition of debt to the funding mix. The low levels of gearing seen elsewhere in the sector may be too conservative to deliver a decent return on shareholders funds' once the UK insurance cycle turns down. It is equally difficult to see the presence of Societe Generale and Compagnie de Suez on the share register as anything but helpful for an insurer with serious ambitions in France. CU's asset mix will also stand out from the crowd once Victoire has been absorbed. The group's property portfolio will treble as a proportion of total assets to 16 per cent, among the highest in the sector. If CU has its timing right, investment gains on its large slice of residential Paris could more than make up for early dilution in terms of earnings. Neither influential shareholders nor decent investment returns will help CU if Victoire does not perform as an insurance company. If Victoire delivers on its promise, though, the structure of the deal could prove to be the icing on the cake.</p>

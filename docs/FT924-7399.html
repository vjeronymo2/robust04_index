			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Councils warned on tenants' rights COUNCIL TENANTS should be allocated some of the 20,000 unsold owner-occupied properties which are to be acquired by the Housing Corporation in the period to the end of March, Sir George Young, housing minister, suggested in the Commons last night. He said council tenants dissatisified with their existing homes and unable to transfer to other council accommodation should have the chance to move into premises secured from the private sector. Sir George called on local authorities and housing associations to co-operate in using the additions being made to the public housing stock to promote 'mobility' for existing council tenants. He acknowledged that council tenants who chose to move would lose the right to buy their homes, but envisaged that many would be prepared to do so in order to live in a more attractive property. Sir George stressed that the council properties released in the process could be used to house homeless families. He said Pounds 630m would be spent in England in the next four months, and estimated that private-sector money would result in Pounds 1bn being available to aid the recovery of the housing market. Mr John Battle, a Labour housing spokesman, attacked the government's refusal to allow local authorities to use the capital receipts already accumulated from council house sales to provide new homes and renovate and repair existing properties. Mr Simon Hughes (Lib Dem Southwark and Bermondsey) condemned the government's failure to permit councils to use accrued receipts of Pounds 5.5bn.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax encouragement for investment in smaller businesses - Venture Capital Trusts To promote investment in smaller businesses additional tax reliefs are being introduced for Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs). Investments in VCTs will receive 20 per cent up-front relief on up to Pounds 100,000 a year, provided the shares are held for at least five years. Dividends and capital gains will also be tax-free. The tax on up to Pounds 100,000 of capital gains on other assets may be deferred when they are reinvested in new VCT shares. The new reliefs will cost Pounds 150m in 1995-96 and Pounds 290m the following year. VCTs are aimed at promoting a culture of investing in risk and encourage the many active British entrepreneurs. This is a new scheme, aimed at generating risk capital in the unquoted company sector, while giving investors the security of a quoted pooled vehicle. Companies can raise up to Pounds 1m a year through the scheme. The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) will also be enhanced by extending capital gains tax reinvestment relief to investments in the EIS. To simplify the scheme, the rules on interests in land and parallel trades, and a rule which can deny relief when a company makes a rights issue, will be abolished. To widen small companies' access to external finance representatives of small business and others will be consulted on the development of a financial management certificate. The aim would be to devise a certificate that provided a clear signal of a company's financial competence, providing an incentive for them to improve and implement financial management skills. The Loan Guarantee Scheme will be made simpler and more attractive. To help businesses in difficulty the president of the Board of Trade will issue a paper on insolvency reform. An important element will be a 28-day moratorium that will be binding on all parties. This will give management a breathing space to assess the rescue prospects and to come to an arrangement with creditors. There will be safeguards to prevent abuse, and to preserve integrity of financial markets. The government will also consult further on a mechanism to assist the substitution of equity for the debt of companies in administration or receivership. This could have a profound influence on behaviour during insolvency negotiations and lead all parties to focus on the potential of the business for continued trading. Separately, individuals will now be able to claim tax relief on necessary expenditure after trading has ceased. To reduce burdens on small businesses the average monthly payment threshold below which small employers can account quarterly for PAYE and national insurance contributions will be raised from Pounds 450 to Pounds 600. Traders will be consulted on a move to annual VAT returns and payments for small businesses. It is envisaged that those who voluntarily register for VAT will make annual returns by the end of 1995, with a possible extension to businesses with an annual turnover below Pounds 100,000 the following year. Dispensations given to employers by the Inland Revenue on tax-free expenses paid to employees will also count for national insurance purposes. The VAT registration threshold will be raised from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 46,000 and the penalty for failing to register for VAT will be reduced in line with the 1993 changes in other VAT penalties. The threshold above which monthly Intrastat returns must be made will be raised from Pounds 140,000 of annual intra-EU trade to Pounds 150,000.</p>

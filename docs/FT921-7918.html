			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Redland resumes war of words REDLAND, the building materials group which is making a hostile Pounds 625m bid for its rival Steetley, yesterday resumed its assault after receiving a favourable indication from the trade and industry secretary on Tuesday. With Steetley's rival plan to merge some of its operations with Tarmac referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Redland has written to Steetley shareholders amplifying previous criticisms and making new claims about cost savings. It has not so far moved on its offer of 85 shares for every 100 of Steetley's, with a mainly cash alternative. The offers value Steetley's shares at nearly 400p or 361p respectively, compared with the target's closing price of 388p. The latest document attacks Steetley's profit performance over the past five years, its high gearing - 67 per cent on net debt of Pounds 242m, low interest cover and intention to pay an uncovered dividend. It questions its claim to have a focused business and criticises its efforts at expansion overseas, notably in France. The new claim for annual cost savings of Pounds 30m raised eyebrows at Steetley. Mr Richard Miles, managing director, said: 'We don't believe that figure.' He challenged Redland to spell out how it would be done. He also retaliated against the comparison of profit records, saying that Steetley had performed better than Redland over the past 10 years in terms of increases in pre-tax profit, earnings and dividend. The Takeover Panel said yesterday that the bid timetable would resume after the secretary of state announced that the Redland offer would definitely not be referred to the MMC. The announcement was expected soon after February 25 and 'day 39' would be two days later.</p>

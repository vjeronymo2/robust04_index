			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ambroveneto raises profits 31% to L171bn BANCO AMBROSIANO Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private sector bank, raised parent bank net profits by 31 per cent to L171.4bn (Dollars 106m) last year, in spite of the recession and the need for write-downs on securities holdings. The improvement restores the upward trend in earnings which had been upset by the need for substantial write-downs on the book value of two subsidiaries in 1991. However, the dividend remains unchanged at L150 for ordinary shares and L170 for savings shares. Gross operating income, net of interest on overdue accounts, rose 17.4 per cent to L710bn due to an improved interest margin and a 'significant' contribution from fee income. Ambroveneto set aside L253bn for loan loss provisions last year, compared with L180bn in 1991. Write-downs on securities and investments amounted to L71bn, against L207bn the previous year, when L170bn was set aside for the newly-acquired Citibank operation. Deposits rose by 21 per cent to L21,367bn and lending by 21 per cent to L18,836bn.</p>

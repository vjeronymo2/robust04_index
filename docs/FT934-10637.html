			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Mercedes returns to motor racing MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car producer currently losing money and cutting tens of thousands of jobs, is launching one of the most ambitious international motor sport programmes to be undertaken by any carmaker in recent years. It is officially re-entering grand prix racing next year for the first time since 1954. The following year it will also start competing in North America's rival to grand prix, IndyCar racing. And it is to use its new smallest C-class model for an official attack on the illustrious German touring car championship. While the move is likely to be criticised in some German quarters as inappropriate at a time of crisis, Mercedes executives justify it on the ground that it is essential to reinforce Mercedes' now threatened image as a technology leader at a time of increasingly severe competition from rival - particularly Japanese - luxury carmakers. The move into North American motor racing, in particular, is seen as almost unavoidable given that both Honda and Toyota are planning to make their IndyCar debuts next year. North America is by far the world's biggest luxury car market. Like virtually every other carmaker participating in motor sport, Mercedes yesterday gave no indication of the programme's likely costs. Motor sport is one of the most expensive of all promotional and marketing activities, with leading grand prix teams such as Williams or McLaren requiring at least Pounds 20m to operate for a season. Mercedes' grand prix and IndyCar involvement will be mainly through the supply of engines, in the same way as Renault and Ford supply engines to the Williams and Benetton teams respectively. Mercedes is relying not on German expertise but the UK's world-leading motor sport industry. It is buying an equity stake in Ilmor Engineering, the small Northampton-based engine specialist, which has been supplying the Swiss Sauber team in grand prix this year.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTER HAWLEY POSTS LOSS OF $26 MILLION; WILL CUT STAFF  </P> <P> Carter Hawley Hale Stores, trying to turn around its debt-ridden retailing  empire, said Tuesday that it had agreed to sell its Thalhimers chain to May  Department Stores for roughly $325 million and that it will slash 1,000 jobs  from its four other divisions.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based retailer, parent of the Broadway-Southern California,  also provided fresh evidence of why it needs to revitalize: It reported a loss  of $26 million for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 4.  </P> <P> Analysts credited Carter Hawley with taking needed steps to restore its  financial health and to comfort its suppliers but said the company still  suffers from weak sales at its department stores.  </P> <P> Company officials said they will cut about 400 jobs in Southern California  during the next 12 to 18 months. The other 600 doomed jobs are in the San  Francisco, Sacramento and Phoenix areas.  </P> <P> Edwin J. Holman, Carter Hawley's senior vice president for operations, said the  company expects to avoid layoffs and to make all of the reductions -- which  amount to slightly more than 3% of its work force -- through attrition. Carter  Hawley employs about 36,500 workers, including 6,500 at Thalhimers,  headquartered in Richmond, Va.  </P> <P> Holman said the eliminated positions will largely include jobs for dock  workers, stock clerks and middle managers. Administrative jobs will also be cut  as the company consolidates some office operations after selling Thalhimers,  Carter Hawley's last chain outside the West.  </P> <P> Some senior executive positions "probably" will be slashed too, but Holman said  no specific plans have been made on that score. One of the few areas not  expected to be included in the cuts is the sales staff.  </P> <P> Through its various cutbacks, Carter Hawley hopes to save $35 million a year at  its four remaining divisions.  </P> <P> The Thalhimers deal, on the other hand, was intended to pump fresh funds into  cash-starved Carter Hawley. The agreement calls for St. Louis-based May, the  nation's biggest department store company and parent of the May Co. California  and Robinson's chains in Los Angeles, to pay a base price of $325 million in  cash for Thalhimers.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley estimates that it could get as much as $15 million more for the  chain, depending partly on how much it spends at Thalhimers stores by the time  the deal closes. Officials expect the sale to be completed by year-end.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley will use $180 million of the proceeds to pay off debt tied to the  Thalhimers chain, which operates 26 stores in Virginia, the Carolinas and  Tennessee. The remaining funds will, among other things, help the company boost  its store remodeling program from $40 million during the past year to $55  million annually this year and next.  </P> <P> To get that needed financing, however, Carter Hawley parted with one of its few  jewels. Thalhimers, which it bought in 1978, is second in performance only to  Broadway-California among Carter Hawley's chains. With sales of $446 million  last year, it accounted for nearly 16% of the parent company's revenue.  </P> <P> For May, Thalhimers gives the company its first stores in the Carolinas and  brings it into other areas where it has few outlets.  </P> <P> Analysts said it appeared to be a good deal for both sides, with Carter Hawley  getting crucial funds to remodel some of its badly run-down stores. Chairman  Philip M. Hawley "had to continue to finance the modernization program or he  had to find someone to buy the company," said Barre W. Littel of First Boston  Corp.  </P> <P> "This gives them a new lease on life," added Edward Weller of Montgomery  Securities. "It gives them a lot of leeway."  </P> <P> Weller said the sale also allows Carter Hawley to "concentrate on the  California market, which they know better."  </P> <P> Wall Street didn't universally praise the developments, however. Carter  Hawley's $350 million in junk bonds climbed Tuesday, but a key bond rating  agency, Moody's Investors Service, downgraded Carter Hawley's debt.  </P> <P> Moody's said it took the action based, among other things, "on the company's  increasingly vulnerable share position in the highly competitive California  market" and "its continuing lackluster operating performance."  </P> <P> In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones industrial  average was off 78.22, Carter Hawley stock fell 37.5 cents to close at $3.  That's down from $14 in the summer of 1989.  </P> <P> Analysts were somewhat disappointed with the financial results released  Tuesday. The $26-million loss for the year, versus profits of $13.5 million a  year ago, far exceeded the deficit of $2 million to $8 million many had  projected.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley and analysts noted, however, that most of the loss stemmed from a  so-called non-cash charge -- a $22.2-million accounting adjustment to reflect  unanticipated inflation and a reduction in the company's inventories. The  company also took a $16.5-million charge to cover uninsured expenses stemming  from last year's Bay Area earthquake.  </P> <P> Excluding one-time accounting adjustments and interest payments, Carter  Hawley's operating earnings fell 0.5% to $172.2 million. Sales for the year  totaled $2.86 billion, up 2.5%.  </P> <P> Most of Carter Hawley's loss came in the fourth quarter, when it posted a  deficit of $25.5 million on flat sales of $623.3 million. In the same quarter a  year earlier, the company lost $8.3 million.  </P> <P> To a great extent, Carter Hawley's trouble stems from the $350 million in  junk-bond debt that it took on in 1987 to reorganize and fend off a takeover  attempt by the Limited and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. Analysts have also faulted  the company for the poor condition of its stores and the company's lack of a  clear-cut merchandising strategy.  </P> <P> Like many other chains, Carter Hawley is also being hurt badly by the national  slowdown in consumer spending.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley owns Emporium in the Bay Area, Weinstocks in Sacramento and  Phoenix-based Broadway-Southwest, along with Broadway-Southern California and  Thalhimers. After the Thalhimers deal, it will have 88 department stores.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carter Hawley is credited with taking needed steps to restore its financial  health, but analysts say the company still suffers from weak sales at its  department stores.  </P></p>

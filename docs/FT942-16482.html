			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Wine: A tiny reef of grape in a sea of Australian sheep - Jancis Robinson goes to Coonawarra to see an odd piece of marketing It was a marvellously unlikely scene for such a remote corner of South Australia. On a specially constructed platform above a sea of vines, two dozen Australian men, muted by the double indignity of wearing both ties and make-up, sat at tables with fancy white tablecloths flapping in the breeze of a Coonawarra sunset. Some had flown thousands of miles across the outback for the sixth Wynnsday, an annual triumph of wine marketing. On a Wednesday each March - the Australian pronunciation of Wednesday being, almost exactly, Wynnsday - the new vintage of Wynns Coonawarra Estate wines is launched throughout Australia with simultaneous tastings in each of the six major cities, linked and broadcast by satellite. Television cameras between the vines transmitted the views of assorted pundits on Wynns' 1991 range to the nation - or, at least, to the 4,000 enthusiasts and retailers who had assembled for similar tastings in hotel ballrooms around the country. 'G'day, Brisbane. What's your question for our winemaker, Peter Douglas?' was a typical link. Wynns, as its slogan continues to remind the avid Australian wine-drinking public, is 'The estate that made the Coonawarra world-famous.' It is not the oldest, but it was the Wynn family which saved the region from reverting to sheep farming by showing its extraordinary affinity for Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in the 1950s and 1960s when the Australian market was still dominated by things sweet and sticky. Today, the Wynns themselves make Mountadam, Eden Ridge and David Wynn wines 250 miles north in the Eden Valley, while Wynns Coonawarra Estate is part of the Southcorp group (which includes packaging and making water heaters among its other enterprises). Southcorp Wines Pty, re-named recently, controls about a third of all Australian wine production including such names as Penfolds, Lindemans, Seppelt, Tollana, Wynns, Seaview, Leo Buring, Killawarra, Rouge Homme and a host of other familiar names. In Coonawarra alone - an extraordinary island of well-drained, fertile terra rossa which is the remains of an ancient coral reef, less than 10 miles long and hardly a mile across - Southcorp controls not just Wynns (which is in the happy position of itself owning a third of the region's vineyards) but, through its other subsidiaries, also has by far the dominant share of the country's most prized, virtually unextendable, wine region Coonawarra. Just down the road (and there really is only one road) from Wynns are the Lindemans and Rouge Homme wines, made at a quite distinct winery, and Penfolds' 600 acres of Coonawarra vines (as well as a distribution agreement with the extensive Katnook estate). The remarkable feature of Southcorp wine policy is that all these subsidiaries and close neighbours are run in fierce competition with each other. Differences in vine growing and wine-making techniques are encouraged. All Southcorp vineyards in this under-populated area are heavily mechanised, however (like those of all but a handful of growers such as Petaluma), and are characterised by widely-spaced rows of rampant vines. This smooths out annual variations in yields, but satisfies the company's accountants more than wine critics. The fertile terra rossa sells for up to ADollars 1,500 (Pounds 721) an acre (twice as much as land one mile east or west). Houses, therefore continue to be razed and Lindemans, for example, solves the problem of a small and disappearing work force by 'minimal' pruning. This leaves the fruit to find its own way out to the light from a tangle of canes on about a third of each of its top vineyards at Pyrus, Limestone Ridge and St George. Each of these vineyards is described, dolefully, as a 'finite resource'  - a relatively new viticultural concept in Australia. But Southcorp is continuing a commitment to producing a wide and competing range of top-quality wines - an unusual trait in a company of this size. Since the 1960s, Penfolds has been proud of its in-house legend in the form of Penfolds Grange, a deep, rich red described famously by Hugh Johnson in his wine atlas as 'Australia's one first growth.' Since then, wine-makers throughout the group (the ownership and constitution of which have been in constant evolution) have been worked hard to produce rivals for Grange, such as the Lindemans' single vineyard wines. Wynns' nominee was launched with the 1982 vintage as John Riddoch Cabernet Sauvignon, an intense and rapturously received essence of Coonawarra from Wynns' oldest vineyards. It was joined last year by Michael Hermitage 1990 (although, under the terms of the recent bilateral trade agreement with Europe, it will eventually have to be renamed Michael Shiraz to bring in the name of the grape variety). This incredible hulk is already selling at ADollars 80 a bottle. And the phones were buzzing last Wynnsday with customers begging to increase their allocations of the Michael Hermitage 1991, released that day at around ADollars 38 a bottle. Tiny quantities (which should be aged for a good 10 years) should reach Oddbins in the UK by the beginning of June and will sell for about Pounds 15. But Wynns' real bargain, and a wine probably better suited to the more modest dimensions of the average European palate, is the black label Wynns Coonawarra Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The handsome 1988 and ripe 1990 are Pounds 7.99 at Oddbins and Victoria Wine and will be followed by the 1991, a truly fine, beautifully-balanced wine designed less to impress than express Coonawarra. Douglas has wrought miracles since arriving in 1985. Southcorp's divide-and-rule policy, however, means that he and fellow wine-maker Sue Hodder must battle to see some of the wine produced at Wynns Coonawarra Estate selected as an ingredient in, say, Penfolds Grange. Penfolds Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon depends particularly heavily on Wynns input. Only about 40 per cent of the grapes crushed this year at the distinctive, three-gabled winery illustrated on each label of Wynns Coonawarra Estate will be bottled under that name. It also vinifies the produce of Southcorp's substantial, and expanding, vineyard holdings in the rest of this usefully cool, south-east corner of South Australia - Padthaway, in particular. On Wynnsday, the winery was processing early-picked Pinot Noir grapes en route to the Southcorp sparkling wine plant at Great Western over the border in Victoria. Truckloads of grapes had also been shipped down from the heavily-irrigated Riverland, 200 miles north, when rot threatened to damage the crop if it waited until the local Southcorp winery was ready for it. This is how big can be beautiful in the wine business.</p>

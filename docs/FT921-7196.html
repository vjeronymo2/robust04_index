			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Supreme Court to rule on abortion row THE focus of Ireland's abortion controversy shifts to the Supreme Court today following the decision of the family of a 14-year-old rape victim to appeal against a High Court injunction made last week which prevents her from travelling to Britain for an abortion, Tim Coone reports from Dublin. At the weekend, some 5,000 demonstrators blocked the streets of central Dublin in protest at the High Court ruling, and demanded a referendum on the abortion issue. Prominent among the demonstrators was Sinead O'Connor, the Irish singer who has admitted publicly to having had two abortions in Britain. Further demonstrations are planned for today and tomorrow. The Supreme Court is expected to make its ruling by Wednesday. The government has offered to pay the costs of the appeal, and is clearly hoping that the Supreme Court will overturn the High Court injunction, which many legal experts in Dublin regard as having been an exceptionally rigid interpretation of the 1983 'right-to-life' constitutional amendment. If the Supreme Court upholds the injunction, however, the Irish government may then be forced to hold a referendum in order to avoid being dragged through the European Court of Justice. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said last week that he would call for a referendum on abortion 'as a last resort'. Few political leaders in Ireland wish to see a re-run of the bitter and divisive debate that took place in 1983.</p>

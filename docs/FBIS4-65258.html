			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a statement by Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Richard Duque yesterday, France "strongly urges" North  Korea to accept the new International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) mission which might be sent within the next couple of  days to inspect Pyongyang's nuclear facilities, where the  production of an atomic bomb is suspected to be taking place.  During this new mission, the inspections at the Yongbyon  reprocessing plant, where IAEA experts were prevented from  conducting crucial tests in March, should be continued.</p>

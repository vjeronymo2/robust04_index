			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Yavorskyy: "Political Ruminations: </F> Democrats, Nationalists, Communists and Others..."]    [Text] No one can deny that the majority of Ukrainians are  extremely inert, both in politics and every aspect of human  endeavour. This unbelievable passivity includes business, in  which Ukrainian interests are by-and-large limited to narrow  consumerism. "Go with the flow", "don't rock the boat," "don't  look for trouble" and "don't think too much" are aphorisms that  fit such people. This general apathy is the reason that other  nationalities are beginning to dominate all new businesses and  commercial enterprises.    This fact of life sharply differentiates Ukraine from other  countries and a fact of life that Ukrainian politicians have to  live with.    In practical terms this means that a small well-organized  and  determined group can take over Ukraine if it is dynamic enough.  There is no need to bother with moral support from the Ukrainian  masses. The latter will follow once they feel they are being  adequately governed. The formation of a society always depends  on a strong center of power, be it an individual or an  organization, that has demonstrated a will to rule and organize.    What are the main political groups in Ukraine today? We hear  mostly about democrats, nationalists or communists. What do they  want? (Unfortunately, little is said about liberals and Russian  chauvinists.)    There is much confusion about what they want and, in fact,  about differences among them. This is largely due to misuse of  terminology and a deliberate attempt by some politicians to  obfuscate things rather than speak openly about their views.    Nevertheless, we shall attempt to clarify matters.    Every political group has an ideology that represents a  value  system and gives the group its name.    Democrats value the concept of democracy as the greatest  good, i.e., a state of tolerance of various viewpoints.    Communists value the concept of the commune as the greatest  good, i.e., communality, equality, and sharing.    Nationalists value the concept of the nation, i.e.,  preservation and protection of the national and cultural  existence of a people.    Are these values contradictory and require a confrontation?  Even if between the democrats and communists there is some  degree of dissonance because of democratic tolerance and  communist mandatory sharing of property, there should be no  disagreement between communists and nationalists since their  main values are not contradictory. Yet nationalists and  communists are perceived as diametrically opposed forces.    Why should communists struggle with nationalists? After all,  the most important thing to the communists is a communist  society and to the nationalists a national Ukrainian state. The  latter concentrate on statehood and the former on social order.  The nationalists are unconcerned about the social order and the  communists about Ukrainian statehood,    In short, there is no rational basis for a conflict between  the nationalists and communists and they could cooperate in  founding a communist Ukrainian state. Even the democrats could  participate in this venture without too much trouble since a  national state does not preclude democracy. In addition, the  philosophy of tolerance allows the democrats to reach an  understanding with the communists.    In theory, all three groups could accommodate each other to  some extent in Ukraine. But reality is something else, and we  see an uncompromising confrontation between communists on the  one hand and the democrats and nationalists on the other.    But the struggle in Ukraine is not for democracy or  communism  or an analogous philosophy, but for the very notion of statehood  for the Ukrainian nation.    In addition to democratic principles, the democrats advocate  national statehood which to them is just as important as  democracy and for that reason they have been called  national-democrats. The communists propose--more-or-less  openly--liquidation of Ukrainian independence and resuscitation  of the Russian-communist empire known as the USSR. In this they  are in agreement with the Russian chauvinists who long for a  Russian empire regardless of its social order.    The key question is whether communism or the Russian empire  is the real preference of the communists in Ukraine. If  communism is their primary goal then liberals, advocates of  individual freedom and private property, should be their primary  adversary. But that is not the case. The communists have  targeted nationalists and national-democrats--not liberals or  garden-variety democrats--as their primary enemies, i.e.,  advocates of the Ukrainian national statehood.    Accordingly, since their primary goal is the liquidation of  Ukrainian statehood and renewal of the Russian empire, they are  better identified as Russian communists/chauvinists rather than  as simply communists.    It is imperative that we have a clear understanding of the  political goals of every movement in order to understand the  social processes occurring in Ukraine. Any confusion as to the  orientation of the key players can have catastrophic  consequences.    Every citizen of Ukraine should understand that the struggle  in Ukraine is not about democracy, communism, capitalism, etc.,  but for the very existence of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation.  The political forces in Ukraine are divided into only two  groups: for and against national statehood. The first category  encompasses nationalists, national-democrats and other political  movements (including Marxists) who support Ukrainian national  independence. The second category is made up of communists or,  more accurately, communists/chauvinists or simply Russian  chauvinists and others who want to destroy Ukrainian  independence.    Since the very existence of Ukrainian statehood is at stake  we must take care not to be distracted by secondary issues such  as democracy, communism, market economy, etc., at the risk of  losing our independence. The people have to be educated to  defend the Ukrainian state against its enemies and not dissipate  their energies struggling against communism or for democracy,  capitalism or even Christian ideals. Ukrainian independence must  be the primary goal for which we struggle. Other considerations  are important but take a back seat when Ukrainian existence is  at risk.</p>

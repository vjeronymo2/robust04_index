			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> THE ROCKIES;  </P> <P> 'NUISANCE' GRIZZLY HUNTING PROPOSED  </P> <P> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed opening the forests around  Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks to controlled hunting of grizzly  bears that menace people or livestock. The huge bears are protected under the  federal Endangered Species Act, although limited hunting is allowed in  northwestern Montana and Alaska. The plan, which is open to public comment for  60 days, would allow hunters to take "nuisance" grizzlies in more than 10  million acres of southwestern Montana, northwestern Wyoming and eastern Idaho.  </P></p>

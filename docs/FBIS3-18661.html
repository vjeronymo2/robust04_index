			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gr. Roumbanis] </F>   [Excerpt] Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros  Pangalos yesterday described the Ankara regime as "far worse  than a dictatorship." He also said that Turkey was never a  state of justice, and in some cases imitates and exceeds  Hitler's policies.    Speaking at the presentation of a book about the Greeks of  Istanbul by Alexandros Alavanos, Coalition of the Left and  Progress deputy, the Greek alternate foreign minister launched  an all-out attack against Turkey for its violation of human  rights and its expansionist policy, for which Cyprus is now  paying in the most tragic way.    At the beginning, both the Greek alternate foreign minister  and the author referred to the history of the famous 1964 secret  decree, with which the Ankara government prohibits the Greeks  living in Istanbul from transferring their properties and  confiscates the property.    In 1980, another law was added to that decree, prohibiting  the execution of wills for the Greeks living in Istanbul. Both  men stressed that even though these decrees are contrary to the  association agreement between the European Union and Turkey,  they are still in effect. They said the issue will now be  brought to the attention of the European Union.    Pangalos noted that the 1964 decree was inspired by a  similar  decree Hitler issued in 1935 that was used to confiscate  property belonging to Jews. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Draft State Budget Sent to Parliament </F> for Approval"]    [Text] According to the republic's deputy minister of  finance, Fikret Yusifov, the income part of the budget assumes  revenue of 138.4746 billion manats, and the expense  part--181.3717 billion manats. Thus, the budget will have a  deficit of 42.8971 billion manats.    F. Yusifov noted that such a large deficit is the result of  a  decline in the level of production, which has dropped  several-fold as compared to 1992. In order to cover the deficit,  the following steps are being planned, in particular:  implementation of the state privatization program, which will  help to earn 5 billion manats; changing prices for alcoholic  beverages, which should bring 1.3 billion into the budget;  raising prices for fuel and energy and bread; introducing  value-added tax on imported goods, which will bring in 4.6  billion over the remaining seven months; and so on. The deputy  minister of finance also emphasized that raising the minimum  wage from 900 to 2,000 manats is in the works, which will  require additional budget expenditures. This difference is  expected to be covered by raising retail prices on gasoline and  the recently approved tax in the amount equal to two minimum  wages on each square meter of space occupied by commercial trade  and public catering entities. F. Yusifov said, however, that  raising the minimum wage will only lead to another jump in  market prices and in the final count an even greater decline in  the population's living standard. As a KHABAR-SERVICE  correspondent learned from competent sources in the republic  government, three options for raising gasoline prices are now  under consideration: 40, 50, and 60 manats per liter. Most  likely the middle figure will be chosen, which will bring into  the budget an additional 25-30 billion manats, but still will  not be enough to raise the minimum wage.</p>

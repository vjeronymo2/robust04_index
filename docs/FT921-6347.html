			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Canada seeks entry clause for others CANADIAN negotiators have told the US they think an accession clause setting out the procedure for the admission of more members to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) should be considered for inclusion in the Nafta treaty. Among the Latin American countries which have approached the US about possible membership in an expanded Nafta are Chile and Colombia. Earlier this week, Mr Guillermo Ford, Panama's vice president, said in Miami that Panama was also interested in a future that might include Nafta. He said he had discussed Panama and Nafta with the Canadian ambassador. The US has told Latin American countries they would have to wait until the Nafta treaty is nearer completion to find out what arrangements might be made for their accession. At the same time, the US has told both Mexico and Canada that signing Nafta would not preclude the US from concluding other free trade agreements in the hemisphere. The issue of widening Nafta is seen as politically problematical by the US. A Nafta accession clause which allowed expansion of the bloc without explicit Congressional approval is anathema to the Bush administration, which is already facing criticism from some legislators and labour unions for seeking to add Mexico to the existing US trade pact with Canada. One way to accommodate the accession clause proposal while meeting US political concerns might be to adopt a modified version of the procedure used in admitting new members to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), according to a study by the Institute for International Economics. Membership of Gatt requires countries to demonstrate they can fulfil obligations set out in the Gatt. Prospective members are also required to negotiate an accession protocol. Individual members of Gatt are allowed unilaterally to invoke a non-application clause which allows the member to deny the benefits of Gatt to the new member. The US would be free to give Congress the right to invoke the non-application clause.</p>

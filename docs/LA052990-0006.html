			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE BLOCKADES  </P> <P> Your story misleads the reader into believing that our nation's highest court  is an unequivocating bastion of support for a woman's right to an abortion.  Recent rulings and remarks by the court show this to be false.  </P> <P> As the article stated, the court case that the Supreme Court let stand, Randall  Terry vs. New York State, was based on the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which  forbids depriving any person from exercising a constitutional right. Thus in  letting the lower court's ruling stand, the Supreme Court is merely stating  that this was not an appropriate opportunity to challenge Roe vs. Wade and  issue a definitive ruling on whether women have a constitutional right to an  abortion. However, such an opportunity will inevitably come, and only then will  the court's true stand on abortion be revealed.  </P> <P> JOHN HOXIE  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

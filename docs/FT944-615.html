			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Terminating a Tessa - Briefcase My wife and I have each substantial investments in self-select personal equity plans and Tessas. Our wills provide for leaving our possessions to each other. As far as our investments in Peps are concerned, which of the following options are open to our executors: 1. To terminate the respective Pep, sell the investments and transfer the proceeds to the beneficiary? 2. To terminate the Pep, not sell the underlying shareholdings but merely transfer them to the beneficiary? 3. Not to terminate the Pep or the investments but to transfer the Pep (plus underlying investments) to the Pep of the survivor, where the investments will continue on a tax-free basis? With Tessas, will these have to be terminated? And will the interest credited up to the date of death be paid gross without deduction of tax, even though the stipulated period of five years from the start of the Tessa was not completed at the time of death? The tax-exempt status of a Pep will terminate automatically on the death of the plan-holder so the third option is not available to you. In theory, options 1 and 2 both are possible, although it should be noted that the transfer of investments or cash will be made by the plan manager to the personal representatives of the deceased. Many plans, however, operate on the basis that the underlying investments will be sold automatically on death, so it is important to check the position with the particular plan manager concerned. Tessas also terminate automatically on death and the proceeds are paid gross by virtue of S326A(2) ICTA 1988, providing all other conditions have been met. (Reply by Andrew White).

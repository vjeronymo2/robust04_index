			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sun Shangwu: "Rural Firms Get OK to </F> Sharehold Enterprises"]    [Text] The central government is drafting a law on how  workers can buy shares in their local enterprises.    The employee-share system has already been widely adopted in  thousands of rural enterprises, but a central law could help  avoid disorder and chaos, and prevent the whole process from  being too haphazard process, said the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economic System (SCRES).    Rural governments used to support collective enteprises by  raising funds from local people and workers.    The new co-operative system allows workers to buy shares in  their local collectives and get paid according to their work and  the number of shares they own.    The shares will not be sold on the open market, only to  workers and locals.    Agriculture Ministry statistics show more than 2 million, or  10 percnt, of rural enterprises were turned into co-operatives  by December.    And another 60 million rural firms, mostly in the coastal  provinces, are in the process of introducing the reform. The  system has even caught on in the less-developed provinces.    Twenty percent of the State firms have adopted it, a SCRES  official said.    He described this new system, which differs from the  traditional and the standard shareholding systems, as a "new  type of relations of production."    Some economists argue that the new national system should  bar  shareholders from withdrawing or transferring their shares when  they leave the enterprises.    And they believe all shareholders should have equal  decision-  making power, regardless of how many shares they hold.    However, the worker-shareholders should be paid according  both to their work performance and the numbers of their shares.    But the SCRES official admitted that many rural enterprises  switching to shareholding co-ops did not follow this principle.    Most have adapted the system to their local conditions.    Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu and Sichuan have  produced their own laws guiding the switch to shareholding  co-ops, he said.    And five other provinces and cities are now mapping out  their  own rules.    The official said that the SCRES is one of several  ministries  responsible for drafting this law.    The commission this year will investigate these provincial  laws and listen to the opinions of experts, provincial leaders  and entrepreneurs.</p>

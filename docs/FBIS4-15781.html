			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shamiram Agabekyan: "Armenia on the Threshold of </F> Voucherization. Prime Minister Bagratyan Predicts Our Fate"]    [Text] As has already been reported, participating in the  discussions in the office of the Ramkavar-Azatakan of Armenia  Party were not only representatives of sociopolitical  organizations, members of parliament, and specialists, but also  Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Grant Bagratyan.    As for the political forces represented in the discussion,  all of them were, to put it mildly, extremely skeptical both of  the reforms and of their authors and supporters. This is  apparently why the discussion amounted to only conceptual  criticism. Thus in the view of the Agrarian-Democratic Party,  the economic transformations are lacking an ideological concept,  they do not have a social base, and the do not go beyond solving  purely technical problems (Mels Mkrtchyan). And the  Constitutional Law Union thinks that the theory of Jeffrey  Sachs, a professor at Harvard University in the United States,  is being deliberately transplanted to Armenian soil. But our  shock therapy is also being carried out with local  peculiarities: Instead of obedience to the law on property, we  have a proliferation of clans usurping spheres of the economy.  Instead of the idea of forming a national bourgeoisie  proclaimed by the government, we have primitive polarization of  society.    In the view of the representative of the Ramkavar-Azatakan  of  Armenia Party, Gagik Galstyan, it is wrong to speak of the  establishment of a market economy in Armenia because a  transition to private property does not mean the establishment  of the market. Different principles are required: In particular,  competition and the corresponding pricing system, which we do  not have, but still there has been a dispersion of resources,  leakage of capital and cadres...    Leonid Akonyan, representative of the Communist Party of  Armenia, thought that for some reason the organizers and  implementers of the reform equate destatization with  privatization, while reforming the economy of the former GDR in  Germany lasted for 10 years, and hundreds of billions of marks  were allotted for these purposes. Such speedy and random  privatization, in L. Akonyan's view, is merely a repetition of  [word illegible] experience of voucher reforms, and that is all.    While advising acceleration of privatization as a whole,  quite a few critical remarks were directed against the  government by a member of the Union of Merchants, Manuk  Gasparyan. I think there will be an opportunity to return to  his speech in one of the next few issues of GOLOS ARMENII, but  now I shall discuss the speech of Prime Minister of the Republic  of Armenia Grant Bagratyan--helmsman of the Armenian version of  the reforms and a passionate champion of them.    Grant Bagratyan, while recognizing that dozens of mistakes  have been made during the process of reforming the economy,  still sees the overall trend as positive. The prime minister  did not deny the possibility of mistakes in the future because  this is not a repeated process but one-time actions, and actions  that affect the interests of the socium, which break down its  customary way of life. The government perceives this as a  natural pattern.    Whether slowly or quickly, privatization will take  place--the  government sees as its main task making sure that this process  is controllable. For a random and uncontrolled outcome caused  by too much haste specifically in industry will lead to the  appearance of a mass deprivatization war. With such a turn of  events not only Armenia but any other state would fail to hold  up on the financial or social, or moral, or political plane.    Incidentally, this could be avoided if the labor collectives  were certain that the changes that were made corresponded  completely to the spirit and letter of the law. Well, what  about the law itself? In Bagratyan's view, the legal vacuum is  broad. To this day we have not defined what property is and  what property is considered to be. To this day we have no law on  citizenship, on deposits, on bankruptcy, we have not determined  the status of public and private joint-stock companies, we have  not decided the fate of productions operating at a loss....  With the reality being like this, property will be distributed  and rights will be granted without determining responsibilities.    As the prime minister stated, privatization is not an end in  itself but the creation of a field for effective activity. And  the elimination of state property is the only means. As  corroboration for what he said he gave this example: When the  government was analyzing budget incomes and expenditures it  became clear that each year 1,700,000 tonnes of garbage are  taken from the capital alone. And only 10 percent of the cost is  paid from local funds and the rest comes from the budget. But  this quantity of garbage does not physically exist.    The prime minister was referring to the fact that the  parliament absolutely does not take into account these  government services-- maneuvering and balancing with state  property under conditions of free prices. So during the  discussion of the budget, with whose professional level Grant  Bagratyan was extremely dissatisfied, they did not even raise  the question of how, for example, the construction of a building  is financed or how the cost of the shipment of that same garbage  is determined...    As the prime minister said, when creating a state it is  necessary on the move to turn over the layers of a whole epoch.  A pedantic, bureaucratized government could reject the process  of privatization altogether, claiming, if nothing else, that it  does not know to whom it should distribute the certificates.  Incidentally, there are many "buts" of this kind.    Even with successful privatization of 80 percent of the  enterprises, the distribution of the limited centralized  resources will be extremely problematic because of the lack of a  mechanism for this. Take just electric energy and water... On  the one hand it is necessary to proceed from the effectiveness  of the output. But we must not cast privatized enterprises to  the caprice of fate. Just because, say, Armelektromash is  privatized this does not mean that its problems are  automatically solved, and at least the supply of metal must be  regulated at the state level, that is, through the efforts of  the government.    With all this, measures are also being taken to render  assistance to privatized enterprises. Thus a club of  entrepreneurs is being created and it will have the opportunity  to meet regularly with the government in order to solve problems  jointly.    Grant Bagratyan included purely organizational problems in  another group of measures. Within two or three weeks the  republic will receive all kinds of vouchers. At the same time  the tax and customs services are being technically re-equipped,  which, in particular, will help to avoid negative occurrences in  the customs system. It will also be necessary to revise the  structure for administration of the economy.    In general and on the whole the prime minister considers it  realistic to begin the privatization of small facilities in May  and enterprises in June, and also to complete some of the unpaid  privatization by the beginning of September.    The prime minister did not deny that there have been and  will  continue to be omissions here because it is not at all easy to  draw up a list of 15,000 facilities... But he assures us that  the plan that has been chosen, the alternatives, and also the  laws that have been adopted will create better conditions in  Armenia than are found in Russia. In April of last year the  "Armenian" version was discussed in the Hague with the  participation of the World Bank, and it gained approval. This  has to do with privatization of enterprises under the conditions  of the notorious 20 percent. This has to do also with the fact  that the "Armenian" version to a certain degree precludes the  sad Russian experience when, for example, the president of a  joint-stock company, deciding to earn $2 million, sends the  company's funds abroad.    The unpreparedness of the corps of directors causes the  prime  minister to have misgivings. Nor do we have the corresponding  socium, which would bring pressure to bear on the leaders of the  joint-stock companies, forcing them to function effectively. In  the prime minister's view, no ideology, even the very best, can  provide for development of minds--this takes time. And he is  afraid that this time will also provide more occasion for  criticism, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be  political blackmail of the government as well.    But Grant Bagratyan, following Chubays' example, intends to  say nothing since he is confident that he is carrying out a  mission of historic significance and he must not stray from the  path, for under conditions of free prices the state sector of  the economy can be controlled only by political methods which,  as he stated, will be manifested in one way or another.    And difficulties are inevitable when establishing a market:  Some enterprises will stay afloat and others will not. Even  today it is possible to tell which productions and organizations  will "stay afloat" and which will not, because from many signs  it is already obvious who has behaved how under the conditions  of free prices and the transition to the market. The Institute  of Physics provides an extremely clear example. Having found a  practical application for its accelerator, the institute  received an order for $2 million. Other institutes have shown  that they have been marking time all these years and merely  reproducing outdated developments. Of course they are doomed.    There is the fear that everything will be attributed to  privatization. Moreover, against this background it is possible  that there will be a large wave of antiprivatization, for  everything that today is concealed from people's eyes by the  so-called state status will come to the surface. Then it will  be possible to see who is good and who is bad, who is able to  work and who is not, who is stealing, who is trading, and who is  speculating.    There is also the danger of the appearance of the so-called  "Vietnam syndrome." After the end of a military confrontation  several tens of thousands of people may make claims against the  society: We were in the trenches and you were dividing up the  property. We must keep an eye out for a solution to this  problem as well. And not only on the ideological but also on  the material plane. In any case the property owner must be  prepared for a year or two or more to compensate, to pay for the  costs of those who are in the mountains today, who have been  wounded, who have become disabled...    The problem of the diaspora is not the least of the prime  minister's concerns. It should not have its property rights  encroached upon, and division into "akhtsarov" and natives must  not be allowed. But the diaspora will have to make its way  through moral and psychological discrimination and overcome a  multitude of other obstacles.    In other words society is faced with a harsh but necessary  transformation through which it must pass. And the more  quickly--the less painfully. This is why with the distribution  of vouchers the government will insist parliament allow them to  be bought and sold, for from now on it will be simply dangerous  to adopt half-way decisions.    Incidentally, with the establishment of the market, in the  view of the prime minister, political passions will abate. And  civil accord will be established because the new economic force  will require stability, laws, and concrete actions.    Privatization will also have a favorable effect on the  formation of the financial market and the stabilization of the  exchange rate of the dram because a new, convertible commodity  will be put into circulation: the property of productions--be it  territory, machine tools, equipment...    Being in the best initial positions for privatization and  having the best production potential, the republic, in  Bagratyan's view, will soon establish itself in the region as  completely successful. But under the condition that the natural  course of economic transformations will not be hampered by  powerful artificial factors in the form of escalation of the  confrontation with Azerbaijan, etc.    ...Oh, those buts! Were it not for all of them, and  not only in the form of external factors, the future would look  bright ahead, would it not? Alas, against the background of the  current reality it is possible at least to say: Oh, it is hard  to believe!...</p>

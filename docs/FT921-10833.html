			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / GrandMet charity to take over Fullemploy GRAND Metropolitan Community Services, the training arm of the food and drinks group, yesterday agreed in principle to take over the operations of Fullemploy, the voluntary training organisation which caters mainly for ethnic minorities and which went into liquidation last month. Mr Geoffrey Bush, GMCS director, said: 'Subject to contract, we are going to be able to continue Fullemploy's operations as previously. We hope to keep all their centres running, either separately or linked to our own.' Mr Aftab Pirbhai, financial director of Fullemploy, said the advantage in the move was that both organisations had charitable status. The takeover, due to be formally announced tomorrow, will secure the future of Fullemploy's operations after months of uncertainty caused by a funding crisis. GMCS is a charity which is backed by GrandMet and has a budget of about Pounds 3m a year. Training experts say it has a sound track record in the field. Recently GMCS took over South East Training, a small, London-based organisation, which would otherwise have had to cut its places on offer. Britain is receiving Pounds 38.7m as part of a European Community initiative to boost job prospects. The money will be used to promote job skills connected with the single market, the support of equal opportunities for women in employment and vocational training, and improved work opportunities for the mentally and physically disabled.</p>

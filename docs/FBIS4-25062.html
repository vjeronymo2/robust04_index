			<p>BFN     [Text] Our province will carry out comprehensive supporting  reform of the regional labor system in an all-around manner.  This was proposed at the provincial conference on reform of the  labor system held in Anshan on 18 May.    The provincial labor department proposed: This year we  should regard reform of the labor employment system as the  breakthrough point, carry out comprehensive supporting reform of  the regional labor system in an all-around manner, accelerate  the pace of implementing the all-member labor contract system;  and make reform serve the whole region, enterprises of various  ownerships, and all staff members and workers. Meanwhile, it is  necessary to take active but prudent steps to make arrangements  for enterprise surplus workers, help unemployed and job-seekers  find jobs again, and implement the integrated social security  system in all places. Through regional supporting reform, we  should gradually establish an enterprise internal wages  distribution method that meets the needs of the market economy,  and implement the wage system under which the wage standards are  determined by the markets and enterprises are allowed to  distribute wages independently while taking supervision,  regulation, and control from the government, break the ownership  and regional limits, and promote the formation of regional labor  markets.</p>

This is how  U.S. President Bill Clinton explained the situation in his State  of the Union address. What is now required is simply the  implementation of the steps that have been initiated. He  mentioned numerous successes -- NAFTA, the gun law, or the U.S.  economy -- which have had a positive impact on the entire world  economy and triggered a recovery.    Fortunately, Clinton's overestimation of his abilities did  not extend to foreign policy. Russia's reforms must be  supported, said the one who had pledged to focus on domestic  issues. Thus, Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia -- in fact he had to  deal with these crises in one or another unfortunate way -- were  hardly worth mentioning. As far as Korea is concerned, keeping  silent was the best solution.    As a matter of fact, the United States will probably supply  12 Patriot-type antimissile batteries to South Korea because  North Korea possesses -- yes, you guessed it -- Scud missiles.  Are the two Koreas really on the brink of war? Will the North  Koreans storm south through their tunnels, like the Iraqi  soldiers when they attacked Kuwait City?    There is no danger at all. The reason is the conflict with  Pyongyang over control of the nuclear facilities. In a constant  quarrel, the North Koreans refuse to show their cards and allow  inspectors to check whether they are producing nuclear weapons  or not. They are not, the CIA announced recently. Probably  not, stated South Korea's president recently, but control is  necessary. There is no doubt about that.    Clinton even threatened the old man Kim Il-Song with "a  military solution" unless he gives in. However, if Patriot  missiles -- which South Korea apparently does not want in the  middle of negotiations because it fears that the North might  feel provoked -- are Clinton's last resort, and there will be  another foreign policy masterpiece that should not be mentioned  during a State of the Union address.</p>

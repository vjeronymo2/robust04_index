			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Just abortion in disguise Your leader 'Controlling population' (August 18), emphasising the empowerment of women and putting into context the effects of population growth, was most welcome and would be gladly endorsed by the Catholic church. However, your claim that the Vatican has been encouraging nations to boycott the UN Cairo conference on population is surprising. The Vatican itself will attend the conference in its UN observer status, and indeed has been denounced by some for lobbying national governments to improve the text of the draft programme of action. A consensus was reached 10 years ago that abortion should not be admitted as a way of population control. This does not bar attempts to reverse that consensus, and the US government, for instance, has relaxed its previous criteria for aid allocation. The Cairo draft programme has also introduced the new concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health, which reintroduce abortion into family planning under the guise of health programmes. The Vatican, and others, have reason to stand by the previous consensus and resist the new changes suggested.

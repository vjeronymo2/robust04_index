			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Nissan accused over fraud A SENIOR executive from Nissan Motor Corporation, the Japanese car maker, made the business introduction for the setting up of a Swiss bank account which the Inland Revenue claims was part of a Pounds 97m corporation tax fraud, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr Friedrich Pannosch, an Austrian rail consultant, was giving evidence in the trial of Mr Michael Hunt, the Nissan UK director accused of taking part in the fraud. The prosecution claims that directors of Nissan UK, the British importer of Nissan cars, and others, inflated freight charges to avoid tax and laundered money through shipping agents into Swiss bank accounts. Mr Pannosch is accused of involvement in the conspiracy but he has not been charged. Mr Pannosch, a prosecution witness, said he was introduced to Mr Tore Thorsen, a Norwegian shipping agent, who is one of the other alleged conspirators, by a Mr Yoshiro Saegusa, a senior executive with Nissan Japan. Mr Pannosch told Mr Michael Sherrard QC, counsel for Mr Hunt, that Mr Saegusa had said Mr Thorsen was helping Nissan Japan with transport problems. The Norwegian asked him to open an account in his own name because the transactions could not be made directly and needed an intermediary. About USDollars 200 passed through the account, the court heard. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The sharp setback in European bond markets on renewed fears on US inflation hit the derivatives sector, sending stock index futures falling heavily, writes Joel Kibazo. On its first full day as the market leader, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,985, and after a brief rise to 2,989 in the first few minutes of the session, the direction was downwards for most of the day. The prospect of higher interest rates to counter US inflation triggered a sell-off in bond markets which in turn affected sentiment in futures. Independent, or local, traders were said to have led the downward movement, with the large institutions reported to have been unwilling to take part in market activity for a large part of the day. The low was reached at 1.30pm when September fell to 2,937.6, showing a 12-point discount to cash. The steadying in bonds brought a sharp rally to the contract but renewed selling at the close curtailed a further advance. The contract ended trading at 2,973, at parity with the cash market, in heavy volume of 20,768 lots. The strong activity in the derivatives sector brought turnover of 43,379 lots to the traded options. Some 26,001 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and the Euro FT-SE had 8,471 lots dealt. Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,239 contracts.</p>

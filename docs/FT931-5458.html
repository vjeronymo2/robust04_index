			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: BCE sells 4.5% stake in TCPL BCE has sold its remaining 4.5 per cent interest in TransCanada PipeLines, the national natural gas pipeline operator, for CDollars 18 a share or nearly CDollars 150m (USDollars 120m). The stock was acquired by investment dealers BBN James Capel and Gordon, and distributed immediately to institutions and the general public. TCPL, which has a heavy expansion programme to meet rising gas demand in Canada and the US, is expected to buy Pacific Gas Transmission, a San Francisco pipeline company. This would make it North America's third biggest gas transmission group with 40 per cent of its assets in the US. BCE, Canada's biggest telecoms group, bought almost 49 per cent of the TCPL in the 1980s. It sold half the holding in 1990 as it returned to its core telecom businesses.</p>

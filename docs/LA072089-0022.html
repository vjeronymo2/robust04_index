			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICY ON DRUGS, ALCOHOL OKD  </P> <P> The Avalon City Council passed a resolution on drug and alcohol policy Tuesday  by a 4-1 vote. Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith was absent.  </P> <P> The policy, approved by city employee groups and city officials before the  meeting, prohibits the sale or use of drugs and alcohol on city property. It  also requires drug testing of prospective employees. Employees who are involved  in an accident or are suspected of abusing drugs also would be asked to take  the test. Those who refuse would be ineligible for drug rehabilitation benefits  and could face suspension.  </P> <P> City Manager Chuck Prince said the policy was required by the federal Drug Free  Workplace Act of 1988, which mandates the development of drug and alcohol  policies by local agencies receiving federal funds.  </P></p>

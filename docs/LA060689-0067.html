			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PONTIFF DEPLORES REPRESSION OF RELIGION IN SOVIET BLOC  </P> <P> Gazing east from Finland across Europe's ideological frontier, Pope John Paul  II on Monday lamented government repression of religious liberties in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union as impediments to regional peace and development.  </P> <P> The visiting pontiff chose the conference hall where the Helsinki accords with  their human rights provisions were signed in 1975 for his policy address  arguing that a shared Christian heritage should be a powerful catalyst for  unity throughout Europe.  </P> <P> "Religious freedom can exist in various social systems. What the churches ask  for is that religious life should not be denied the freedom it needs," John  Paul stated in an English language address to a blue-ribbon audience of  government officials, diplomats, intellectuals, scientists and businessmen.  </P> <P> The Helsinki accords -- signed by 32 European nations including the Soviet  Union as well as the United States, Canada and the Vatican -- established  principles for peaceful cooperation, including promises to guarantee freedom of  thought and religion, the Pope noted.  </P> <P> "European nations have become more and more aware that the honest confrontation  of ideas and convictions has been an indispensable condition for their overall  development," the pontiff asserted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Regrettable' Cases of Denial  </P> <P> John Paul, however, deplored "the gap between the stated principles and the  grave hindrances faced by some communities of believers in Europe." He noted  that he had in the past denounced "regrettable cases of the total denial of  religious freedom to communities of Eastern Rite Catholics, which lost even the  right to exist within the new postwar political and juridical structures."  </P> <P> The Pope's reference was to the Soviet Ukraine, where an estimated 2 million  underground Catholics in communion with Rome practice a faith that has been  officially proscribed since Josef Stalin's day.  </P> <P> Repeated Ukrainian requests to the Soviet government for legalization of the  church as part of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of reform, known as  perestroika, have been thus far unavailing. The Ukraine is certain to be a key  point of friction during Gorbachev's expected meeting with John Paul at the  Vatican later this year.  </P> <P> Asked by reporters here Monday about a possible papal visit to Moscow, Vatican  Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli replied, "Clearly the possibility  exists, but I personally don't think it will come any time soon."  </P> <P> John Paul, the most traveled Pope in history, has said he would like to visit  the Soviet Union but at the same time has made clear he would not go without  being able to visit Ukrainian Catholics, whom the government regards as part of  the officially sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Serious Difficulties'  </P> <P> Expressing satisfaction at the expansion of religious liberties in Central and  Eastern Europe since the Helsinki agreement, John Paul noted that "serious  difficulties" still exist in some countries.  </P> <P> "I am thinking especially of those Catholic communities forced to live in  underground existence; of young people discriminated against in their studies  or careers because of their religious beliefs, and of dioceses deprived of  their bishops," John Paul said.  </P> <P> The Czechoslovak government, in particular, has been slow to allow replacement  for aging bishops, and Catholics are sometimes stigmatized in other officially  atheist societies of Eastern European. Under John Paul, the Vatican has  patiently built bridges to the East Bloc, particularly to Hungary, which the  Pope will visit in 1991, and Poland, where the church is the principal bulwark  of the Solidarity union.  </P> <P> John Paul's keynote address came on the fifth day of his Nordic tour after a  Mass in which small delegations from the neighboring Soviet republic of Estonia  were sprinkled among worshipers from Finland's 4,200-member community of  Catholics.  </P> <P> "The idea that religion is a form of alienation is no longer fashionable,  because, fortunately, the leaders of the (European) nations and people  themselves have come to realize that believers constitute a powerful factor in  favor of the common good," John Paul told the audience.  </P> <P> Religious freedom is consistently near the top of the 69-year-old, Polish-born  Pope's agenda. With it, on a visit to rich and nominally Lutheran but staunchly  secular Nordic countries, have come repeated papal calls for stronger Christian  ecumenism, better environmental protection and injunctions against  spirit-sapping materialism.  </P> <P> "Religious life is not threatened merely by vexing restrictions," John Paul  warned Monday. "It can also be threatened by the spread of false values -- such  as hedonism, power-seeking, greed -- which are making headway in various  countries and which in practice stifle the spiritual aspirations of large  numbers of people."  </P> <P> The Pope, who came to Finland on Sunday after stops in Norway and Iceland,  continues his Nordic pilgrimage today in Denmark. He returns to Rome on  Saturday after a final stop in Sweden.  </P></p>

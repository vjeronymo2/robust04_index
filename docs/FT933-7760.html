			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Pricing of Denmark's Dollars 1bn FRN deal creates confusion THE PRICING of the Kingdom of Denmark's Dollars 1bn offering of floating-rate notes (FRNs) prompted some confusion in the international bond market yesterday. According to the terms of the four-year deal, arranged by Lehman Brothers, Denmark appeared to be paying an all-in cost of nine basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). This initially baffled syndicate managers at the other banks which had been invited to bid for the mandate, since they had shown much more aggressive pricing proposals to the borrower. Denmark's National Bank said that Lehman Brothers had attached a 'structure' to the deal which enabled the Kingdom to come away with an all-in cost of more than 10 basis points below Libor. However, it to give further details. Lehman Brothers also declined to comment on what happened behind the scenes. It said the issue had received a good reception in eastern Asia and in Europe, partly because the pricing was not as tight as the market had expected. The fact that there was no call option on the issue made the notes attractive to investors who believe US interest rates will start climbing again before the notes mature, Lehman said. The notes, which carry a coupon of  1/8 of a basis point below Libor, were re-offered at their issue price of par. They are expected to be freed to trade today. The Eurodollar sector was tapped late in the day by Exxon Capital Corp, the financing arm of the US oil giant, which raised Dollars 250m through an offering of 15-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 1/8 per cent, were priced to yield 37 basis points over the 5 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2003. Philips Electronics NV also raised dollars but launched its Dollars 500m offering in the 'Yankee' market - the US domestic market for foreign borrowers. Lead-manager Goldman Sachs said that the triple-B credit rating of the Dutch company had not yet recovered sufficiently to enable it to tap the international bond market. However, the deeper US domestic market was able to accommodate borrowers with weaker credits, the firm said. The offering from the Dutch company was divided into two tranches of Dollars 250m, one with a maturity of 10 years and the other with a life of 20 years. The bonds due in 2003 were priced to yield 110 basis points over 10-year US Treasuries while the bonds due in 2013 were priced at a yield spread of 105 basis points over the 30-year US Treasury, which is traditionally used to determine the pricing for long-dated bonds. Elsewhere, Rabobank Nederland, the triple A-rated Dutch bank, raised L200bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. A syndicate manager involved in the deal said that the borrower had swapped the proceeds of the issue into floating-rate dollars, achieving a borrowing cost of 25 basis points below Libor. The bonds, which have a coupon of 9 per cent, were re-offered at 100.25 and they were quoted at 100.30 bid when freed to trade. Dixons Group, the UK electrical retailer, has signed a Pounds 225m revolving credit facility with a number of international banks. The facility, arranged by NatWest Capital Markets, includes about Pounds 140m which has a three-year maturity.</p>

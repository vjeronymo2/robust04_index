			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE ASSAILS TOTALITARIANISM, INTOLERANCE;  </P> <P> RELIGION: JOHN PAUL, IN WORLD DAY OF PEACE MESSAGE, ALSO CALLS FUNDAMENTALISM A  THREAT TO PEACE.  </P> <P> Proclaiming freedom of conscience as mankind's "inalienable right," Pope John  Paul II on Tuesday scored totalitarianism and intolerance and called religious  fundamentalism a threat to world peace.  </P> <P> The 70-year-old pontiff returned to the theme of human rights for the third  consecutive year in his message for the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of  Peace on Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Entitled "If You Want Peace, Respect the Conscience of Every Person," the  6,000-word message urges world governments to respect the rights of minorities  and to allow individuals to freely pursue their own beliefs.  </P> <P> "People must not attempt to impose their own 'truth' on others," the Pope said.  "The right to profess the truth must always be upheld, but not in a way that  involves contempt for those who may think differently. Truth imposes itself  solely by the force of its own truth.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately," John Paul noted, "we are still witnessing attempts to impose a  particular idea on others, either directly -- by a proselytism which relies on  means which are truly coercive -- or indirectly, by the denial of certain civil  or political rights."  </P> <P> Published Tuesday at the Vatican in Italian, French, English, Spanish,  Portuguese, Polish and Arabic, the papal appeal will be distributed to  governments around the world and read out in Catholic churches on New Year's  Day.  </P> <P> John Paul defended "the inalienable right to follow one's conscience and to  profess and practice one's own faith," warning that those who violate such a  fundamental human right risk causing "strained and hostile relations within  society or even . . . open conflict."  </P> <P> "A serious threat to peace is imposed by intolerance, which manifests itself in  the denial of freedom of conscience to others. The excesses to which  intolerance can lead us has been one of history's most painful lessons."  </P> <P> Without naming them specifically, the Pope attacked governments and societies  that ban religious practices -- a reference to totalitarian Marxist states --  and those that impose a single religion -- a reference to countries in which  Muslim fundamentalism is the ruling force.  </P> <P> When religious law becomes synonymous for civil law, the Pope warned, it "can  stifle religious freedom, even going so far as to restrict or deny other  inalienable human rights."  </P> <P> "Intolerance can also result from the recurring temptation to fundamentalism,  which easily leads to serious abuses, such as the radical suppression of all  public manifestations of diversity, or even the outright denial of freedom of  expression," John Paul said.  </P> <P> Calling religion "a powerful force for liberation," he warned that attempts to  suppress it risk "fueling open or latent rebellion."  </P> <P> He insisted that individuals must have the right to choose their own religion.  Citing excesses in the history of his own church, he asserted that "no one  ought to be compelled to believe" and noted that "even today much remains to be  done to overcome religious intolerance which in different parts of the world is  connected with the oppression of minorities."  </P> <P> Peace-threatening intolerance is born, John Paul said, when individuals or  minorities "are oppressed or relegated to the margins of society. In public  life, intolerance leaves no room for a plurality of political or social  options, and thus imposes a monolithic vision of civil and cultural life."  </P></p>

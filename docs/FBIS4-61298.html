			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kiev, 4 May -- "The election of a new parliament  marked the end of a period of political indecision in Ukraine,"  said Alain Lamassoure, the French minister delegate for European  affairs, at a news conference concluding an official visit to  Ukraine by a French delegation. France is interested in  expanding cooperation with the independent Ukrainian state, he  said. To assist this, agreements have been signed in the course  of the visit on the encouragement and protection of investments,  on air transport, on cultural exchanges, and on youth and sport  cooperation and exchanges. [passage omitted] During their visit  to Ukraine, the French delegation discussed issues concerning  energy resources and nuclear power engineering. France has  proposed, Mr. Lamassoure noted, that issues regarding nuclear  power engineering in Ukraine be discussed at the forthcoming G-7  summit in Naples.    France is offering Ukraine help in preparing a project to  shut down all generating sets at the Chernobyl nuclear electric  power station and complete the construction of three generating  sets at other nuclear electric power stations to compensate for  power losses caused by the closure. "We do realize, however,  that the cost of these projects is very high and that only  international financial support will enable Ukraine to carry  them out," Mr. Lamassoure stressed. France is ready to promise  such support to Ukraine, he said.</p>

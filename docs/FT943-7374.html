			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Vodka author loses job A new book detailing the phenomenal marketing success of Absolut vodka has cost its author his job at a prestigious economics institute. The book, due to be published in October, is an expanded version of a research project which was commissioned by the drinks' company Vin and Sprit. The book is said to contain information the company considers confidential and it credits Absolut's huge popularity to advertising firms in the US, rather than to company officials in Sweden. After the author, Mr Carl Hamilton (left), insisted on publishing the study despite company protests, his funding was halted at Stockholm's Institute of International Business, and his research position was withdrawn. The institute said that Mr Hamilton's publication of the book had breached the school's standing guarantee of confidentiality in return for access.</p>

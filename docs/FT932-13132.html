			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: Sid continues to do as he was told - The Week Ahead HI THERE, Sid. Woken up? Retail demand for new issues is on the rise again, after last summer's collapse. This week the public element of bus operator Stagecoach's float was nearly eight times subscribed, and other recent issues did well. It has got to the point where one tabloid newspaper this week advised readers to apply for a particular flotation, saying the shares would rise sharply after the issue. Not an unreasonable tip - except that the particular issue has yet to be priced. As the banker involved said, he is hurt to be accused of mispricing an issue even before he has. Flotations abound as companies are rushing to market before the Government's Pounds 5bn sale of its British Telecom stake in the summer, in which Sid will also be expected to do his stuff. And on Wednesday Imperial Chemical Industries gave further details of the demerger of Zeneca, its bioscience business, which involves raising Pounds 1.3bn. Add those to all the rights issues that have been coming - the total for the year to date already exceeds that for the whole of 1992 - and what do you get? An awful lot of equity coming on the market. And it is widely forecast that the government will want to raise Pounds 50bn in gilt-edged stock in the current financial year. Last year's public sector borrowing requirement was revealed on Tuesday to have been a record Pounds 36.5bn. So what is wanted is some new source of demand. Now, the bulls of the stock market have been counting on overseas buyers to plug the gap. And there has certainly been some interest from them. But I am indebted to the most irrepressibly bullish of them all, Nick Knight, and his colleague Chris Dillow, at Nomura Research Institute, for identifying another source of demand. Not Sid so much as his high-net-worth-individual cousin. Let us call him Gerald. Between 1963 and the middle of 1991 there were only three quarters when individuals were net buyers of equities. (Which three? answers at the foot of this column.) But in the last six recorded quarters, they have been net buyers for no fewer than five. And in 1992, individuals like Gerald bought more UK shares than non-bank institutions did - for the first time in more than 30 years. Further evidence of Gerald's investment comes from the building societies. They have been complaining of a shortage of funds - and threatening a rise in mortgage rates. Their problem is not so much a lack of retail funds, but more a shortage of wholesale money. But included in wholesale money is deposits of more than Pounds 50,000 by individuals. In other words, Gerald as well as Sid has been taking his money out and putting it into shares. There is an obvious reason why. The yield he can get from equities, of around 4 per cent, is not far short of what the building society is paying. Indeed if he picks his shares he can get a higher income from equities and hope for a capital gain too. As the first chart shows, the real gap between the yield on the All-Share Index and money market interest rates is the lowest (least negative) it has been for donkey's years. And for good measure, the second chart shows the yield on the Footsie index falling below 4 per cent this week. For the first four days of the week the market was rising. A stream of good news meant that by Friday morning all the headlines were saying that the recession was over and recovery had started. The news included a second monthly fall in unemployment - quite a surprise given that new jobs are supposed to lag recovery. There are two explanations for this. Either it is a happy freak, and a happy coincidence for the Conservatives facing the Newbury by-election and the local government elections. The other - rather off-the-wall but distinctly cheerful idea - is that it is indeed a lagging indicator and shows that recovery began sometime last autumn. At any rate next Monday's output figures should mark the official end of the recession. Some of the other good news was: March car production in the UK was the highest for 19 years; there were cuts in interest rates in Germany and France; cheery surveys came from the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce; chirpy retail sales figures were published on Friday. But by Friday this was all too much for a market happier to travel hopefully than arrive. And the week ended with the Footsie at 2843.8, up 19.4 points over the week but down from Thursday's close of 2881.1. That leaves the Footsie roughly where it was when the year started, and since then forecasts of recovery and of interest rate falls are on balance more optimistic. What has perhaps been lacking this week has been more optimism from companies. On the plus side was Abbey National's annual meeting, where the chairman said mortgage enquiries were up and arrears down, and first quarter results from SmithKline Beecham, up 12 per cent pre-tax, and Zeneca, profits 'usefully' ahead in the first quarter, whatever that means. After weeks of underperformance for pharmaceutical stocks, when the ICI demerger was looking more and more foolish, there was a reversal this week. Zeneca may, after all, have timed its launch to perfection. But on the negative tack, dividends are still being cut or paid uncovered; CE Heath, the insurance broker, discovered a nasty loss in Australia; and Hammerson, the property company, produced results even worse than the nothing great that was expected. It may take more good news from the corporate sector, to add to the better economic news, to persuade equities to break upwards again. The three quarters were: the fourth quarter of 1974, the second quarter of 1975 and the third quarter of 1987. Gerald can buy at the bottom as well as the top.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Ki-pong] </F>   [Text] Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] leader Kim Chong-pil  said: "Kim Il-song who made 2.3 million compatriots fall victim  to his invasion 44 years ago still has the ambition to reunify  the country by armed force." He then stressed: "The object of  Kim Il-song's nuclear attack is South Korea where his fellow  countrymen live, not the United States or Japan." He is warning  against "war criminal" Kim Il-song every day. He said the above  in a training for members of the Yongwol-Pyongchang, Chongson,  and Taebaek district party chapters held at Yongwol County  Cultural Center on 24 June. During field education programs for  party members in Andong, North Kyongsang Province on 22 June and  at the Veterans Association office in Seoul on 21 June, Kim  warned: "We must not let down our guard against North Korea  since no one knows what Kim Il-song will do."    DLP leader Kim Chong-pil is the only person who strongly  denounces President Kim Il-song every day at a time when  people's expectation of the South-North summit is ever  increasing as the summit has been promoted.    There are different analyses of the reason why Kim is  frequently making remarks running counter to the trend of the  time.    Some people view that this is an expression of disputes  inside the ruling party over the party line. Some view that his  remarks represent conservatives stressing that one should not  meet face-to- face with Kim Il-song with such an idea as  expressed in President Kim Yong-sam's inauguration statement  noting "any allied country is not better than the nation."    Some view that criticism of Kim Il-song is a portion  allotted  to Kim Chong-pil.    Those close to Kim Chong-pil explained: "He is making such  remarks to warn the people against their conviction that the  South- North summit will immediately be followed by  reunification."    Many other people view that Kim's criticism of North Korea  and his alerting the people against it are linked with his  political position. That is, they think Kim is trying to take  this opportunity to secure his position as the leader of  conservatives.    Some people note that Kim's remark against Kim Tae-chung,  president of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, that "if there  is a person who stated that it does not matter if North Korea  possesses one or two nuclear weapons, he or she is not a person  living in this land" was aimed at driving the political  situation to a progressives-versus-conservatives structure.    People are interested in how far his moves will go after  breaking his silence while presenting himself as a "housewife"  since the inauguration of the civilian government.</p>

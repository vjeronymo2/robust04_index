Ms Li, who returned home last week, said she was "forcefully  detained" by Huangpu District Court officials after she was told  that the court had rejected a lawsuit filed by Fu.    "Please help us now. We, the family, can no longer protect  itself (against the Government)," she said.    "We are driven to the wall. There is no road to heaven and  no door into the earth," she pleaded.    The ordeal of Fu has caught the attention of the United  States Government which has warned that China might lose her low  tariffs trade status this June if it fails to make "significant  progress" on human rights.    Fu was sentenced without trial by Shanghai police last June  to three years "reeducation through labour" for instigating four  other Shanghai activists to start a hunger strike.    Fu has denied he was responsible for the hunger strike and  has filed a lawsuit against the labour reform authorities for  holding him illegally.    The court held its first hearing last November at the Dafeng  Farm in Yancheng District where Fu was held. Although Fu was  represented by two lawyers, he was not allowed to call witnesses.    When Fu's lawyers were notified on December 28 that a  verdict  had been reached, Ms Li went to the Huangpu District Court. She  was told that the judges had decided to uphold the original  sentence without giving reasons.    Ms Li was so upset she accused the judges of a "miscarriage  of justice" and acting "against their conscience". She was  manhandled and taken away by court officials who accused her of  "contempt of court" and "cursing the people's judges".    She was locked in the Huangpu District Detention Centre for  15 days with about 10 "criminals" in a small cell.</p>

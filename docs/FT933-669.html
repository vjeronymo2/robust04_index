			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Observer: On bended knee Successful overseas industrialists could be forgiven for asking why Britain tarried well into the final decade of the 20th century before setting up a Foundation for Manufacturing Industry (FMI). Observer merely wishes to point out that almost everything else has been tried to breathe life into the country's ailing widget-makers. The idea for the FMI, which dovetails neatly into the current Lord Mayor's City and Industry in Partnership campaign, in fact stemmed largely from Kenneth Adams, former Comino Fellow at the Royal Society of Arts. Three years ago Adams wrote about the 'nonsense' that Christians cheerfully pray for farmers at harvest festival but 'do not pray for successful production in manufacturing and extractive industry or for successful achievement in commerce'. His campaign to involve a higher being having yielded insufficient results, he was obviously forced to turn to the earthly powers of FMI's new chairman, Sir Trevor Holdsworth.</p>

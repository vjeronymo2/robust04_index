			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian parliament's Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin  group said it would vote against the draft budget for 1994,  "since it fails to meet our priorities in economic and social  policy."    Explaining the reasons for the decision in a statement  issued  on Sunday, the group says the budget would increase taxes,  contains no provision for measures to stop the decline of  production, for structural reforms, for support for private  business enterprise, for the reorganization of insolvent  enterprises, for any changes in industrial policy, for  demonopolization, for a better social policy, for any measures  to improve the situation in the armed forces, or for the  insufficient financing of public education and preschool health  care, but would increase administrative expenditure.    The economic policy guidelines that the draft budget lays  provide no basis for further reforms or for solving Russia's  acute problems, the group says. It says it is going to propose  that the government amend the budget within the next month and  put it before parliament every quarter to make it possible to  adjust it to new developments.</p>

Such an accord would give the mainly Moslem Bosnian  government "the chance to finally deal with only one enemy, the  Serbs," Vice President Ejup Ganic told reporters.    Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic was in Washington  Sunday for the second day of talks with Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic on the creation of a Moslem-Croat  federation in Croatia's war-torn neighbor, Bosnia-Herzegovina.  [passage omitted]    Ganic said Croatia, however, had yet to win the withdrawal  of  Serb troops from both Bosnia and Serbia, which have occupied a  third of its country since the war there ended shortly before  the Bosnian conflict began.    Pushing the Bosnian Croats to reach an agreement with the  Moslems would give Croatia "a chance to deal with the Krajina  (Serb-occupied Croatia) without any distractions," Ganic said.  [passage omitted]    Ganic said: ``When the Croats and Moslems have a federal  state with part occupied by the Serbs, then we can deal with  that. But the federal state comes first.    "Then as one country we will deal with the Serbs, one on  one."    He said that since there had been greater U.S. involvement  in  Bosnia on the Moslems side, the Serbs had turned to Moscow. The  Serbs, Ganic said, "are reveling in everything Russian. They  can have the Russians." [passage omitted]</p>

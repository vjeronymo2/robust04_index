			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Deficit increases as exports plummet THE UK TRADE deficit has deteriorated slowly since the beginning of the year, with the recession in continental Europe hitting exports hard. Figures from the Central Statistical Office - including figures for trade with the European Community - show that in the first seven months of the year the deficit on visible trade was Pounds 8.7bn. This compares with Pounds 7bn for the same period last year. The value of exports to the EC in July was Pounds 4.85bn, the lowest monthly figure for 18 months, and sharply lower than the June figure. Imports from the EC were Pounds 5.7bn in July, leaving a monthly deficit of Pounds 848m, the biggest EC trade gap for two years. The deficit on trade with countries outside the EC in July was Pounds 698m. The total deficit was Pounds 1.54bn, the largest total for seven months. The CSO stressed that the figures for EC trade were provisional and were likely to be revised as the new system for measuring intra-EC trade settled down. However, the provisional figures indicate that sterling's devaluation in September last year has not been sufficient to offset the depressing effects of recession in the EC - with which the UK does more than half of its external trade. Because of the poor performance in Europe, the value of total exports in the latest three months was 2 per cent lower than in the previous three months. Imports over the same period were little changed. Outside the EC, exports have been more successful. In July the UK exported Pounds 4.8bn of goods to non-EC countries, slightly less than in June, but well up on the beginning of the year. Trade flows measured by volume show the varying fortunes of EC and non-EC trade. In the three months to July, export volumes to the EC excluding oil and erratics were 2 per cent down on the previous three months. Underlying import volumes were up 1 per cent. Exports to non-EC countries, measured on the same basis, were up 2.5 per cent, compared with a 0.5 per cent rise in imports. The figures also showed exporters were raising their prices more rapidly than importers.</p>

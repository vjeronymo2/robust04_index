			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / NUT leadership calls for end to test boycott The leadership of the National Union of Teachers yesterday recommended that its members end their boycott of national curriculum tests after the government agreed to hold a wide-ranging consultation into the tests' educational value. The move, which may herald the end of two years' industrial action over the issue, follows a meeting last week between Mr Doug McAvoy, the union's general secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary. All three teachers' unions boycotted the tests when they were introduced to secondary schools in England and Wales last year. Two abandoned their boycott last year after concessions by Mr John Patten, then education secretary, but the NUT remained strongly opposed to them. Mr McAvoy said the union's position had been strengthened by last week's announcement that only 20 per cent of secondary schools reported the results of English tests for 14-year-olds this year. He said this showed the boycott was still strong. He described the agreement as a 'tremendous achievement' for the union's campaign. The deal would lead to a consultative exercise similar to the consultations carried out by Sir Ron Dearing during his two-year review of the national curriculum, he said. Mrs Shephard, who had already announced in September a Pounds 30m package of measures including external markers to placate teachers, suggested the consultation would be less ambitious. 'As in previous years,' she said, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron, would evaluate the tests. She said: 'I have taken a series of steps to respond to teachers' concerns about workload and to enhance teachers' professionalism. I am glad that the NUT executive has responded in a professional and considered way.' Mr McAvoy said Mrs Shephard's 'willingness to understand the professional and educational concerns of teachers' had made the announcement possible. The union will ballot its members on the proposal, and will lift the boycott if a majority are in favour. However, Mr McAvoy made clear the union would continue to support members who claim that the tests create an unreasonable workload. This is in line with the policy of the other teachers' unions. The NUT leadership continues to claim that the tests are 'educationally unsound', a view endorsed by 90 per cent of members who responded to a survey in October. Members telephoned the union yesterday afternoon to protest at the apparent deal.</p>

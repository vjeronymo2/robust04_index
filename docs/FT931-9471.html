			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Another big fall for sterling STERLING recovered sharply against both the D-Mark and dollar in European trading yesterday, after falling to a new historic low against the German currency in Asia the night before, writes James Blitz. In Tokyo, the pound fell to an all-time low against the D-Mark of DM2.3245. It also fell to a new low against the dollar this year of Dollars 1.4070. In London, the pound later opened at a new all-time low on the trade weighted index of 75.7. This meant that sterling was worth 75.7 per cent of its 1985 value against a broad basket of currencies. Once European trading was underway, the currency rebounded, possibly helped by a comment from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, that there was no scope for a further reduction in interest rates. There was also strong speculation in markets that the Bank of England was intervening in support of the currency. The pound peaked at DM2.3610 at lunchtime before closing at DM2.3575, half a pfennig up on the day. Against the dollar, it peaked at Dollars 1.4321, before closing at Dollars 1.4180, virtually unchanged on the day. Sterling's strong rebound in Europe suggested that the earlier selling had been speculative, rather than the product of quality selling. At these levels, institutional investors are probably very short of the currency, or wondering whether its effective floor against the D-Mark has finally been reached. But there were reasons to believe that the currency was not 'out of the woods' yet. One worrying factor for sterling holders was that further cuts in UK interest rates were still being discounted at the end of the day by money market dealers. Yesterday's UK inflation figures, which showed a dramatic fall on the month, may also raise speculation in the next few weeks that the UK authorities could afford to see a weaker pound. The yen had a much calmer day following the robust rally that has dominated the week. The rally has been caused by speculation that US and Japanese treasury officials would try and reach an accord for a stronger yen this weekend in order to reduce the Japanese trade surplus. Officials' comments were very ambivalent yesterday. The yen closed slightly weaker against both the D-Mark and dollar at Y72.65 and Y120.80 respectively. The US currency continued to trade within a range of DM1.6415 and DM1.6615 against the D-Mark. Dealers are also waiting to see what fiscal package President Clinton will announce on Tuesday. The dollar closed in London nearly  1/2 a pfennig higher on the day at DM1.6625.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC reviewed potential issues related to possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiological sabotage of storage casks at reactor site ISFSIs in the 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking that added Subparts K and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (55 FR 29181;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 18, 1990). NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 72 establish physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection and security requirements for an ISFSI located within the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled area of a licensed power reactor site. Spent fuel in the ISFSI is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(5) to be protected against the design basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat for radiological sabotage using provisions and requirements as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in 72.212(b)(5). Each utility licensed to have an ISFSI at its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor site is required to develop security plans and install a security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system that provides high assurance against unauthorized activities that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety. The security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems at an ISFSI and its associated reactor are similar in design features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure the detection and assessment of unauthorized activities. Alarm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annunciations at the ISFSI are monitored by the security alarm stations at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor site. Response to intrusion is required. Each ISFSI is periodically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspected by NRC and annually audited by the licensee to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security systems are operating within their design limits. The validity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the threat is continually reviewed, with a formal evaluation every six months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC is currently conducting a study into the consequences of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle bomb detonated in the vicinity of an ISFSI. Following completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this study the NRC will make a determination as to whether additional physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection is warranted. In the interim, the NRC staff believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent nature of the fuel, along with the degree of protection provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approved storage means for spent fuel, provides adequate protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against a vehicle bomb.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> N.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wanted the emergency plan updated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include initiating events caused by unnatural occurrences, such as sabotage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly for this fuel storage option. The commenter believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC should determine if upgraded or new security barriers are necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the David-Besse site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 10 CFR 72.212 requirements, each general licensee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must protect the spent fuel against the design basis threat of radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sabotage. Also, 10 CFR 72.212 requires each general licensee to review the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor emergency plan to determine whether its effectiveness is decreased,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and if so, to prepare the necessary changes and obtain the necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvals. Therefore, the comment is already essentially incorporated into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> O. Several commenters had fabrication, quality assurance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> O.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter raised questions about NRC oversight and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for proper cask fabrication by licensees. This is based on tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the faulty welds at the Palisades plant conducted in July 1994 just before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cask was filled, but the test was not reviewed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ultimate responsibility to ensure proper cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabrication belongs to the user of the cask. Each Part 50 licensee (general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee) must have its own quality assurance (QA) program in place to oversee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vendor activities. The QA requirements apply to design, purchase,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabrication, handling, inspection, testing, operation, maintenance, repair,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications of structures, systems and components, and decommissioning that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are important to safety. In addition, certified cask vendors have NRC-approved QA programs that control the implementation of these quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities in a manner appropriate to the safety significance of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. In turn, the general licensee reviews, approves, and oversees its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vendor's QA programs and activities. The NRC inspects both the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee and the subtiered vendors for compliance with the respective QA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirements and for the adequacy of the activities performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The faulty welds at Palisades in a loaded cask happened because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiographs were not read initially. If the radiographs were read in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner, the cask should not have been loaded without corrective action first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being taken. NRC oversight and involvement in the process contributed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely detection of the defective cask weld.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> O.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wants clarification of the quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance program. NRC should have a regulatory guide for vendors with strong  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for audits and subcontractors, and NRC inspection reports of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabricating facilities need to be put in the PDR. How will a subcontractor of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS vendor be checked by NRC in the future? If a vendor is going to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuously change subcontractors, the NRC should inspect each cask and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carefully inspect the vendor QA manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

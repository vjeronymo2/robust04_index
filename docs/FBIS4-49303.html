			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporters Xu Dongyang (1776 2639 3152) and He Shumei </F> (0149 3219 2734): "Accelerate Agricultural and Animal Husbandry  Development and Strive To Enter a New Stage"]    [Excerpts] The regional party committee and government  held a regional rural and pastoral work conference on 22 April,  and clearly proposed that the time for Inner Mongolia Region to  greatly develop agriculture and animal husbandry has arrived and  that this region has every condition and ability to develop  agriculture and animal husbandry in a quicker and better manner  and to enter a new height on the present basis. [passage  omitted]    Wang Qun and Wu Liji gave important speeches respectively.  Qian Fengyong, Bai Enpei, Yi Junhua, Song Zhimin, and Wu  Lunsai, and responsible comrades of various leagues, cities,  regional departments concerned, and the regional rural and  pastoral work leading group and units attended the conference.  Bai Enpei presided over the conference.    In his speech, Wang Qun pointed out: While fully  understanding the excellent situation, we should clearly  recognize that we should set demands on ourselves in line with  the high standards of modernizing agriculture and animal  husbandry and the market economy. At present, our region's  agricultural and animal husbandry production is still at a low  development stage. The party Central Committee has stressed  repeatedly that the issue on agriculture, animal husbandry,  rural areas, and peasants is always a fundamental issue  affecting the overall situation of our party and the state.  Judging from our Inner Mongolia Region's situation, without the  invigoration of agricultural and animal husbandry and the  development of the rural and pastoral areas, there can be no  economic invigoration and social development in Inner Mongolia,  no social stability in the rural and pastoral areas, and no long  period of order and security in the border areas. Therefore, we  should conscientiously study, profoundly understand, and  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the central rural  work conference, further understand the urgency of strengthening  agriculture, animal husbandry, as well as rural and pastoral  work from the overall situation of reform, development, and  stability, firmly establish the ideology of regarding  agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation, unswervingly  place agriculture and animal husbandry above all economic tasks  at any time and under any circumstance, and uphold it for a long  time with unremitting efforts.    Wang Qun said: The rural and pastoral works are numerous,  and  development is the essential criterion. Judging from the  overall situation of the region, the current agricultural and  animal husbandry development trend is good and the situation is  gratifying. The broad masses of peasants and herdsmen have  already seen the opportunity of having a good market for  agricultural and livestock products and good prices and the  local advantages and potential for developing agriculture and  animal husbandry. Therefore, their enthusiasm in planting grain  and raising livestock is unprecedentedly high and their desire  to accelerate development is very strong. In the face of this  situation, party leading cadres at all levels have the  responsibility of protecting, guiding, and giving play to the  enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; the responsibility of  judging the hour and sizing up the situation, organizing leading  peasants and herdsmen to advance on the crest of a victory,  developing our region's agriculture and animal husbandry in a  quicker and better manner, and entering a new stage on the  present basis. The general objective of this new stage is to  enable peasants to attain a better-off level of moderate  prosperity on schedule by the end of this century which was once  proposed by the regional party committee and the provincial  government, to enable herdsmen to take the lead in becoming  better-off, to basically realize the goal of developing  modernized agriculture and animal husbandry with high yield,  high quality, and high efficiency, to carry out all forms of  integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture, to  combine planting industry with breeding and processing  industries, and to turn the region into an important base and  market for brandname, quality, and special products, such as  grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar, meat, milk, eggs, leather and  fur products, fruits and medical herbs, in China's northern  region. In line with this general objective, our region's  agricultural and animal husbandry sectors must strengthen  scientific and technological progress, raise the quality of  personnel, strengthen the infrastructure facilities for  agriculture and animal husbandry, mechanize agricultural and  animal husbandry production, increase input, deepen reform, and  carry out large-scale production and intensive operations. This  year it is necessary to continuously increase the production of  grain and animal husbandry on the basis of last year's  production and strive to make the grain output reach 23 billion  jin; the number of livestock reach 57 million during the animal  husbandry fiscal year; the total revenue growth rate of township  enterprises reach more than 50 percent; and the net income of  peasants and herdsmen increase by 100 yuan after deducting the  factor of price hikes. According to this demand, the higher and  the lower levels across the region should adopt practical  measures, make specific targets, and strive to attain the  aforementioned objective.    After analyzing our region's possibility, necessity, and  favorable conditions for accelerating the development of our  region's agriculture and animal husbandry and entering a new  stage, Wang Qun stressed: Our proposal of accelerating the  development of agriculture and animal husbandry and entering a  new stage on the present basis is in conformity with the  guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee, the overall  situation of reform, development, and stability, and the common  interests and wish of the people of various nationalities across  the region. The regional party committee has called on the  broad masses of party-member members across the region,  particularly the party's leading cadres at all levels, to  further emancipate the mind, enhance understanding,  realistically unite their ideology with the policy decision of  the regional party committee, and guarantee the implementation  of this policy decision with practical and effective deeds.  Wang Qun pointed out: At present and for some time to come,  the principle of deepening reform in the rural and pastoral  areas is and will still be the four sentences proposed by the  eighth plenary session of the 13th party Central committee, that  is to stabilize and improve the responsibility system with the  family-based output-related contract system as the mainstay,  perfect the dual management system of centralized and  decentralized management, actively develop various forms of  socialized service system, and gradually expand the collective  economic strength. The major content of reform is to take  market cultivation as the mainstay, perfect the socialized  comprehensive service system, strengthen macro regulation and  control, and accelerate the establishment of economic  operational mechanism and management system that suit the  socialist market economic structure. First, we should further  improve the rural and pastoral management system; second,  organize and improve the township comprehensive service  organizations; third, actively develop "dragon-typed economy";  fourth, strengthen macro regulation and control as well as  protection in the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors; and  fifth, deepen reform in rural and pastoral areas and in banners,  counties, and organs, transfer personnel to all localities, and  combine these two tasks together.    Wang Qun stressed: The objective of accelerating  agricultural and animal husbandry development and entering a new  height has set a higher demand on the party committees and  governments at all levels, particularly the party's leading  cadres at all levels. We must pay more attention to agriculture  and animal husbandry and to the issues on peasants and herdsmen  than at any time in the past, adopt practical and effective  measures, and further strengthen and improve the party's  leadership over rural and pastoral work. Party committees at  all levels should realistically place rural and pastoral work  above all economic tasks and further strengthen leadership. In  the future, the work focus and main energy of the party  committees of various leagues, cities, banners, and counties  should be placed on agriculture, animal husbandry, and rural and  pastoral work. It is necessary to continuously attend to  building grass-roots organizations and ranks of cadres in the  rural and pastoral areas. All banners and counties should be  determined to select good quality cadres from all sectors and  send them to work in townships, towns, and sumu and install good  leading bodies in townships. We should realistically strengthen  spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system in the  rural and pastoral areas, and take a "two-handed approach in  work and be tough with both." Through effective work, we may  eliminate the destabilizing factors and create a good social  environment for reform and development in the rural and pastoral  areas. [passage omitted]</p>

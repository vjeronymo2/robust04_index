			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: The green time bomb - The EC has established a benchmark for environmental management The long-awaited publication of the European Commission's ecological audit proposals last week has finally ignited the fuse on an environmental time bomb lurking under many companies across the EC. After three years of discussion and amendments, companies now have the basis for establishing a standardised, internationally recognised system of environmental management and verification. Initial indications are that many will take advantage of the scheme. To be registered, companies will be required to adopt an environmental policy which commits them to both complying with legislation and to introducing continual improvements in performance. They must conduct an initial environmental review of each participating site, develop a programme and management system, and conduct audits at least every three years. They must publish a public statement after the initial environmental review and following each audit, which must, in turn, be approved by independent, accredited environmental verifiers. In exchange, companies may register the sites that have been scrutinised, and use a logo to promote their involvement. But the symbol must not be used on any products or packaging the company produces. Since initial drafts of the regulation were first circulated in 1990, the shape of the proposals has changed fundamentally. Most important, the scheme has been converted from a mandatory proposal into a voluntary one, aimed particularly at companies with industrial activities. Equally, the proposals have been reduced in scope. To be approved, companies will no longer require all operations on all sites to be examined. The scheme has been modified so that businesses can choose which sites will be covered by the audit. Even since the previous draft was circulated last autumn, at least one important change has taken place. The title and content of the regulation has shifted from simply eco-audit to the eco-management and audit scheme (Emas). It now makes considerable reference to environmental management systems as well as their verification. Most of these changes have been heralded as victories by British lobbyists. The introduction of environmental management issues - and their detailed contents - echo closely BS 7750, the new British standard on environmental management. Mike Gilbert from the British Standards Institute says: 'It's about establishing a benchmark for environmental management. The EC viewpoint is that market forces are much more powerful tools than legislation. By making it a competitive requirement, it will be a lot more attractive.' Despite the concessions, Martin Houldin, head of the national environment unit at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, stresses that many of the Emas requirements remain rigorous. A company must say it has identified all significant environmental issues; that it has management systems which can identify those issues; and that the information they produce can be relied on. David Miller of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand says: 'Quite a few of our clients are making preparations for it. They have draft environmental reports but are waiting for comparative figures before publishing. There will be incremental pressure to adopt the proposals over the next five years.' Some industrialists are concerned the regulations may ultimately be made mandatory. But in the short term, business is more likely to face pressures to comply from other companies and government bodies which demand compliance as a condition for tenders. Companies such as British Telecom and B&amp;Q are already moving in that direction by asking suppliers for details of their environmental policies. In the meantime, environmental reporting remains in its infancy. Body Shop is one of the few companies to produce an independently-verified statement, and is campaigning to see Emas become compulsory. National Power will do the same this summer for the first time. Michael Renger, a partner in the environment unit at lawyers Nabarro Nathanson and author of a recent book on environmental auditing, says: 'This is one of the clearest examples of recent European directives.' But despite a set of regulations with 20 articles on 20 pages, and the same again in annexes, the circulation of Emas last week is only the start of a long process. Publication in the Official Journal in June will begin a 21-month timetable for implementation. A committee is being created to monitor progress. After five years, the Commission is also reserving the right to introduce amendments. Meanwhile several companies are involved in a pilot programme to see how effectively the regulations will work in practice. Most important, a battle over the environmental verifiers is about to begin. In a concession to subsidiarity, each EC member state will be expected to develop a 'competent body' to promote Emas and maintain a register of sites; and another body to accredit environmental verifiers. In the UK, current thinking is that a new body may be created for the first function, and the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies take on the latter, expanding its existing role in approving verifiers for BS 5750, the quality management standard. The Association of Environmental Consultancies, a trade body for consultants, is also vying for this mantle. Once accreditation has been determined, there will still be a debate over who will be authorised as environmental verifiers. The latest edition of the directory published by Environmental Data Services in London shows 339 firms which it recognises in the UK. Some estimates suggest there are more than 1,000 business claiming to be environmental consultants. Many may benefit from the demands and the confusion surrounding the new regulations. But others are unlikely to receive authorisation and may face conflicts between operating as consultants on management systems and as acting as independent verifiers. There is also the question of standardisation. Some observers are worried that the standards applied to verification and accreditation of verifiers across the EC countries will vary considerably and may devalue the Emas endorsement. The green time bomb may be ticking, but its fuse is a long one.</p>

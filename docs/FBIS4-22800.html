			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Osipov, deputy chief of the Locomotive </F> Service of the October Railroad: "Today Spare Parts, but  Tomorrow?...."]    [Text] The locomotive fleet is growing old. It is  virtually impossible to replace the machines that have worked  out their life under the conditions of the production slump and  the severance of ties with the enterprises of the near abroad,  and indeed, it is to no purpose. How can the available machines  do their work and how long will there be enough of them?    All the problems of the diesel locomotive fleet (and on the  October Railroad it is the predominant one) can be clearly seen  from the example of one of the major enterprises on the network  -- the Volkhovstroy Locomotive Depot. In 1988, 135 freight  locomotives were maintained here. With the reduction in the  transport volume, some of the machines were transferred to the  Petrozavodsk Depot. Now only 70 are left at Volkhovstroy. In  order to keep them in good working condition, they have been  assigned to locomotive and comprehensive repair brigades. What  is more, the personnel selected are quite qualified, experienced  people, and make it possible to maintain the diesel locomotives  at the necessary level. Moreover, they introduced a set of  equipment here for technical diagnosis of the locomotives.    No matter how they cared for them, though, the machines  naturally get out of order. The TE10 is obsolete. Its D100  diesel, developed at the dawn of diesel locomotive traction,  does not guarantee reliable work.    The M62 diesel locomotive, developed in its time for  railroads in European countries and intended for light, or  rather, export work, found itself on Russia's difficult proving  grounds. On the Volkhovstroy-Petrozavodsk-Kem and  Volkhovstroy-Cherepovets sections, it had a hard time pulling  four-five-thousand tonne consists. This locomotive is in general  not suited for intensive hauling of such consists. In the future  it will be even worse, for after all, the diesel locomotives are  wearing out. For example 130 M62 machines have been in operation  on the October Railroad for 20 years now, and another 57 M62  diesel locomotives will reach this milestone in two years.  Series TE10 and M62, with low-power diesels, are unreliable in  operation, not to mention the fact that they are uneconomical  and do not meet ecological requirements. They should be replaced  immediately! Only, with what?    Operations workers will still be able to work on these  diesel  locomotives for some time, but this will cost them a pretty  penny. The TEP70, TEM7 and 2TE116 diesel locomotives are  equipped with more powerful diesels. They rarely break down en  route, are more economical and ecologically cleaner -- they do  not have fuel or oil leaks, nor other harmful emissions.    The thought comes to mind: why not put more powerful  four-stroke diesels on the TE10 and M62 locomotives? Even under  the present crisis conditions, there are plants with enough  technical potential to manufacture them. They manufacture 5D49  diesels at Penza and Kolomna, and can make them at Bryansk. The  collectives of these enterprises would be glad to have our  orders. Incidentally, there is experience in this. GUDOK  reported on what happened in Germany when the time came to  exchange the diesels on the diesel locomotives. They did not  write off the machines for scrap metal there, but announced a  competition, in which the best known diesel locomotive building  firms would take part. The managers gave their preference to our  Kolomna Plant. It is a pity that we have not proved to be so  enterprising!    Under the conditions of the breakdown in economic relations,  we must set up direct cooperation with enterprises. For example,  we have a good business contact with the Lyudinovo Plant, which  performs capital repair of TEM7 diesel locomotives. We sent a  TEP70 to the Kolomna Diesel Locomotive Building Plant after  eight years of operation, and hope that they will do a good job  of renovating it. These direct ties with the plants are  advantageous to the railroad.    We have to work within the limits of our technical  potentials. For example, last year, at the Volkhovstroy Depot,  we plagued the life out of them with a mass of chips on the  wheelpairs, caused by a multitude of track defects. We had to  machine 672 wheelpairs in the spring. We did not manage to do  this completely. Complications came up on the road. The  Petrozavodsk Depot had to machine the wheelpairs of the TE10MU  diesel locomotives because the wheel tires were worn, and the  time has come to do this on the 2TE116 as well. How could we  operate if we had only 120 wheelpairs for the whole fleet of 390  sections!    The road is in debt. Plant prices for capital repair are  becoming inaccessible. So we have had to handle this work  ourselves. Last year we carried out capital repair of the first  batch of over 20 sections. This year we plan to put 75 sections  in good working order this way. At the same time, the quality of  the depot work is in no way inferior to that of the plants. This  is the limit, though, our technical base is not highly  developed, and it became possible to perform capital repair only  when there was a reduction in the demand for "hoisting" because  of the drop in transport volume.    The Byborg Depot also had to do hoisting repair. We hope  that  we will be able to repair 48 sections of the M62 diesel  locomotive there. This will make it possible to fully guarantee  the road's need for this type of work in the next two years.    There is one special feature here, though: diesel locomotive  equipment, which we used to get from the MPS [Ministry of  Railways] main administrations through our requisitions, now,  just like spare parts, is ordered by the road's  material-technical supply service. But the road doesn't have the  money to get it. As a result, the diesel locomotive fleet has  found itself without turbines, reducing gears, small electric  motors, wheelpairs and diesels. We can still get some of these,  but on the road the clearing accounts for capital repair are  proceeding according to an "advice note," and this type of  purchase requires "real" money.    The plants of the former Ministry of Heavy, Transport and  Power Machine Building and some of those of our former TsTVR  [Main Administration for Locomotive Repair Plants of the USSR  Ministry of Railways] became joint-stockholding companies. They  work only for cash or with pre-payment. This stumps the railroad.    Just what will happen to the diesel locomotive fleet on the  October Railroad?    About 60 TEP60 diesel passenger locomotives will be operated  up to the year 2005. Only the Poltava Plant will perform their  capital repair. We on the October can do only the hoisting, and  do only one section a month of that.    We have 115 TEP70 diesel locomotives. Ten of them need  capital repair this year. This is possible. But after that, the  process of locomotive wear will increase. There is a danger that  the Kolomna Plant will not stretch to this work. Indeed, we have  no money for it. I think that the MPS should give the road  permission to perform routine second and third phase repair. We  can absolutely cope with this. The mileage norms established by  the manufacturing plant should remain. The problem of the  technological reserve of wheelpairs and electric traction  engines must also be solved (so far no one is doing this in  Russia).    Even though we have found a temporary way out for spare  parts  for the series M62 machines and its modification -- we dismantle  old locomotives -- industry should in no case curtail their  production, or else these locomotives will be laid up everywhere.    We can still operate the Hungarian diesel trains for about  five or six years. After that they will have to be replaced,  since there are no spare parts for their repair. This problem  must be solved as soon as possible.    I think that other roads that have a large diesel locomotive  fleet are experiencing the same difficulties that we are. We  have one task: together with the ministry, draw outside  enterprises more widely into the production of spare parts,  engines, assemblies and units. The diesel locomotive fleet must  be saved.</p>

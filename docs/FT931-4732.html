			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: An algebra lesson in Tory subversion - Ivo Dawnay goes underground with Bill Cash and his anti-Maastricht 'guerrilla force' IF THERE is a geographical epicentre for British political conspiracies it lies only a few hundred yards from the Palace of Westminster. Well within the summons of the division bell, bounded by Westminster School and Conservative Central Office, the network of early eighteenth century streets around Smith Square have harboured well-heeled subversives for time immemorial. It was here, in fiction, that CP Snow set late-night liaisons in his book The Corridors of Power. Here, too, Mr Norman Lamont established Mr John Major's campaign headquarters in November 1990. Not long after, it was to Great College Street - the home of Lord MacAlpine, the former Tory party treasurer - that the woman he replaced retreated to lick her wounds. How appropriate, then, that Mr Bill Cash, arch Euro-sceptic and most prominent of Mr Major's Tory enemies, has set up his camp under her anti-Maastricht standard in the same premises. For visitors to the modest terrace, it is the parallels with Downing Street itself that strike first. Although tiny by comparison, the juxtaposition of antique furnishings and fax machines, period pictures and computer screens echoes the ambience of deadly-serious - if gentlemanly - amateurism that pervades the prime minister's residence. As in Downing Street, the downstairs area is a hive of worker bees - the glint of history-in-the-making in their eyes. At the computer screen is Keith, a forty-something environmentalist who abandoned greenery to take up arms for Cash and country, and now collates the names of other footsoldiers for future mobilisation. Then there is William Sitwell, 23-year-old great nephew of the late Edith, who, in a reversal of Byronic tradition, returned from sybaritic tour-guiding on the Greek islands to fight for British independence. Behind him, in the garden room, sits Great College Street's own garden girl, Sally Rickard, an interior decorator, who says she had been 'praying for two years about the state of the nation' before she received the call. Ms Rickard believes fervently that the other Europeans' agenda is inspired by 'jealousy' for Britain's unique way of life. 'They don't want us to have what we've got, so they want to dissolve it - all our assets are at stake,' she warns apocalyptically. All these and the 'two Davids' - policy crunchers and Hansard trawlers buried in the basement - are merely the outward manifestations of a countrywide network of anti-Maastrichtians, all dedicated to the cause. Mr Cash himself, not unlike the prime minister, sits upstairs in Lord MacAlpine's impeccable drawing room. Nurtured by his wife Biddy, and cups of traditional British instant coffee, he plots the next twist to the Maastricht saga in endless telephone calls to sublime constitutional lawyers or ridiculous tabloid pressmen. Talking to Mr Cash these days is a bit like an algebra lesson as amendments and clauses merge in a stream of numbers and letters testifying to the thoroughness with which he has navigated the darker backwaters of the treaty. The idea of Great College Street, he says, is to provide a guerrilla secretariat, civil service and think tank to harry, second guess and bamboozle the government. Every day it sends a 'fact sheet' to all Conservative MPs, aimed at arming them against what he describes as the 'outrageous disinformation' disseminated by official sources. For those still able to see anything amusing about the endless Maastricht debate, the wry aspect of Mr Cash's crusade is that it is being fought by a group of people who are socially and politically identical to their enemies  -a Sloane civil war transferred to genteel Westminster. The reason that Mr Cash's irregulars have loyalist Whitehall on the ropes is that his own team of 'super' girls and boys has tapped that most dangerous and un-Toryish quality: conviction.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- To become one of the  world's 10 largest traders, China is to strive for a new foreign  trade system with improved legislative protection, more  transparency and open and fair competition.    The statement was made by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing at  the international symposium on China's strategy for foreign  economy and trade opened here today.    Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Director  General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  Peter Sutherland made speeches at the symposium.    This is the first symposium of its kind to be held in China.    In his speeches, Li said that China's foreign trade strategy  is of vital importance to China's modernization drive as well as  to the Asian and world economies, for China has a large  population, a vast market and rich resources.    He said that China has made active contributions to the  world  economy and trade with the speeding up of China's economic  development and expansion of its opening since the '80s, which  has drawn attention from all over the world.    He continued that in the latter half of the '90s, China's  economy will maintain sustained, fast and healthy development  and China's market will be more open, so China will continue to  make its due contributions to the world economy.    Wu Yi, minister of China's foreign trade and economic  cooperation, said in her report at the symposium that although  China's foreign trade has achieved substantial development, it  can not fully meet the requirements of China's modernization  construction, adding that China's foreign trade has a vast  potential.    Wu gave a detailed description of China's foreign trade in  her report titled "Opportunities and Prospects: Basic Framework  for China's Foreign Trade in the 1990s".    She pointed out that China's economy is to be brought  further  in line with international practices and China will learn from  successful international experience to formulate a suitable  foreign trade strategy so as to ensure its development.    Before the opening of the symposium, Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing met with some foreign attendants.</p>

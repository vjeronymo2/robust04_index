			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Value of stress courses is queried: British Psychological Society Conference STRESS management courses may be 'money for old rope', two senior psychologists told the conference yesterday. That is because stress is a confused concept that reveals little about employees' difficulties at work, according to Ms Shirley Reynolds, clinical psychologist with the Medical Research Council at Sheffield University, and Dr Rob Briner, occupational psychology lecturer at London University's Birkbeck College. Dr Briner said: 'If we do believe these courses are money for old rope, then in the world of business psychology that is not unusual.' Ms Reynolds said: 'I certainly would not spend money on them, but on the other hand many organisations spend money on graphologists (handwriting analysts) in recruitment - I wouldn't do that, either.' They told delegates: 'The academic and practitioner communities of occupational psychologists have collectively ignored, avoided or denied the theoretical and conceptual confusion and the empirical inconsistencies in the occupational stress literature.' Such selective reading of the literature led psychologists to make 'over-optimistic' claims about the effectiveness of many stress management strategies. Ms Reynolds said: 'If there is no clear link between stress and poor performance at work, then interventions which are based on that assumption are unlikely to be particularly helpful.' She said: 'Most stress management courses are based on a 'feel good' factor. Some people certainly do experience distress at work but just sending along 10 or 12 people who have nothing wrong with them is unlikely to deliver anything more than very short-term benefits because there is nothing to cure.' Job satisfaction declines significantly in the aftermath of privatisation, but recovers after subsequent restructuring, a study suggests. 'Privatised companies should restructure as soon as possible instead of waiting a few months, as is more usual,' Professor Cary Cooper of Manchester School of Management told the conference. His study of 620 employees of a privatised water company found that job satisfaction declined after privatisation.</p>

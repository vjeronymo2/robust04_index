			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Observer: Not gilty Have the fertile minds from the new issues department of Morgan Stanley International come up with the 'dog' of the year? Observer ran the office slide-rule over yesterday's issue of sterling-denominated zero coupon perpetual bonds. They don't pay interest; there is no repayment of principal; there is no listing. A question as to whether the bank would be making a market in the paper after the offer closes in mid-January merely elicited a giggle. No wonder the underwriting group is taking no fees. PS The issuers milking the market on the tightest terms of the year are the Samaritans, Relate, and the Depaul Trust. The yield is 'a warm feeling' over Libor (WFOL). Paid semi-annually or monthly? The offer telex doesn't divulge.</p>

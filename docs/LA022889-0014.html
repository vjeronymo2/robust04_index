			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUCH PRIVATE PAIN, SO LITTLE PUBLIC CARE  </P> <P> I was shocked and saddened to read last week about the stabbing death of social  worker Robbyn Panitch in Santa Monica. And then I saw the picture on Page 3:  David Scott Smith was the man who had sat next to me in church the previous  Sunday.  </P> <P> My boyfriend Tad had just gotten up to help out with the collection -- this was  the week the money would be used to help the homeless who live in the park  across the street. A man I recognized as one of our "park people" slipped into  the empty space beside me. His smell was unpleasant, but not overpowering. I  mentioned that the seat was taken and that my boyfriend would return soon. The  man didn't move.  </P> <P> We use a lot of music in our 5:30 Mass and it's not unusual to find people  crying quietly during the service over some private pain. The man from the park  sitting next to me began to sob, tears streaming down his face. He began  calling: "Yahweh, heal me! I am in so much pain!" I had no tissues in my purse  to offer, but I did reach out a hand of comfort to rest on his shoulder. He  didn't acknowledge me or my feeble gesture. Instead, he began to call out: "God  I love you so much." Then he shouted an obscenity. And that's when I knew we  had a problem.  </P> <P> When my boyfriend returned, the man I later recognized as David Scott Smith  seemed to calm down. He appeared to be genuinely grateful when several people  reached out a hand to him during the part of the Mass when everyone extends a  sign of peace. He took Communion. Afterward, as my boyfriend bent his head down  for a moment of quiet reflection, this man who'd been ranting just a few  minutes earlier extended a hand of his own and placed it on Tad's shoulder.  </P> <P> Two days later, he stabbed his social worker to death.  </P> <P> The incident affected me not only because I had had some personal interaction  with the man, but also because my job takes me out on the streets where I talk  to people like David Scott Smith every day. I talk to their social workers who  complain about their ever-increasing caseloads. And I talk to the people who  operate the clinics, who say that they find themselves treating the David Scott  Smiths only in the latter stages of their diseases because there isn't enough  manpower to treat them any earlier. And I talk to the Los Angeles County  supervisors, who tell me that the state isn't living up to its agreement to pay  90% of the mental health bill, and that the county doesn't have enough money to  pick up an $18-million deficit. And I talk to the people who work with the  homeless, who tell me that fully a thirdof the people who live on our streets  are mentally ill.  </P> <P> Those who saw David Scott Smith more often than I knew that he was  deteriorating mentally. His mother tried to have him committed after he tried  to strangle her, but David was unwilling to enter a hospital. The only other  way to have someone institutionalized is to prove that he poses a threat to  himself or to others. But a woman who works with the homeless mentally ill told  me a joke among mental health professionals: The only way to prove that the  threat exists is if someone attacks a psychiatrist in the presence of another  psychiatrist.  </P> <P> On Monday, the county began dismantling services at 13 clinics from the San  Fernando Valley to San Pedro. Eventually, nearly 500 mental health workers will  be laid off, demoted or transferred to other jobs. Robbyn Panitch was one of  those scheduled for demotion.  </P> <P> Twenty thousand patients will lose their counselors. Another 10,000 could find  themselves transferring buses as many as three times in order to get counseling  and medication at one of the few remaining open clinics.  </P> <P> The closures have not come without protest. Psychiatrists and parents of the  mentally ill staged loud and colorful rallies throughout Los Angeles County.  Patients stood nervously at microphones, telling in painful detail what their  lives were like before they found counseling. Groups marched on Sacramento. But  unless the supervisors act quickly, the clinics will close.  </P> <P> Mental health has not been a top priority for county budget planners. That's  largely because most of the money to run the clinics is supposed to come from  the state. But for more than a decade, that hasn't happened.  </P> <P> Supervisors must take a more active stand in the fight for state funding. A  united board should demand that the governor invoke the dreaded "T" word to pay  for mental health care and half a dozen other health crises in the making. If a  general increase in state income tax proves too distasteful for the  politicians, alternative "user fees" could be found. Such tax increases are not  unpopular with Californians. Voters approved an increase in cigarette taxes  last November to offset some of the costs of treating poor patients. And recent  polls indicate that drivers would pay an extra five cents a gallon in order to  reduce traffic woes. Wouldn't they agree to a tiny increase in the state's  sales tax in order to pay for adequate mental health care?  </P> <P> It's time to realize that the system of caring for the mentally ill is falling  apart. You don't have to look very far to see for yourself. Walk the streets of  downtown Los Angeles. Take a stroll beneath Santa Monica Pier. Or come to  church with me next Sunday.  </P></p>

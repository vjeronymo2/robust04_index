			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trilateral Agreement"] </F>   [Text] A trilateral agreement was signed in Smolnyy  yesterday among the Government of St. Petersburg, the Union of  Associations of Enterprises of Industry, Construction, Science,  Transportation, and Communications, and the Council of the  Leningrad (St. Petersburg) Trade Union Federation for 1994. It  was signed by the city's mayor, Anatoliy Sobchak, the president  of the Union of the Association of Enterprises, Viktor  Kharchanko, and the chairman of the Trade Union Federation,  Yevgeniy Makarov.    The parties agreed on joint actions regarding questions of  socioeconomic policy, regulation of labor relations, provision  of the necessary guarantees for workers, and prevention of labor  conflicts.    In particular, the agreement envisions prompt payment of  wages. If there is a delay of payment for a period of more than  a month, for workers of enterprises financed from the state  budget, the amounts that are delayed will be indexed taking into  account the higher consumer prices during this period.    Upon signing the agreement St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy  Sobchak noted that last year such an agreement was completely  justified and the city avoided large conflicts and strikes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The Chinese Government  is conducting a thorough investigation into the murder of a  South Korean businessman who was found dead in Northeastern  China over the weekend, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  said Monday.    "We do not want this kind of mishap to take place in China,  although it is the kind of incident which can occur in any  country," said Spokesman Shen Guofang at a meeting with South  Korean reporters.    "The Chinese Government has taken measures to guarantee the  safety of foreign investments here and the security of  foreigners doing business in China, and will continue to  reinforce such measures," said the spokesman.    A 53-year-old Cheju resident, So In-sok, was found dead over  the weekend in Changchun city, Jilin Province. So's relatives  said he journeyed to Changchun last March when several ethnic  Koreans told him about promising business opportunities there.</p>

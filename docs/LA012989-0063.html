			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOING BROKE IN MOSCOW  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's new candor has prompted the public admission that the  government not only runs a budget deficit, but that it's a whopper. Three  months ago Finance Minister Boris Gostev disclosed that the 1989 deficit would  reach 35 billion rubles, or $58 billion at the official rate of exchange.  Western economists who considered that figure too low now find their suspicions  confirmed. Leonid I. Abalkin, director of the National Institute of the  Economy, says that this year's real deficit, including borrowing, will exceed  $160 billion. That's equivalent to 11% of the gross national product, compared  to a U.S. budget deficit thatis about 4% of GNP. The deficit, Abalkin says,  "ruins" the economy. For President Mikhail S. Gorbachev it also raises the most  troubling political questions.  </P> <P> For one thing, Abalkin says, trying to reduce the deficit will force deferring  until at least the mid-1990s the major improvement in living standards that  Gorbachev has made a priority in his program to restructure the economy. So  far, whatever has been promised, the Gorbachev era has seen a net decline in  living standards, with short-ages of food and basic consumer goods deepening  even as public demands for improvement grow louder. As part of the effort to  cut the deficit, Abalkin says, about 20% of current capital investment in the  civilian sector will be slashed. The prospect, then, is for things to get worse  before they start to get better.  </P> <P> Other savings are expected from previously announced cuts in military spending  and from a threatened shutdown of inefficient, money-losing factories and  farms. These steps could cut the deficit by about 20%. But far more drastic  measures will have to be taken if the hoped-for goal of wiping out the deficit  within three years is to be reached.  </P> <P> A further casualty of the deficit crisis will be the plan to lift government  controls on prices. As Abalkin concedes, price deregulation in a time of  unabated shortages would be sure to produce an inflation that in turn would  raise demands on the state for higher wages, further aggravating the deficit  problem. But if moving toward a market system of prices is deferred, then it's  hard to see how plans to edge toward a market system in the production of goods  can be carried out. Soviet economic history makes clear that the gap between  consumer demand and supply can't be closed by fiat or ideological exhortation.  A market approach would narrow that gap, but now the Soviet Union's most  prominent economist says that the conditions for this aren't appropriate and  are not likely to be for some time.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has staked his political life on making economic restructuring work.  If the reform effort fails, as he well knows, the Soviet Union can forget about  its chances to be internationally competitive. So far success has eluded him,  and the unavoidable question becomes how much more time he may have left to  shake up a system that has proved to be woefully inadequate for the late 20th  Century, and hopelessly unsuited for the 21st.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's high standing in opinion polls taken in West Germany or Orange  County is interesting, but far more significant is how he stands among 285  million Soviet citizens. The priority that he gave to improving supplies of  food and consumer goods showed clearly the importance that he put on winning  public approval, for popular support could give him a claim to political  legitimacy that his opponents in the higher echelons of leadership would fear  to challenge. Now, though, the Soviet people are again being told that their  economy is a mess and that they will have to wait still longer for the promised  bigger piece of the pie. That message is not likely to boost Gorbachev's  approval rating at home, or strengthen his hand in the Kremlin.  </P></p>

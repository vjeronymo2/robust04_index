			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By the Regional Desk] </F>   [Text] The plight of Laos, a bulwark of the communist bloc  in Asia until the collapse of Soviet Union, has almost been  forgotten.    It was only with the April opening of the Thai-Lao  Mittraphap  bridge, that the land-locked country of six million people began  to attract the attention of the world media. But most of the  interest was in its economic potential as it warily opens its  doors to foreign investment and market economics.    However, if Laos is to take advantage of the dynamism that  has become the hallmark of many of the region's economies it  will first have to develop its human resources.    "There is a lack of understanding at the top leadership  level  about how to develop and mobilize basic human resources to take  up the immense challenges of this development decade," said  Chansamon Voravong, president of Paris-based Organization of Lao  Community for Refugees and National Communities (Orlec).    "It may take another twenty years before the technicians and  professionals in training at present become operational, and  resorting to foreign experts without capable supervision,  coordination, control and reliable evaluation, not only  constitutes human and financial waste, but also hinders the  solution of human resource development of the country," he said.    While hailing Vientiane's programme to focus on human  resource development as the right way to reach its stated target  of sustainable economic development, Chansamon said it failed to  address two inseparable issues -- democracy and national  reconciliation.    Without the two things, human resource development will not  work, he said. "There cannot be national reconciliation without  democracy. There cannot be democracy without a sustainable  economy," said Chansamon.    In an interview with The Region, Chansamon pointed out the  present government could no longer rely on foreign help for  resource mobilization. He said the magnate of foreign  assistance has now shifted to Vietnam with its potentially vast  human resources and market of 70 million consumers.  International aid agencies will, meanwhile, be focusing on  war-ravaged Cambodia.    As such, he said the government should re-orientate its  focus  to tap the overseas Laotian community, who collectively  represent an immense pool of human resource in know how capital  and access to markets which are crucial to the economic and  human resource development of Laos.    Vientiane's self-articulated economic development priorities  -- education and cultural and national preservation -- in order  to sustain a qualitative growth over a quantitative growth will  be hard to implement without skilled administrators, he said.    Chansamon was among the 10 percent of the Laotian population  who joined the exodus for fear of political persecution  following the communist victory in 1975. Many of the exiles  have successfully transformed them selves into world-class  entrepreneurs, investors, technical experts, manager, bankers,  social service administrators and leaders in other fields.    "Finding ways to access and tap this valuable human  resource pool represents a major challenge and opportunity for  the government, said the 64 year-old former senior government  official of the right-wing government. He left the country in  1979 after being held for four years in a rehabilitation camp.    Tens of thousands of Laotians, who formed the core of the  intellectual and skilled resources base of the country, were  sent to "rehabilitation camps". After more than ten years, less  than one percent have been re-integrated into the socio-economic  structure of the nation, according to a paper written by  Chansamon.    "Pragmatic, realistic, reconciliatory and perhaps  imaginative  ways must be found to heal the wounded hearts and minds, to  reestablish mutual trust and to instill new hope and confidence  in the future among Laotians from all walks of life, said  Chansamon in his report presented to recent international  meeting in Tokyo.    His organization has been campaigning for five years under a  programme called the "Loatian Democratic Initiative" to educate  overseas Laotians and to improve the understanding of and  commitment to democratic values among the populace.    Once allied to the anti-Vientiane Hmong leader Vang Pao in  its armed struggle against the Vientiane socialists, his group  later renounced the cooperation for peaceful means.    "We believed Laotian overseas or in the country share the  same aspirations for peaceful political reform and improvement  of economic conditions. But those living inside the country  cannot express these aspirations without danger," said the  report on prospects for national reconciliation.    "Some present Lao government officials who can discuss with  expatriates, have not yet seen how the word democracy can be  utilized without fear of punishment or any other wordings which  are not in line with the party's parlance," he said.    Chansamon said during the interview that the mobilization of  human resources in the country will never work for Laos if the  government did not allow people to speak up and put their  capabilities to the test.    He said he believed Laos would not be suffering from a such  a  dire shortage of experts and academics if it had allowed the  limited number of educated "cream" to speak up and express their  opinions.    Since the communist takeover, the general election of a  National Assembly and promulgation of a Constitution and legal  reforms had yet to translate into real democracy and freedom,  his report said.    On the contrary, the party still condemned the dissemination  of documents and ideas about democracy and human rights, which  the party considers as a sinister new approach, a peaceful  manoeuvre by the "enemies of the People's regime", it said.    Chansamon said the government should rather provide  conditions conducive to attract educated Laotians abroad to  return and help with the skill they had accumulated.    Although the government has eased visits and contacts  between  Laotians in and outside the country and persuaded them to return  for national development, there were no formal legal guarantees  for their safety or liberty, Chansamon said.    For example, he said there was no legal framework to ensure  their adopted nationality would be recognized.    There were no legal offers including the amnesty programme  to  guarantee the safety of former anti-government activists if they  return.    Vientiane recently claimed the government's programme to  persuade overseas Laotians to return home since 1978 had met  with success. Laotian Ambassador to Thailand Bounkeut  Sangsomsak said more than 30,000 overseas Laotians have returned  home outside the UN programme. He said the government continued  through its embassies in many capitals where expat Laotians live  to appeal to them to return.    But Chansamon said only a few hundred had so far returned  home for good.    "The time is right. An unstable Laos would ultimately be a  factor of imbalance and instability in the region. Any effort  for reconciliation and harmonious economic and social  development in this country would be beneficial for the  stability of the region, for peace and mutual understanding in  the world as well," he concluded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Franz-Olivier Giesbert editorial: "The Tragedy and the </F> Buck"]    [Text] What purpose does NATO serve now that the Cold War  is dead and buried? Following the Atlantic alliance summit,  which has just been held in Brussels, it is difficult to answer.    NATO, courageous but not reckless, announces in its final  declaration that it "remains open to other European states" and  accepts the principle of "expansion." The countries like Poland  or the Czech Republic, which are knocking at its door, are  simply asked to wait in the waiting room for as long as is  necessary. They will learn the pleasures of purgatory.    With regard to Bosnia, NATO sententiously decrees that the  conflict "must be settled at the negotiating table and not on  the battlefield." How can we fail to agree? And the Sixteen  are renewing their already long-standing threat of an air strike  against Serbian positions. But the threats, like the promises,  primarily commit only those who receive them....    There is a well-known expression: "Stop me or I will do  something I will regret." This is largely the international  community's state of mind with regard to the Bosnian tragedy.  From NATO to the European Union, all the world's institutions  constantly predict reprisals against the Serbs which never come.  Like Pontius Pilate, they say: "I am not responsible for this  blood," wash their hands of it, but never forget, for history's  sake, to proclaim their indignation by condemning Slobodan  Milosevic.    Thus the "world community" in general, and Europe in  particular, have brought shame on themselves as they go from one  step backwards to another. This time, however, it is not  certain that the worst will happen. As Mr. Mitterrand noted,  NATO yesterday put forward proposals for practical action  formulated by Mr. Major and Mr. Juppe together. The aim is to  launch air strikes to reopen Tuzla airport and clear the  Srebrenica road.    Will the international community finally succeed in  instilling fear? NATO's distaste lies in having reaffirmed that  the execution of its threats is dependent on the go-ahead of the  United Nations which, as things stand, is merely carrying out  the orders of the UN member states in the conditions on the  ground about which we know.    This is the tactics of discarding. Since the start of the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia, everybody has been trying to  pass the buck. Europe regularly turns toward the United States  which then demands the intervention of the Twelve. Hitherto  they have both always managed not to agree at the same time on  the need for military intervention. They thought they were  taking people in.    NATO is now addressing the United Nations which can do  nothing about it. What if the United Nations said: "You are  on?"</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/P/94/10: "Commission Adopts a </F> Communication on Immigration and Asylum"]    [Text] On a proposal from Mr. Flynn, Commissioner  responsible for justice and home affairs, the Commission today  adopted a communication on immigration and asylum policies.    Introducing the communication, Mr. Flynn said that "this  document represents a significant and important initiative by  the Commission. It will initiate a wide-ranging debate with the  Council and Parliament and beyond on the long term strategy now  needed to respond to the challenges posed by immigration and  asylum on the one hand and integration measures for third  country nationals legally resident in the community on the  other."    Immigration, together with the separate but related subject  of asylum, has continued to occupy an increasingly prominent  place in the political agenda of the European Union and its  member states. It gives rise to public and parliamentary debate  of growing intensity, and occasionally is the focus of acts of  violence totally out of character with Europe's traditions and  laws.    There is increased recognition that the issues involved need  to be tackled on a cooperative basis. That has found expression  in the provisions of the treaty on European Union which formally  designates the subjects as being matters of common interest, to  be addressed in the context of a single institutional framework.    That is as it should be. The deepening of the European  integration process calls for an integrated and coherent  response, which combines realism with solidarity, to the  challenges which migration pressures and the integration of  legal immigrants pose for the Union as a whole. Failure to meet  those challenges would be to the detriment of attempts to  promote cohesion and solidarity within the Union and could,  indeed, endanger the future stability of the Union itself.    The Commission therefore looks to this communication as a  basis to stimulate a new and wide-ranging debate as to how the  new possibilities which the treaty on European Union creates can  be used to provide the coordinated response necessary, and the  framework, to guide the Union in its future work.    To that end the communication takes account of the work  already done and developments on the ground. In addition, it  takes as its base a number of agreed starting points drawn from  earlier discussions, in particular the need for a comprehensive  approach which addresses the key components of an effective  immigration policy:     -  action on migration pressure,  particularly through cooperation with the main countries of  would-be emigration to Europe;    -  action on controlling immigration  in order to keep it within manageable structures;    -  action to  strengthen integration policies for legal immigrants.    The advantage of a comprehensive approach of that kind is  that it enables control and admission measures to be matched by  long-term cooperation with countries and regions of origin and  an active policy of advancing the situation of those third  country nationals already legally resident in the Union.    The communication looks beyond the existing work programs of  the Union in the relevant areas in ways designed to complement  those programs. It seeks to be realistic while putting forward  new ideas and a new emphasis on how policy objectives can be  pursued in operational terms.  <H5>  Action on The Causes of Migration Pressure </H5>   The communication argues that this requires ensuring that  immigration and asylum policies are fully integrated into the  union's external policies, and that the various external policy  instruments available to the Union are used to address the root  causes of those pressures. That could involve action at a  number of different levels such as in the areas of trade,  development and cooperation policies, humanitarian assistance  and human rights policies.    Effective action in this area also requires ensuring the  availability of accurate information on current migration  patterns and likely future trends.  <H5>  Action on Controlling Migration Flows </H5>   Action to control migration flows will also require a policy  response at a number of levels. It will mean defining and  implementing common approaches to admission policies as regards  admission of workers, self-employed persons and students and the  approximation of admission policies for humanitarian reasons. It  calls for policies to deal more effectively with the problem of  illegal immigration by way of preventive measures and measures  to address the issue of persons illegally resident in the  Community, with a particular focus on combating illegal  employment.    Policies in respect of refugees and other persons in need of  international protection also need to be addressed but the  communication suggests that the focus here is of necessity  different. The focus for the purpose of asylum policies should  be on ensuring that the examination of asylum applications can  continue to operate in a fair and efficient manner. The  communication also deals with new issues thrown up by the war in  ex-Yugoslavia by way of the development of schemes for temporary  protection. It suggests that a Union committed to cooperative  action could examine how best to show solidarity to help member  states caught in a front-line position in responding to such  situations.  <H3>  Action to Strengthen Integration Policies for Legal  Immigrants </H3>   The communication stresses that action in this area remains  an essential element of the wider need to promote solidarity and  integration in the Union. What this requires will be to ensure  that integration policies are directed in a meaningful way  toward improving the situation of third country nationals  legally resident within the community by taking steps which will  go further toward assimilating their rights with those of  citizens of the member states.    Strengthening integration policies will also involve action  to create the right economic and socio-cultural conditions for  successful integration by way, for example, of actions in the  field of employment and education. Equally it requires  promoting information and dialogue and combating racial  discrimination and all forms of racism and xenophobia.    The various ideas which the Commission invites the  Parliament  and Council to examine are set out in summary form in Chapter IV  of the communication in terms of a possible new framework for  action by the Union. The ideas set out there are not intended  to lay down a definitive work plan at this stage. They do,  however, represent a coherent set of proposals which member  states and the Commission itself will want to consider in  drawing up a long term action program that is now required to  take account of both the new challenges and new possibilities  offered by European Union. The proposals contained in chapter  IV should therefore be regarded as ideas to be discussed and  elaborated upon in the debate which the Commission would wish  this communication to launch.    Translating those ideas into action will represent the next  phase. The Commission will equally seek to contribute to that  process by using the various instruments at its disposal, both  in relation to the plan of action adopted by the European  Council in December 1993 and the new framework for action by the  Union suggested in Chapter IV.    Commissioner Flynn expressed the hope that "a consensus will  emerge which recognizes that the challenge which immigration and  related issues poses for the Community, demands both a balanced  and comprehensive response in keeping with Europe's best  traditions."</p>

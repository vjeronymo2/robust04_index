			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Last chance in Russia FAILURE BREEDS failure. In Russia today it even seems predestined. But despair is an unaffordable luxury, unaffordable for the Russians and unaffordable for the west as well. Russia is a country of vast resources, copious skills and great importance. No effort should be spared to prevent it from sinking into chaos or returning to an inward-looking despotism. It is this thought, not fear of failure or worries about relatively small sums, which should inform the reconsideration of policy towards Russia to which the Clinton administration is committed. In any such reconsideration, the administration - indeed the west as a whole  -needs to ask itself a few fundamental questions: how much does Russian reform matter? What are the political and economic obstacles to success? And how can the west improve the chances? After spending trillions of US dollars in protecting itself against the alternative, the west should need no persuading of the desirability of a democratic transformation. Given Russia's location, resources, historic significance and nuclear armament, few foreign policy goals can rival the desirability of Russian success. Why have things been going wrong? Russia's flirtation with hyperinflation and the continuing collapse in industrial output are not the fruit of 'shock therapy'. On the contrary, they reflect a failure to impose shock therapy. The government did liberalise prices, but it inherited the disintegration of central planning and the breakdown in political and economic relations among the successor states of the Soviet Union. It also had to suffer an explosive increase in central bank credit. It is not the unique properties of the Russian soul which make it so difficult to introduce the market economy. History is littered with the reputations of pundits who declared that countries could not manage the market economy, until, unexpectedly, they did. Russians are as entrepreneurial as anyone else. Under hyperinflation and grossly inadequate property rights, however, their entrepreneurship is inevitably revealed in speculation, black marketeering and gangsterism. A part of what has made reform so difficult is an economic and political legacy more adverse even than Poland's. What has also made it difficult, however, were simple mistakes: Mr Boris Yeltsin's failure to reform the constitution when he could have done so; the central bank's misunderstanding of the relationship between monetary policy and inflation; and the west's refusal to do what was needed to help shift the internal balance of power towards the reformers. The principal western interlocutor has been the International Monetary Fund. Its goal of stabilisation is right. But it is no use standing on the sidelines, waiting for a coherent government to come forward with an implementable stabilisation policy. The west had to help the reformers win their domestic battles. It failed to do so. No wonder the Russians joke that 'they pretend to give us aid and we pretend to reform'. What does the west need to do? First, it should decide that Dollars 24bn a year in long-term assistance - a mere 0.2 per cent of its aggregate gross domestic product - is a price well worth paying for the chances of successful Russian reform. Second, authority for negotiating and implementing western assistance should be given to a small high-level team working directly for the Group of Seven industrial countries. Third, a substantial amount of long-term assistance - Dollars 2 1/2 bn-Dollars 3bn, plus debt relief - should be given almost immediately, in return for some degree of control over the central bank and the budget. Fourth, assistance should be provided for balance of payments support; for a comprehensive and politically effective social safety net; for support for long-term investment in viable industries; and for small business development. Finally, all assistance must be conditional, but the conditions should be neither over-detailed nor excessively unrealistic. It may already be too late to succeed. But it cannot be too late to try. The Clinton administration should commit itself to one big push. The question is not whether it can afford to take the risk. It is whether it can afford not to.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The Korea High-Speed Rail  Construction Authority (KHRC) contracted with Anglo-French  Consortium GEC-Alsthom on Tuesday for the 2,101.6-million-dollar  high-speed train system.    KHRC President Pak Yu-kwang and GEC-Alsthom President Pierre  Bilger signed the contract at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and  Industry (KCCI) in downtown Seoul. The contract will take  effect when the KHRC makes an advance payment to GEC-Alsthom  after the authority takes out a loan with Indosuez Bank of  France for 2,337 million dollars, a KHRC official said.    With Tuesday's contract, the system for the high-speed  railway linking Seoul and Pusan has finally been decided -- the  TGV (Train a Grand Vitesse) -- almost three years after the KHRC  invited bids from France, Germany and Japan on Aug. 26, 1991.    Train manufacturers from France and South Korea will jointly  design the TGV trainsets late this year with production slated  for June next year, according to the KHRC.    The high-speed train system will be established by September  2001, with the TGV trains running on the 410-kilometer track  between Seoul and Pusan in 124 minutes at a maximum speed of 300  kilometers per hour with over 1,000 passengers aboard.    As for technology transfers from GEC-Alsthom to South Korean  businesses, KHRC officials said that at least 50 percent of the  46 trainsets must be localized and that if the localization rate  does not reach 50 percent, Alsthom should pay a fine comprising  20 percent of the shortfall, according to the KHRC.    Meanwhile, 12 Korean and French firms will participate in a  consortium to manufacture and supply the trainsets, and the  consortium will be divided into five groups, KHRC officials said.</p>

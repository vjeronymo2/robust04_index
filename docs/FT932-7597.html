			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Restructuring boosts Ricoh RICOH, a leading Japanese office automation equipment maker, yesterday announced a 52.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y11.6bn (Dollars 9m) for the year ended in March, and attributed the increase to its recent restructuring efforts. Net profits rose by 1.8 per cent to Y4.9bn for the year, in spite of a decline in sales of 3.1 per cent to Y651.8bn. The Tokyo-based company had streamlined its product range and research capacity, and strengthened sales to offset the country's economic slump. Brokers said the company's stock has risen in tandem with the overall advance of the Nikkei average since mid-March.</p>

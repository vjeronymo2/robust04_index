			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Greek Justice Minister Yannis Skoularikis said he is leaving a decision on  extraditing a Palestinian guerrilla to the United States to the new government  to be formed after June elections. The Supreme Court said Friday that Mohammed  Rashid, 34, should be extradited. The final decision rests with the justice  minister. "The Rashid case is a major one, and the decision on whether he  should or should not be extradited to the United States will be made by the  government that will emerge from the June elections," he told reporters in  Athens. The United States wants Rashid to stand trial over a midair explosion  aboard a Pan Am airliner in 1982 that killed a Japanese teen-ager.  </P></p>

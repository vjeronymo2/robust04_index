In other words  the DZVM, with its five deputies, will not enter a coalition  with either the Socialist Party of Serbia or the opposition. To  a suggestion that in this case neither side will have the  necessary 126 votes in the republican parliament, Agaston said  that "other solutions will have to be sought." The decision not  to take part in the formation of a new republican government was  adopted by the DZVM presidency last Saturday. [passage omitted]</p>

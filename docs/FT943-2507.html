			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Yields tell a different story Sir, In 'Interest cost of UK opt out' (September 15), Samuel Brittan says: 'The important point is that opting out of EMU does have an economic price which the UK may already be paying in long-term interest rates higher than those of her partner countries, and in the need to reinforce confidence by base rate increases. . .' It is difficult to square this with the changes in the gilt-bund spread. In April 1992 when we were solidly in the ERM and on the way to some sort of currency union, gilt yields reached a peak of 230 basis points above bund yields. From January to September 1992 the average spread was around 170 basis points. After we dropped out of the ERM and prospects of EMU receded, the spread decreased to a low of a little above 40 basis points at the end of January 1994. The average for the year was around 90 basis points. Today, after the shake out in world bond markets, the spread is about 130 basis points - still well below that which ruled when firmly in the ERM. It is worth noting that, contrary to the predictions of the government and most of the market commentators, as the ERM fell and prospects of British membership of any foreseeable EMU virtually disappeared, the spread did not increase; instead it sharply contracted. With the break up of the ERM all interest rates, short and long, nominal and real went down - instead of up as ERM enthusiasts predicted. If there is a de facto currency union and everyone believes that it will be sustained, then of course interest will be the same and there would be no spread at all. But the road to such a union is not smoothly paved with declining spreads, as the experience with the ERM has so convincingly demonstrated.

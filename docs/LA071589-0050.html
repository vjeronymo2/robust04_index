			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIRNESS ON TELEVISION  </P> <P> Regarding " 'Rage' Documentary Puts PBS in Its Own Mideast Standoff," Howard  Rosenberg's July 12 column about "Days of Rage":  </P> <P> If PBS and public television stations were, as Rosenberg suggested, so afraid  of controversy that might offend funding sources and potential donors, why  would KCET and most PBS stations have carried a 45-minute Jim Lehrer interview  with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat or a half-hour conversation with King Hussein  of Jordan earlier this spring?  </P> <P> The real issue surrounding the broadcasting of Jo Franklin-Trout's film  commentary is not an obsession with balance but rather a commitment to  fairness.  </P> <P> If any producer creates a program that makes serious claims of illegal behavior  against an individual or a group, public television is obliged by its own  standards of journalism to give those accused a reasonable opportunity to  respond.  </P> <P> Since "Days of Rage" created, as Rosenberg once wrote, "a documentary-length  statement without rebuttal," it was up to PBS and public television stations to  be concerned about how to provide for a fair response. Although public  television is willing to create an appropriate forum for such a response, it is  clear that the film's producer has felt that effort to be unnecessary.  </P> <P> Public television accepts its obligation to take the heat in matters of public  controversy. But to do that responsibly, we must not only demand respect for  the intelligence of our viewers but also for their common sense of fairness.  </P> <P> STEPHEN KULCZYCKI  </P> <P> Senior vice president and  </P> <P> station manager, KCET  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

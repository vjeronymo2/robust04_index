			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Banks extend Ratners borrowing facilities RATNERS GROUP has won a breathing space from its banks which have agreed to extend the jewellery retailer's borrowing facilities until June next year. In return the banks have imposed more stringent covenants and higher interest rates. Mr James McAdam, executive chairman, said the new banking terms were 'not unreasonable'. The agreement with the banks will allow Ratners to meet the Pounds 58.5m redemption of its convertible bonds in October, so long as the payment does not breach the covenants or require new funds from the banks. The banks and bondholders have been given security over some of the group's assets. Ratners shares fell  1/2 p to 11 1/2 p yesterday. The group has agreed a business plan with its banks which, if adhered to, is expected to allow the company to repay the bonds and eventually return to profitability. Mr Gary O'Brien, finance director, said 'it is critical that we perform to the plan.' The plan involves 180 store closures in the UK and 150 in the US, over the next three years. Gross margins will be pushed up, and the chains will pursue a more tightly focused marketing strategy. Cost savings, totalling around Pounds 50m a year, are being made and working capital is being cut sharply to release cash. Ratners also announced much delayed results for the year to February 1, with losses before tax of Pounds 122.3m (profits Pounds 112.1m) in line with expectations. It said trading conditions worsened sharply in the second half of last year, with sales substantially below expectations in the crucial Christmas trading period. Sales have fallen again in the first half of the current year. Group sales rose marginally to Pounds 1.13bn (Pounds 1.11bn) because of the inclusion for a full year of Kay, the US chain bought late in 1990. Apart from Kay and Salisburys, the UK chain selling handbags and luggage where sales rose 3 per cent on a comparable basis, all Ratners chains suffered sales falls. Sales in the Ratners chain itself fell 24 per cent in the year on a comparable store basis, the decline worsening after the now infamous 'crap' remark made by Mr Gerald Ratner, chief executive, about one of the group's products in a speech in April last year. Operating profits dropped from Pounds 134m to Pounds 1.4m. The fall was largely accounted for by lower gross margins as prices were cut in an attempt to regain sales, particularly in the pre-Christmas period. This was estimated to cost Pounds 35.9m. At the same time operating costs rose sharply, costing an extra Pounds 113m. Exceptional costs amounted to Pounds 98m (Pounds 2m) as the group predicted in May when it finalised its business plan. These costs cover stores closures, asset and stock write-downs, bad debts and reorganisation. After tax of Pounds 3.62m (Pounds 36.4m) and dividends, largely payments on the group's preference shares which are now being rolled up, of Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 44.4m), there was a retained loss of Pounds 149m (profit Pounds 24.5m). After paying an interim dividend of 2.4p (same) there is no final dividend. At the year end total debt was Pounds 480m (Pounds 362m) offset by cash of Pounds 257m (172m). Shareholders funds were Pounds 303m (Pounds 398m). Working capital was Pounds 296m (Pounds 360m). See Lex</p>

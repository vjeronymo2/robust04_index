			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs lead partner to retire early Mr Stephen Friedman, senior partner and chairman of the management committee at Goldman Sachs and arguably the world's most powerful investment banker, is to retire early at the age of 57. He will be replaced in November by Mr Jon Corzine, 47, joint head of the firm's fixed income division. Mr Henry Paulson, 48, joint head of investment banking, will become vice-chairman and chief operating officer. Mr Friedman said he made his decision a year ago and had fixed the date of the announcement in March. Working at the head of Goldman could be 'more than a little tiring', he said. 'I guess people might be surprised by the timing. But I've always made clear to my colleagues that I had no intention of working full-time till I'm 60.' Mr Friedman, 56, will assume the title of senior chairman and concentrate on Goldman's main investment business, whereby the firm buys stakes in companies on its own behalf. The change in command comes at a delicate time for Goldman. After record profits last year, it is believed to have been caught out, like other Wall Street firms, by upheavals in financial markets. As a private partnership, Goldman does not disclose results, but it is estimated to have made a pre-tax profit last year of Dollars 2.7bn. Mr Friedman said 1994 had been frustrating. 'While almost all our businesses have done well this year, the firm's profits have been disappointing, particularly as a result of trading results in some of the same businesses which performed extraordinarily well in the last few years.' Mr Corzine said yesterday: 'We're in no way backing away from our commitment to global markets, but you have to adjust your risk profiles in different market environments. Maybe we were a bit slow in recognising changed conditions.'</p>

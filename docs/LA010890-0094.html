			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CROOKS PREY ON THE UNWITTING WITH CLONED CARS  </P> <P> There is a dark side of muscle car collecting.  </P> <P> "As the stakes went up, the crooks came out," explained Corvette aficionado  Brian Lee, of Mt. Pleasant, Tex.  </P> <P> The biggest problem: unscrupulous sellers and restorers who clone muscle cars  from standard models and pass them off as original. For example, said Craig  Jackson of Barrett-Jackson Auction Co., it's all too easy to be stung when  dealing with 1963-67 Chevrolet Corvettes.  </P> <P> Last year, the most powerful versions of the 1967 Sting Rays sold for as much  as $100,000. But experts say there are now more of these Corvettes -- known as  "tri-powers" because of their three-carburetor induction systems -- on the road  than were produced by the factory, thanks to the availability of restoration  parts and the potential for big bucks. In fact, sharp scroungers are turning  salvage-yard iron into gold, asking as much as $4,000 for correctly dated and  numbered carburetor setups alone.  </P> <P> By contrast, a dozen years ago, $4,000 would buy a first-rate,  original-condition 1967 Corvette convertible, powered by a 427-cubic-inch,  435-horsepower engine. And that was for a car with "documentation" -- the bill  of sale, manufacturer's window sticker, factory order sheet, dealership invoice  and title and service records coveted by hard-core auto collectors.  </P> <P> "It's almost impossible to verify one of those cars," says Tom Sloe of the  Corvettes. "They make every piece of documentation now. All they're doing is  changing the number on the engine to correspond to the (vehicle identification  number) on the car.  </P> <P> "As collectors we need to band together and turn over to the authorities  anybody who is committing fraud," said Sloe, a Cleveland-area auto repair shop  owner who has 25 muscle cars. "That's the biggest thing that will hurt these  cars."  </P> <P> The best way to protect yourself is to become an expert -- read, join car clubs  and attend car shows, swap meets and nostalgia races -- or hire an expert.  </P> <P> "It's very easy to wish a car is what it is claimed. It's also a very good way  to lose a lot of money," said Robert DeMars, whose Oakland company appraises  collectible autos and charges a minimum of $470 to appraise a muscle car. JEFF  YIP  </P></p>

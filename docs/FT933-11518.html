			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Pesticide levels in drinking water rise MORE PESTICIDES and chemical residues were found in drinking water last year than in 1991, the second consecutive year to show an increase, the Drinking Water Inspectorate said yesterday. Overall water quality remained the same - 98.7 per cent of the 3.75m tests complied with the national standards, the inspectorate said in its third annual report. Mr Mike Healey, chief inspector, said: 'There is no evidence that where the standards were not met the health of consumers was endangered.' Since the inspectorate was set up in January 1990 its reports have fuelled the debate about whether some EC water directives are unnecessarily tough, resulting in high bills for UK water customers. Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies, said the rise in pesticide detection was partly because sampling for pesticides had increased. Last year 3 per cent of water supply zones failed to meet pesticide standards, compared with 2.8 per cent in 1991 and 2.1 per cent in 1990. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, called for the government to make farmers, not customers, pay for the pollution. Out of a total modernisation programme of Pounds 45bn the water industry is spending some Pounds 1bn on removing pesticides. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, has warned that customers' bills will have to continue to rise faster than inflation throughout the 1990s. The inspectorate said traces of coal tar in the water supply also rose last year. Mr Owen Hydes, deputy chief inspector, said it was possible that the coal tar could cause cancer, but only if it occurred in the water in very large amounts. Drinking Water 1992.

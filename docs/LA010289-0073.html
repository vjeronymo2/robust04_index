			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV TALK SHOWS GOING. . .AND COMMING. . .;  </P> <P> PAT SAJAK AND ARSENIO HALL ENTER THE NIGHTTIME FRAY  </P> <P> Johnny Carson and David Letterman made it. But not Alan Thicke, Joan Rivers,  Paul Robins and Phil Cowan, et al. The late-night TV arena and trivia books are  littered with the bodies of Carson challengers, but that hasn't stopped Pat  Sajak and Arsenio Hall. This month they plunge into the highly competitive time  slot after the 11 o'clock news. (Answer to trivia question No. 1: Robins and  Cowan hosted the late "The Wilton North Report" on Fox Broadcasting.)  </P> <P> Both Sajak, congenial host of "Wheel of Fortune," America's favorite game show,  and Hall, who broke into late night last year as a guest host on Fox's  now-defunct "Late Show," plan to avoid direct competition with the mighty  Carson "Tonight Show." Both say they'll try to provide something completely  different.  </P> <P> Marla Kell Brown, producer of "The Arsenio Hall Show" points out that  competition in late-night television is somewhat different from that during  other "dayparts," as the networks dub the different time periods.  </P> <P> In prime time, for example, the competition is the other networks. In late  night, "your biggest competition is sleep," said Brown, who worked with Hall  during his "Late Show" stint after Joan Rivers' ouster.  </P> <P> Sajak, who makes his CBS late-night debut next Monday at 11:30 p.m. with the  appropriately titled "Pat Sajak Show," and Hall, whose syndicated "Arsenio Hall  Show" premieres Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13 in Los Angeles, say they  don't plan to unseat NBC's Carson and Letterman, ABC's "Nightline" or even go  head-to-head with each other.  </P> <P> They just want to find their own audience among the available pool of  late-night viewers and keep them from falling asleep over their bedtime snacks.  </P> <P> "We're not going to worry about Arsenio; we're not going to worry about Carson  and 'Nightline,' either. We just have to do what feels best for Pat," insisted  Sajak producer Paul Gilbert in a recent conversation at CBS, where the network  spent between $4 million and $5 million constructing a new sound stage and  other facilities for "The Pat Sajak Show," the network's first late-night  effort since 1972, when it canceled Merv Griffin's show.  </P> <P> Ask the people behind "The Arsenio Hall Show" whether they're drawing up battle  plans and they give the same answer. "Hopefully there's enough room for  everybody," said Frank Kelly, senior vice president of programming at Paramount  Television, where the show is produced.  </P> <P> Said Hall: "I think people place too much emphasis on the competition; I'm  running my own race. It's a personal best, it's me against me. I'm on after  Sajak in Chicago (the show airs at various times in different cities) so I want  him to do well."  </P> <P> Well, maybe there's just a little competitive sentiment. "The demographic that  knows Sajak from daytime TV is people who should be asleep (at 11:30). His  people are asleep," Hall noted smugly in an interview at his office at  Paramount. "He probably would do well with a morning talk show. That's what I  would have done with him if I were a CBS executive."  </P> <P> The Carson camp refused comment on their new competitors. But Robert Morton,  producer of "Late Night With David Letterman," said there's truth in the notion  that dissimilar late-night shows pose little threat to one another.  </P> <P> "I think we'd be crazy not to care that they're out there," Morton said. "(But)  there are some shows that, when they're faced with severe competition, are in  an out-and-out battle -- witness the morning shows, how many different ones CBS  has tried. I don't think it's that intense with the late-night shows.  </P> <P> "In fact, we've had Pat Sajak on 'Letterman,' talking about 'The Pat Sajak  Show,' There is, of course, a competitive spirit. But on the other hand, I  think he'll bring another audience to late night -- his daytime viewers. That  can only be helpful to late night. (If) they like his show, maybe they'll turn  to our show."  </P> <P> Unlike Sajak, however, Hall has not been a guest on "Letterman." "I was booked  (on the show), and then, the day of the announcement that I was going to have  my own show, they canceled me," Hall said. "At first I wasn't upset about it,  because this is war. Then I heard that Sajak was on the show. Maybe they don't  consider Sajak competition . . . ."  </P> <P> Producer Morton denies playing favorites. "We don't care about competing shows  as far as booking -- we have guests from the other networks all the time," he  said huffily. He acknowledged, however, that Hall was originally booked for one  "Letterman" date, which Hall himself canceled because he had a schedule  conflict. The only other date Hall had available was nixed because it fell too  close to the debut date of "The Arsenio Hall Show." "We just thought it would  looked a little strange to have him one place, and then another right away,"  Morton countered.  </P> <P> Whether or not Hall and Sajak are deliberately competing -- or which one gets  an on-air audience with David Letterman -- the pair have definitely assigned  themselves a difficult task: trying to be different from each other and the  rest of the pack without really breaking any of the comfortable late-night  conventions that have made Jack Paar, Carson, Letterman and others bright stars  long after the moon comes up over Television Land.  </P> <P> And now, he-e-e-re's Pat and Arsenio. . . . Host: Pat Sajak. (Caucasian male,  42, "Wheel of Fortune" host. Weatherman for Los Angeles' KNBC-TV 1977-81 and  prior to that at WSMV-TV in Nashville.)  </P> <P> Network: CBS.  </P> <P> Time: 11:30 p.m. Running Time: 90 minutes.  </P> <P> Sidekick: Yes (Dan Miller, former news anchor and Sajak colleague in Nashville;  briefly held an anchor position at Los Angeles' KCBS-TV in 1986, but was fired  following a messy management coup at the station).  </P> <P> Studio Orchestra: Yes (The Tom Scott Band, all-male, jazz-rock-fusion).  </P> <P> Desk for the host: Yes.  </P> <P> Style: Neo-Jack Paar. Broad demographic appeal. Guests ranging from show-biz  superstars to political figures, authors, scientists and the man- or  woman-in-the-street. Sajak, who worshiped Paar as pre-Carson host of "The  Tonight Show" while a child growing up in Chicago, hopes to bring back the good  old days of late-night talk -- when guests were entertaining, conversation was  gracious and nobody ever broke the host's nose by throwing a chair at him.  </P> <P> At first, the producers of the "Pat Sajak Show" considered a radical move:  Instead of seating guests on the left side of Sajak's desk -- the way Johnny  Carson does on "The Tonight Show" -- Sajak's people wanted to put guests on the  right side, just to make things a little different.  </P> <P> They decided against it. "I swear, it was like looking into a mirror, we're so  used to seeing it the other way," said Sajak. "It just looked weird."  </P> <P> Weird is the last thing "The Pat Sajak Show" wants to be. It enters late-night  TV with the philosophy that the traditional talk-show format is not broken and  needs no fixing.  </P> <P> Although the show's producers seek to minimize Sajak's identification with  "Wheel of Fortune," the new Pat Sajak will basically be the old Pat Sajak.  Coordinating producer David Williger said any image changes will be subtle, if  detectable. Sajak usually wears double-breasted suitcoats and a pocket  handkerchief on "Wheel." On "Sajak," he will wear mostly single-breasted coats  sans handkerchief.  </P> <P> Mike Mischler, CBS vice president of advertising promotions, described the  show's promotional campaign as equally low-key to avoid what he calls  "anticipointment" -- or unrealistic viewer expectations. "The problem with that  is, they watch the first night and they never come back again," he said.  "That's why 'Thicke of the Night' failed; they trumpeted the Second Coming, and  there was no Second Coming."  </P> <P> Sajak considered the idea of having no sidekick. He considered the idea of  having a woman sidekick -- but after years on "Wheel" opposite Vanna White,  decided that viewers might find another woman disconcerting, "as though Vanna  and I had gotten a divorce or something" (although Sajak will be replaced on  the daytime "Wheel of Fortune" by ex-football star Rolf Benirschke, he will  continue to host the night-time show).  </P> <P> Sajak also thought the good-natured ribbing between male host and female  sidekick might be misconstrued: "If I'm needling some guy, it's two guys having  fun -- but if I'm needling a woman, I'm a cad, and if she's needling me, she's  a bitch," Sajak said. Eventually he settled on old friend Dan Miller, a  quintessential authoritative newscaster whose towering height and rich  Nashville-tinged voice provides vivid contrast to Sajak's elfin charm and quick  wit.  </P> <P> Sajak said the show will make ample use of CBS' location in the Fairfax  district, conducting live interviews from the studio via microwave link-ups  with the locals, from melon merchants at Farmer's Market to the punks of  Melrose Avenue. The producers have purchased a helicopter to pay impromptu  visits to earthquake sites and other areas of note. Sajak plans to do for CBS  Television City what Carson did for beautiful downtown Burbank. And Steve Allen  once did for Hollywood.  </P> <P> Although "Sajak" producers eventually hope to develop their own signature bits  along the lines of Letterman's "Stupid Pet Tricks," Sajak plans to keep his  show traditional -- even returning to the 90-minute format earlier used by Paar  and Carson to allow guests enough time to develop a conversation.  </P> <P> "I was at Jack Paar's house a couple of weeks ago, and we watched some of his  old shows," Sajak said. "You can't do it quite the same way anymore -- things  have changed, attention spans have shortened. But you can get a little of that  flavor. The one thing we did not do was say, 'What can we do to break new  ground, what can we do to be radical?' This format has been working in one form  or another for 35 years." Host: Arsenio Hall. (Black male, 30, most popular  guest host of Fox Broadcasting's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers" following  Rivers' ouster. Turned down regular hosting position on "Late Show" to pursue  movie career; most recently starred with best friend Eddie Murphy in the  box-office hit "Coming to America.")  </P> <P> Network: Syndicated.  </P> <P> Time: In Los Angeles, 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13.  </P> <P> Running Time: 60 minutes.  </P> <P> Sidekick: No.  </P> <P> Studio Orchestra: Yes (Hall describes the band as unusual because it features  women: "I have a sexy lady on drums, I have a sexy lady on keyboard" . . . ).  </P> <P> Desk: Absolutely not.  </P> <P> Style: Hall plans to create the hipness of Letterman without his hard-edged  cynicism. Hall describes himself as just a star-struck boy from Cleveland  beneath all the Hollywood glitter. Although guests will be wide-ranging, as on  "Sajak," Hall expects his show to have a slightly younger demographic appeal  due to his own freewheeling, desk-less approach to interviewing. Hall boldly  calls himself "The Martin Luther King of comedy," and plans to eliminate racism  and sexism from late-night TV by making sure minorities and women appear on the  show. "There are a lot of people out there who don't have a talk show. I am  their talk show."  </P> <P> Hall will make two concessions to late-night TV tradition: (a) he will call his  show "The Arsenio Hall Show," and (b) the announcer will be male. Paramount  audience research showed that people did not find a female announcer's voice  "authoritative" enough.  </P> <P> And the title? It just seemed to fit. "We had guys here (at Paramount) who make  $300,000 a year saying: 'How about "The Arsenio Hall Show?" ' " Hall said with  a chuckle. "But 'Arsenio Hall After Dark' sounded sleazy. And I thought of  'Arsenio,' " but they said: 'You're not Cher, pal."  </P> <P> Beyond that, Hall plans to shake up the format. Talking to his guests without  the barrier of a desk, Hall said he will try for spontaneity with both guests  and audience. "I just like to wing it," he said in a conversation at his  ultra-modern Paramount office, with a big-screen music video throbbing in the  background. "I'm a comedian, I come from the clubs. I know how to work an  audience."  </P> <P> Despite his youthful following, Hall will eschew leather jackets and jeans for  stylish suits and a more sophisticated look to broaden his audience. Nor does  he plan to limit his guest list to youth-appeal acts. "I'd love to talk to  Ronald Reagan," he offered. "There isn't anyone who I would consider too old  and square. I'd love to do Bette Davis, I'd love to talk to Wayne Newton."  </P> <P> Producer Brown noted that publicists for some of Hollywood's less-than-hip  stars have begun seeking out the show because they believe Hall can bring out  "a lighter side to the client" than other hosts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as both host and producer will tell you, Arsenio will do nothing but  concentrate on being Arsenio. "I honestly think Joan's (Rivers) failure was  based on the fact that they tried to change Joan, they tried to tone her down,"  Hall said. "I have to be Arsenio. I'm the best Arsenio there is."  </P> <P> "Sajak" head writer Monty Aidem believes that Sajak and Hall, both nice guys  from the Midwest, have just the right non-abrasive quality and ability to draw  out other people -- rather than simply go for a joke -- that makes viewers want  to welcome them into their homes on a nightly basis.  </P> <P> "All of the very successful talk-show hosts are Midwestern people, just like  Pat," mused Aidem, veteran of "The Tonight Show," "Thicke of The Night," and  Fox's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers." "That includes Johnny Carson and David  Letterman, and, gee, Dick Cavett, too.  </P> <P> "Those people wear well, you don't get tired of them quickly. It's a real solid  base to come from."  </P></p>

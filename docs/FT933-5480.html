			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Californian exodus THE state of California, a magnet for immigrants since the days of the gold rush, is experiencing an unprecedented exodus of residents leaving for other parts of the US, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. Job losses as a result of defence cuts are the driving force behind the population shift, state officials said in a report published this week by the state Department of Finance. Most of those leaving the state are from Southern California. According to the report as many as 600,000 people moved from California, during the fiscal year ending June 30, producing a net loss of 150,000 residents in the state. 'The economy is the driving force in these losses,' said Ms Mary Heim, a Department of Finance demographer. California lost almost 200,000 jobs in the last fiscal year, according to independent researchers. Domestic immigration is also down by 15 per cent in 1993, compared to 1992. However, California's population is expected to continue to grow as a result of births and immigration from other countries. At least 200,000 legal immigrants are expected this year, plus an estimated 100,000 illegal immigrants.</p>

In the region of Zavidocici and Zepca, central Bosnia,  antagonism between Moslem military and civilian authorities is  more marked, the sources added citing local Bosnian Croat  military sources.    Croatian refugees from Sarajevo are also giving accounts of  growing divisions among Moslems in that city and the rising  number of those who are now in favor of a political solution,  and not the continuation of war in Bosnia.    Serbian military sources report about continued Moslem-Croat  clashes in central Bosnia, especially in the region of Prozor,  Gornji Vakuf, Kiseljak and Zepca, as well as in the region of  Mostar, in the south-west of that former Yugoslav republic.    In attacks of Croatian forces on parts of Mostar under  Moslem  control one civilian was killed and seven were wounded in the  last 24 hours, Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported on Tuesday.    At the same time, Croatian military sources claim that 15  civilians were wounded on Monday in the part of Mostar under  Croatian control.    Despite heavy casualties, the Moslem army continued its  offensive in the region of Zepce, the Zagreb-based Croatian  Radio reported.    In the region of Sarajevo, Moslem forces continued attacks  on  the Serbian parts of the city, targetting especially [word  indistinct], Grbavica, Lukavica, Nedzarici and Ilidza, Serbian  military sources added.    Serbian positions in northern Bosnia, in the region of  Doboj,  the mountains of Ozren and Teslici, were also targetted by  Moslems.    Moslem forces continued with their armed provocations of the  Serbian side from the direction of Olovo, Kladanj and Kalesija  (north-east Bosnia), as well as from the eastern Bosnian enclave  of Gorazde -- a zone under U.N. protection.</p>

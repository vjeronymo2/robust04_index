WATERWAY  </P> <P> About 10,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from a punctured barge early Wednesday  into a heavily industrialized waterway between New York's Staten Island and New  Jersey, the Coast Guard reported.  </P> <P> The spill at the GATX terminal on the Arthur Kill, site of about half a dozen  spills this year, was reported by workers on the barge owned by Victoria  Transportation of Elizabeth, the guard said.  </P> <P> Workers had been pumping unleaded gasoline onto the barge for several hours  before realizing there was a hole beneath the water line, said George Lowman, a  spokesman for GATX.  </P> <P> The waterway was reopened after about five hours when most of the gasoline had  either evaporated or dispersed.  </P></p>

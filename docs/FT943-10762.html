			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Fighting talk as NatWest advances 83%: Response to price cuts - Profits reach Pounds 767m / Interim dividend up 14% National Westminster Bank yesterday said it would fight to protect its share of lending amid growing competition, and indicated that it would respond to rivals' price cuts. The pugnacious comments accompanied the disclosure of an 83 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 767m, against Pounds 419m, driven by a big fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. NatWest, the UK's second largest bank, responded to discontent over its 6 per cent increase in total dividend last year by raising the interim payout 14 per cent to 7.3p (6.4p). Lord Alexander, chairman, said this showed 'confidence in the future'. The shares gained 17p to 470p. Slack demand led to customer loans and advances falling to Pounds 81.7bn from Pounds 85.7bn in June 1993. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive, said there were signs of demand picking up, but the bank faced strong competition. 'Parts of the UK market are very difficult. We have got a strong market share and we do not intend to lose it,' he said. He indicated that NatWest might respond to Abbey National's cut in authorised overdraft lending rates. Bad debt provisions fell to Pounds 370m from Pounds 643m. Provisions in UK branch banking more than halved to Pounds 216m, with those for medium-sized companies falling 58 per cent and for small companies, 57 per cent. But operating income was flat at Pounds 3.45bn, against Pounds 3.47bn. In addition to pressure on branch earnings, profits at NatWest Markets, its corporate and investment banking arm, fell to Pounds 201m, against Pounds 256m, in poorer trading conditions. Although it suffered from bond price falls, this was partly offset by higher equity volume. Securities trading income fell to Pounds 67m (Pounds 76m). Mr Wanless said the figure was quite stable because it mostly traded on behalf of customers. NatWest met its target of 17.5 per cent return on equity for the first time since 1988, with an annualised return of 18.1 per cent. Mr Richard Goeltz, chief financial officer, said all its arms earned 'close to an appropriate rate of return'. It achieved a 6 per cent tier 1 ratio of core capital - mostly equity and retained earnings - to risk-weighted assets. Lord Alexander said the bank now had 'robust capital ratios' which would allow it to grow. Expenses rose slightly to Pounds 2.33bn (Pounds 2.24bn), and the ratio of cost to income rose from 64.6 to 67.6 per cent. Profits at NatWest Bancorp, the US retail bank, rose 30 per cent to Pounds 117m, while those of Lombard, the finance arm, rose 59 per cent to Pounds 111m. European operations lost Pounds 5m. Net asset value per ordinary share rose to 338p (322p) and earnings per share to 30p, against 12p. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Much less specific information is available concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions resulting from general aviation activity than is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for commercial and military aircraft operations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA collects some information on general aviation operations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airports with FAA-operated (or contractor-operated) control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towers, but these data are not comprehensive, and do not capture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations occurring at non-tower-controlled facilities. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, the lack of data specifically addressing general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation operations by type of aircraft makes an accurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of the emissions from this source more difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Overall Control Strategy. Although general aviation operations represent a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraction of total emissions in most FIP areas, EPA is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include this source in the FIP control strategy along with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial and military aircraft operations as part of the broad,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive control scheme for these areas. As described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below, developing an effective comprehensive control strategy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this source, and effectively administering it, is an especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenging task due to the diverse aircraft types and usage, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> great number of individual owners/operators, and the large number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of airfields in each most FIP areas. Nonetheless, if this source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were excluded from the FIP, the potential reductions from this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category would have to be achieved from another source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal would establish an operations fee to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions from general aviation activity during the ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> season in each FIP area. The Agency intends that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach provide the same level of benefits as the emission cap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for stationary sources in each of the FIP areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See section III.D.4.e.(2)(a)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), above, for the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage reductions.) Comments are also requested on three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative control schemes. EPA has chosen not to apply a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive emission cap to this source because the significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data requirements and level of EPA involvement in such a program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make that strategy impractical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the proposed strategy, EPA notes that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear to be few, if any, regulatory options for innovatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing emissions from general aviation aircraft, given the age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and emissions performance of the general aviation fleet, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic status of the general aviation industry. Unlike many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other sources, improving the emissions performance of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft through new, industry-wide emission standards is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problematic. Even if cleaner engines could be made available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general aviation fleet is unlikely to experience significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction of cleaner alternatives, since fleet turnover is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively low (sales of general aviation aircraft in fact have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declined in the past several years).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is not to suggest that emission benefits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unavailable through the careful selection of aircraft/engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combinations or the possible limited introduction of new models  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the future. Rather, there are no substantially cleaner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives to current technology engines for the vast majority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the fleet. Therefore, the strategies that rely on turnover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cleaner technologies are unavailable in this instance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operational and procedural measures such as reduced-power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takeoffs and direct routing from hardstand to runway also would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be difficult to implement for general aviation on an area-wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, given the widely varying aircraft and facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics found amongst general aviation operations. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures also offer little opportunity for emission reduction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to minimal congestion at most general aviation airports,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short taxi distances, and relatively low power-range engines. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result, the only available measures that would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant emission benefits appear to involve activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The diverse and diffuse nature of general aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations creates significant obstacles for any emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. General aviation aircraft and the facilities at which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they operate are controlled by a large and varied group of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and organizations. General aviation operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically occur on a highly variable schedule and many operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can occur at completely uncontrolled airports. Despite these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulties, EPA believes that an emission reduction program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general aviation could be implemented. The specific proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control measures and alternatives discussed below reflect varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degrees of direct EPA involvement and participation by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general aviation community, with resultant variation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certainty of obtaining emissions reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The control strategy applies to general aviation aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated at commercial airports as well as those operated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public and private general aviation facilities. It does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to civilian general aviation aircraft operations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military bases; these are included in the military control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically requested on the need to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from general aviation in each area based on local air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality concerns, given the potential difficulty and likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource-intensive nature of administering an effective program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Key Regulatory Elements. The EPA proposes an operations fee program to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from general aviation activity. By implementing a fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, EPA can avoid establishing direct allocation of landing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slots for general aviation as discussed later in this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby maintaining the flexibility that is desirable for general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

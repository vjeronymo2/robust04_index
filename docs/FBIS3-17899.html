Dubnov on news conference </F> given by LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the State Duma on  29 March; from the "Vesti" newscast; Zhirinovskiy remarks  recorded]    [Text] [Video shows Zhirinovskiy holding news conference]  [Dubnov] In the State Duma building today a news conference by  the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader took place  which was devoted to the 5th Congress of the Liberal Democrats  opening on 2 April. After declaring categorically that this  would be the congress of the party whose line was no less than  the whole of our people had chosen, Mr. Zhirinovskiy went on to  boast about the two main victories of his party. The first was  the amnesty:    [Zhirinovskiy] We were the main instrument for passing the  amnesty. The political amnesty in the first place. The  initiative for a criminal amnesty did not come from us.    [Dubnov, over Zhirinovskiy's voice] There is now someone we  can thank for the greatest event in the history of the Russian  parliament of the end of the 20th century, as Vladimir Volfovich  put it. Although we will note that any criminal can now claim  that he committed a crime at that moment for political reasons  -- both the sniper who fired into the crowd and the marauder who  robbed a savings bank. The second mighty victory of the LDPR  lies in the fact that, in the words of its leader, the party has  averted war in Serbia by announcing to those countries whose  pilots were getting ready to bomb Serbian troops that return  bomb strikes would be carried out against their capitals.  Getting more and more worked up, Mr. Zhirinovskiy once again  confirmed his readiness to defend the rights of Russians in the  Near Abroad using highly unambiguous methods.    [Zhirinovskiy] We will respond with such a terrible blow  that  these peoples will forget what civilization means. There will  be a scorched desert there.    [Dubnov] We can now put a question to the law enforcement  agencies -- does this outburst come under the article on appeals  to war and arousing interethnic strife?</p>

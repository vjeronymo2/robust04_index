			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS Report: "Forecast from Vienna: Better Times Will </F> Have to Wait"]    [Text] After the catastrophic year of 1993 for the economic  development of the CIS countries, tne coming year will also not  bring a significant improvement in the situation of a majority  of the republics, according to experts from the Vienna Institute  for Comparative Analysis of the World Economy.    In the report published here on the results of research they  carried out, it is noted that the decrease of Russia's gross  national product, which was 12 percent last year, will slow  somewhat and will comprise 7 percent. The average level of  inflation will drop from 880 percent in 1993 to 500 percent.    As for the other countries of the CIS, they can expect a  larger economic slump than last year. One of the reasons for  this, in the opinion of the institute's specialists, is the cut  in deliveries of raw materials and energy from Russia, which  will lead to growth in prices and acceleration in inflation. As  it is noted in the report, in 1993 the general volume of gross  national product in the CIS countries dropped 10 percent and the  output of industrial prodcution decreased 14 percent. The  average level of inflation comprised 1,450 percent.    According to results of last year, the decrease in gross  national product in Ukraine comprised 15 percent; in Belorussia  [Belarus]--9 percent; in Moldavia [Moldova]--4 percent; in  Uzbekistan--3.5 percent; in Kazakhstan--13 percent; in  Kirghiziya [Kyrgyzstan]--13.4 percent; in Tajikistan--21  percent; in Armenia-- 9.9 percent; and in Azerbaijan--13.3  percent. Positive results were noted only in Turkmenistan,  where growth in GNP comprised 7.8 percent.    The situation in the labor market looks somewhat better in  the CIS countries than in other states of East Europe. However,  the reason for this, in the experts' opinion, is because of the  very slow formation of the structure of a market economy. As a  result, as in the past a large number of inefficient jobs are  maintained at enterprises. According to official data, there  are almost 1.2 million unemployed people in the CIS countries.  But hidden unemployment is much higher because many people are  on unpaid or partially paid leave.    As a whole for the 1990-1993 period, according to data from  the institute, the volume of industrial production in the CIS  countries decreased almost 40 percent. This is more than during  the U.S. "Great Depression" of the 1930s.</p>

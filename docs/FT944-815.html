			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Moscow purges rumoured as Grozny battle rages on Evidence of upheavals within the Russian government emerged yesterday as reports of resignations and a purge of top military commanders were denied by the defence ministry and fierce fighting continued around the Chechen capital of Grozny. President Boris Yeltsin announced he would shortly present a solution to the Chechen crisis 'based mainly on using political methods'. But on the ground the Russian military continued its 12-day-old assault, switching for the first time to daylight bombing raids on selected targets in Grozny. Correspondents remaining in the city reported at least 20 people killed, including a US photographer, as bombs and rockets hit blocks of flats and, in one case, a crowd clearing away the debris of a previous bomb. In Chechnya, a defiant President Dzhokar Dudayev issued a televised appeal for a holy war to fight 'the satanic methods of Russia'. A report that six generals had been dismissed - including the entire top leadership of the north Caucasus army group and Colonel General Georgy Kondratyev, the deputy defence minister, for 'indecision and inaction' - was carried by the RIA-Novosti, the state-owned press service. Citing 'an informed source', the report said General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, was taking personal command of the operation. The report was later denied by the ministry of defence. Separately, Mr Sergei Yushenkov, the chairman of the Duma (lower house) defence committee, announced to reporters that General Eduard Vorobyev, deputy commander of Russian land forces, had resigned because he disagreed with the conduct of the war. Unofficial sources said Gen Vorobyev had been asked to take over command of the Chechnya operation, and chose to step down instead. The same sources last night said the likely explanation for the flurry of announcements and denials was that the generals' letters of resignation had not been officially registered or accepted. Curiously, the resignation announcements did not include that of General Ivan Babichev, the divisional commander in Chechnya who has refused to move his division closer to Grozny. Mr Yeltsin wrote a letter to the Duma, suggesting that he would seek a political solution to the Chechen crisis in the form of an appeal to Russian citizens. Several influential figures, including Mr Sergei Kovalev, his representative on human rights, urged Mr Yeltsin to hold out the possibility of negotiations once more.

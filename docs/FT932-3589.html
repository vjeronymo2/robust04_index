			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Israel approves free trade zone Israel's cabinet yesterday approved plans to establish a private sector free trade zone to stimulate foreign investment and create jobs, Julian Ozanne writes from Jerusalem. Investors in the zone, to be sited either in the Galilee or the Negev desert, will be granted a 20-year income tax holiday and indefinite exemption from customs duties and import-taxes. Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, promised that the free trade zone, the country's first, will create thousands of jobs for an economy with an unemployment rate of 10.6 per cent. The finance minister also said yesterday that the scheme was designed particularly to attract US and other foreign companies which have complained about excessive bureaucratic red-tape for new foreign investors in Israel.</p>

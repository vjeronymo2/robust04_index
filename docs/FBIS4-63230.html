			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Biryukov] </F>   [Text] Kaliningrad May 19 TASS -- Visiting Swedish Foreign  Minister Margaretha af Ugglas has expressed concern about high  concentration of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region,  Russian enclave bordering on Poland, Lithuania and Estonia.    "Kaliningrad may become an important link in developing  cooperation both in the Baltic Sea region and with Russia," said  Ugglas, who made a one-day trip across the Kaliningrad region on  Thursday.    Ugglas became the first foreign foreign minister to visit  the  region since the Second World War.    She met with Yuriy Matochkin, head of the regional  administration, and held a news conference. She declared for  constructing a transbaltic highway and some facilities for  environmental protection here, developing cooperation between  the twin cities and in the field of arts and science.    "Sweden belongs to those countries which strive to involve  Kaliningrad in practical cooperation between the countries of  the baltic sea region. I intend to discuss it with Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in a week's time, at the meeting  of foreign ministers of the Baltic Sea region in Tallinn," she  emphasized.    According to her, Sweden has alloted two million Swedish  Kronas to fund an international research into the economy of the  Kaliningrad region with a view to attracting foreign investments.    The Swedish foreign minister left Kaliningrad for Stockholm  on Thursday.</p>

The operation, based in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, has a workforce of 850 and an annual turnover of around Pounds 53m. The main products of the new company, to be called Automotive Components Dunstable, are windscreen wiper motor assemblies. Its main customer is GM Europe (Opel/Vauxhall), which accounts for around 56 per cent of its turnover, but it also supplies Rover, Toyota, Nissan and Honda car plants in the UK as well as several truck producers in Europe.

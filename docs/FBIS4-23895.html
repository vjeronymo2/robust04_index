			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan Interim President  Theodore Sindikubwabo stated today in Kinshasa that there were  no "militiamen" in Rwanda, but rather "resistance fighters"  fighting invaders.    One of his advisers also stated at a press luncheon that  what  "the Western media are calling militia," comprise "resistance  forces, like the one in France, which just celebrated the 50th  anniversary of its liberation."    Mr. Sindikubwabo, the ministers of foreign affairs and  health  who accompanied him, and several advisers, stated that Rwanda  was the victim "of Ugandan aggression," which according to them,  is supporting and arming the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF, Tutsi  minority rebels). They also accused "certain Western press" of  taking only the viewpoint of the RPF into account.    The participants also said Belgian troops from the United  Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) were present at  Kigali airport during the 6 April attack on the plane carrying  the Rwandan and Burundian presidents.    "Kigali airport was in the hands of UNAMIR and other  elements, most of whom were Belgian troops," Mr. Sindikubwabo  stated. He pointed out that the aircraft's black box "could not  be found by the Belgian troops, and that it was not in the hands  of the UNAMIR," without giving further details. Mr.  Sindikubwabo and his delegation, who were on their way back from  the OAU summit in Tunis, also expressed satisfaction with that  meeting, as well as their desire to see the establishment of "a  frank and sincere dialogue" with the RPF, so as to find a  "political compromise" to the Rwandan situation.</p>

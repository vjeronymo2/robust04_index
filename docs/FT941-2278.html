			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Technology: Smart move on fraud Smart cards, with chips rather than magnetic strips in the plastic, have yet to make much of a mark outside Europe, but China and India are giving them a close look as ways of checking identities and preventing fraud. Sempac, a small Swiss company, hopes to benefit from trends in both markets, as well as in Japan where smart cards are being considered as a replacement for magnetic cards in making telephone calls. Based on the methods developed by Esec, its parent, to make semiconductor equipment, Sempac produces a line of machines which have introduced a new technology into smart card manufacture. Its process enables cards to be printed and have chips embedded in one step. Willi Truckenbrod, Sempac's vice-president for marketing, says manufacturing costs can be cut by up to 50 per cent. This is because its system uses four machines instead of the eight or more in other techniques, though the Sempac output of 700 or more cards an hour is less than in rival systems. The main technologies used for smart cards are: the lamination of several layers, with the chip module then placed into cavities; processing of cards in large sheets with the cavities milled into the card; and cards with pre-moulded cavities. Sempac's process uses semiconductor assembly technology with injection moulding machinery. Truckenbrod says some 300m smart cards are now produced a year, which is expected to rise rapidly to 1bn, mainly in Europe. Its customers include Rexroth Electronic of Germany, which has ordered an assembly line to make forgery-proof cards in which colour photographs and computerised data are printed on to the plastic. Sempac has held talks with the Chinese who are thinking off issuing smart identity cards to Hong Kong inhabitants when they take over there in 1997.</p>

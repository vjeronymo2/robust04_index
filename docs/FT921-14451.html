			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Market stays calm as coffee-shop ethos put at risk - Sampling the atmosphere during a historic day FOR all the high-tech 20th-century facade of the Lloyd's insurance market, the heart and soul of the business remains as it was 300 years ago - a bunch of guys meeting in a coffee shop. The clubby ethos has remained impervious to the sweeping changes that have turned London's other financial exchanges upside down. 'We're trying to catch up on 300 years of business,' said Mr Reg Brown, underwriter at RE Brown syndicate. 'Up until now, Lloyd's syndicates haven't regarded themselves as businesses.' Unlike the sometimes frenzied trading floors of the world's leading equities and commodities exchanges, Lloyd's on a busy day consists of dark-suited brokers patiently lining up at underwriters' 'boxes'. Even on the day of the market's greatest single disaster - the destruction of the Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea - unflappable brokers went about business in the usual fashion. Yesterday, as one of the biggest reform packages ever proposed was announced, business proceeded as usual. Early in the day, syndicate heads and senior officials were called to a briefing, leaving underlings to rely on the rumour mill for information. 'We're waiting to read it in the papers tomorrow,' said a clerk at one underwriting syndicate. Seated or kneeling, brokers daily bargain with underwriters, hoping to persuade them to accept a portion of risk in return for the smallest possible fee. Oil rigs, satellites, ships and international trade transactions are all assets that can be destroyed at any time, causing devastating losses for owners. Underwriters bear those losses if they occur and charge a fee for their risk. Recent losses have been so great that 20 per cent of Names are pulling out of the market, so underwriters and brokers yesterday hoped the proposed reforms would reverse the loss of capital. But long-time members remain cynical. 'Do you know the best way to stop the haemorrhage of Names? Make a profit for them,' said one underwriter, whose view was echoed around the market. 'Nobody was screaming for reform when everyone was making a profit.' Overall, there was relief at the proposed cap to be placed on the personal liability of Names, who now may risk all their personal wealth. 'For unlimited liability, they should be getting a 25 per cent return on their money every year,' said one underwriter. 'They've only been getting 10 per cent and you can get that out of the stock market.' People in the market used to think they were 'bomb-proof', Mr Brown said, but the market was finally taking a more businesslike view of itself. 'I have always said to my lads: 'We're nothing more than a sweet shop.' If we don't open up in the morning, we don't sell sweets. If we don't sell sweets, we don't make a profit.' And the 'lads' at Lloyd's are getting the message. For all its significance in the world's insurance business, however, the revolution of the 1980s appears to have touched Lloyd's little in many key ways. For example, the number of female underwriters can be counted on one hand.</p>

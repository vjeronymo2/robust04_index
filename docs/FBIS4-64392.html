			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich -- Prior to the legal discussion procedure  about the planned new research reactor in Garching near Munich,  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens  confirmed their criticism of the project involving 525 million  German marks. A group of SPD politicians, including Bundestag  members Peter Glotz and Otto Schily, criticized in Munich today,  above all, the planned use of highly enriched uranium that can  also be used for the construction of nuclear weapons. This is  in contradiction with worldwide efforts to curb the  proliferation of this substance, the critics stressed before  tomorrow's start of the procedure.    For the operation of the new research reactor, a fuel rod  requirement of 40 kg highly enriched uranium per year is  expected. In fact, the operation of the reactor with fuel rods  from uranium silicide does not pose any direct risk of  proliferation, the SPD declared. However, there is a danger  that the resulting demand might contribute to a worldwide trade  in highly enriched uranium.    The new reactor is to replace the old research reactor of  the  Munich Technical University -- the "nuclear egg of Garching."  After 36 years of operation, the old reactor no longer meets  the requirements of modern research for a neutron source.</p>

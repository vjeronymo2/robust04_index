			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Brussels officials clash on state aid to airlines A fragile consensus inside the European Commission snapped yesterday as two senior commissioners disagreed in public over newly agreed guidelines on state aid to Europe's troubled airlines. The rift emerged after Mr Marcelino Oreja, outgoing Spanish transport commissioner, suggested that state bail-outs could be justified in exceptional circumstances, such as currency devaluations or a war. Mr Karel Van Miert, Belgian commissioner responsible for competition policy, rejected Mr Oreja's statement on currency devaluations as incompatible with guidelines agreed hours earlier by the full 17-member Commission. 'This is not a correct interpretation,' he said. The clash raises questions about the credibility of the guidelines, which are intended to serve as justification for the recent approval of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in state aid to Air France and as a reference for future aid cases. Consideration of currency devaluations in state aid cases would be highly controversial. It would favour airlines from countries with weaker currencies, such as Olympic of Greece. The debate about the tightness with which rules on state aid should be drawn has intensified in Europe after British Airways and other European airlines in the private sector mounted a legal challenge to the Commission's decision last summer to approve the Air France aid. Yesterday's clash represented a dress rehearsal for the battle in Brussels over whether to approve new state aid for Iberia, the Spanish national carrier, which may seek up to Dollars 1bn as part of a new restructuring package. Spanish officials are privately furious that Mr Van Miert pre-emptively ruled out a new state aid package for Iberia last week - ahead of any such request. This week, Mr Van Miert succeeded in strengthening the eight new Commission guidelines on state aid. In future, airlines may expect Commission approval only 'under exceptional circumstances, unforeseeable and external to the company'. A Brussels official explained that the new version was in line with the 'one time, last time' policy on state aid which underpins efforts in Brussels to liberalise the airline industry by 1997. 'Exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances means earthquakes or a stock market collapse,' the official explained. Mr Oreja told a news conference in Strasbourg that the Treaty of Rome clearly provided for state aid, adding assistance could be justified if it was vital to restore the airline to financial viability and resulted from 'circumstances beyond the company's control' - including war or sudden currency devaluation. Mr Oreja predicted that the Commission would become progressively tougher on applications for state aid as competition increased in the wake of further air transport liberalisation in 1997.</p>

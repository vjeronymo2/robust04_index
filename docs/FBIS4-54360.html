			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry is  inclined to adopt income tax cuts three years before an  offsetting consumption tax hike in line with a U.S. demand, a  ministry report suggested Friday [27 May].    The report, submitted to the government's advisory panel,  estimates net revenues in fiscal 2000, after the 6.2 trillion  yen tax cuts are extended and the current 3 percent consumption  tax is hiked to 7 percent to 10 percent from April 1997.    This represents a three-year lag until a future tax raise  from already implemented tax cuts, which include 5.5 trillion  yen in income and resident taxes, that are limited to the  current fiscal year.    The ministry also called for net revenue increases beyond a  consumption tax increase to 6 percent to cover the tax cuts, in  order to fund heavier welfare burdens amid a graying society.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently said the  United States would endorse Japan's plan to link tax cuts with  offsetting indirect tax hikes if the two measures are separated  by at least three years.    The report will be a key reference for the tax commission,  an  advisory panel to the prime minister. It is scheduled to issue  its proposals by the end of June, by which time Japan promised  in its March market-open package to detail full-fledged tax  reform.    Based on the panel's proposals, the government and the  ruling  coalition parties are to decide on reform, but uncertainties  remain amid the yet-fluid political situation for the coalition  parties holding minority Diet seats.    The ministry's report also poses various problems for the  panel to use without further reviewing. The tax forum is to  draft alternatives with concrete figures for presentation at  regional hearings in early June.    The estimates exclude possible effects from fiscal and  administrative reform and expected "natural" tax revenue  increases despite the panel's intent to factor them into its  alternatives.    Based on a 7 percent consumption tax, the report estimates a  net tax revenue increase of 2 trillion yen in fiscal 2000.  However, a revenue shortfall of 5.3 trillion yen results when  1.8 trillion yen in funds to repay "bridge" bonds and 5.5  trillion yen in increased welfare spending are included.    The "bridge" bonds are debts to finance the advance tax  cuts,  and the ministry wants to clear them in 10 years. Welfare  spending is based on a 21st century welfare vision issued in  March by an advisory panel to the Health and Welfare Ministry.    A plan proposed in February by then Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa would have replaced the 3 percent consumption tax with  a 7 percent "national welfare" tax.    The ministry sees a revenue surplus only with the 10 percent  model, which would generate 700 billion yen.    Although not included in the models, the report estimates a  "natural" increase in tax revenues of 2.8 trillion yen to 3.0  trillion yen based on a revenue elasticity rate of 1.1 and a  nominal economic growth rate of 5 percent.    The ministry report noted that the government must secure  funds for a planned increase in the amount of the 10-year, 430  trillion yen plan in public works spending started in fiscal  1991. Japan also pledged in its March package to decide on the  boost by the end of June.</p>

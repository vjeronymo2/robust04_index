			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Minister proclaims innocence Mr Gerard Longuet (left), France's trade and industry minister, said yesterday he was 'astonished' and 'a little disconcerted' at a judge's move to widen an investigation into his Republican Party's finances by probing into Mr Longuet's own property purchases. Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, a judge in Brittany who has also pursued irregularities in the Socialist party's funding, has been investigating a 1988 commission of FFr4.4m (Pounds 510,000) from Pont-a-Mousson, a pipe-making company based in Mr Longuet's home region of Lorraine, which allegedly reached an RP councillor in Nantes via the Swiss bank account of a local industrialist. Mr Longuet, who was national treasurer of the RP at the time, confirmed yesterday that the judge was trying to find out whether any of the Pont-a-Mousson money ended up in Mr Longuet's properties in Paris and the south of France. Mr Longuet, who yesterday said he had 'all the serenity of someone who is on the right side of the law and the tax authorities,' has been tipped to succeed Mr Edouard Balladur as prime minister if the latter becomes president.</p>

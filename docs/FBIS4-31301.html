			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by correspondent </F> Lucie Weissova in Prague on 7 June--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Weissova] Mr. Prime Minister, in the past few  days we were able to follow the impressive celebrations of the  50th anniversary of the Allies' landing in Normandy. The  celebrations were, however, not without blemishes. The greatest  and most criticized fault was probably the failure to invite  representatives of Russia. Is the importance of opening the  second front overrated, at the expense of the role the USSR  played in the war?    [Klaus] Look, I do not want to comment on absolutely  everything because, if I do, I am most often criticized from all  sides. I am, therefore, speaking with some embarrassment.  Nevertheless, I have been living for decades in a world where I  thought--I am overstating this slightly--that it was only the  Red Army that fought in World War II and that the war in the  West was only a shadow war that was utterly irrelevant with  regard to the final result of the war. Naturally, I knew that  this was nonsense. If, however, the impression is now being  made that the exact opposite was true, then I am, in principle,  against this sort of interpretation of history that swings from  one extreme to the other. It really seems to me to be  substantially false. [passage omitted]    [Weissova] On 6 June, the Civic Democratic Party [ODS]  executive, among other things, dealt with the proposal for new  parliamentary procedures. The ODS cabinet members have been  authorized to try to ensure that there is no change in the  relations between the government and parliament. According to  you, some proposals for the new parliamentary procedure seem to  go in this direction. Can you specify what they are?    [Klaus] [passage omitted] What I am really concerned about  is  the fact that a specific interruption has occurred in the  interaction between the government and parliament. We have  grown accustomed to certain methods of interaction. They became  a habit. We have--all of us--mastered these methods to some  extent. It seems somewhat useless to pull them down.    The interaction between the government and parliament is a  process triggered by the government putting forward an idea and  embodying it in a so-called proposal of principles for a  particular law. This is not a fully worked out document.  Really, it contains only rough ideas, concepts by which we tell  ourselves and the parliament that this is probably the way and  these are the basic outlines of the law. Parliament,  parliamentary committees, discuss this material. The government  then is given back the document, and the bill is then drafted on  this basis. After this stage, the document will be submitted to  parliament again.    It seems to me that this ping-pong, this interaction, is  successful. Moreover, we have grown accustomed to it, and I  think that it is working error free.    The stage of debating main ideas of a bill is now  disappearing from the new procedures, and the government is  being asked to submit a bill directly. This means that the  dispute, the debate, the mutual enrichment while working on the  bill will be missing. I consider this to be a specific  weakening of the mutual relations between the government and  parliament. [passage omitted]</p>

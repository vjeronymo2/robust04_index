			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;38&hyph;AD,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Netherlands, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that operators have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported several incidents in which the flight crew did not depress both halves of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> autopilot disconnect switch during the LAND 2 or LAND 3 approach and, as a result, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> autopilot remained engaged. Although certain aural warnings sounded and visual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicators illuminated in these situations, the flight crew still believed that both autopilots  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had been disconnected. Consequently, unanticipated movements of the stabilizer trim and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher than anticipated control forces of the flight controls occurred. Inadvertent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disconnection of only one autopilot when both autopilots are engaged could result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unanticipated control surface movements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;22&hyph;020, dated September 25, 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that describes procedures for replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified units. Installation of the modified units will ensure that if one-half of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> autopilot disconnect switch is depressed, both autopilots will disengage; in addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system will remain separated. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive 90&hyph;112(A), dated October 15, 1990, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with modified units. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts would cost approximately $2,500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55,860, or $2,940 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

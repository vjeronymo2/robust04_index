			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Technology: Warm, smug and green all over - Technically Speaking When my family and I bought our dream home in south London earlier this year we never considered the environmental responsibilities we would be taking on. We soon had to. Our problems started when it emerged that the central heating system had all but packed up. We decided to investigate the financial and environmental implications of repairing or replacing it, and asked for advice from the National Energy Foundation. Its aim is to promote energy efficiency and it runs a National Home Energy Rating Scheme which marks homes out of one to 10. Our house scored only three. Worse still, heating and lighting the house entailed pumping out 34.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year into the atmosphere. The annual cost to us of inflicting this environmental catastrophe on an unsuspecting world was gas and electricity bills of Pounds 1,820 a year. Something had to be done. Our assessor, Vic Harrison, suggested nine areas for action, some more helpful than others. We decided, for example, to dispense with his suggestion for installing new timber softwood for double glazing. I am all for improving the environment but I draw the line at a suggestion that this would cost Pounds 8,200 and take 222.2 years to pay for itself in saved heating costs. Among Harrison's more useful suggestions was replacing the house's standard light bulbs with the low-energy type now available in the high street. He estimated that an initial outlay of Pounds 75 would save Pounds 22 a year; we started our energy-efficiency campaign by replacing two of them. The new bulbs are not pretty and they take a few seconds to warm up but we are getting used to them. But the impressive savings would apparently come from replacing our old boiler with a gas condenser. This works by using a second heat exchanger to recapture most of the heat normally wasted through the flue. Harrison reckoned its installation would move our home energy rating up from three to 4.5 at a stroke. It would take just 5.5 years for us to recoup the Pounds 2,300 cost of the boiler. Normally the idea of finding Pounds 2,300 would have stopped us from proceeding further but, since we needed to fix the heating whatever happened, we decided to investigate. The problem is that most heating engineers and plumbers seem to have developed an aversion to gas condenser boilers, in part because of problems with installing them when they first came on to the market. In any case, several engineers assured me that there was no condenser boiler which was large enough to fit our six-bedroom house. (I should point out that the house is run-down and does not signify large amounts of wealth of the type which make finding Pounds 2,300 easy.) My inquiries eventually led me to the Heating and Ventilating Contractors Association which advised me that there was at least one make of boiler, Yorkpark, which would suit my house. But had I considered a smaller two-boiler system? Armed with this information I eventually found two engineers willing to give me quotes, one for the Yorkpark, the other for a system using two Glow worm boilers. Their prices? Pounds 7,200 and Pounds 6,400. The main difference between their quotes and Harrison's original estimate of Pounds 2,300 was that the current system had been so badly set up that the whole thing needed renewing, pipes and all. The quotes also included extending the heating to the top floor of the house with four new radiators. After days of anguished deliberation in increasingly cold surroundings, we eventually plumped for the two-boiler system which worked out at Pounds 6,200 thanks to a Pounds 200 energy-saving grant from the government. The result is a beautifully warm house and an ever so slightly smug feeling that we have chosen the environmentally correct route. The rest of the light bulbs will have to wait.</p>

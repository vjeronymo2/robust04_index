			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Zedillo promises fresh drive for peace: Foreign-trained economists extend grip in Mexico Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the new president of Mexico, yesterday promised to open new negotiations with armed rebels in the troubled southern state of Chiapas and pledged the armed forces would maintain their unilateral ceasefire in the conflict. 'There will be no violence from the government and I trust there will be none from those who have dissented,' said Mr Zedillo in his inauguration speech after he received the traditional red, white and green presidential sash and a big bear hug from outgoing president Carlos Salinas. Mr Zedillo also announced he would introduce constitutional amendments 'as the first step to deeply reforming' Mexico's 'very deficient' judicial system. The president dedicated much of his 45-minute speech to attacking corruption and impunity from prosecution. He promised to lead a government whose guiding principle would be 'the rule of law.' One of the government's first judicial commitments would be to 'fully clarify' the assassinations this year of the ruling party's first presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio and party secretary general Mr Francisco Ruiz Massieu. While economic growth and income redistribution would be a priority, Mr Zedillo stressed he would maintain 'strict discipline on prices,' arguing that growth with inflation would 'destroy' the successful structural changes undertaken under Mr Salinas. Nevertheless, Mr Salinas was indirectly criticised, as Mr Zedillo painted a stark picture of the political, economic and social problems he was inheriting. On political reform, Mr Zedillo said he would work to make the 1997 mid-term elections unquestionable by working for a 'definitive' political reform, including party financing and spending, media access and autonomy of the electoral authorities. Mr Zedillo's cabinet, announced on Wednesday, shows foreign-trained economists who rose to prominence under Mr Salinas extending their grip. Overall 13 of the 19 principal cabinet ministers have post-graduate degrees from foreign universities. Many, including Mr Guillermo Ortiz at communications and transport and the president's chief of staff Mr Luis Tellez, have economics PhDs from leading US universities. So do two prominent non-cabinet members, Mr Carlos Ruiz and Mr Rogelio Gasca, new heads of Petroleos Mexicanos and the Federal Electricity Commission respectively. The proliferation of technocrats, committed to free market economic reforms, has led to criticism that the cabinet lacks political experience, and is too narrow in its background. Some observers predicted that old-guard politicians left out of the government by Mr Zedillo, who himself has an economics PhD from Yale University, may cause trouble down the road. The decision to break with tradition and select Mr Antonio Lozano, a member of the opposition, as Attorney-General, and to appoint two ministers (environment and health) with no party affiliation, was well received yesterday. However, the incorporation of Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the former president of the ruling party, who is alleged to have blocked the investigation into the assassination of Mr Ruiz Massieu was sharply criticised by the opposition. Another official allegedly involved in blocking the investigation, Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, was expected to be named president of the PRI tomorrow. Both officials vigorously deny the charges. Mr Ortiz, the former deputy finance minister, is likely to loosen further rules limiting private investment in public infrastructure in his new post. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> PERSONAL COOKING, ITALIAN-STYLE  </P> <P> What is Fama? A year ago, I thought I knew. It seemed to be a slightly  Frenchified idea of a Californianized version of an Italian restaurant.  </P> <P> And evidently a good idea, because this most disorienting of rooms -- full of  meticulously crafted blond-wood structures leaning at Expressionist angles --  was roaring. I mean, people were fighting to get in. (Well, it was roaring,  too, with all those sound-reflective surfaces.)  </P> <P> This had not been the original idea, though. Fama was planned as an Italian  restaurant, but Sally Fama is Hans Rockenwagner's wife, and the public  fervently expected impressive inventions of the sort they were used to at  Rockenwagner restaurant. Fama found itself obliged to serve things like trout  on saffron rice, scattered with giant capers and toasted almonds.  </P> <P> Since then, the wheeling cloud of restaurant first-nighters has moved on to  newer placesand Fama has sneakily reverted to its original plan: a personal  style of Italian cooking.  </P> <P> Many of the appetizers, at any rate, do have an Italian or Italian/Californian  aspect. The salad of sweet red and yellow tomatoes, sliced and dashed with  vinaigrette, is a tastefully simple celebration of these particularly sweet  tomatoes (vine-ripened, it says here very credibly). A "light style" eggplant  Parmesan made by grilling eggplant slices and heating them in tomato sauce with  some smoked mozzarella epitomizes the clever California-Italian style.  </P> <P> One of the successes of the old menu is still available, the eggplant mousse  surrounded by a pool of tomato sauce -- rather like fresh cream of tomato soup  -- with a flotilla of green gnocchi bobbing around. It seems as un-Italian to  me as it did last year, but it's still irresistible. The smoked trout salad,  with rather mild fresh horseradish sauce, and salad garnished with goat cheese  on toast are as California as you can get.  </P> <P> Fama makes all, but all, of its pasta fresh. This means even spaghettini -- and  very tasty spaghettini it is, though the fresh texture is a bit of a surprise,  something like Oriental pan-fried noodles. It comes mixed with sliced grilled  carrots, zucchini, onions, celery and sweet peppers, combining a lot of our  favorite things.  </P> <P> The other pastas cover an amazingly wide spectrum. The jalapeno rotellini are a  shocking bright green color and taste a bit peppery, but the overall impression  of this dish is of the rich cream sauce and the smokiness of the salmon mixed  with it. Shocking in their own way are the noodles with homemade Milano  sausage. They're in the old-fashioned hearty-Italian style, where tomato sauces  taste like sweet tomato paste.  </P> <P> The list of meat entrees is short, and the star is the exquisite, thin-sliced  baby Bodega salmon, which has an unusual delicacy of flavor. They tend to what  the West Side would call sober and traditional: lemony grilled ahi served with  a sort of tomato hash on the side, filet mignon with a wonderful grilled flavor  and an early-'80s green peppercorn cream sauce.  </P> <P> Sober is good. The big innovation here is breast of capon with red lentils --  an intriguingly tangy puree of red lentils, actually. But the capon itself is  chewy, practically rubbery.  </P> <P> The desserts are a little bit country, a little bit rock 'n' roll. The best is  the two scoops of intense chocolate mousse in a small sea of pureed hazelnuts  in cream. You can get fruit in a lively champagne zabaglione.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there's apple crisp and a soupy rice pudding much improved  by the addition of fresh pecans. The surprise is Mummy's two-layer cheesecake,  simply the old-fashioned sort with a sour-cream frosting layer, but  well-balanced and very fresh.  </P> <P> Fama is still loud and sort of disorienting. No matter (unless you really want  to carry on conversation). It was good before and it feels more sure of itself  this time around.  </P> <P>  Fama, 1416 4th St., Santa Monica, (213) 451-8633.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon automatic exercise of a capped option, the holder receives a cash settlement amount equal to the cap interval times the multiplier for the option. Under no circumstances, however, does the holder receive a cash settlement amount greater than the cap interval times the index multiplier. Therefore, the cap price establishes a maximum pre-defined value for the capped options. For example, if the index multiplier is 100, the index closes at 382 and the investor holds a capped call option with a strike price of 360 and a cap interval of 20, then the holder would receive a cash settlement amount equal to $2,000 (20 times $100). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Long capped call options closely resemble vertical bull spreads traded as a single security ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the combination of one long and one short call position with the same expiration but where the strike price of the short call is higher than the strike price of the long call). Conversely, long capped put options closely resemble vertical bear spreads traded as a single security ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the combination of one long put and one short put position with the same expiration, but where the strike price of the short put is lower than the strike price of the long put). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PSE has proposed the following rule changes to accommodate the trading of capped index options. First, the PSE plans to amend Exchange Rule 7.1, ``Definitions,'' to define ``capped-style option,'' ``capped-style index option.'' ``cap interval,'' and ``cap price.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 7.6, ``Position Limits,'' to provide that capped options will be aggregated with standard index option contracts on the same stock index for position limit purposes. However, the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 7.7, ``Exercise Limits,'' to provide that capped options will not be aggregated with standard option contracts on the same stock index when calculating exercise limits. This amendment is designed to avoid instances where an investor would violate exercise limits by virtue of the automatic exercise of the capped options, an event over which the investor has no control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.8, ``Terms of Options Contracts,'' to: (1) Indicate those indexes upon which capped options can be traded; (2) reflect that the cap interval for capped options, unless modified by the Exchange, shall be $20.00; (3) provide that initially, one at-the-money capped option call and put will be listed with an expiration of up to one year in the future and additional at-the-money capped option series may be listed every two months with expirations up to one year in the future; and (4) capped option series may be added to expiration months with three or more months remaining to their expiration, if there has been a move of ten or more points in the index value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 7.16, ``Margin,'' to provide the following margin treatment for short positions in capped options. For cash accounts, the customer must deposit an amount equal to the cap interval times the index multiplier in cash or cash equivalents as defined in Section 220.8(a)(3) of Regulation T under the Act. For margin accounts, the margin requirement is 100% of the current market value of the contract plus 15% of the current index value times the index multiplier. In each case, the amount shall be decreased by any excess of the aggregate exercise price of the option over the current index value as multiplied by the index multiplier in the case of a call, or any excess of the current index value as multiplied by the index multiplier over the aggregate exercise price of the option in the case of a put; provided, however, that the minimum margin required on each contract shall not be less than (a) the option market value plus 10% of the current index value multiplied by the index multiplier or (b) the cap interval multiplied by the index multiplier, whichever is less. The maximum margin required on each contract shall not exceed the cap interval multiplied by the index multiplier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

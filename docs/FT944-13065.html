			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Major snaps over tittle-tattle: Rumbold explains resignation and hits back at 'witch-hunt' Mr John Major angrily rejected allegations of ministerial impropriety yesterday and promised full co-operation with the director of public prosecutions' inquiries into claims that Mr Mohamed Fayed - the owner of Harrods - tried to blackmail the government. Clearly annoyed by a fresh controversy over the resignation from a lobbying firm of Dame Angela Rumbold, a Conservative party deputy chairman, Mr Major rebuked reporters who questioned him about her position during a visit to Wales. 'If you want to know about Angela's position, then you had better ask Angela,' he said. 'It is not a matter for me. I am not responsible for the headlines. I am not responsible for tittle-tattle.' Mr Major's outburst suggested that the strain of dealing with a week-long onslaught of allegations against ministers was taking its toll. But there was no sign of an end to the stream of accusations from opposition MPs. Dame Angela, MP for Mitcham and Morden, said she resigned as a director of Decision Makers to prevent the firm being 'dragged into some kind of unpleasant dogfight with the press'. Dame Angela, who had registered her interest in the firm, said the 'campaign of innuendo' against the government 'is becoming a quite unpleasant witch-hunt'. Labour claimed she had offered an 'inside track' to the company during its successful campaign to have a station on the proposed Channel tunnel high-speed rail line sited at a site owned by Blue Circle at Ebbsfleet, Kent. Mr Michel Meacher, shadow transport secretary, accused Dame Angela of 'hiring out her position and contacts' to businesses. Downing Street said Mr Major took no part in the Ebbsfleet decision. He met the Ebbsfleet campaigners only once, by accident at a social engagement. The Department of Transport said Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, had never met them. Mr John McGregor, transport secretary until July, was also said to have had no official meetings with the campaigners - but they did meet Mr Roger Freeman, then transport minister of state. Mr Major, who had hoped that his announcement of a standing committee chaired by Lord Nolan would stop the allegations of 'sleaze', said he would speak to the DPP about the blackmail allegations. Interviewed before his trip to Wales, Mr Major insisted: 'Nobody, whatever position they may hold, is above the law in this country.' He said he would also give evidence to the Nolan committee if it wished. Labour will table a Commons resolution on Monday requiring the privileges committee to sit mainly in public to hear allegations that two Conservative MPs were willing to take cash for tabling parliamentary questions. Meanwhile, a Harris poll for ITN suggested that 66 per cent of people think MPs' standards have declined since 1979, and 85 per cent think MPs should not receive money from lobbyists.</p>

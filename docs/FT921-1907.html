			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Gardening: So sweet, but often dowdy - Daphne, a plant of variable character DAPHNE brings images of fragrance and unreliability, yet neither is true entirely of the dozen or so species found commonly in gardens. In fact, it is extraordinary how much these vary in character: some evergreen, others deciduous, some scented very sweetly and a few not at all, or only very slightly. And although most are beautiful, there are one or two that are distinctly dowdy. Two daphnes grow wild in Britain. One of them, D. mezerium, is a favourite in gardens, especially with cottagers who seem to have the knack of growing it well. It is fairly rare in the wild but the other native, D. laureola, the spurge laurel, is common enough in woods on alkaline soils. Although not exciting, D. laureola is worth a place in the wild garden for its ability to thrive in dry shade and the limiest soils. It is a leafy evergreen that grows from 2ft to 4ft high with curling clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers which sometimes are honey-scented and always appear very early in the year - from February to April. You can scarcely go wrong with this daphne. You could say much the same of D. mezerium, which does grow freely in some gardens and even spreads by seedlings which are self-sown from the handsome, scarlet berries (which are very poisonous and usually produced freely). The habit of the bush is distinctive with stiffly-upright stems, lance-shaped deciduous leaves, and small purple flowers clustered close to the stems. They are very fragrant, as are those of its beautiful, pure-white variety. D. mezerium is a rare, protected plant that is found wild on limey or chalky soils, usually in woods, although generally it is grown in the open in gardens. The difficulty with this fine plant is that it is apt to die suddenly and without obvious cause. Cottage gardeners seem to succeed with it, perhaps because they often let it choose its own place to grow and then leave it alone. Probably the best daphne with which to make a start - because it is beautiful, likely to succeed and lives for a reasonable time - is a hybrid named D. burkwoodii Somerset. It makes a very freely-branched bush, 3ft to 4ft high and generally a little more through, with narrow, light-green leaves and abundant, lilac-like pink flowers that are very fragrant. It is a semi-evergreen which likes sunny places and most reasonably well-drained soils, with a preference for those containing lime. It flowers in May and sometimes there is a second, smaller display early in autumn. Daphne cneorum, known as the Farland Flower, was one of the parents of D. burkwoodii and could be considered the most beautiful of all daphnes. There is a pure-white variety but the natural, rose-pink type is the favourite. It makes an evergreen, wide-spreading bush which, while only about a foot high, can reach several feet across. The small and sweetly-scented flowers are produced with immense freedom in May. D. cneorum certainly likes limey soil but it grows freely in the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, where the soil is sandy and rather acid. What it does require is moisture at all times of the year and failures, which are fairly frequent, may be due very largely to drought. Then there is Daphne blagayana which has much larger, evergreen leaves. In spring, there are clusters of very sweetly-scented, creamy-white flowers at the ends of the long sprawling stems that make it very suitable for rock gardens. Daphne petraea is a true rock plant: a tiny, tufted evergreen rarely more than 3in high which grows wild on inaccessible cliffs in the limestone alps of the southern Tyrol. For the garden, there is a variety named Grandiflora which has flowers of superior size. They are rosy-pink, sweetly-scented gems which individually are like those of D. cneorum although the plant is, of course, very much smaller. Indeed, its size means it needs to be protected from slugs and other foes. Thus, rock plant enthusiasts usually grow it in pots or pans containing gritty, sharply-drained soil (including limestone chippings) in an unheated greenhouse or frame. This is not an easy plant to buy but it can be obtained from Potterton and Martin, the Cottage Nursery, Nettleton, Caistor, Lincolnshire. Perhaps the best smelling daphne of all is D. odora, but it is not as free-flowering as some of the others and it is not completely hardy in all parts of Britain, although it will survive a few degrees of frost. The lance-shaped leaves are evergreen, quite large, and a fine, glossy hue. There is a variety named Aurea-Marginata, with an attractive golden margin to each leaf, which is actually a little hardier than the plain green type. D. odora produces quite large clusters of flowers in two shades of reddish-purple from December well into the spring (which is much too early for safety in most British gardens). So, this is an ideal small plant for a conservatory; but for years I grew the variegated variety successfully in my Sussex garden against the south-facing wall of the house.</p>

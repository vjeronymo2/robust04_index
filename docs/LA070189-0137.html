			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL;  </P> <P> DOCTORS BUY SAN CLEMENTE HOSPITAL, RENAME IT SAMARITAN MEDICAL CENTER  </P> <P> The $23-million sale of San Clemente General Hospital to a group of staff  doctors was completed Friday, more than a year after they launched a bid to buy  the 116-bed general acute-care facility from a bankrupt hospital chain.  </P> <P> In one of their first moves, the new owners changed the hospital's name to  Samaritan Medical Center-San Clemente.  </P> <P> Purchase of the hospital from American Healthcare Management of Dallas was  accomplished by PACE, or Physician Associates Committed to Excellence, a group  of 67 local physicians who each put up $50,000 in cash to help finance the  transaction.  </P> <P> The biggest share of financing for the acquisition was provided by Cigna  Insurance Co., said David Gordon, vice president of John Nuveen &amp; Co. Inc.,  a Chicago investment banker that represented PACE in its negotiations with AHM.  </P> <P> As soon as the sale closed Friday, administration of the hospital was turned  over to Samaritan Health Services, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Samaritan  Foundation. Samaritan Health Services has contracted with PACE to operate it as  a nonprofit facility.  </P> <P> Vince Townsend, who previously was an associate administrator of Good Samaritan  Regional Medical Center in Phoenix, on Friday became the San Clemente  hospital's chief executive officer.  </P> <P> Townsend said one of his priorities would be to upgrade the hospital's  emergency room, as state health officials have requested. He said he will  submit to the state within 60 days a plan that details how and when the  improvements will be made.  </P></p>

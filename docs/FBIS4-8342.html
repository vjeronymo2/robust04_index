			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- "The Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) wants to keep its identity, its KDH  label, at all costs," KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky says in an  interview for the independent daily SME. Everything is possible  concerning the emergence of pre-election alliances between  Slovak right-wing parties, except for the possibility of KDH  joining any new party, "named, let us say, the Right Bloc, in  which individual parties would lose their identity and would  create a joint list of candidates," Carnogursky says.    He explains the KDH's idea that all right-oriented parties  (the Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, the Democratic Party,  the Alliance of Democrats, the groupings around Ludovit Cernak  and Jozef Moravcik) should create a free alliance, with each of  these parties relying on its own list of candidates for the  elections. Later all these parties, or some of them, would ally  in a group, under the election law, or create a joint list of  candidates.    If it turns out that any of the above parties is unable to  acquire parliamentary representation, the KDH is ready to put a  few people on its list as independent candidates, Carnogursky  says. The Slovak right wing should be united by the end of  July, when the lists of candidates have to be submitted, he  adds. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Menem gets his way on route to second term: John Barham on a step forward for Argentina's president - and misgivings about its democracy President Carlos Menem and his old rival Raul Alfonsn, in a ceremony transmitted live on Argentine national television yesterday, signed an agreement that opens the way for the fulfilment of Mr Menem's greatest ambition. He has been pushing with almost indecent haste to remove the 140-year-old constitution's ban on successive presidential terms so that he can stand for re-election when his mandate ends in July 1995. In exchange for backing constitutional reform, Mr Alfonsn's Radical party wins greater participation in government, Congress and the judiciary. The divided and demoralised Radicals, realising that they have little chance of winning the next elections, decided they had more to gain by negotiating with Mr Menem than obstructing his ambitions. The ceremony yesterday was the culmination of six weeks of negotiations behind closed doors. Congress must approve constitutional change by a two-thirds majority. Since the Radicals and Mr Menem's peronists control more than 80 per cent of the seats in Congress, approval by Christmas is almost a foregone conclusion. Mr Menem is in such a hurry that Congress will have only five days of debate before rising until March. Elections for the constituent assembly that will rewrite the constitution are to be held then. As part of their price for support, the Radicals also demanded a purge of the nine-member Supreme Court. Justices are appointed for life, to insulate them from political interference, but the opposition says the court lost its independence after Mr Menem packed it with pro-government justices. Mr Menem duly forced the resignation of two justices and a third promised to retire in February. Last week, Radicals and Peronists agreed on their replacements - one justice for each party and an independent. For the pessimists, the horsetrading and negotiations in smoke-filled rooms bode ill for Argentina's fragile democracy , the 10th anniversary of which was celebrated last Friday. It might be appropriate that the celebrations were uninspiring. There was a rally in a sports stadium. Mr Menem and Mr Alfonsn planted 10 saplings in a Buenos Aires park. Vandals uprooted them the next day. There was no sign of the enthusiasm in December 1983 that had greeted Mr Alfonsn's inauguration. That ended seven years of military rule which was unusually brutal, even by Latin American standards. However, most Argentines seem to approve the Peronist-Radical pact. La Nacion, Argentina's leading conservative newspaper, is one of the few dissenting voices. It protested in an editorial that 'a small group of men whose only qualification is to have been designated by the two leaders (are) discussing the text of Argentina's future constitution as if (theirs) was the final instance of the reform process.' It said this is being done with the 'evident intention of delivering the constituent assembly a tightly-closed package' to be rapidly rubber-stamped. Such secretiveness is a striking feature of Mr Menem's presidency and, to a lesser degree, of Mr Alfonsn's years in power. Mr Menem has amassed more power than any leader since Juan Peron ruled Argentina from 1946-55. Peron was Argentina's only president to change the constitution and win re-election. But he was toppled by the military, who scrapped the changes. Mr Menem has drawn the teeth of the supreme court and the judiciary. He ignores congress and rules by decree when necessary. He claims Argentina's economic 'reforms would not have been possible without the presidential system that we have'. These reforms have brought strong growth and low inflation, further re-inforcing his popularity and authority. The last 10 years have seen important advances. Civilian courts tried and jailed generals for human rights violations in the 1970s, although Mr Menem later pardoned them. The press is growing in confidence and aggressiveness. The arts are flourishing. The military, discredited by its disastrous 1976-83 government, now proclaims its commitment to democracy. Indeed, democracy has survived considerable stresses, such as four army mutinies, 13 general strikes and the hyper-inflation of July 1989 that drove Mr Alfonsn from office five months early. While support for democracy and Mr Menem's market-oriented reforms has never been stronger, Argentines complain that education, health, administration of justice and employment opportunities have deteriorated since 1983 while corruption is growing. Six military coups since 1930, guerrilla warfare in the 1970s and 60 years of economic upheaval have crippled the machinery of government. Democrats argue that Argentina must consolidate stability by rebuilding its institutions of state. Political analysts say that, although Mr Alfonsn restored democracy and Mr Menem brought economic stability, the latter is not the man to rebuild Argentina's institutions. Argentines often say their greatest hope for the future is the 'democracy generation' of children born after 1983. These are supposed to grow up untainted by the violent, bitter hatreds which have divided their parents and grandparents. If the Peronist-Radical 'tightly-closed package' is approved swiftly and with little debate, Argentina will lose a fine opportunity to design new political structures in order to help it avoid a repetition of its blood-soaked history.</p>

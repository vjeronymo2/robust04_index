			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, March 9 (YONHAP) -- The sudden cold snap  was their first topic when South and North Korean  representatives met again after six days Wednesday at the truce  village of Panmunjom to discuss the long-awaited exchange of  special envoys. "It feels like winter's final spite," the  North's chief negotiator Pak Yong-su said in lieu of welcoming  his South Korean counterpart Song Yong-tae.    "It was warm until yesterday, but the mercury plunged to  below zero Celsius this morning," Pak noted. "We have had rain  in Seoul and the central region since Monday. I believe spring  flowers will start blooming sooner or later," Song retorted in  an equally breezy greeting. "Willow buds are the first to  announce spring...wild garlic and Shepherd's Purse (spring  plants Koreans commonly eat as a vegetable dish or in soup) are  already out and I had them for breakfast," was Pak's next  addition to the small talk.    "I hope to see the special envoys come and go during this  beautiful spring," said Song, finally getting down to the nitty-  gritty.    -- The two representatives were able to agree in principle  on  at least one thing -- stepping up inter-Korean economic  cooperation.    Processing-on-commision trade between South and North Korea  in the past two months reached 2.8 million U.S. dollars, already  60 percent of last year's performance, Song said, implicitly  proposing direct exchanges so as to boost two-way trade. "Well,  2.8 million dollars in two months is less than expected," Pak  said, suggesting that the communist regime has been busy putting  its trade-first policy into action. "If South and North Korea  run together toward the world, it won't be just one plus one  becoming two, but our forces multiplying 10- and 20-fold," Song  predicted.    -- Pak was, as always, witty, asking Song if he had cooked  for his wife the previous day. "March 8 is international married  women's day and I make it a habit of cooking for my wife that  day," Pak said. "How nice, and I thought you were a hen-pecked  husband...," Song jested. As for himself, he said that he  entertains his wife by taking her on trips or for a drive every  now and then.    -- North Korea made a keynote statement first as the meeting  took place on the Northern side of Panmunjom. Before getting to  the closed-door session, Song commented on news reports after  their previous contact last Friday. He said he was personally  embarrassed by press reports calling the last meeting "much ado  about nothing," adding that he had hoped to see articles  picturing this contact as having blossomed like a flower. "Let's  be patient. Good results will come out in the end," Pak  responded.    -- The two negotiators again tossed back and forth thorny  and  playful barbs. Pak started by saying he read in a South Korean  newsweekly that Song practices a mock meeting before  inter-Korean dialogue.    "I wonder who played my role. I hope to be friends with  `him'," he said. "I also read in one newspaper where you said  you knew what I'm thinking just by looking at my eyes. Well,  tell me what my eyes say today," he ventured.    The two then picked up on their joke about the envelope and  briefcase that Pak first mentioned at last week's meeting.    "I see you haven't brought your big briefcase this time. I  guess you don't have too much to offer this time," the chief  North Korean negotiator observed. "Well, instead of a briefcase,  I brought with me a big bundle," Song countered, pointing to a  white envelope brought by Pak and bantering, "You won't feel  very comfortable carrying an empty envelope around."    "Since you came here (Northern side of the truce village),  we  will have to give you something big this time... Let's do  well," Pak said expansively.</p>

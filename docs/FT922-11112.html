			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Top Tokyo brokers to cut dividends JAPAN'S big four securities companies - Nomura, Yamaichi, Daiwa, and Nikko - are being forced to write off Y129.9bn (Pounds 550m) in securities losses following the steep fall in the Tokyo stock market. The companies are also, with the exception of Nomura, cutting dividends sharply in response to declining profitability. Daiwa said yesterday it would declare Y36.45bn in securities losses in the fiscal year ended in March because the market price of securities it holds have plunged below acquisition costs. The firm also said pre-tax profits would fall nearly 30 per cent below estimates of Y13bn made in early March, compared with Y119bn a year ago. The company will cut its full-year dividend from Y14 a share to Y9 a share. Daiwa's business, like others in the industry, has been hit by a decline in securities markets caused by the weaker Japanese economy and high interest rates. Retail customers have also been deterred by scandals last year and trading volumes have plunged. Yamaichi will declare securities valuation losses of Y40.75bn and cut its dividend from Y13.5 a share to Y7.5. Yamaichi expects a pre-tax loss of Y34bn, against Y67bn profit last year. Nikko Securities will declare valuation losses of Y18.2bn, and cut its dividend payment from Y13.5 to Y8.5 a share. Pre-tax profits will decline to Y2.5bn, from Y72.9bn a year ago. Nomura will declare Y34.5bn in securities losses, but expects a pre-tax profit of Y45bn, against Y233.5bn a year ago. Its dividend is not expected to be cut.</p>

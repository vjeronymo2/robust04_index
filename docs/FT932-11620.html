			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Motoring: Sisters under the trim - Stuart Marshall compares the Rover 600 and the Honda Accord ON MY left, the new Rover 600. And on my right, the new British-made Honda Accord. As everyone must know by now, under the sheet metal they are the same cars. What sets them apart are really no more than cosmetic changes to the front and rear ends and a different approach to interior styling and trim. But are they merely badge-engineered clones? I think it would be glib to leave it at that. There is nothing dishonourable in using the same engines, transmissions, suspensions and some body parts in what are promoted and sold as different makes of cars. Developing a completely new car costs so much it has become impossible not to. For example: identical engines and transmissions go into Audi 80s and Volkswagen Golfs; all Citroens and Peugeots; and many Fiats, Alfa Romeos and Lancias. But as individual cars they all manage to feel different. Were I to get into a Rover 600 or Honda Accord in an unlit garage and drive them off into the night, I would be hard put to tell which was which. Both are as quiet, comfortable, lively and refined as one expects a modern 2-litre saloon to be. In daylight, though, it would be a different story. Comparing the Rovers I had driven last month with the Hondas I sampled last week, the Rovers seemed somehow more distinguished. I could even have convinced myself they were more than just Hondas that had had a nose job and a tail tuck. Outwardly, the 600 is a handsome car; a proper Rover, in fact. The Accord looks a typical Honda and there is, of course, nothing wrong with that. From the front, the only car you would mistake a Rover 600 for would be a Rover 800. It looks as up-market as BMW's 3-Series that it is being pitched against. Inside, so long as lashings of traditional wood veneer turn you on, there is no contest. The interior of the new Rover 600 Series makes the Honda's look quite ordinary and more than matches that of the BMW. Beauty is, of course, skin deep. The Honda Accord may look a bit bland compared with the Rover but it comes very well equipped. When the Accord goes on sale in Britain next week a 2.0i LS will have a Pounds 15,145 list price. This includes electrically operated front and rear windows, sunroof, heated door mirrors and aerial; remote central locking, stereo radio-cassette and, should you want it, metallic paint. Its Rover 600 counterpart, the 620SLi, costs Pounds 17,200 and metallic paint is a Pounds 345 extra. At Pounds 18,475 the poshest Accord 2.0iES is trimmed in soft hide. It even has some wood veneer but is only Pounds 25 dearer than the equivalent Rover 620GSi. This, too, has leather seats - but not the Honda's standard air conditioning and driver's side airbag. So in the end, as the old saying has it, you pays your money and takes your choice. A potential buyer of an Accord or Rover 600 would be wise to match specification details carefully before deciding one way or the other. The Swindon-built Accord is every bit as British as the Cowley-made Rover 600. Honda is confident company car fleet managers - and their financial masters - have taken this point on board. If value and performance, comfort and equipment are the only criteria, the logical choice would be the Honda. But the Rover's fairer face and traditionally British interior may seduce status-conscious buyers. Whichever they choose, they can be sure of getting a thoroughly competent car.</p>

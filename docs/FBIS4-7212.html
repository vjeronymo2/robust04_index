			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan seems to have halted  its long economic decline but recovery, while possible this  fiscal year, cannot be predicted yet, the Bank of Japan (BOJ)  said Friday [22 April]. "Japan's economic growth seems to have  stopped weakening," the central bank said in its quarterly  economic outlook.    The "prospect of a gentle recovery is possible" during the  fiscal year that began this month, a central bank official said,  but added that "we cannot make an immediate decision" about the  connection between the halt to declines and a turnaround.    Uncertainties remain, the report says, citing corporate and  financial balance-sheet adjustments, the effects of jobs cuts  and other streamlining and foreign exchange movements. It notes  that the first quarters of 1992 and 1993 also showed bright  signs that did not pan out, but says that this time, "indicators  of personal consumption picked up and machinery orders, a  leading indicator of business investment, began to show signs of  bottoming out."    Personal consumption, a major engine of the economy, will  likely grow gradually this quarter, the report says.    Money supply growth will remain sluggish in the quarter,  between 1 percent and 2 percent above year-earlier levels, the  report says. The official said that while such tepid growth is  not good for recovery, money supply alone is not enough to put a  drag on the economy.    Japan's corporate capital spending will continue to fall,  keeping downward pressure on the economy, but the extent of  declines should narrow, the BOJ report says. It notes that  production and shipments have risen at Japan's mines and  factories but cautions that some of the effect could be from  fiscal year-end sales promotions. Production and shipments  could weaken again in the April-June quarter, it says.    "Any momentum for production recovery will remain weak, as  household income and corporate profits will be low," the report  says. Total domestic demand should recover gradually, with  consumption helped by this year's income tax cuts and continued  stable prices, it says.    The central bank found "lesser weakness in final demand,"  citing continued strong housing investment, higher consumption  of such items as appliances, a halt to the fall in machinery  orders and a pickup in exports due to recovering overseas  demand. That rise in exports, the report says, has boosted  Japan's trade surplus.    "Labor conditions continue to ease," it says, but no  "drastic" further adjustments are expected. The BOJ official  said some firms must continue restructuring efforts but that the  process need not be completed nationwide for recovery to occur.    Noting recent rises in long-term money market rates, the  report says overseas rises and expectations of fresh bond supply  may have played a part but that the trend "also seems to have  reflected market expectations for economic recovery and upturns  in corporate profits."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 8 (AFP) -- Nigerian pro-democracy  activists called Wednesday [8 June] for mass protests and civil  disobedience next week to bring down military ruler General Sani  Abacha.    The Campaign for Democracy said that from next week, "market  women and men should lock their shops, drivers and transport  owners should remove their vehicle from the streets. Workers  should stay off their offices.    "Our brothers and sisters in the armed forces and the police  are advised to take side with the civil society," it added.    The struggle between the Nigerian government and opposition  has intensified in recent weeks with the opposition accusing the  regime of dragging its heels over a return to democracy after  annulled elections and a military coup last year.    However, a nationwide umbrella group, the National  Democratic  Campaign, Wednesday cancelled a big rally at the Lagos home of  Moshood Abiola, the unofficial winner of presidential elections  held last year. The campaign wanted to forestall a breakdown of  law and order that could jeopardize its objective of having  Abacha's military regime stand down and hand over power to  Abiola, a spokesman for the group said.    The number two official in the junta, General Oladipo Diya,  said the government was determined to continue with a phased  return to democracy, with the first element, a constitutional  conference, due to open June 27. This is intended to show the  opposition that the government is a "responsible military  administration," Diya told state-run radio.    However Nigerian security forces earlier in the day arrested  four leaders of the opposition National Democratic Coalition,  press reports said.    In a communique, the British High Commission, or embassy, in  Lagos said it "regrets the recent arrests of a number of  prominent politicians and hopes they will soon be released."  The declaration, which diplomats said reflected the joint  position of the European Union, said Britain and its partners  were studying trade sanctions they took after the annulment of  the elections last year and the military coup last November.    "These are being kept under close review and will be  modified  in the light of progress towards the establishments of  democratic civilian rule," the statement said.    The detainees were a former information minister, Anthony  Enahoro, and three former civilian state governors, Christian  Onoh of Anambra in the southeast and Yahaya Abdulkarim and  Balarabe Musa of Sokoto and Kaduna in the north.    Four members of the disbanded Senate, including speaker Ameh  Ebute, and another former civilian governor, Segun Osoba, had  been arrested previously.    The opposition coalition and members of the dissolved  Nigerian parliament, issued separate statements declaring  Abacha's six-month- old government illegal and called for a  government of national union to be set up under Abiola.    Abiola has meanwhile written to US Vice President Al Gore  asking the United States and other countries to recognise a  parallel Nigerian government he said he intends to name by  Sunday, the first anniversary of the annuled poll. The  millionaire businessman told a crowd of supporters of his  intention and challenged the military to arrest him.    "I will be sworn in as the president and commander-in-chief  by the popular wish of the Nigerian people by the first  anniversary of the election (June 12), and then let heavens  fall," he said to a thundering ovation.    The crowd included ambassadors and representatives of 25  countries, reporters said.</p>

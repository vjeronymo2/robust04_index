"Wang was arrested early this morning for no apparent  reason," spokesman and fellow dissident Yang Zhou said by  telephone. Yang is a founder of the Peace Charter movement  which was started in November last year.    Wang, 39, a private businessman who has long been involved  in  promoting human rights, spent three years in prison from 1979  for "counter-revolutionary" activities during the Democracy Wall  movement in 1978-79. Chinese authorities' crackdown on  dissidents has coincided with the opening of the annual National  People's Congress (NPC) on Thursday and a visit to China by US  Secretary of State Warren Christopher scheduled to begin later  Friday. Several dissidents have been arrested in recent days  and three of them were sent to prison.    Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations  which culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre in the  capital, was forced to leave Beijing on Friday along with two  other dissidents. Dissident Wei Jingsheng has also left for the  countryside by order of the authorities.</p>

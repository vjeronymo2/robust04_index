			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> STRIPPER PARTY SPURS FORUM AT CHAPMAN  </P> <P> A campuswide forum on morals will be held today at Chapman College in response  to an incident last month in which a stripper was hired to entertain at an  off-campus fraternity party.  </P> <P> The forum, entitled "A Question of Values," is set for 11 a.m. in Hashinger  Hall on campus and will feature a discussion among students and faculty on  values that Chapman College "stands for and should uphold," Pamela Ezell, the  school's spokeswoman, said.  </P> <P> Ann Bolger, director of residence life at the 2,200-student college, said the  stripper incident involving members of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity "raised  a larger issue of values on the campus."  </P> <P> "We need to get together and discuss how we determine values," Bolger said  Monday. "This is an issue across the country. Many campuses are wrestling with  the issue of values."  </P> <P> Two members of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, Chapman College's largest, invited  the topless stripper to a party at their off-campus apartment on Sept. 28,  according to the fraternity's president. About 50 students, many of them  fraternity members, attended.  </P> <P> The school earlier this month punished the fraternity with a one-year  suspension and a second year's probation. But Chapman officials decided to set  the suspension aside and allow a student "Greek Judicial Board" review the  incident and make recommendations.  </P> <P> Bolger said the board decided last Thursday to place the fraternity on  probation for one year and to require its members to become involved in three  educational projects on campus, such as holding a forum on the dangers of  pornography.  </P> <P> The student board consists of members from all the school's fraternities and  sororities.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is set to hold talks  with President Clinton on 11 February, will leave Japan on 10  February and return home on 13 February. This schedule was  disclosed by the prime minister at a 31 January meeting of  leaders of the government and ruling coalition parties. During  the meeting, the prime minister expressed his eagerness to  settle the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which have  continued to run into rough sailing, saying, "I intend to make  the utmost effort to settle the talks." As for the issue of tax  cuts which the United Sates has sought persistently as a means  to expand Japan's domestic demand, both the government and the  ruling coalition parties will decide on a rough outline for  reforming the current tax system by 2 February and the  government will announce a new package of stimulus measures on 3  February. These quick moves by the government and the ruling  coalition parties reveal their intentions to take steps which  could fulfill U.S. expectations of Japan in the macroeconomics  field including tax cuts amid a stalemate in the Japan-U.S.  negotiations on the microeconomic field including automobile and  auto parts.    At a meeting with the prime minister at his official  residence on 23 January shortly after the rejection of a package  of political reform bills in the House of Councilors, U.S.  Treasury Secretary Bentsen said in a soft tone: "The income tax  reduction is important from the point of expanding Japan's  domestic demand. If the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks make  little headway prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, there would  be various moves in the United States to take legal actions."  During the meeting, Treasury Secretary Bentsen made one request  after another, while mentioning the U.S. Government's  expectations on the prime minister. The prime minister  undoubtedly felt keenly a grim mood and moves in the United  States toward reviving the Super 301 provision of the 1988  Omnibus Trade Act. Speaking at a 26 January news conference, he  said, "Mr.Bentsen told me about tough requests."    At noon on 31 January, the prime minister spoke by telephone  with President Clinton. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said,  "I cannot give details of what leaders of the two countries  talked on the telephone." In this way, the telephone  conversation between the prime minister and President Clinton  has not been made public. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura,  however, said, "The President manifested U.S. expectations on  Japan for Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and stimulus  measures." The President is believed to have made requests for  tax cuts and other issues.    With the Japan-U.S. summit talks 10 days away, the  Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks remain deadlocked. While the prime  minister has expressed his intention to display his political  leadership in order to settle the talks, pessimism is voiced  within the government that the settlement of negotiations on  automobile and auto parts would be deferred until later.    At the present stage, the United States is responding  favorably to the prime ministers' policy for changes. Although  changes in Japan, which the United States has sought, are things  that Japan should do for its own sake, it is not easy for the  prime minister to coordinate views of people in the government  and the ruling coalition parties. It can be said that the prime  minister is sandwiched between the U.S. expectations on Japan  and his task of coordinating the views at home.</p>

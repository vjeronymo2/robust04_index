			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Electrolux plans Dollars 50m investment in SE Asia Electrolux, the world's largest producer of household appliances, has underscored its new focus on emerging markets with a Dollars 50m investment programme in the fast-growing south-east Asia region. Mr Christer Forsstrom, senior vice-president, said: 'Our objective is to be one of the top three suppliers of white goods in the Asean region by the year 2000.' The programme, which will rely heavily on advertising to promote Electrolux brands, will begin in Thailand before being expanded to include Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. It is in line with the group's target of doubling its Asian sales from SKr4.57bn (Dollars 585.9m) in 1993 over the next five years. Electrolux said there was an emerging class of educated, urbanised Asian consumers with rapidly rising disposable income which provided it with a big new sales opportunity. It cited predictions that in Thailand alone, the number of urban households would leap from 3.9m in 1990 to 8.2m in the year 2000. The company said it had already widened its distribution network and it had spent the past two years adapting a wide range of products to meet Asian needs and tastes. Electrolux said it expected annual demand growth in emerging markets, including south-east Asia, China and India, to be at least three times the 2 per cent level it forecast for its mature US and European markets.</p>

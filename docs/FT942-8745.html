			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Portillo hopeful on cutting deficit Government action to reduce the public-sector borrowing requirement should serve in turn to cut Britain's large current account deficit, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said last night, Peter Norman writes. But in a speech to the Lombard Association in the City, Mr Portillo warned that the current-account deficit, which was an estimated Pounds 10.9bn last year, was unlikely to improve as rapidly as the PSBR, which the government expects to fall close to zero during the next five years.

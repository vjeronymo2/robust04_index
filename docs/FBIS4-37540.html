			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--A number of Iraqi businessmen  and industrialists have voluntarily contributed $2.275 million,  equivalent to 1 billion Iraqi dinars, to finance some food  imports, on condition that they are repaid in dollars after the  unfair economic embargo is lifted.    This has been announced to INA by Trade Minister Dr.  Muhammad  Mahdi Salih, who said these businessmen and industrialists are  the first group of contributors, who will be followed by other  groups.    He explained that this step expresses the readiness of Iraqi  businessmen and industrialists to contribute to confronting the  economic blockade, along with other segments of the society. It  also comes in light of President Saddam Husayn's instructions  that merchants be given a chance to voluntarily contribute to  the importation of food.</p>

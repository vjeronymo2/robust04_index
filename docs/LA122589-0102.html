			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY ATTACK STIRS BARELY A WHIMPER;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: WHILE L.A. HAS RALLIED AGAINST SPRAYINGS, ORANGE COUNTY REMAINS  NONCHALANT. AN AIDE CALLS THE PASSIVITY 'APPALLING.'  </P> <P> Randall Toler is sure there are other critics out there of the state's aerial  assault on the Mediterranean fruit fly, but he couldn't prove it by the turnout  at a demonstration he tried to stage a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> When just one supporter showed up, the Fullerton man had to scrub the whole  thing. And a team of helicopters proceeded unhindered to spray hundreds of  gallons of malathion mix over North County, with no hint of protest in the  streets below.  </P> <P> "The opposition just hasn't developed yet here," the self-styled environmental  activist lamented.  </P> <P> While the state's recent onslaught of aerial spraying has triggered growing  resistance among Los Angeles residents and politicians, it has drawn barely a  whimper among those in Orange County, even as the pesky Medfly has threatened  to move deeper into the county.  </P> <P> "The passivity is appalling," said Huntington Beach Councilman Peter M. Green,  a human ecology professor who fears that the Medfly may be heading toward his  city. "How people can allow some helicopters to come over their houses and dump  poison on them, I don't know. I don't see anyone questioning this at all. I  don't see it on anyone's agenda."  </P> <P> The difference in reactions between Los Angeles and Orange County may be  explained, in part, by contrasting temperaments, politics and loyalties in the  two regions, political observers say.  </P> <P> In Orange County, a community considered more conservative than Los Angeles in  both its politics and its approach toward governing, politicians may be less  likely to challenge the policy of a Republican administration in Sacramento,  observers suggest. And that may be particularly true on an issue that many  believe sharply undercut the political future of Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. in  1981 through his failure to respond quickly to the Medfly.  </P> <P> But the biggest reason for the differing responses, politicians agree, is also  the simplest: The Medfly has not hit here with the same severity and duration  as Los Angeles.  </P> <P> If and when that does happen, officials caution, a political firestorm seems  sure to follow in Orange County.  </P> <P> Already, some North County residents, now facing as many as a dozen sprayings  in their neighborhoods through the summer under an aggressive new state plan,  have privately voiced fears about what the drops of pesticide mix may be doing  to their bodies and the environment, not to mention the finish on their cars.  </P> <P> A few dozen malathion critics in Orange County have even called county and  state agriculture officials, contacted the media and attended city council  meetings to question claims about malathion's safety.  </P> <P> But whatever concern does exist has not translated into any visible show of  opposition to the ongoing Medfly spraying, nor has it caught the attention of  many politicians.  </P> <P> With the lone exception of County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, virtually all  county leaders and North County municipal officials have voiced strong support  for, or at least acceptance of, the state's Medfly spraying.  </P> <P> With only a negligible influence over the state's policy, many local  politicians view the spraying as "a necessary inconvenience" to protect the  state's $16 billion-a-year agricultural industry. The raiding Medflies ravaged  California in 1981 to the tune of about $200 million in damaged produce and  eradication costs.  </P> <P> Said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley: "I'd like to think that we  in Orange County have rationalized that our own best interests are at stake."  </P> <P> And Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby added: "I think people pretty much accept  the spraying. You sort of joke about it and say that it's there, and they'll  spray, and we hope they get the Medfly.  </P> <P> "If you had a lot of people in the community rising up against it, we'd  certainly listen, but that really hasn't happened," Norby said.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the signs of unrest over malathion have been many in recent  weeks: 90 people showed up for a downtown demonstration in one of several  protests. Neighborhood groups banded together to create an anti-malathion  coalition. And city officials formally asked the state to consider alternatives  to spraying and are now looking at a possible lawsuit to ground the  helicopters.  </P> <P> In Orange County, by contrast, the Medfly has been a silent issue.  </P> <P> "We've only had a few sprayings, and I don't think it's really sunk in yet,"  said Supervisor Stanton, who is openly skeptical about the state's policy. "I  think we have to question this early on before we're literally doused in this  stuff. If not, look out."  </P> <P> In Orange County, the Medfly spraying has been confined to an area just under  10 square miles that includes more than 30,000 homes and businesses in parts of  Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. The region surrounds the Brea guava tree where a  pregnant Medfly was found Nov. 17, and borders several other finds in La Habra  Heights in southern Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> But another fertile Medfly was trapped in Westminster about two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Because the sexually immature fly was not pregnant, state officials decided not  to spray the Westminster area for now. But they nearly tripled the number of  traps in the area to more than 2,200, and the discovery triggered fears among  agriculturists that the destructive insect may have broadened its reach.  </P> <P> To thwart any spread of the Medfly into South County, the heart of the county's  $225-million-a-year agriculture industry, officials say they have no choice but  to spray the infested area with malathion -- again and again and again.  </P> <P> For North County and the other eight areas around the Southland where Medflies  have been found, totaling 277 square miles, the new state program will mean  helicopters overhead once every three weeks in the next few months, increasing  to perhaps once a week toward spring.  </P> <P> State officials anticipated from the start that their stepped-up spraying  policy was likely to prompt public concerns.  </P> <P> "People are quiet about it for a while, but then just the noise of the  helicopters overhead ruining their sleep is enough to get people cranky," said  Gera Curry of the state Department of Food and Agriculture. "We're sorry about  that, but this was really the only alternative left."  </P> <P> At stake, malathion spraying proponents say, is the very core of the state's  economy -- its agricultural base -- in the face of attack from the Medfly. The  insect is thought to destroy more than 260 types of fruits, vegetables and nuts  by laying eggs in the skin and producing pulp-attacking maggots.  </P> <P> Japan, which officials say imports about a third of California's $3.3-billion  in agricultural products, has been monitoring the Medfly situation "very  carefully," said Hiroyuti Kobayashi, agricultural counsel for the Japanese  consulate in Los Angeles. U.S. official worry about a possible Japanese  quarantine on California produce.  </P> <P> And the powerful agricultural lobby, which supports the Medfly spraying, has  made clear to Sacramento that "if we don't keep on top of this thing, there  could be terrible consequences," said David L. Moore, president of the  Irvine-based Western Growers Assn.  </P> <P> "My biggest concern is the (potential) public outcry," Moore said. "I hope  people will listen to the scientific evidence and have the patience and  fortitude to stay with this thing."  </P> <P> Environmental critics, however, charge that the costly aerial spraying is only  the easiest solution to appease the powerful agribusiness lobby; it is not,  they say, the best.  </P> <P> They assert that the state has not worked hard enough to find other  alternatives to combat the Medfly, such as the use of sterile flies to invade  and kill off the fertile population, fruit-tree stripping, and further ground  application and trapping.  </P> <P> And, pointing to past studies, these critics say the true health effects of  malathion are not known. It may, they assert, cause cancer and genetic defects  and damage to the nervous system.  </P> <P> "The best you can say is that we don't know what this stuff can do," said David  Bunn, a research director with Pesticide "The worst is that it can really do  some harm."  </P> <P> State officials assert, however, that scientific evidence shows malathion, used  in low doses for the aerial sprayings, can kill off Medflies but poses no  threat to humans. But public reaction has been decidedly mixed.  </P> <P> Some North County residents in the spray area say they support the current  strategy against the Medfly and believe state officials when they say malathion  won't hurt them.  </P> <P> Many seem most concerned not about the effects of the pesticide on their health  but rather on their cars, as evidenced by the rows upon rows of  tarpaulin-covered automobiles on spray nights and the long lines at carwashes  the next morning. Then, too, they complain about the noise and disruption,  likening the spraying to a scene from "Apocalypse Now."  </P> <P> But some simply don't believe that the pesticide is safe.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be the sad recipient of news 10 years down the road that 'oh  goodness, we were wrong. This pesticide is deadly,' " said Kathryn Fine, a  Fullerton resident who lives in the spray area.  </P> <P> Fine was so concerned about the malathion that she addressed the Fullerton City  Council at a meeting last week. She was the only person to do so.  </P> <P> "It's a shame that so many people are so lackadaisical," she said. At work in  the public reaction are two competing forces, says Elaine Vaughan, an assistant  professor of social ecology at UC Irvine who studies the way people view the  risks of pesticides and other environmental threats.  </P> <P> On the one hand, "people are naturally wary of pesticides and tend to overreact  to the risk," often with little regard for scientific evidence or assurances  from the government, Vaughan said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, she said, "people tend to feel helpless when it comes to  these large policy questions. And if they don't think there's anything they can  do about it, they simply accept it."  </P></p>

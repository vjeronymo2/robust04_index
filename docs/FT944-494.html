			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Cautious Chinese look before they leap into year of change: End of Deng era may bring 1995 turmoil, explains Tony Walker It will be a leap year in China in 1995 and only the fourth time this century that August has provided the leap month. It will also be a year of the pig - the last of the 12 terrestrial symbols and among the least auspicious. Little wonder that the mood in China is a mixture of unease, inertia and nervousness, or that China's leaders are enmeshed in a game of transitional politics which is affecting domestic and foreign policy. Sensitive to omens and portents, the Chinese are noting that each August leap year this century brought cataclysm. In 1900 the Boxer uprising ended in bloody reprisals by a foreign expeditionary force. In 1957 the anti-rightist campaign preceded two decades of disaster. 1976 produced the Tangshan earthquake in which as many as 250,000 perished. It was also the year in which Mao Zedong and his premier, Zhou Enlai, died. The deteriorating health of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, coupled with the sense that the end of an era is fast approaching, appear to be weighing more heavily on the leadership. As the New Year beckons in wintry Beijing, China's leaders are engaged in seemingly endless meetings, conferences and planning sessions. But in spite of much talk about continued reform, the overwhelming impression at present is not one of movement, but of inertia. A western official put it succinctly: 'We're in limbo,' she said. 'We're in stalemate.' This lack of motion seems set to persist as Mr Deng's life ebbs away. How long the process will take is anybody's guess, but the leader's condition - he has Parkinson's disease - appears to have worsened since mid-year. Nervousness about the future appears to be conditioning policy responses at home and abroad, sharpening the leadership's reaction to challenges to its authority - real or imagined. Last week's sentencing of nine dissidents to jail terms of between three and 20 years is a case in point. These sentences are a sign, according to western officials, not of self-confidence at the top but of leaders unsure how they will keep order in the post-Deng era. China's mystifying approach to the Gatt negotiations, in which it eschewed what might have been regarded as reasonable compromise, left an impression that a distracted leadership, weighed down by other preoccupations, was in no mood to sanction the concessions required on market access and other issues. Lack of progress on Sino-US copyright negotiations is another example of inertia. Pirating of laser and compact discs and computer software is rife in China. US officials report that talks on intellectual property rights violations have bogged down recently, with Beijing apparently unwilling to concede that its policing efforts are ineffectual. Domestic economic reform also appears to be faltering. Worries about inflation are casting a long shadow and reinforcing a tendency towards caution. Chinese officials talk endlessly about state enterprise reform, but there appears to be a widening gap between words and deeds. Among indications of uncertainty is the eclipse, for now, of Mr Zhu Rongji, the reformist vice-premier. Mr Zhu has been less prominent since mid-year. Western officials and Chinese observers interpret Mr Zhu's current reticence as vulnerability. They believe that he is shoring up his defences for the leadership struggle that lies ahead once Mr Deng dies. The executive vice-premier is said to oppose strongly concessions required to advance the Gatt negotiations. Another indication of uncertainty in Beijing is the more nationalistic tone apparent in recent public statements. Commentaries on the failed Gatt talks, for example, were more an expression of outrage and wounded pride than an analysis of reasons for failure. 'Our government has said it will not yield to pressure, however great; we believe all Chinese people endorse our government's firm and just stand,' said the China Daily yesterday. The Gatt argument also risks sharpening Sino-US differences after a period in which the two sides appeared to have achieved relative harmony in managing their complex relationship. President Bill Clinton's decision last May to 'de-link' human rights and the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status have improved the atmosphere, but there are dangers that things could regress. Finally, lurking in the background are real concerns about the quality of China's 'third generation' leadership, whose task it will be to assume Mr Deng's 'blood-spattered mantle'. Mr Jiang Zemin, the avuncular 68-year-old president of the republic, general secretary of the Communist party and chairman of the Central Military Commission, awaits his turn, but doubts persist about his ability to assert authority in the difficult months after Mr Deng's death.

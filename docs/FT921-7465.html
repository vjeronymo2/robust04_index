			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / More aid sought for Welsh coal regions THE GOVERNMENT is to seek further aid from the European Commission for the depressed coal-mining areas of Wales. This is on top of the Pounds 17.8m released by Brussels earlier this week. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, met Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for regional policy, on Thursday in Brussels when it was indicated that an application for a further Pounds 10m would be 'looked on favourably'. Mr Hunt said qualifying projects had been drawn up by the Welsh Office. 'We have a long list of schemes ready to be put into Brussels as soon as we get the nod,' he said. The move will be welcomed by other British mining areas which are certain to put in further applications now that the dispute over such funding between Whitehall and Brussels has been settled. The government backed down on Monday from its previous stance that European regional aid should go to the Treasury to help finance schemes already authorised in Britain. Mr Millan refused to release Pounds 120m to Britain for more than 50 projects unless he received an assurance that European finance would be used in addition to anything the government might spend. Mr Hunt and Mr Millan met at the opening of the Wales European Centre in Brussels, designed to act as a link between companies in the principality and the EC. Organisations that played a part in setting it up include the Welsh Development Agency, district and county councils, the Training and Enterprise Councils in Wales, the Development Board for Rural Wales and University College, Cardiff.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (New In Brief): Labour defines Scottish 'autonomy' LABOUR yesterday spelled out the case for Scotland staying within the union with England and Wales by outlining its definition of 'the maximum autonomy' feasible without severing the links of nearly three centuries, Ivo Dawnay writes. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said there was no advantage in 'breaking the first internal market that Europe achieved' when the European Community was working towards common economic goals. He said the demands of the Scottish National party for a separate currency and exchange rates represented 'the costly trappings and not the essential substance of a modern national identity'. He went on to attack the Conservatives for gambling with the union by attempting to 'polarise the debate' between the status quo and separatism. Mrs Margaret Ewing, SNP MP for Moray, said last night in a party political broadcast that Labour's programme was simply a 'prospectus for continued poverty and economic stagnation' in Scotland. Observer, Page 18 ***** NORTHERN IRELAND: The government's majority slumped to three in the Commons last night when an order extending trade union legislation already operating in Britain to Northern Ireland was passed by 90 votes to 87. Ministers and their handful of supporters in the almost deserted chamber ignored shouts of 'resign' from the few Labour MPs present to hear the result. ***** BRITISH RAIL: The government would be reluctant to tolerate increases in the sums paid by BR in compensation once the new passengers' charter comes into effect, Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, suggested yesterday. The government had 'no plans to be associated with' any scheme that would involve significant costs, he said. The 'sensible' way of improving services would be to create performance targets for BR. ***** OIL RIG SAFETY: Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary has promised to consider amending a private member's bill now in the Lords to include legislation to protect from victimisation by employers workers on North Sea oil rigs who complain about the inadequacy of safety arrangements.</p>

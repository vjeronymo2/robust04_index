			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Corporate Guarantee (Section 258.74(g))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule proposes to allow owners and operators to comply with financial responsibility requirements for MSWLFs using a guarantee provided by another private firm (the guarantor). Under such a guarantee, the guarantor promises to pay for or carry out closure, post-closure care or corrective action activities on behalf of the owner or operator of a MSWLF if the owner or operator fails to do so. Guarantees, like other third-party mechanisms, such as letters of credit or surety bonds, ensure that a third party is obligated to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, or corrective action in the event that the owner or operator goes bankrupt or fails to conduct the required activities. At the same time, a guarantee is an attractive compliance option for owners and operators, especially those affiliated with larger corporations because guarantees are generally much less expensive than other third-party mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would allow three types of qualified guarantors: (1) The parent corporation or principal shareholder of the owner or operator (e.g., a corporate parent or grandparent), (2) a firm whose parent company is also the parent company of the owner or operator (a corporate sibling), and (3) other related and non-related firms with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the owner or operator (including subsidiaries of the owner or operator). Guarantors also would be required to meet the conditions of the corporate financial test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To comply with the requirements of the corporate guarantee, the owner or operator would be required to place in the facility operating record a copy of the guarantee contract and copies of all of the financial test documentation that is required of the guarantor as specified in the corporate financial test requirements. The terms of the guarantee contract must specify that, if the owner or operator fails to perform closure, post-closure care, or corrective action in accordance with the requirements of part 258, the guarantor will either: (1) carry out those activities or pay the costs of having them conducted by a third party (performance guarantee), or (2) fund a trust to pay the costs of the activities (payment guarantee). The required documentation must be placed in the operating record, in the case of closure and post-closure care, prior to the initial receipt of waste or the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later, or in the case of corrective action, no later than 120 days following selection of a corrective action remedy. The financial test documentation from the guarantor must be updated annually, in accordance with the requirements of the corporate financial test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The financial test documentation required of the guarantor is the same as that required of a corporate financial test user except that, in cases where the guarantor is not a corporate parent, grandparent, or sibling, the letter from the chief financial officer must address the ``substantial business relationship'' (as defined in &sect;264.141(h)) that exists between the owner or operator and the guarantor. In particular, the letter must describe the relationship and the consideration received from the owner or operator in exchange for the guarantee, which is necessary to ensure that the contract is valid and enforceable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would require that guarantors agree to remain bound under this guarantee for so long as the owner or operator must comply with the applicable financial assurance requirements of subpart G of part 258, except that guarantors may cancel this guarantee by sending notice to the State Director and to the owner or operator. The proposal would provide that such cancellation cannot become effective earlier than 120 days after receipt of such notice by both the State Director and the owner or operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a guarantee is cancelled, the proposal would require the owner or operator to, within 90 days following receipt of the cancellation notice by the owner or operator and the State Director, obtain alternate financial assurance, place evidence of that alternate financial assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director. If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate assurance within 120 days, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the corporate guarantor no longer meets the requirements of the financial test, the owner or operator would have to, within 90 days following the close of the guarantor's fiscal year, obtain alternative assurance, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director. If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor would be required to provide that alternate assurance within 120 days following the close of the guarantor's most recent fiscal year, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has affirmed the importance of the media in confronting  extremism and the extremists. He said in statements today that  Egypt will never lapse into a state of anarchy nor will it move  away from the law which it set 7,000 years ago.    He pointed out that there is a group belonging to the Muslim  Brotherhood which has been involved in financing terrorist  groups. He said that he would not reveal how many people there  are because all the facts are now before the prosecution and  will be revealed at the appropriate time.    He said that the Interior Ministry will not stop confronting  terrorism.    The interior minister said that there are continuous and  extensive campaigns against those trading in cassettes with  recordings of calls for extremism and that the ministry is in  the process of submitting a law that increases punishment for  such merchants.    On the other hand, during his meeting today with a group of  businessmen from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, Mr.  Hasan al-Alfi affirmed that the progress the Interior Ministry  has achieved in imposing its control over the terrorist elements  did not come in a vacuum but resulted from following a  scientific system of training, modernization, and development in  all the agencies, in addition to coordination and  comprehensiveness in all the ministry's departments.    Al-Alfi said during the meeting that the Interior Ministry  now has a large data base on all those who carry out terrorist  acts whether inside Egypt or outside it. He praised the  Egyptian people, who are now providing all sorts of help to the  security organs.    On the other hand, Mr. Muhammad Shafiq Jabir, deputy  chairman  of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, affirmed in  statements on the sidelines of the meeting that the Chamber,  which represents 650 companies operating in Egypt, is convinced  that the Interior Ministry is not sparing any effort in exposing  all the facts.    He said that the security situation in Egypt is now more  stable than it was before, as a result of the successive  security sweeps and the successes the Egyptian Interior Ministry  has had in confronting the terrorists. He said that foreign  media reporting on Egypt has improved immensely.    The U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Cairo had asked Mr. Hasan  al-Alfi to hold a meeting to discuss the security situation in  Egypt and its relationship to encouraging investment in Egypt.    The meeting was attended by a number of prominent figures  from the Interior Ministry and ranking businessmen, as well as  members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and some economists from  Egypt.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Flotation values ICG at Pounds 105m Shares in Intermediate Capital Group, the specialist provider of mezzanine finance to unlisted companies, were priced at 225p yesterday, valuing the group at Pounds 105m. The issue is fully underwritten by Lazard Brothers and will be placed with institutional and other investors. There is also a clawback to meet demand from an intermediaries offer. The notional gross dividend yield for the year ended January 1994 is 5.5 per cent. Since it was formed in 1989, ICG has carved out a niche providing loans to fund management buy-outs and buy-ins, acqu-isitions and development cap-ital. The group enhances returns by receiving warrants or a redemption premium when the investment is realised. COMMENT Niche lender, Intermediate Capital Group, is a strange animal. Part bank and part investor in unquoted companies, it is both an operating company that lends and an investment trust with a portfolio of equity stakes. Judging by the pricing, the company's advisers are confident institutions agree ICG should not be valued as an investment trust - Pounds 105m values the group at a 19 per cent premium to net asset value. Viewed as a specialist lender, however, ICG's notional gross dividend of 5.5 per cent is only just covered by earnings from core interest income, dividends and management fees. Hardly comfortable cover in conventional terms. But then the group hopes to continue to realise capital gains through further sales of equity. ICG is not a stock for risk-averse investors. It is a growth stock underpinned by an unusually high yield. But for investors who believe ICG can maintain its healthy, if short, record of realising capital gains, the shares have some attractions.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Plaid seeks boost for small shops PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh Nationalist party, began its election campaign with a call for extra help for small businesses in Wales, Anthony Moreton writes. Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones, MP for the Isle of Anglesey in the last parliament, said the most important economic benefit for the Welsh economy would be the end of the uniform business rate. 'Many small businesses in Wales have been destroyed by introduction of the uniform business rate in 1989. Its arrival saw a massive hike in bills, the final straw for many small shops in our towns.' Mr Wyn Jones called for the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales to be given more money to spend on small companies, as well as the setting up of 'advice' shops to help smaller businesses with finance and accounting.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown to float part of Fairview HILLSDOWN Holdings, the diversified food group, is preparing to sell part of Fairview New Homes, its housing subsidiary, in a flotation that could fetch Pounds 100m. The move is in keeping with Hillsdown's decision two years ago to concentrate on its core food business, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of the group. It has delayed selling the housebuilding subsidiary because of a reluctance to sell the business at the bottom of the cycle. The sale is likely to take place later this year or in early 1993 - although the exact timing will depend on the state of the stock market. 'The condition of the market will dictate the timing,' said a Hillsdown spokesman. 'We don't need the money; we are not pressured to complete the sale.' Fairview, which specialises in London flats for first-time buyers, has cut its margins but continued to make profits during the recession. Hillsdown is planning to make several in-fill acquisitions, priced between Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m, in the food business. The group will announce its 1991 figures on March 11. The City is expecting a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 191m to below Pounds 185m.</p>

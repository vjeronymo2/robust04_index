			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME RENOVATION  </P> <P> Schweitzer's casual disregard for the profession of architecture is glib and  irresponsible.  </P> <P> One cannot be a professional until he or she has been recognized by the  profession. I would suggest that the only rationalization for eschewing a  license stems from fear and insecurity rather than from a holier-than-thou  arrogance.  </P> <P> Stick to picking paint and wallpaper, Mr. Schweitzer, or see if you can pass  the test.  </P> <P> JAMES LECRON  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

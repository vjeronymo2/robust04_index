			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 2.A._Determination of Target Rate of Compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in undesignated waters is average annual compensation for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. The average annual compensation for first mates is determined based on the most current union contracts, and includes wages and benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in designated waters approximates the average annual compensation for masters on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. It is calculated as 150% of the compensation earned by first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 2.B._Determination of Number of Pilots Needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of designated waters is established by dividing the projected bridge hours for that area by 1,000. Bridge hours are the number of hours a pilot is aboard a vessel providing basic pilotage service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of undesignated waters is established by dividing the projected bridge hours for that area by 1,800.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In determining the number of pilots needed in each pilotage area, the Director is guided by the results of the calculations in steps 2.A. and 2.B. However, the Director may also find it necessary to make adjustments to these numbers in order to ensure uninterrupted pilotage service in each area, or for other reasonable circumstances which the Director determines are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 2.C._Projection of Target Pilot Compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The ``projection of target pilot compensation'' is determined separately for each pilotage area by multiplying the number of pilots needed in that area by the target pilot compensation for pilots working in that area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 3: Projection of Revenue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The third step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to project the revenue that would be received in each pilotage area if existing rates were left unchanged. This step consists of two phases: (a) Projection of future vessel traffic and pilotage revenue; and (b) adjustment for ancillary revenues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 3.A._Projection of Revenue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The Director generates the most accurate projections reasonably possible of the pilotage service that will be required by vessel traffic in each pilotage area. These projections are based on historical data and all other relevant data available. Projected demand for pilotage service is multiplied by the existing pilotage rates for that service, to arrive at the projection of all pilotage revenue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 3.B._Adjustment for Ancillary Revenues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The projection of pilotage revenue from Step 3.A., above, is adjusted for ancillary revenues (i.e., revenue from docking, undocking, moveage, delay, cancellation, and lock transit). Ancillary revenues are subtracted from the projection of all pilotage revenue because the rates for ancillary services are set separately from the basic pilotage rates. The method for setting ancillary charges is discussed in Step 7.D., below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) After adjustment for ancillary revenues, the result is the projection for revenues which would be generated by basic pilotage services if existing rates are left unchanged. The results of these calculations is defined as the ``projection of revenue.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 4: Calculation of Investment Base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The fourth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is the calculation of the investment base of each Association. The investment base is the recognized capital investment in the assets employed by each Association required to support pilotage operations. In general, it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets, less the value of land. The investment base will be established through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended by material supplied in the Notes to the Financial Statement. The formula used in calculating the investment base is detailed in Appendix B to this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 5: Determination of Target Rate of Return on Investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The fifth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to determine the Target Rate of Return on Investment. For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment (ROI) is allowed for the recognized net capital invested in the Association by its members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The allowed ROI is based on the rate of the most recent return on stockholder's equity for a representative cross section of transportation industry companies, including maritime companies, with a minimum rate equal to the interest rate incurred by the Associations for debt capital, and a maximum rate of 20 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Assets subject to return on investment provisions must be reasonable in both purpose and amount. If an asset or other investment is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, that portion of the return element is not allowed for ratemaking purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Step 6: Adjustment Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The next step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to insert the results from steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 into a formula which is based on a standard utility rate structure, and comparing the results to step 5. This basic utility rate structure takes into account revenues, expenses and return on investment, and is of the following form:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The parties are discussing one of the last  points on the agenda, but peace still seems to be far away. Our  correspondent Joao Ligio reports.    The mediators have finally drawn up the third version on  specific principles, but it has not obtained the agreement of  all parties as the UN officials had thought. This morning, the  government and the mediators needed no more than 15 minutes to  reach an agreement on the specific principles for national  reconciliation. They were, however, confronted with the  viewpoints of the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA].    Late this afternoon, there was a major exchange of  correspondence revealing that there was a new version from the  mediators. The government delegation, reinforced with the  presence of two more army generals, held its own meeting and  this evening left for a meeting with Alioune Blondin Beye,  special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola.    A lengthy plenary meeting was then held, but the distance  separating the parties has not reduced and the discussions are  characterized by a threatening tone. For certain observers,  attempts to reach an agreement were dashed because, despite  changing its initial stand, UNITA has neither reduced the number  of its demands, nor withdrawn the stand which the government  consider unacceptable -- the desire for power sharing.</p>

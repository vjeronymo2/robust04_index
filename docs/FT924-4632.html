			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Challenge to Asda rally RECOVERY hopes at Asda continued to draw support yesterday as the shares again edged forward in huge turnover of 85m, by far the heaviest traded stock in the market. However, there were indications last night that Asda's good run may have peaked, with a number of brokers preparing to issue sell notes in time for the start of trading today. The shares, which stood at 23p on August 10, gained 2 1/2 to 58p yesterday. Mr Nick Bubb at Morgan Stanley, a buyer of the stock since its summer depths, said: 'The recovery in Asda was supposed to take three years not three months. We forecast a top price of 55-60p which has now been reached. Asda is an interesting recovery story, but until we see some new figures, we have turned seller.' Asda's results are due on December 18. Other traders noted that yesterday's heavy trading included some of the UK's leading institutions as sellers, although this was more than countered by heavy US buying and smaller UK funds. One analyst also said that the Asda management had expressed unease about the one-way march in the shares, which have outperformed the market by around 90 per cent in the last three months. One leading food retail analyst commented: 'The stock is overvalued and is no longer supported by the fundamentals.' Oil stocks busy The two leading UK exploration and production stocks, Lasmo and Enterprise, were the spearhead in a general upsurge in the oil sector after last week's Opec agreement. News of further encouraging drilling results from a southern Italian oil discovery was said to have been the driving force behind both companies' share prices. The oil sector in general made good progress after last Friday's Opec agreement to restrict output to some 24.58m barrels a day saw oil prices move up some 20 cents a barrel. But oil analysts were by no means over impressed with the latest moves by Opec. 'It's not a good agreement, they've papered over the cracks and oil prices are unlikely to move up from here,' said Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court. 'The market will still be dependent on cold snaps to get oil prices up,' said Hoare Govett, while Keith Morris at Carr Kitcat said: 'I'm not enthusiastic, the oil price won't go a lot further.' County NatWest said: 'We see no reason to change our cautious view of the oil sector.' Lasmo ran up 8 to 170p and Enterprise 7 1/2 to 462 1/2 p after more positive news from the Tempa Rossa oilfield in Southern Italy in which both companies hold substantial interests. BP edged up 2 to 233 1/2 in front of a presentation to Scottish institutions regarding progress on the group's recovery plan. BP is due to address oil analysts in London on December 7. Shell added 6 at 554p. Burmah Castrol jumped 18 to 667p, responding to a stock shortage and a broker buy recommendation. There was heavy turnover in Aran Energy stock where a block of 6m shares, or around 2.3 per cent of the issued capital, was sold into the market at 15 1/4 p. The shares were thought to have come from one of the big Irish institutions. Aran shares closed unaltered at 16p. Rosehaugh shivers The arrival of a receiver at Rosehaugh sent shivers through the property market with selected stocks being marked back in nervous trading. Property developers which have been the hardest hit by the market downturn in the last three years were among the worst performers. Speyhawk lost 2 to 11 1/2 p, and Stanhope, which has a joint development with Rosehaugh, 6 1/2 to 11p. Yesterday, Stanhope said its joint venture with Rosehaugh was unaffected by the receivership, funding having been secured last week. Mr Carl Gough at UBS Phillips and Drew said: 'We remain very negative on the sector, but especially on those companies with exposure to the central London office market.' He added that he expected other developers to join the casualty list in the near future. After an initial boost when Britain left the ERM, the commercial property market has recently slumped back into a cycle of falling rents and few buyers. One problem has been the unwillingness of insurers to provide adequate cover against terrorism for central London locations. German buying interest, much in evidence in recent weeks, appears to have faded. Barclays Bank's substantial involvement with property development ensured that Barclays shares were given a rough ride by the market after news of the suspension of trading in Rosehaugh stock. There were hints around the market that Barclays exposure to Rosehaugh could well amount to around Pounds 150m and specialists pointed out that Barclays had not yet provided for such a sum. Barclays shares dipped to 367p before stabilising and closing a net penny higher at 374p. A flurry of speculative buying drove TSB shares up 4 1/2 to 143 1/2 p with turnover reaching a hefty 7.1m. The latest political turbulence in Hong Kong brought renewed downward pressures on Standard Chartered and HSBC. The latter dropped 5 to 518p on heavy turnover of 10m and were additionally weighed down by a Lehman Brothers recommendation that investors 'take profits' in the stock. Lehman said 'growth at the core activities is likely to slow down and recovery elsewhere is likely to be modest; we expect HSBC's medium term profits growth to be below the average for the Hong Kong market.' Standard Chartered was also unsettled by speculation that Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, the Malaysian businessman, may be considering the sale of his near 13 per cent stake. Other leading high street banks were affected by the worries concerning the property sector. NatWest held at 394p, after 390p, and Lloyds closed 2 firmer at 502p, after 498p. The electricity and water sectors were persistently sold and the proceeds switched into the more fashionable cyclical stocks. But the Scottish generators were well supported after Scottish Power posted top of the range half-year profits and a better than expected interim dividend. Power shares settled 2 better at 223p. Paint manufacturer Manders jumped 20 to 221p after news that it had won a long-term contract to supply own brand paint to the 67-strong Wickes chain of DIY superstores. Several leading international stocks continued to be boosted by last week's favourable US data which some say points to the prospect of recovery. RTZ jumped 21 to 640p. US recovery hopes combined with vague takeover talk helped Cadbury-Schweppes add 9 to 453p and United Biscuits 11 to 347p. A stock overhang held back Kwik Save, the shares 13 lower at 731p. WH Smith was steady at 485p, pinned back by a downgrade from UBS Phillips and Drew. Worries over Our Price records were again cited. In engineers, an early buyer of TI Group caused a squeeze which sent the shares climbing 13 to 292p. Shares in Glynwed International bucked the strong market trend and shed 2 to 217p, after it was reported that its broker SG Warburg had reduced its current year profits forecast to Pounds 32m. The range of forecasts is now between Pounds 31 and Pounds 34m. Rolls-Royce rose to 5m as the shares continued to recover, breaking through the 100p barrier. They closed 5 up at 101p. Also recovering was tobacco machinery and packaging manufacturer Molins. The shares jumped 12 to 379p. Among motor stocks, Burndene were wanted and gained 11 to 201p. A leading securities house was said to have turned positive on T Cowie, helping the shares gain 6 to 137p. Erskine House were a good market ahead of tomorrow's interim figures and the shares firmed 5 to 75p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (128).

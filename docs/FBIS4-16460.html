			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Ignatyev and Sergey </F> Oleynik]    [Text] St. Petersburg April 18 TASS -- Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin pledged adherence to market reforms  and predicted that inflation may be curtailed to 7-8 per cent by  the end of the year if the budget drafted for 1994 is approved  by the State Duma.    "The course towards reforms, financial stabilisation and  economic restructuring remains the backbone of the Russian  economic policy", Chernomyrdin told a meeting of the governors  of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which  opened in the second biggest Russian city on Monday.    He recalled that in the first quarter of 1994 inflation was  below the 10 per cent level and predicted it would be further  curtailed to monthly 7-8 per cent by the end of the year "if the  planned parametres of the budget are preserved". The Russian  State Duma gave an outline approval to the draft budget, but  demanded that the government introduces certain corrections to  it.</p>

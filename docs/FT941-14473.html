			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Leading Article: First blood in red tape war Red tape is like jungle undergrowth. From time to time, politicians hack it back in their frustration. But as soon as their attention is distracted, the red tape creeps back again. The British government yesterday announced measures, including a deregulation bill, designed to put its campaign against red tape on a permanent footing. Not only have ministers drawn up a hit-list of regulations to be scrapped. Procedures are to be adopted to stop regulation creeping back. Cutting red tape is important if business is to be free to focus on wealth creation. Small businesses, in particular, find constant form-filling saps their energy and diverts them from running their companies. Much of the blame for over regulation has been attributed to Brussels. But Whitehall is as big a culprit, often elaborating European directives with reams of detailed prescriptions. There is also a tendency to respond to the latest scandal or disaster by drawing up regulations without assessing costs. The result is that, though the Tories have promised to cut red tape since they came into power in 1979, regulation is more pervasive than ever. Hence the need for a new approach. The centrepiece of this is a plan for ministers to be given so-called Henry VIII powers, allowing them to scrap many regulations without having to pass new primary legislation. The aim of this fast-track procedure is to clear out the accumulated mass of out-of-date rules without clogging up the parliamentary timetable. Other measures include a promise that new regulations will be subjected to a 'small business litmus test'. This will involve consulting with two or three typical small firms to ensure that the cost of complying with rules does not outweigh the benefits. There will also be a new deregulation task force under Mr Francis Maude, the former junior minister, to drive the initiative forward. The most controversial measure is undoubtedly the proposed Henry VIII power. The government has sought to deflect criticism that it is seeking to rule by decree by building in safeguards over how this power will be exercised. Before a regulation is scrapped, there will be public consultation, a breathing space of 40 days and debates in both houses of parliament. While this procedure will take the sting out of the criticism that ministers are behaving undemocratically, more could be done to ensure accountability. For example, a new select committee or standing committee for deregulation could be established to scrutinise ministerial proposals in detail. By contrast, the government's hit-list of regulations to be abolished is not that controversial. Some of the most useful, such as the promise to scrap compulsory audits for companies with a turnover of under Pounds 90,000, have already been announced. Other proposals, such as that permitting Scottish barbers to open on Sundays, are small beer. The main political fights will come when ministers address health and safety regulations. These were not tackled yesterday because the government is still waiting for conclusions from a Health and Safety Executive study. While ministers claim they are not deliberately ducking the issue, the absence of specific proposals in this area should certainly help smooth the passage of the legislation. Though the government has taken a welcome first step in its deregulation initiative, there is no guarantee of success. The challenge will be to maintain momentum.</p>

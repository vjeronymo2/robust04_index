			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei settles down to await June futures settlements SHARE PRICES lost ground on small-lot arbitrage-related selling, and volume fell to its lowest level since March 30 as investors remained inactive ahead of this Friday's June futures settlements, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 134.98 at 17,655.06, its lowest since May 1. The index opened at the day's high of 17,795.56 and fell to a low for the session of 17,390.31 in the afternoon. Volume was a mere 170m shares, against Friday's 182m. Declines outnumbered advances by 726 to 204, with 166 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 8.17 to 1,337.79, while in London the ISE/ Nikkei 50 index eased 3.78 to 1,054.18. The 225-issue Nikkei was depressed by arbitrageurs unwinding arbitrage-linked cash positions ahead of the June contracts expiry. While bargain hunting by public pension funds and individuals helped to recoup some of the initial losses, the buying failed to trigger institutional trading. Traders forecast a lull in market activity for the next few weeks. Foreign investor buying, which previously led activity in the market, has slowed. Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks which had been previously sought for short-term trading. Okamoto Industries retreated Y70 to Y1,310, but Meiji Milk Products, the day's most active issue, ended Y3 firmer at Y925. NEC receded Y25 to the year's low of Y885 on profit-taking by foreign investors. Other high-technology issues also weakened. Mitsui Trust and Banking fell Y19 to a low for the year of Y764. Investors were discouraged by reports of the bank's extension of additional loans to a consumer credit company facing financial trouble. Mitsubishi Paper Mills moved up Y4 to Y573 on its strong earnings forecast for the current year to next March. The company expects pre-tax profits to rise by 31 per cent and operating profits to increase by 12 times. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 235.40 to 20,252.26 in volume of 6.7m shares. Volume fell due to the lack of fresh news. Mori Seiki, the machine tool maker, lost Y10 to Y2,460, investors having become increasingly concerned over weak machine tool orders. Roundup THE LOWEST close for four years was recorded by the Seoul market in a Pacific Basin region that, with the exception of Manila and Jakarta, continued to weaken. Australia was closed. SEOUL's stabilisation fund failed to stop the market from falling: the composite index lost 5.55 to 563.65, but trading ended one hour earlier because of a computer failure. Turnover was put at Won162.5bn. The few gainers advanced on theme-backed buying. Sunkyong rose Won200 to Won20,400 and Yukong added Won400 at Won24,800. Both companies are competing for a contract to provide a second mobile telecommunications system. MANILA, by contrast, continued to break records, the composite index closing at another all-time high, up 63.07 at 1,580.28. Sentiment has been encouraged by the likelihood that Mr Fidel Ramos will soon be officially declared president after last month's elections. HONG KONG was sent lower by profit-taking among leading stocks. The Hang Seng index ended down 57.05 at 5,978.75 in turnover of HKDollars 3.83bn, against HKDollars 4.24bn on Friday. HSBC Holdings declined HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 46.75 following Lloyds Bank's withdrawal from the takeover battle for Midland Bank. Hutchison Whampoa dropped 40 cents to HKDollars 19.00 on unconfirmed rumours that it will soon have a rights issue. Cheung Kong relinquished 60 cents to HKDollars 25.90. SINGAPORE eased, with the Straits Times Industrial index dipping 3.14 to 1,500.58 in turnover of some SDollars 54.8m. TAIWAN, which rose in early dealing, closed down on balance after profit-taking. The weighted index lost a net 21.57 at 4,565.04. NEW ZEALAND saw lacklustre trading that was not helped by the closure of Australian markets. The NZSE-40 index slipped 2.60 to 1,572.30. JAKARTA rose on foreign buying of selected blue chips. The Jardine Fleming index gained 1.56 to 68.22. The market is shut today for the general election.</p>

Spurred by this rapid growth, hard currency income from  these  export-oriented firms saw a sharp growth of 60 percent over 1992  totalling about 190 billion yuan ($21.8 billion).    According to Qi Jinfa, director of the Bureau of Township  Enterprise Management under the Ministry of Agriculture, total  output and profits of rural enterprises both grew by at least 40  percent last year.    The total output value of rural enterprises last year was  expected to hit 2.9 trillion yuan ($333 billion) and total sales  volume 2.6 trillion yuan ($298 billion).    According to Qi, who was speaking yesterday in Beijing at  the  ongoing national conference on rural work the scale of township  enterprises increased as more and more capital flowed in.    It is estimated that at least 400 township firms had output  values exceeding 100 million yuan ($11 million) and more than  300 had sales value topping that figure.    With the deeper reform, the director pointed out more and  more rural firms introduced shareholding or cooperative systems  or formed enterprise groups to meet the needs of a more  competitive market.    About 10 percent of rural enterprises have become  shareholding or stockholding cooperative companies while nearly  100 rural industrial groups were established across the country.    "Township enterprises have played a significant role in the  booming rural economy and in absorbing extra rural labour  force," Qi said.    China has 900 million rural residents, the most in the  world,  and more and more farmers have left the farm since the beginning  of reform 16 years ago in an attempt to earn more money from  nonagricultural jobs.    Meanwhile, some 20-odd million rural enterprises are  mushrooming in the country's vast rural areas and their output  has topped one third of the gross national product (GNP) and  more than 60 percent of the total rural production value.    Last year, some 112 million former farmers were employed by  township enterprises, up 6 million over 1992, according to Qi.    And a total of more than 29 billion yuan ($3.33 billion) was  injected by rural firms into the construction of infrastructure  of various kinds in rural areas, making it a new and important  investment channel for agriculture.    Qi said at least 60 percent of farmers' increased net income  last year came from rural enterprises.    But some problems and difficulties still hinder the smooth  growth of rural enterprises, Qi pointed out.    He cited the shortage of funds as the biggest problem, in  addition to the lack of talent, especially in the less-developed  central and western regions.    And the introduction of a market economy, new systems of  taxation and other reform measures have also been a challenge to  township enterprises' development, Qi added.    The director said great efforts, including financial  support,  are needed to spur the development of the rural enterprises in  the central and western regions.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLL ON SMOKING  </P> <P> Only the tobacco industry could have the gall to poll 1,500 adults (less than  one in 100,000 or exactly 30 per state) and announce that a "majority" of  Americans do not support higher cigarette taxes or tougher anti-smoking  legislation (Tobacco Institute ad, Business, Jan. 9).  </P> <P> If so, how come Proposition 99 passed despite a massive and misleading campaign  by tobacco companies?  </P> <P> The statistics showing the damage and financial burdens smokers inflict on  others as well as themselves are too dreary and familiar to bear repeating --  not that they'd impress an industry that still denies smoking causes lung  cancer.  </P> <P> MAX SHAPIRO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

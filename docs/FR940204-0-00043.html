			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The tidewater goby occurs in loose aggregations of a few to several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundred individuals on the substrate in shallow water less than 1 meter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3 feet) deep (Swift  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1989), although gobies have been observed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depths of 1.5 to 2.3 meters (4.9 to 7.6 feet) (Dan Holland, University  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Southwestern Louisiana,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). Peak nesting activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commence in late April through early May, when male gobies dig a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vertical nesting burrow 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) deep in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean, coarse sand. Suitable water temperatures for nesting are 18 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (75.6 to 79.6 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) with salinities of 5 to 10 ppt. Male gobies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in the burrows to guard eggs, which are hung from the ceiling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walls of the burrow until hatching. Larval gobies are found midwater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> around vegetation until they become benthic (Swift  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the potential for year round spawning exists, it is probably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlikely because of seasonal low temperatures and disruptions of lagoons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during winter storms. Ecological studies performed at two sites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented spawning occurring as early as the first week in January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Swenson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). Although usually associated with lagoons, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tidewater goby has been documented in ponded freshwater habitats as far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as 8 kilometers (5 miles) upstream from San Antonio lagoon in Santa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barbara County (Irwin and Stoltz 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tidewater goby is discontinuously distributed throughout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, ranging from Tillas Slough (mouth of the Smith River) in Del  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Norte County south to Agua Hedionda Lagoon in San Diego County. Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of precipitous coastlines that preclude the formation of lagoons at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream mouths have created three natural gaps in the distribution of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goby. Gobies are apparently absent from three sections of the coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between: (1) Humboldt Bay and Ten Mile River, (2) Point Arena and Salmon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek, and (3) Monterey Bay and Arroyo del Oso.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Roughly 10 percent of the coastal lagoons presently containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations of tidewater goby are under Federal ownership. Over 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the remaining populations are either entirely or partly owned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and managed by the State of California. The remainder are privately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The tidewater goby was first classified by the Service as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category 2 species in 1982 (47 FR 58454). It was reclassified as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category 1 candidate in 1991 (56 FR 58804) based on status and threat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in Swift  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1989). Category 2 applies to taxa for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which information now in the possession of the Service indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not currently available to support a listing proposal. Category 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies to taxa for which the Service has on file substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on biological vulnerability and threats to support proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to list them as endangered or threatened species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 24, 1990, the Service received a petition from Dr. Camm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Swift, Associate Curator of Fishes at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> History, to list the tidewater goby as endangered (Swift 1990). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition, status surveys, and accompanying data describe the goby as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened because of past and continuing losses of coastal and riparian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitats within its historic range. The Service's finding that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition presented substantial information that the requested action may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be warranted was published on March 22, 1991 (56 FR 12146). Following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this finding, the Service initiated a status review on the tidewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goby.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act), as amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1982, requires the Secretary to make a finding within 12 months of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date a petition is received as to whether or not the requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is warranted. On December 11, 1992, the Service published a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to list the tidewater goby as an endangered species (57 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 58770). The proposed rule constituted the 12-month finding that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioned action was warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

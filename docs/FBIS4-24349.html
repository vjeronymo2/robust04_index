			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition parties yesterday dissociated themselves  from the idea of forming a united army, advocated by Zimbabwe  United Movement co-president Mr Edgar Tekere, to fight the  ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic  Front] during the current campaign for next year's general  elections.    Opposition leaders who were attending the Zim-rights  consultative conference in Harare, however, emphasised that they  were urging members of their parties to defend themselves should  they be attacked by anybody for holding legitimate rallies.    Mr Tekere was quoted at the weekend as having said "Let us  build an opposition army of "Angels with Swords" to put down the  Mugabe-ZANU (PF) evil.    "Let us mobilise and recruit from among all able-bodied  Zimbabweans, irrespective of party-political affiliation, for  our "Angels with Swords" to put down, for all time, any  temptation to resort to party-political violence."    Yesterday the president of ZANU (Ndonga), Rev Ndabaningi  Sithole, said that if it is to be an "Army of Angels", to him  that amounted to a call that the people involved should be ready  for any eventuality.    "The angels are always there," he said. "They swing into  action when there is need. In this sense I am thinking of  spiritual angels.    "Ndonga says if we are attacked we will attack. If they kill  us we will kill them. If they disappear us (sic) we will  disappear them."    The vice-president of Forum Party of Zimbabwe, Mr Washington  Sansole, said what the party chief, Dr Enoch Dumbutshena, meant  by urging members to arm themselves with spears and axes had  been taken out of context.    "It (the statement) is attracting confusion to what the  original purpose of Dumbutshena was," he said. "The emphasis  was on defensive action...Only if you are attacked within your  home.    "Past experience," he said, "is the invitation for  house-to-house campaign is a euphemism to violence.    "ZANU (PF) has never been successful in holding peaceful  elections. If our supporters encounter a situation which  requires them to take defensive action they should not be afraid  to do so."    Mr Sansole spurned the idea of "Angels with Swords".    Rev Sithole said there should be an interim government in  the  run-up to, and during the, elections.    "The problem is changing the attitudes of the people," he  said. "The problem is the powers-that-be. That is why we, in  ZANU (Ndonga), believe that up to the time of the elections  tremendous popular pressure has to be brought on the Government  to allow the introduction of an interim government.    "People are losing confidence in the Government," he said.  "Once they (people) adopt an interim government, the confidence  will be restored."    Rev Sithole said an interim government would be a barometer  indicating whether (ZANU) (PF) was sincere in saying next year's  general elections would be free and fair.    Rejecting this idea, Rev Sithole said, was an indication  that  the Government was not sincere in its intentions.    He said that, with the interim government in place, the  present government would go on as it is, but some people from  "reputed" opposition parties would be brought into the executive.    "Each of these (opposition) parties would give one or two  people to be in interim government, which will guarantee free  and fair elections."</p>

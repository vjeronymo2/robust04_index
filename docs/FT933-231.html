			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Brussels set to accuse US over Saudi air order THE European Commission is expected to accuse the US next week of breaching international trade agreements to secure for US manufacturers a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.96bn) order for up to 60 aircraft from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian airline, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent. EC trade negotiators are expected to lodge a complaint with US trade representatives at a meeting in Washington next week, claiming that the US has broken last year's Gatt civil aircraft accord by offering Saudi Arabia special inducements to acquire US rather than European Airbus airliners. Mr Jean Pierson, chief executive of the European Airbus consortium, is understood to have written to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, to alert him of a visit to Saudi Arabia by Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, at the end of this week. Mr Pena is going to Saudi Arabia today, together with Mr David Hinson, administrator of the US Federal Aviation Administration, to sign a new bilateral aviation agreement between the two countries. He is also expected to discuss with Saudi officials the imminent Saudia aircraft order. The EC is worried that the US is exerting political pressure on the Saudi government to award the lion's share of the Dollars 6bn aircraft order to US manufacturers, including Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The US Export-Import Bank has already announced it would provide loan guarantees to finance purchase of US airliners. In his letter, Mr Pierson drew Sir Leon's attention to the risk of the US trying to link the new aviation agreement with a Saudia order for US-made aircraft, according to EC trade sources. 'The opportunity of linkage of the two issues is self-evident,' Mr Pierson wrote. In turn, this would breach article 4 of the Gatt civil aircraft code which stipulates that governments should not 'exert unreasonable pressure' to support their manufacturers to win export orders. The award of airline landing and route rights is included in the Gatt list of prohibited inducements. The EC complaint coincides with a concerted campaign launched this week by British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale of France, the three leading European aerospace companies in the Airbus consortium, against what they claim are US efforts to undermine the Gatt aircraft agreement.</p>

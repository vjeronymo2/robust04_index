			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Southern EC states fight move to end tied aid SOUTHERN EC states have opposed a European Commission proposal, backed by the Dutch, for the EC to remove curbs tying much of their national development aid to purchase of goods and service within their own countries. The first serious debate for years by EC aid ministers on the issue of 'untying' development aid ended on Monday night, with France, Spain and Italy opposing any weakening of 'national procurement' restrictions still attached to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) aid that EC states give the Third World each year. The southern three argued that, while untying aid might give developing countries better value for money if they could shop around the EC for the best deal, it would cut overall aid because taxpayers in one EC state would not want to see aid-related contracts going to the industry of another EC state. The Commission proposal won full backing only from Mr Jan Pronck, Dutch aid minister, who had commissioned it when the Dutch held the EC Council presidency last autumn. Lady Chalker, UK aid minister, with some German and Danish support, suggested a gradual untying of aid. Ministers asked the Commission to make a further study, but the EC executive seems unlikely to produce a formal draft directive to abolish tied aid, as Mr Pronck has urged. This week's debate showed France, Italy and Spain form a blocking minority in the EC Council. EC aid, via the Community and national budgets, amounted to Dollars 26.7bn in 1988, (not including small amounts from Greece, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal which do not belong to the OECD's Development Aid Committee). Some 60 per cent is untied, including money channelled through Brussels to some 70 developing country members of the EC's Lome Convention. The remaining aid from EC states is totally tied (requiring all contracts be placed with companies, or contain a minimum national content, from the donor country), or partially tied.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Tube power failure traps 20,000 commuters A fault in 70-year-old cabling emerged as the cause of power failure that halted much of the London Underground network yesterday, trapping more than 20,000 passengers in tunnels. An unprecedented breakdown of both the main power supply and an emergency back-up system halted trains across London during the morning rush-hour. Further trouble stopped trains during the evening peak. Engineers struggled last night to remedy the fault, but the capital will face the possibility of a second day of disruption today. London Underground says no Central Line trains will run east of Liverpool Street. The scale of yesterday's breakdown prompted calls from business organisations, the rail unions and retailers for additional government spending on the hard-pressed Underground system. This year, London Underground published a study of its investment needs, arguing for spending at least Pounds 900m a year in the next 10 years on track, bridges, escalators, signalling and trains. It did not mention power supplies. Yesterday's disruption began with a power failure in west London at 7.10am. Power was restored 20 minutes later but at 8am primary and back-up power to much of the District, Central and Metropolitan lines failed. More than 20,000 people on 26 Tube trains were trapped in darkened tunnels for up to 3 1/2 hours. 'It is unprecedented for both systems to fail at the same time,' an official said. Engineers traced the fault to cabling on the Central Line between Bow and Leyton, east London, but were still unsure about the exact cause of the breakdown. Empty trains were run throughout the afternoon to test the system and buses were used to carry passengers on parts of the Central Line. Seventy-year-old cables are not unusual on the Underground - many escalators are more than 60 years old. Cables are tested daily electronically while physical inspections are carried out less regularly. Business organisations and retailers said it was difficult to assess the impact of such a widespread failure but the Confederation of British Industry estimated the cost to business at tens of millions of pounds. 'It is vitally important that the government makes enough money available to complete the Underground's modernisation programme,' commented Mr Alex Jan, CBI transport policy co-ordinator. Oxford Street, one of London's main shopping streets, was quieter than normal but the British Retail Consortium said shoppers would either spend their money locally or delay their purchases, so overall spending levels would not be depressed. Companies reported that most employees managed to straggle into work. Journeys that normally took an hour were taking up to three hours, travellers reported. London Underground said yesterday's events would form the subject of a senior management review. London rails over Tube snarl-up, Page 9</p>

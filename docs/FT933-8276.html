			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Single market aids larger companies - In a Nutshell Small businesses have done badly from the creation of the European single market with, in the early stages at least, most benefits going to large companies, according to a survey* by the 3i/Cranfield European Enterprise Centre. Fifty four per cent of companies employing fewer than 50 people reported increased competition, while only 33 per cent had boosted exports. Among larger companies (with up to 500 employees) 46 per cent had experienced more competition, but 44 per cent raised exports. German companies appeared to be planning to make the most of the single market with just over half setting up some form of collaborative deal in Europe. In other countries between 20 and 28 per cent had done so. *Attitudes to Europe, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield, Bedford, MK43 0AL. Tel. 0234 751122. Free.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dresser's Security Division has a diamond drill bit manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. Dresser's total 1992 worldwide sales of diamond drill bits were about $10.4 million and its U.S. sales of that product were about $4.7 million. Baroid produces diamond drill bits at manufacturing facilities located in Houston, Texas, Brussels, Belgium, and Leduc, Alberta, Canada. Baroid's 1992 worldwide sales of diamond drill bits were approximately $40 million, and its domestic sales were about $3.6 million. Baroid's domestic diamond drill bit operations are handled through its DBS subsidiary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint alleges that the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids is a relevant product market for antitrust purposes. A small, significant nontransitory price increase would not cause customers to use another product instead of drilling fluid. The United States is a relevant geographic market for the drilling fluid market within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Complaint states that this market is highly concentrated and would become substantially more concentrated as a result of the merger of Baroid and Dresser. Three companies dominate the drilling fluid business in the United States, including M&hyph;I and Baroid Drilling. Based on 1992 sales data,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> M&hyph;I was the largest firm in the drilling fluid market, accounting for about 29 percent of sales, while Baroid Drilling, the second largest firm, accounted for about 22 percent. The merger of Dresser and Baroid would increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index by about 1200 points to a post-acquisition level of more than 2800 points. The merger of Dresser and Baroid will diminish competition in the drilling fluid market by enabling the remaining competitors more likely, more successfully, and more completely to engage in coordinated interaction that harms customers. The increase in concentration will result in higher prices for drilling fluids, which will increase the costs of oil and gas exploration and development in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Successful new entry into the United States drilling fluid market is difficult and time-consuming. Moreover, the expansion of fringe firms would be insufficient to counteract or deter a small but significant nontransitory price increase. To gain a significant market share, a firm must have an adequate, reliable, and independent source of barite and bentonite and a significant research and development capability. Because the costs to the customer of product failure are so high, the firm must also have a reputation for providing a reliable product and dependable service. The establishment of such a reputation takes years and requires a significant investment of resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint also alleges that the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits is a relevant product market for antitrust purposes. A small, significant nontransitory increase in the price of diamond drill bits would not cause customers to use another product. The United States is a relevant geographic market for this product market within the meaning of section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Complaint states that this market is concentrated, with five companies, including Dresser and Baroid, accounting for approximately 90 percent of all diamond drill bit sales in the United States. These five companies have established reputations for providing dependable diamond drill bits for almost all types of drilling operations, backed by extensive product research, development, and testing. For a significant number of drilling projects, only these five companies have the product quality, performance record, and engineering support required to be considered by customers as a supplier of diamond drill bits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States diamond drill bit market would become significantly more concentrated as a result of the merger of Dresser and Baroid. Based on 1992 sales data, Dresser was the third largest firm in the diamond drill bit market, accounting for about 13 percent of sales, while Baroid, the fifth largest firm, accounted for about 10 percent. The merger of Dresser and Baroid would result in a competitor having almost 25 percent of U.S. diamond drill bit sales, and would increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman index by more than 250 points to a post-acquisition level of more than 2300. As a result of the acquisition, four firms would account for approximately 90 percent of sales. The merger of Dresser and Baroid will diminish competition in the United States diamond drill bit market by enabling the remaining competitors more likely, more successfully, and more completely to engage in coordinated interaction that harms customers. This increase in concentration would result in higher prices for diamond drill bits, which will increase the cost of oil and gas exploration and development in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entry into the United States market for diamond drill bits is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. To enter the diamond drill bit market and gain a significant market share, a firm must build a manufacturing and research and development facility, develop diamond bits, and establish a reputation for the efficiency, durability, and reliability of its product under actual drilling conditions in a wide variety of different geographic and geological conditions. Because the performance of a bit is critical to assuring the lowest possible drilling costs, and the risk of financial loss due to bit failure is substantial, customers are generally very reluctant to purchase bits from a new supplier that lacks a proven performance record. It would take several years and significant investment for a new supplier to establish a performance record and obtain the sales that are necessary to support the substantial engineering, technical services, and research and development capabilities possessed by the five major competitors in this market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

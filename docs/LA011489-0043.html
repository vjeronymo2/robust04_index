			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE TASK FORCE MAPS ATTACK ON GROWING PROBLEM OF HOMELESS  </P> <P> The visible increase in the homeless people who drift aimlessly along  Oceanside's streets and find shelter in doorways has spurred city and community  leaders to establish a task force to find the best ways to help the city's  needy.  </P> <P> The Homeless Task Force, established earlier this week, will try to coordinate  the efforts of social agencies that serve the city's homeless, said  Councilwoman Lucy Chavez, who presented the group's objectives on Friday.  </P> <P> The 15-member task force, which includes representatives from social agencies  and religious and business leaders, hopes to identify the specific needs of the  different groups of people that constitute the city's homeless population, said  Chavez, the group's chairwoman.  </P> <P> "There are various types of homeless people, various degrees of homelessness,"  Chavez said. "There are the migrant workers, the street people, homeless  families, homeless teen-agers, the mentally ill and those who have drug  problems.  </P> <P> "There are various reasons why people become homeless, and they have to be  treated separately," she said. "There is no one solution."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Replace Agencies  </P> <P> The city's task force has no plans to take over existing agencies or finance  homeless services, Chavez said. But it will assist such agencies in finding  funds to expand and help establish a list of short- and long-term priorities.  </P> <P> "If we can figure out a way to immediately help, say the homeless street  people, especially with the recent cold weather, we will," Chavez said. "But  the task force was not established to be a Band-Aid. This will be a long,  analytical study to find a long-term solution, not a quick fix."  </P> <P> For example, task force members are likely to consider establishing  "transitional housing" in the city, Chavez said.  </P> <P> Such housing plans provide homeless people with temporary residences and often  special assistance to enable them to regain autonomy. Transitional housing can  include medical care, counseling, child care and job-training programs, Chavez  explained.  </P> <P> "We're not interested in the quick fix where we house them overnight and kick  them out the next day," Chavez said. "For those people that can be  rehabilitated, we want to find a way to get them back into the mainstream and  be productive."  </P> <P> The group's immediate goal is to assess the size and composition of the city's  homeless population, which is believed to have increased in recent years. The  task force's inaugural meeting is scheduled for Jan. 30.  </P> <P> "We don't have any statistics" about the size of the homeless population, she  said, "but you can see the homeless street people sleeping under door fronts  and under bridges. We're getting more phone calls from people concerned or  complaining about the homeless."  </P> <P> Obtaining such statistical information is necessary to receive state or federal  assistance, said Councilwoman Melba Bishop, who is also on the task force.  </P> <P> "We intend to find as many funding sources as possible," Bishop said. "But,  when we apply, the first thing we'll be asked is, 'How did you document your  need?' If we can't tell them, we won't be getting any money."  </P></p>

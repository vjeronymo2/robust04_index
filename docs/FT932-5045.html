			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: China's antique treasures IF YOU are in the mood for some serious shopping in Hong Kong then you might consider some proper antique Chinese furniture. For those who like the thrill of the chase, who like rummaging in scruffy shops, then there is a lot of fun to be had walking up and down the hills and backstreets of Central District. Head for Hollywood Road, a bare ten minutes walk from the Mandarin, and potter round the 'ladder streets' - you will find everything from posh set-ups discreetly exhibiting a few rarified pieces to little hole-in-the wall shops where you can hardly see the contents for the dust. If you prefer to have the hazard removed and want a certain source of well-priced authenticated Chinese antiques, visit Beatrice Owen. She has been collecting Chinese and European antiques for years. Finding herself in Hong Kong she set about learning Cantonese and studying Chinese furniture. She makes regular forays into mainland China buying furniture, carpets and other traditional artefacts. They are almost invariably in poor condition when she buys them but she has two Chinese carpenters who repair, restore and sand down in the traditional way. She will not buy furniture that has been restored on the mainland. 'The passion,' she says, 'for care has gone, they use modern materials and glues whereas my carpenters make their own tools and use only the old traditional methods.' Her tastes runs to simple, country-style furniture. She does not go in for the over- decorated, ornate pieces that sit uneasily in Western homes. Her shop is at 40 Hollywood Road, Central, Hong Kong. It always holds a selection of restored pieces and artefacts - a pair of late 18th century elm wardrobes from the North at HKDollars 35,000 (approx Pounds 330) each, butcher's tables (HKDollars 3,200), camphor chests (HK Dollars 1,100) and porcelain, silver, children's toys and shoes. Much more fun, though, is to visit her warehouse - ring the shop (telephone 850-7813) and she will make an appointment. Everything there is piled high, covered in dust, mostly unrestored and much as it arrived from the mainland. Here is a perfect chance to test your eye. Which is the camphor chest with best grain, the butcher's table of the most pleasing dimensions, the cupboard with the finest lines? Prices seemed exceedingly reasonable - you could buy a fine piece of cabinet work, a genuine antique, for less than half the price the equivalent piece would cost in the West. Owen will organise packing, shipping and all the tedious paper work. The other great bonus is that not only is the antique furniture much more beautiful than most modern repro but anything over 100 years old can be imported free of duty.</p>

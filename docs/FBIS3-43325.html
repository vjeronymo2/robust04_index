			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tigrinya </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment of an interview with President Isayas </F> Afeweki by unidentified local reporters; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Reporter] It has been almost  a year now since Eritrea achieved its sovereignty. Despite  this, we are still using the Ethiopian currency. When will we  stop using this currency?    [Isayas, in Arabic followed by Tigrinya translation] We will  continue with the said currency until an ongoing study has been  accomplished. Eritrean currency will be printed after all the  requirements have been fulfilled. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] What is the objective of this so-called jihad  movement? Are there any religious problems in Eritrea?    [Isayas, in Tigrinya] What we should understand here is that  the problem is not the political situation in Eritrea. [passage  omitted] Even if the jihad movement objectives are to intensify  religion in Eritrea, we are not new believers. Religion has  strong roots in our society. [passage omitted] We should not  see this new incident as a problem because this issue is not the  problem of Eritrea. It is a problem that is coming from outside  Eritrea.    What we should understand is that this issue is of a foreign  origin. There is no reason for foreigners to come and fight  here. The objective is to destabilize the prevailing peace and  stability of the region. [passage omitted] It is not a big  threat to us. Our fear is that we do not want the existing  relationship we have with our neighbors to be affected as a  result of the prevailing situation.    [Reporter] Eritrea is one of the countries of the region  which is actively working to safeguard peace and stability in  our region. If we turn to the question of Sudan, Eritrea is one  of the countries which is working hard to solve the problem of  southern Sudan peacefully, so why is Sudan taking a hostile  stance?    [Isayas] It is not a secret that the Sudanese Government and  its political forces are the ones who are supporting them by  giving them space to (?organize). It is also no secret that the  (?movement) is supported by forces from other regions. It is  difficult to name them and they are not officially connected  with countries. However, it is not the right time to name them.  The war was declared a long time ago. We could have responded  negatively, but this is not our wish, because the consequences  would be very bad. [passage omitted]    Despite all these things, we will not stop supporting Sudan  or strengthening our relations with Sudan. We will continue to  maintain our tolerant relationship with Sudan. Those who are  actively involved in the jihad movement are the frustrated ones.  If the movement had the people's support it could have not  declared such a war against the people.    [Reporter] There are some forces who want to destabilize the  stability of this region using religion as a cover. The jihad  in Eritrea is coming from Sudan. Kenya and Ethiopia are said to  have the same problem. Is there any plan to solve this common  problem jointly?    [Isayas] Our policy is to include these matters in our  bilateral relations, and we will continue to do so. It is  appropriate to issue this message on the regional and  international level. Since the problem is coming from Sudan, we  will try to solve it with Sudan. If other countries are facing  the same problem, then I think those countries should also try  to solve it on the same basis. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today is the last day of meetings that the  rapporteurs for Romania of the Council of Europe are having in  our country.    The first meeting this morning took place with members of  the  bar of lawyers and then with representatives of the Association  of Former Political Detainees, the Civic Alliance, and of the  Associations of Former Revolutionaries. After 1030 the  rapporteurs met with leaders of nongovernmental organizations in  the area of human rights.    These first meetings permitted the representatives of those  organizations to brief the rapporteurs on their activities and  on the way the commitments that our country assumed when it was  admitted to the Council of Europe are being fulfilled.    Asked by Friedrich Koenig which of these commitments would  be  given primary importance, Senator Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu  emphasized that they were human rights and political rights. At  the same time, Ticu Dumitrescu criticized President Ion  Iliescu's attitude and the attitude by the majority party,  which, in his opinion, after Romania's admission to the Council  of Europe, prove that they do not want to renounce the monopoly  of power.    Ana Blandiana handed a letter to the rapporteurs whereby the  Council of Europe is informed about the Civic Alliance's  intention to set up an institute of studies on totalitarianism  under the aegis of the Council of Europe.    Nicolae Stefanescu-Draganesti, LADO [League for the Defense  of Human Rights] president, demanded the results of the  investigations on the 1990 miners' incursion when, in his  opinion, hundreds of people were killed.    The meeting between the rapporteurs and the justice  minister,  the interior minister, the prosecutor general, and the president  of the Supreme Justice Court ended shortly before 1300. On this  occasion, Justice Minister Gavril Iosif Chiuzbaian presented the  progress of the reform process in this ministry and announced  that by 13 August 1994 all judges will be granted tenure.    Minister of interior Doru Ioan Taracila, presented the stage  of the reform process in the ministry he headed affirming that  1,654 people who have committed violations have been removed  from the police so far, and that the military magistracy has  been notified about other 320 such cases of employees of the  Ministry. He also said that he has not noted any cases of  censorship by the police or cases when correspondence was  opened. He emphasized that, in the shortest time possible, he  would provide the rapporteurs with information on cases of  censorship reported to him, and that he would take measures to  punish all the guilty people.</p>

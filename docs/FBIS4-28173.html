			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has test-fired  three silkworm missiles in the past one week and one of them hit  the target, a military expert in North Korea [as received] said  Tuesday.    "From their Sinsang-ri missile base near Wonsan, North Korea  test-fired three silkworm missiles toward the East Sea [Sea of  Japan] since May 31," he said.    Only one of the three hit the target about 160 kilometers  away with two others having failed, the expert said.    The missiles with a range of 200 kilometers were an improved  model of the Chinese-made 95km-range silkworm missile, he said.    North Korea had in the past test-fired missiles from their  Hwajin-ri missile launching pad North of Pyongyang in the  direction of Sinmi-do island in the West Sea, and this was the  first time they test-fired missiles toward the East Sea, he  added.</p>

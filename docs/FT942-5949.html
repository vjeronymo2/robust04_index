			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Unionists angry at Adams demands Unionist politicians yesterday reacted angrily to the latest preconditions for peace in Northern Ireland spelled out by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. With unionist leaders warning that support for loyalist violence is growing in the community because of its growing sense of alienation, the Rev Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party leader, attacked the 'sell-out' which he claimed would see the British government give in to the latest republican demands. Mr Adams called in a speech to European election workers in Belfast for a full amnesty for IRA prisoners, whose 'speedy release' was a matter of urgent concern. He said the government would have to legislate away provisions which gave unionists a veto over political and constitutional change. It would also have to accept the right of the Irish people to national self-determination. Sinn Fein has said that it would respond to the Downing Street declaration after next week's Euro-elections, although the government says acceptance of the document is not a prerequisite for republicans to join the peace process. Mr Paisley said he feared that Mr Adams would succeed in his request for the speedy release of all long-term prisoners. The government, however, has committed itself against any amnesty for convicted terrorists. Mr Paisley said the call for an end to the unionist veto meant that the majority unionist vote in Northern Ireland had to be subverted and the province forced into an all-Ireland republic. Mr Dick Spring, Irish deputy premier, yesterday criticised Sinn Fein for delaying its response to the Downing Street declaration and again stressed that the IRA would have to enact a permanent cessation of violence before it could join the peace process. He told the Dail: 'It has to be permanent; there can be no equivocation about that.' He added: 'There is little point in attempting to bring people into political dialogue if they are doing so on the basis of 'we will give it a try, but if it does not work, we will go back to the bomb and the bullet'.'</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington turnover up 16% Higher volumes, acquisitions, and the weak pound helped group turnover at Pilkington rise by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn in the half year to end-September, against Pounds 1.2bn. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said better volumes contributed 7 percentage points of the gain and exchange gains made 6 percentage points. The Pounds 95m purchase of Heywood Williams' glass division added 4 percentage points, but lower prices cut sales by 1 percentage point. Group operating profits rose from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 57m, after exceptional profits of Pounds 300,000 (losses Pounds 1m). European glass profits fell from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 16.5m, but those from North America bounced from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 15.4m, helped by higher volumes and prices. The Heywood Williams business contributed Pounds 3.4m to operating profits. The Sola spectacle lens subsidiary, sold after the period end, made a profit of Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 5.6m). Mr Roger Leverton, chief executive, said capacity utilisation in Europe was about 88 per cent, after taking two float lines out for 3 and 4 months. Weak prices in continental Europe - down 6 per cent in Germany  - had prevented an 8 per cent rise in UK prices from sticking. In North America, higher volumes had increased capacity utilisation to over 90 per cent had enabled a 5.5 per cent price rise in June and a 6.5 per cent rise in November. Profits from the southern hemisphere rose from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 25.3m. Cost cutting more than offset the effects of inflation on costs, and the group had taken Pounds 200m out of annual costs over three years, with a 20 per cent reduction in jobs. Earnings were 0.4p (losses 0.8p).</p>

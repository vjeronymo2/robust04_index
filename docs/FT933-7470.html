			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / 100 workers paid off at Timex A FURTHER 100 workers were paid off yesterday at the troubled Timex factory in Dundee, Tayside. There are 100 employees left at the plant, although closure is still 'several weeks away', Timex said. When the factory's closure was announced in mid-June after a bitter dispute the plant employed 375, of whom 280 had been hired to replace workers sacked earlier in the year. The Scottish TUC is to hold a protest rally in Dundee today.</p>

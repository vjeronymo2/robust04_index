			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Britain to reappraise evacuations: Airlift of wounded from Bosnian capital stepped up as 39 adults and children leave THIRTY-NINE sick or injured adults and children were flown from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, yesterday for treatment in Britain and Sweden. A further five are expected to be flown out by the Irish government in the next few days. Amid claims that the operation had become an emotive publicity stunt, with insufficient co-ordination among the different aid groups, the British government yesterday said that it would be 'reassessing' the situation before it pressed ahead with an offer to send another aircraft to evacuate civilians. Officials with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the former Yugoslavia admitted the recent publicity over the evacuations had left them with more offers of hospital beds than they had patients for. Nearly 300 beds had been offered for injured Bosnians by European and Moslem governments, as well as private American groups, although UNHCR officials had only been wanting to evacuate some 25 victims a week from Sarajevo, it said. UN officials stressed more aid was needed across the region, and reiterated that with funding for its Bosnian operations due to run out in October, the UNHCR needed more money. Following the Serb withdrawal from mountains around Sarajevo this weekend and plans for resumed peace talks in Geneva today, the situation around Sarajevo was fairly quiet, a spokesman for the UN protection force yesterday said. However, fighting was continuing yesterday between Moslem and Croatian forces in central Bosnia. This was preventing aid convoys from reaching those regions, he added. 'Things are opening up around Sarajevo. But in central Bosnia things are still very difficult, although this hasn't had the headlines,' the spokesman said. As the diplomatic wrangling over the humanitarian efforts continued, the British government sought to play down allegations that there was too great a focus on child victims from Sarajevo, following the emotional press coverage of Irma Hadzimuratovic, a five-year-old victim of mortar shrapnel who was evacuated by the British government last week. The 21 patients evacuated to Britain yesterday would be treated at nine NHS hospitals, with the cost of the air ambulance being met by the Saudi Arabian royal family, it added. Meanwhile, Bosnian Croats threatened to walk out of today's peace talks and stop aid convoys into central Bosnia unless the international community gave treatment to their sick and wounded comparable to that received by the Moslems.</p>

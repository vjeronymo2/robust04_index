			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINING OUT: RELISHING SINGAPORE CUISINES  </P> <P> Ask people in Singapore for the name of a good restaurant and they will always  ask what kind of food you want to eat.  </P> <P> Say Chinese, Indian, Malay or even French, and they will again ask what kind.  Variety is the spice of dining in Singapore, and the variety can be bewildering  to visitors.  </P> <P> Take the Banana Leaf Apolo restaurant. Scrupulously clean, the tables have  large pieces of banana leaf at each setting.  </P> <P> We were warmly welcomed. Soon after sitting we were surrounded by waiters  carrying steel pots filled with steamed rice, curried vegetables and papadums  -- a crisp Indian bread made from chickpeas.  </P> <P> Stop here and the bill will run about $3 Singapore per person, for all you can  eat. If you want meat (we tried a moist and very spicy chicken and fishhead  curry) the bill will double. Add lassi, a yogurt drink, or a beer, and you  might spend $10. You can eat with a spoon or with your fingers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cheap Dining  </P> <P> Dining in Singapore is ridiculously cheap. We figure that about $30 Singapore a  day will buy three squares and a couple of snacks in between. What you get for  that is remarkable. (Prices listed are in Singapore dollars that recently  exchanged for $1.85 per $1 U.S.)  </P> <P> But if your travels are to include taxis, find out where you are going from the  hotel concierge, take a map and be prepared to direct the driver.  </P> <P> Annalakshmi restaurant is another Indian experience. It is vegetarian cooking  at its best, and the selection of vegetable and rice dishes is huge. We chose  the buffet for $15.  </P> <P> You fill up big silver platters and small bowls with noodles, lentil soup,  curried vegetables such as squash, potatoes and onions, and various chutneys  and condiments, including a wonderfully cooling dish of radishes in yogurt.  Fragrant tea, mango lassi (a habit-forming drink of yogurt and ripe mango) and  hot bread were brought to the table.  </P> <P> The room was quiet, decorated with rich fabrics and filled with Indian  families. The restaurant is part of a cultural foundation that offers classes  in Indian dancing and musical instruments. You may see a class in progress in  one of the spaces outside. Several shops sell costume jewelry and clothing used  in dances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hawker Stalls  </P> <P> Singapore's fascination with food is most evident in the famed hawker stalls  that are now found in the various food centers around the city. "The hawkers  are an old Singapore tradition," said Violet Oon, an expert on the cuisines of  Singapore.  </P> <P> "The hawkers used to come through the neighborhoods with bicycle carts laden  with food. We could recognize them by their calls, and would know when the  especially good ones were coming. The stalls you see today are the descendants  of those carts, often with the same families running them. Today a hawker  license is the hardest thing to get in Singapore. Everyone wants one; it's good  business."  </P> <P> On Oon's recommendation we sought out the Ellenborough Market Stalls.  </P> <P> Ellenborough's stalls are on the third and fourth floors of a large Chinese  market, with vendors selling huge quantities of dried seafood.  </P> <P> We stopped on the third floor and selected a variety of grilled and steamed  fish, a great cabbage broth and chili noodles, all for about $3. The hawkers  were delighted to see us and helped us select local specialities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Many Westerners  </P> <P> Oon had assured us that Chinese business leaders regularly entertain at  fourth-floor stalls but that the food seemed to be about the same. Dining at  Ellenborough is a real adventure, and you won't see many other Westerners.  </P> <P> Most visitors head for the stalls at Newton Center just off Newton Circus. At  night the crush of people can be overwhelming, although the hawkers will help  you find a table from which you can venture forth to select from dozens of  stalls. (One member of the party should stay at the table to maintain  possession of it.)  </P> <P> Satay vendors serve chicken or beef grilled on bamboo sticks with a spicy  peanut sauce -- 20 came to $6. We ordered two dozen chili prawns for $15 and  the huge shrimp arrived whole and ready to be opened by hand.  </P> <P> We ordered Pomfret, a small local fish that was grilled and served on a banana  leaf. Fruit stalls sold fresh litchi, durian, rambutans and star fruit.  Mangosteens were in season, so we bought a huge bunch of the sweet fruit for  $8.  </P> <P> We also tried hawker stalls at Empress Place, where we breakfasted on chili  noodles for $1.50. At Bugis Square the won-ton noodles in broth and the chicken  rice were both excellent. The Satay Club is well known and popular, but we  preferred the satay at Newton Circus.  </P> <P> You can feel secure eating anywhere in Singapore, as the country has one of the  toughest health departments anywhere, and each stall and restaurant is visited  daily by a health inspector.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Food Guidebooks  </P> <P> Because food is a national obsession in Singapore, the quality and variety is  exceptional. The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (8484 Wilshire Blvd., Suite  510, Beverly Hills 90211), phone (213) 852-1901 offers several guidebooks to  eating in Singapore.  </P> <P> Or you might consider joining one of Violet Oon's culinary tours. They are an  easy way to sample a variety of Singaporean cuisines. She also is responsible  for a monthly publication called "The Food Paper" that provides information on  what is new in Singapore dining.  </P> <P> Near the end of our stay in Singapore Oon suggested that we try another side of  Singapore food. We found ourselves at the Brasserie at the Marco Polo Hotel.  </P> <P> "It's a well-loved restaurant in Singapore," she said. "It gets a lot of local  business and the food is very good." We agreed, as we dined on fresh white  asparagus flown in from France, green asparagus from Thailand and a wonderful  chicken that came from a local farm.  </P> <P> You really can dine around the world in Singapore.  </P> <P> Recommended: Annalakshmi, Excelsior Hotel Shopping Center, No. 02-10, 5 Coleman  St. The Banana Leaf Apolo, 56-58 Race Course Road. Brasserie La Rotonde, Omni  Marco Polo Hotel, 247 Tanglin Road. Ellenborough Market Stalls, Tew Chew  Street. Violet Oon, The Food Paper, P.O. Box 102, Farrer Road Post Office,  Singapore 9128. Other restaurants and hawker centers are listed in the booklet,  "Singapore 101 Meals," available from the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board.  </P></p>

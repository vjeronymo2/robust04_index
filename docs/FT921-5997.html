			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Property: Renters rally to plug gap caused by sales slump - Assured tenancies have helped spur the London market RESIDENTIAL letting specialists have been smiling alongside their grim-faced sales colleagues over the past two years. For the rental business has largely been unaffected by the recession and demand has held up well. The sharp fall in trading activity in the City, and heavy job losses at international finance houses, has reduced the number of fresh-faced US bankers leasing flats with money no object. On the other hand, more international corporations have chosen London as their Euro-base in the run-up to the integration of EC markets at the end of the year. The two trends seem to have balanced each other out. While even the most generous international corporations are tightening budgets for executive accommodation overseas, the number of business renters in London remains high. They are supplemented by an increasing number of domestic tenants who are choosing to rent rather than buy. Domestic renters, and more UK landlords, have been drawn back into this market by the assured tenancies created in the 1988 Housing Act. The change in the law enables landlords to charge open-market rents and to be certain of recovering their property at the end of an agreed period. Until the act, landlords renting flats and houses commercially were not willing to accept an individual tenant who might, under existing regulations, win a lifetime's security of tenure at an artificially low 'fair' rent. Even with the new law, landlords initially were reluctant to let to anyone other than a company. As Sammy Salama, of Plaza Estates, says: 'People were a bit frightened of finding loopholes or some other problems with the change, but it has been working fine.' The result is a choice that has not been available to individual British households for half a century - a realistic option to rent. 'We are seeing more people who sold before the crash who have done their calculations. They can't see any appreciation if they buy now and they see that they are better off renting and leaving their money on deposit,' says Salama. 'The difference now is that whereas individual tenants were not acceptable before, now they find they are treated like a customer and they can pick and choose the properties they want.' That choice of properties in London has been boosted by developer-owners releasing unsold flats, and by a limited number of individuals offering unsold houses and flats for rent. 'Many vendors who are reaching the end of their tether with the sales market will now look to letting as a viable option,' says Mary Ryan, of John D. Wood. These amateur landlords do not necessarily make the best clients for the letting agencies. As Ryan says, once it has been agreed to rent the family home, it has to be available for a reasonable period. 'Vendors-turned-landlords must understand that tenants coming from abroad will not be prepared to entertain release clauses that mean a landlord can terminate just because he believes the sales market has picked up enough to warrant another shot at selling,' Ryan stresses. The most common corporate rental period in London is a year, with a six-month 'break' clause. But only the most dedicated bargain-hunters exercise that six-month option to shop around again. 'People always can negotiate something off the rent if they try,' Salama says. 'It is a far cry from the days when it was 'beggars can't be choosers,' with little choice of properly-equipped flats.' The savings are, however, likely to be marginal in a market where, as most of the active letting agents agree, there are invisible - but nonetheless effective - price bands. In crude terms, central London rents for a single-bedroom or large studio flat would be in the Pounds 200-400 a week range (a touch lower in the Docklands of east London). The most active sector is for two-bedroom apartments in the Pounds 300 to Pounds 500 bracket, while three- and four-bedroom family houses range from Pounds 500-700 a week in good but off-centre areas. Rents for more-distinguished properties - those with a fashionable address and the capacity to be a base for entertainment - race swiftly past Pounds 2,000 a week . Then, there is the rarified - and highly negotiable - sector where people keep straight faces while asking rents of Pounds 5,000-8,000 a week and more. The most expensive rentals tend to be taken up by private visitors who travel with a large retinue. Even at several thousand pounds a week, the costs are likely to compare more than favorably with hotel suites. For the travelling sheikh or the globe-trotting businessman, rental London can be a deal cheaper than traditional lodging. But these huge rentals account for only a small fraction of all letting. In its most recent survey of the market, Hamptons found that the average weekly rent for a professional letting in central London was Pounds 432. That was a balance between averages as low as Pounds 170 in Docklands and more than Pounds 800 in Belgravia, Knightsbridge and Mayfair. American corporate tenants are the largest single group for many letting agencies. Savills reports that an exceptional 87.5 per cent of rental deals this year have been with US companies, with budgets mainly in the Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000 a week range. But Aylesford's autumn 1991 survey showed that UK and US renters accounted for around one-third of the total each, with continental Europeans making up much of the balance plus a sprinkling from the Far and Middle East and South Africa. The records at Hamptons show a similar pattern. Clearly, views of the market vary from agency to agency. At Vogue Rentals, Helene Silvestros has found a sharper-than-average switch to domestic tenants. She notes: 'Only a few years ago, the market was dominated by foreign clients, primarily American. However, that has changed with the lengthy recession. Today, over half of all rentals are for English clients.' Generally stable rents, at a time when capital values are continuing to fall, mean that investment returns are rising. But what an investor might expect to get in this market is debatable. Some agents are talking about gross returns of 13 and 13.5 per cent - sufficient to earn a double-figure net return after agency fees and professional costs. Others report gross returns of 8 to 10 per cent - impressive by past standards (when net returns of 4 to 5 per cent would have been regarded as good) but paling alongside the premium yields. Buying makes all the difference. Those premium yields are being won by investors using all their cash power to pressurise the last pound of price reduction from owners keen to sell. London's stock of apartments for rent never has been so open to scavenger bids; and even with some confusion about the effective rate of return on such flats, the figures are proving enough to bring the buyers back. Investors looking to the mid-1990s evidently believe that today's returns offset the risk of further price cuts. Hong Kong residents and expatriates have a five-year span in their minds as they look to the 1997 handover of the colony to China. Their recent buying in London confirms that they believe this is as good a time as any to lay down some comparatively cheap property so they can take a rental return that virtually covers financing costs but leaves enough time to allow for a recovery in values.</p>

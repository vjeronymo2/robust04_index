			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WHERE FUR ART THOU?  </P> <P> Steven Spielberg and Andrew Lloyd Webber may have plans to turn the musical  "Cats" into an animated film, but two lesser-knowns already have a jump on  those two entertainment fat cats. Not only a jump -- they used real felines.  </P> <P> For an all-cat version of "Romeo * Juliet"( no less.  </P> <P> Brussels-based P.H. Consulting and L.A.-based Moonseed Prods. produced the  film, which premieres Thursday at the Venice Film Festival (no U.S. distributor  yet). Loosely based on William Shakespeare's drama, it's played as a ballet,  utilizing the music of Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" ballet as performed by  the London Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Andre Previn.  </P> <P> Actually, there is one human character amid the furry cast -- actor John Hurt  in drag as "La Dame aux Chats," a Venetian bag lady. Moved by Romeo and  Juliet's plight, she transports them to the New World, where Romeo, a smoky,  long-haired gray, and Juliet, a cloud-white Turkish Angora, are free to  purr-sue their romance in peace.  </P> <P> Director Armando Acosta kept Shakespeare's famous balcony scene in the script  -- sort of. Acosta shot it atop the Cyclone roller coaster at Coney Island.  </P> <P> Still, there was one more detail that gave us pause: "The cats themselves do  not speak," said a press release. Were they expected to?  </P> <P> A spokeswoman explained that such stellar British actors as Maggie Smith, Ben  Kingsley and Vanessa Redgrave convey the cats' thoughts in voiceovers. David J.  Fox  </P></p>

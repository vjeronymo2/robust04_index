			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> In the latest round of tit-for-tat diplomacy between Washington and Moscow,  Secretary of State James A. Baker III has ordered a New York-based Soviet trade  official to leave the United States by next week, it was announced. With two  Soviets expelled from the United States and one American from Moscow thus far  this month, State Department spokesman Charles Redman expressed hope there will  be no further expulsions. The ouster of Sergei Malinin, an employee of the  Soviet trade organization Amtorg, was in retaliation for Moscow's expulsion of  a U.S. Army attache from the Soviet Union last week. Redman said Baker told  Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin he was concerned by the Soviet expulsion of Army  Lt. Col. Francis Van Gundy on March 14.  </P></p>

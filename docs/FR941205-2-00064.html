The Employer is a professional corporation engaged in the practice of medicine. The Plan is a defined contribution money purchase plan with 108 participants.

Following the acquisition of the Property by the Plan, it will be leased by the Plan to the Employer for its medical practice. A portion of the Property will be subleased by the Employer to other unrelated tenants. The initial annual rental for the Property is to be $62,458. The Lease is to be on a triple-net basis; thus, all expenses, including real estate taxes, will be paid by the Employer. The Lease will be for an initial term of ten years, and will be automatically renewed at the end of the term for an additional five year period, subject to the approval of the Plan's independent fiduciary (see rep. 5, below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

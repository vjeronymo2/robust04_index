			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIJUANA WATER SUPPLY TO TRICKLE BACK TODAY;  </P> <P> FULL SERVICE IS NOT EXPECTED UNTIL AFTER HOLIDAY; SAN DIEGO HOOKUP, CREWS  PROVIDE AID  </P> <P> A ruptured aqueduct that shut off most water supplies to this city of more than  1 million should be repaired by early today, and water should begin flowing  into the city by late in the day, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> "It's still an emergency situation, but the level of concern has been reduced  considerably," said Miguel Ravelo, a spokesman for the Baja California state  public service commission.  </P> <P> However, water supplies are not expected to return to normal until late Tuesday  -- after the Memorial Day weekend, a major tourist period -- because the  repaired aqueduct must be tested, filled, pressurized and sanitized, Ravelo  said. In the meantime, the city will continue to depend in part on sundry water  supplies, including an emergency hookup with San Diego water lines.  </P> <P> Despite emergency declarations, officials said drinking water has not been  threatened. Most residents in Tijuana, as in much of Mexico, rely heavily on  bottled drinking water purchased from private distributors. The water from the  aqueduct, although nominally purified, is used mainly for non-drinking  purposes, such as washing and sewage flow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Complaints Voiced  </P> <P> Residents here are accustomed to breakdowns in the water system and seemed to  take the lack of water with few complaints. Commercial sales of water were  brisk, and authorities warned against price-gouging, with rates said to be  rising among water salesmen.  </P> <P> City officials, wary of losing tourist income, have been downplaying the  potential impact of the water shortage, noting that many hotels and restaurants  have their own holding tanks with reserve capacity or have the option of  purchasing water. Tens of thousands of U. S. vacationers traditionally head  south for the holiday weekend.  </P> <P> Many restaurant owners were scrambling to maintain their water supply to  prepare for the weekend, purchasing water in bulk or trucking it in from other  locations.  </P> <P> The emergency began Wednesday morning when an underground, 6-foot-diameter pipe  ruptured and began spilling water, prompting an eventual shutdown of the  aqueduct system, which carries water from the Colorado River and supplies more  than 90% of the city's non-drinking needs. Engineers from Mexico and the United  States have been working around the clock to fix the metal-reinforced concrete  pipe and expect to complete the job by about 3 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> San Diego crews equipped with gasoline saws designed to cut through concrete  were helping, officials said.  </P> <P> Authorities called for conservation and opened a number of wells as several  dozen state-owned trucks began distributing water, free to some of the  hardest-hit neighborhoods. About 500 private trucks were also vending water on  city streets, which is typical since many Tijuana residents are not connected  to the city water system.  </P> <P> On Thursday, officials on both sides of the border arranged a hookup with San  Diego's water system, providing Tijuana as much as 13 million gallons a day --  less than a third of Tijuana's average daily consumption, but still a  significant flow. The transnational link had been used previously to transport  water to Tijuana but was abandoned a decade ago when Mexico completed its own  hookup to the Colorado River.  </P> <P> The water sharing caused San Diego officials to ask residents to adopt  voluntary conservation measures, such as limiting irrigation and washing of  cars. Officials were hopeful that the diversion would not lower water pressure  in San Diego, said Henry Pepper, San Diego's assistant water utilities  director, who noted that water was being pumped in from reservoirs to maintain  the pressure level.  </P> <P> He said the diversion of San Diego water will continue until Tijuana supplies  return to normal.  </P></p>

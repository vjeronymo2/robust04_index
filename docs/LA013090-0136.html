			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KENNEDY'S MAYBERRY GETS 200TH VICTORY  </P> <P> With Kennedy High School's 82-55 Garden Grove League triumph over La Quinta  Monday night, Coach John Mayberry recorded his 200th career victory. And to  mark the occasion, students at the school raised banners and balloons and  presented Mayberry with a cake.  </P> <P> Mayberry raised his coaching record to 200-110 in the midst of his 13th season  with another routine victory.  </P> <P> Now in his 24th year of teaching at Kennedy, Mayberry is the only coach to win  a Southern Section basketball title in the history of Anaheim Union High School  District. Kennedy won the boys' 3-A division title in 1987-88 with overtime  victories in the semifinals and championship game.  </P> <P> All along, through a 1-19 season in 1982 and the title year in 1988, Mayberry  has worn the school colors of the Fighting Irish, a trademark green suit with a  yellow sweater.  </P> <P> There have been some emotional moments for Kennedy, for instance, when he  became teary-eyed in the run to the championship two years ago. That mood  resurfaced Monday night when the school's cheerleaders presented him with a  cake that read: "200th Win, Congratulations Coach."  </P> <P> "I've got that feeling all over again," said Mayberry, as he stood beneath a  bridge of green and white balloons fighting back the tears. "I tried to keep  this quiet, but I guess I'm not very good at keeping a secret.  </P> <P> "This is a special night for myself and the team. The kids are playing with  such intensity now, it's been a joy to coach them. We've had great practices  and we're all working hard for a shot at another title."  </P> <P> Kennedy (12-6, 9-1) has nine consecutive victories since losing its league  opener to Rancho Alamitos. Forwards Jim Barker and Billy Williams sparked  Kennedy Monday night.  </P> <P> Williams had 20 points and 17 rebounds. Barker added 25 points, but saw his  consecutive free-throw streak end at 39 when he missed his first attempt.  </P> <P> While Kennedy celebrated, a nightmare season continued for La Quinta. The  Aztecs played well in the first quarter, then self-destructed in the second and  third quarters.  </P> <P> Kennedy held a 63-36 lead after three quarters and it was only a matter of time  before La Quinta lost its 18th consecutive game of the season.  </P> <P> In other Garden Grove League games:  </P> <P> Pacifica 81, Los Amigos 47 -- Host Pacifica began the game with a 12-2 run and  had five players score in double figures. Tim Whalen and Kevin Gaughen each  scored 13 for Pacifica (10-8, 8-2).  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos 82, Santiago 63 -- David Green scored 20 points and Richard  Pearce and Tony Cortez each added 16 for host Rancho Alamitos (15-4, 9-1).  Jamal Nuristani scored 21 to lead Santiago (6-12, 2-8).  </P> <P> In the Freeway League:  </P> <P> Sonora 77, Buena Park 71 (OT) -- Sonora's Anthony Choe made a three-point shot  with 20 seconds left in regulation to send the game at Buena Park into  overtime. Scott Oxarart, who had 16 points and 18 rebounds, made four of four  free throws in overtime for Sonora (6-14, 1-5).  </P> <P> Choe led all scorers with 25 points. Ray Lanier had 18 points for Buena Park  (8-11, 3-3).  </P> <P> Fullerton 84, Troy 83 -- Ladd Brunner made a three-point shot at the buzzer for  host Fullerton. With eight seconds remaining, Troy's Chris Inman missed the  front end of a one-and-one. Fullerton's Jason Black got the last of his 11  rebounds and passed it to Rene Arias. Arias threw a 40-foot bounce pass to  Brunner, who made the shot that put Fullerton (8-11, 5-1) ahead for the first  time in the game.  </P> <P> Arias led all scorers with 32 points, including 22 in the second half and 14 in  the fourth quarter. Richard Wesley had 22 points and Mike Abbott had 19 to lead  Troy (8-12, 2-4).  </P> <P> In the Academy League:  </P> <P> St. Michael's 62, Newport Christian 61 -- Trailing 35-19 at halftime, visiting  Newport Christian rallied to within a point with about 20 seconds remaining.  Jocques Wright scored 30 points for St. Michael's (5-1).  </P></p>

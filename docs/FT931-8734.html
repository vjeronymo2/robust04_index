			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / India liberalises kerosene imports THE Indian government has announced a partial deregulation of the domestic fuels market as part of a pre-budget package which also includes a steep increase in sugar and coal prices. New Delhi is keen to show that its economic reforms package is regaining momentum after last year's setback of the destruction by Hindu extremists of the mosque at Ayodhya. To this end, it has liberalised the import of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and has also allowed the private sector, both domestic and foreign, to enter the tightly controlled domestic fuels market. A dual pricing system will make domestic fuels, at present in short supply, more expensive, but freely available on the open market. The government will continue to retail kerosene oil through its public distribution system at subsidised rates, staining it blue to distinguish it from the open market kerosene. Users of LPG cylinders will not be entitled to subsidised kerosene on ration cards as they are at present. Opposition parties have criticised the government's 20 per cent increase in the price of sugar and the dual pricing policy of domestic fuels, even before the budget is presented on February 28. The government yesterday announced an additional rise in the regulated price of coal, amounting to an increase of 11.8-12.8 per cent for different grades. Soft coke, used for domestic purposes, has been spared.</p>

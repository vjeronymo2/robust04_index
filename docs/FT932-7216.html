			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Professor Stephen Littlechild has once more rattled the threat of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference in front of the privatised electricity generators. That is pretty standard stuff, but the generators' victory in the battle over coal may also have cost them friends in Whitehall. The duopoly, always an anomalous structure, may thus be under threat, along with the companies' high dividend cover and strong cash flows. In the short run, the government's 40 per cent stake may protect them. Further out, National Power and PowerGen may have to consider selling stations to reduce market share. The companies may also hope that Professor Littlechild's desire to shape the industry himself leads him to strike a deal directly rather than take a chance with the MMC.</p>

[Mangope] Well, we are undoubtedly in charge of our country.  When I say we, I mean my government.    [Hefers] But still we have the SA [South African] Defense  Force in the streets of Mmabatho and Mafikeng right at this  moment?    [Mangope] Well, as the result of recent happenings, we have  an agreement with the South African Government in terms of which  the South African Defense Force, which is in the country, as you  say, but they have not taken over -- they are there to help, and  that is just that?    [Hefers] And are you happy with that situation?    [Mangope] Well, so far, I don't see anything wrong with it.    [Hefers] Do you think that the presence of the SA Defense  Force has played a role in stabilizing the situation?    [Mangope] Well I think that has to be put in perspective. My  own defense force was very, very, very instrumental, together  with the police, that section that has not insurrected; they are  very much in charge of the situation, and I think they did a  very a [word indistinct] to do to restore in as much as it was  within their power to do so.    [Hefers] Mr. President, what is the feedback at the moment  that you are getting from your people in Mmabatho -- I mean your  generals, your cabinet ministers, and so on -- about the  situation?    [Mangope] The situation is that there has been, I think in  the true character of communism, an operation as we have seen it  in Eastern Europe, in Russia; this has been typical communism,  and a chance to overthrow a legitimate government. And I think  I must really pay special tribute to my defense force, to my  police, to my security people, and even to my colleagues in the  government for the manner in which they had faced this upheaval,  which undoubtedly was caused by the African National Congress  [ANC], the Communist Party, and perhaps to the littlest extent  the National Party.

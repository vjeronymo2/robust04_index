			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: IBM senior debt is downgraded by Moody's INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, for decades the most blue chip of all US manufacturing companies, has suffered the indignity of having its long-term debt downgraded by Moody's Investors Service, a leading credit rating agency. Moody's cut its senior debt rating from Aaa to Aa2, because its 'credit quality over the longer term will be adversely affected by shifting customer requirements and intense competitive pressures'. The blow is likely to be more psychological than practical since the company's rating is still high and Moody's stressed that 'IBM remains an exceptionally strong credit'. Analysts said it was a further sign that IBM, which dominated the global computer industry, was a diminished force facing pressures from smaller and nimbler rivals - which it is emulating through a management shake-up and decentralisation. The first downgrading of IBM's debt occurred last year at the hands of Duff &amp; Phelps, another rating agency. S &amp; P retains its top rating on IBM - AAA - but has had the company on 'negative outlook' since last August. It has said that a downgrade would be possible if IBM failed to improve profits when it shipped its new line of mainframe computers, a process which began in late 1990. IBM said it was disappointed with Moody's action but believed the impact on its worldwide financing requirements would be minimal. The company said that in seven of the 10 years from 1980 to 1990 it had been the most profitable company among the Fortune 500. Although 1991 had been a difficult year, it had earned pre-tax profits of nearly Dollars 4bn. Moody's said 'IBM's competitive environment, and its own necessary remedial actions to adapt to it, will continue to induce volatility in its operating performance, and that overall returns and margins will stabilise at lower levels than those IBM has historically reported'.</p>

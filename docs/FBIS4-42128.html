			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkey has announced that the decision of the U.S.  House of Representatives to suspend 25 percent of the security  aid to Turkey does not serve the common interests of the two  countries.    Replying to a question on the issue during his weekly news  conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that  the security aid constitutes an important dimension of the  Turkish-U.S. security cooperation relations. He said: It is  natural that we seriously assess any negative development that  might emerge in this field in all its aspects. Turkey has  always opposed the linking of U.S. aid -- which is supplied as a  requisite of mutual defense and cooperation within the framework  of the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement -- to outside  factors. Turkey, which has been faced with terrorism for years,  does not deem it appropriate to link aid to certain conditions  for unrealistic reasons and pretexts.    Ataman stressed: The suspension of 25 percent of the  security aid by the House of Representatives as a result of  allegations of human rights violations is an issue that must be  assessed within this framework.    Ataman concluded by saying: We hope that a more responsible  attitude will be adopted to eliminate this injustice in the  future stages of the foreign aid bill as it goes through the  U.S. Congress.</p>

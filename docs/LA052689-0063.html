			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> JOFFREY IN ARPINO'S 'VIVA VIVALDI'  </P> <P> "Viva Vivaldi" is one of Gerald Arpino's strangest and most fascinating Joffrey  Ballet showpieces. Created in 1965 and revived this season, it contains duets  of great originality as well as group passages just as slick and empty as  Arpino's recent output. A real back-to-the-future oddity.  </P> <P> For starters, it's curious that Arpino made a Spanish-style divertissement from  the Venetian composer's Concerto in D for violin, strings and cembalo. And  those two moody, intimate duets -- each of them ornamented by three subsidiary  dancers -- are puzzling too, structurally and spatially, very imaginative but  expressively enigmatic, even private.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the first duet involved  Elizabeth Parkinson and Ashley Wheater along with three male soloists, while  the second featured Julie Janus and Tom Mossbrucker plus three women. But the  formal parallels soon dissolved as each sequence developed its own pattern of  principal and group interaction and its unique emotional implications.  </P> <P> In the two bravura sections, however, (one dominated by Jodie Gates and Carole  Valleskey, the other by Edward Stierle and Carl Corry), we saw what has become  Arpino's M.O.: high-velocity, hard-sell step combinations imposed at random on  cast and score. And here the ballet blurred into all the generalized  neoclassical bonbons to come, and they into one another. Let's see, there's  "Suite Vivaldi" and "Viva Saint-Saens," "Italian Rain" and "Light Confetti,"  "Reflections of Angels, and "Ketten-something" . . .  </P> <P> All the dancing had flair and charm, but Mossbrucker was the major surprise:  unexpectedly somber and even self-absorbed. A sense of mystery always makes an  artist interesting, but the quality can be startling when combined with  all-American surfer-boy looks. If the underwater fantasy "Sea Shadow" (Tuesday)  depended on this juxtaposition, "Viva Vivaldi" showed Mossbrucker sustaining it  in a non-dramatic context and making it doubly compelling.  </P> <P> Allen Lewis conducted stylishly, with guitarist Stuart Fox and violinist  Kenneth Yerke the capable soloists. Completing the program: Paul Taylor's  "Cloven Kingdom" and Eugene Loring's "Billy the Kid," both reviewed during the  Joffrey Ballet's recent engagement in Costa Mesa.  </P></p>

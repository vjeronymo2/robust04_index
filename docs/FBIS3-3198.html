			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, March 9 (XINHUA) -- German and Russian  defense ministers announced here today that the navies of the  two countries would stage a joint exercise early this summer in  the Baltic Sea.    German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Russian  counterpart Pavel Grachev also told a joint press conference  that a small-scale joint military exercise will be held in  Russia in 1995 and another in Germany in 1996, to be followed by  a larger event involving ground troops.    Grachev, who arrived in Bonn earlier today for a three-day  visit, announced that Russia would withdraw all of its remaining  weapons and ammunition from the former East Germany by the end  of May this year.    The two ministers said they would make efforts to cooperate  in a regular, planned and long-term manner.    Grachev stressed that Russia viewed the proposal  "Partnership  for Peace" agreed between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) and East European countries, as a transitional plan.  Although Russia would act positively to the NATO proposal it  was not going to make a hasty political decision on it.</p>

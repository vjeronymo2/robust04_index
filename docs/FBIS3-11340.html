He stressed: "This makes even more unattainable the proposal  for salary equity between branches of government and increases  unrest." He stated that the military has accumulated a very  significant loss in purchasing power. He cited his own case:  "In March 1990, while in the post of squadron commander, I  received a salary equivalent to $3,000: Today I receive the  equivalent of $1,200."    The minister said the lack of motivation within the  organization is so perceptible that 49 Navy officers are  pursuing other posts within the state itself. The admiral  vehemently defended the FHC2 [Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso-2] plan on the "Tomorrow's Journal" program broadcast by  TVE [Rio de Janeiro Educativa Television] on 16 March. "If  inflation drops there will be a gradual recovery in purchasing  power and we are betting on this," he said.    When fiscal and monetary adjustments attain their goals,  previous losses lose significance, he commented. The minister  also defended a return of investments to modernize the Armed  Forces and the creation of a salary program for the military  once stabilization has been achieved.    Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party-Rio Grande do Sul State], the government leader [in the  Senate], and Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party-Parana State], are heading the movement in the  Senate to maintain President Itamar Franco's veto against the  salary equity between congressmen and Supreme Court (STF)  judges. "It is an act of immorality that will have a  devastating effect on the economic stabilization plan," Richa  stressed. Richa and Simon on 16 March began to press their  colleagues on the "unsuitability of the increase." On 17 March,  the senators were convinced that their pressing would work. "It  is a delicate situation; the Senate must be seen to maintain the  veto," Simon said.    The greatest difficulty to overcome is the blockade imposed  by their colleagues that will lose their mandates this year  because they will not seek reelection. One party leader said  there is a group of senators leaving public life which will vote  against the veto. "They wish to take advantage of the salary  increase at least for the next few months," the leader said.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Money Markets: Day out for rate bears SHORT-DATED sterling futures fell again yesterday as dealers took the view that another cut in UK base rates was increasingly unlikely, writes James Blitz. There was no concrete news to make the sterling market so modest in its view of rate cuts yesterday. But this week's raft of good economic indicators has robbed the cash and futures markets of their speculative edge. Although sterling futures dealers had a relatively quiet morning, there was a sharp sell-off in the front-month contracts at 2 pm. The June contract fell 6 basis points on the day to a close of 94.06, while the September contract fell 7 basis points to close at 94.15. At this level, the market is predicting that 3-month sterling cash rates will be at 5.85 per cent by the autumn, and that they will go no lower. There was an equally downbeat view in the interbank market, partly influenced by a huge shortage of Pounds 2.5bn forecast by the Bank of England. Three-month money closed a touch firmer at 5 31/32 per cent from a previous 5 15/16 per cent. The cost of overnight lending touched 10 per cent as the shortage proved difficult to remove, and there was late assistance of Pounds 315m. One dealer in a London- based commercial bank said he could not remember the market being as negative about rate cuts for many years. There are now only 15 basis points separating the December 1993 contract from most cash rates out to 1 year. Another dealer was more cautious. 'There is something of a recovery going on in the Uk economy,' he said. 'But we will need more figures in a month's time before people lose all hope of a rate cut.' In Europe, dealers were particularly concerned by comments from the Bundesbank President, who said that, if interest rate cuts did not relieve pressure on weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, the only solution might be devaluation. The June Euromark contract consequently fell back 3 basis points to close at 92.73, nearing the lows seen in January. The June French franc contract was up 1 basis point at 91.69. German call money rates remained firm at between 8.20 and 8.25 per cent as tax payments drained liquidity from the market.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Record Pounds 7bn raised by flotations in first half A record Pounds 7bn was raised by UK and Irish companies floating on the London Stock Exchange in the first half of the year. The figure was three times the amount raised during the same period last year and more than the total of Pounds 5.9m for the whole of 1993. The first half's 141 new entrants was only 39 short of 1993's record of 180. Despite the turbulent market conditions, 25 companies joined the Official List in June but there has been a slowdown of new issues in the pipeline. Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listing at the Stock Exchange, said: 'With new issuers becoming more cautious in the light of the current market uncertainties, we may have to wait until conditions have settled before seeing a resurgence.' The strongest share price performance was from Utility Cable, which more than tripled in the three months following its listing. Mithras Investment Trust shares have risen 75 per cent and Trafficmaster by 42 per cent. Flotations on the continent raised a total of Pounds 12.3bn in the first five months of the year which included several large privatisations. But only 32 new companies joined the large European Union exchanges in the period, compared with 90 in London, excluding investment trusts.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Nigeria oil strike lifted NIGERIA'S main oil workers' union yesterday suspended its 10-day strike, which was aimed at pressing the interim government to recognise the outcome of the June presidential elections. Most other trade unions voted to end their strike last week, but the Nupeng union's block on fuel supplies has stopped normal operations in government and the private sector throughout southern Nigeria. Nupeng is expected to lift the strike with immediate effect, but public and commercial transport will need most of this week to return to normal. Nupeng's leaders described the suspension as a 'tactical withdrawal. . . allowing a truce to give authorities time to review their position on the 12th June presidential elections and find a solution acceptable to the victors and the vast majority of people.' The other members of the Nigeria Labour Congress called off the strike when the interim government backed down over the proposed 10-fold rise in the price of petrol, but the oil workers' strike action was entirely political. Nupeng was aiming to force the government to hand over to Mr Moshood Abiola, banned winner of the presidential polls who is taking refuge in Britain; its leaders hinted at more strikes to back their cause.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Talks on East Timor Have Resumed in </F> Geneva"]    [Text] Geneva, 6 May (ATS) -- The fourth series of talks  between Portugal and Indonesia on the future of East Timor  started in Geneva this morning under UN auspices. UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is meeting Ali Alatas and Durao  Barroso, the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers,  respectively. At meetings in New York last September, both  countries pledged to take measures to ease the situation in that  former Portuguese colony, which was annexed by Indonesia in 1975  right after it became independent. The occupation of East Timor  has never been recognized by the international community.  Several organizations have blamed Indonesia for human rights  abuses there.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: Commission that is hard to justify Sir, Bruce Johnsen suggests (Personal View, March 24) that paying soft commissions through an execution only broker is no worse than paying commission to an integrated research broker and that commission is good because it subsidises research - otherwise fund managers would have 'little incentive to do well-researched trades'. Fund managers, however, know that most commission is optional and, in a highly competitive business with few barriers to entry, we have every incentive to orientate our own research to long-term evaluation rather than to stimulate trading. Soft commission is particularly hard to justify because it is so susceptible to abuse - after all, resulting costs passed on to client funds feed directly to the fund managers' profit line. Regulators in the UK and US are rightly worried about the rapid development of this Pounds 1bn money-go-round which leaves investors invariably bemused and almost invariably poorer.

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / IBM falls to loss of Dollars 2.8bn in quarter INTERNATIONAL Business Machines surprised Wall Street yesterday with earnings far weaker than expected. IBM reported third-quarter net earnings, before charges, of only Dollars 86m (Pounds 50m), or 15 cents per share, far less than the most pessimistic projections. After previously announced restructuring charges of Dollars 4.43bn, IBM's net losses for the quarter were Dollars 2.8bn or Dollars 4.87 per share compared with third quarter 1991 net earnings of Dollars 177m or 31 cents. Revenues rose from Dollars 14.4bn to Dollars 14.7bn. IBM shares, trading recently at a 10-year low, fell to Dollars 72 7/8 at the close in New York, down from Wednesday's closing price of Dollars 78. IBM's disappointing performance served in part to drag the broader market down. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 20.80 points lower at 3,174.68. IBM said dividend payments would not be affected. Mr Frank Metz, IBM senior vice president, said: 'We have no need or plans to do anything about the dividend.' IBM blamed the European currency crisis, with slow sales of mainframe and personal computers, for its poor third-quarter performance. The charges announced last month covered the cost of reducing IBM's workforce and consolidating manufacturing capacity. The company said then it expected 40,000 employees to accept voluntary severance; twice the number it had originally projected. The charges were partially offset by a tax benefit. Mr John Akers, chairman, said: 'Our business was adversely affected by economic turmoil in Europe, particularly at the close of the quarter, and by persistent economic weakness in the US and Japan. Our hardware profits continued to be hurt by price pressures, especially within our personal computer line.' Mr Metz said IBM had not expected the effect of the currency turmoil in Europe. Revenues for the first nine months were Dollars 45bn, up 5.1 per cent from Dollars 42.8bn in 1991. Net earnings, after charges and tax benefits, were Dollars 498m or 87 cents, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.4bn or Dollars 2.46 per share in the same period last year.</p>

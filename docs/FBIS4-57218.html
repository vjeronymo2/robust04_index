[applause] [words indistinct] to read the 10  April 1994 resolution of the Senate of Republic:    Senate of the Republic of Haiti. Resolution of the Senate of  the Republic. In view of Articles 1, 8, 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, (?136),  (?137), (?138), 139, 148, 149, 153, 154, 155, and 170 of the  Constitution;    In view of the resignation of President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide and his departure on 30 September 1991;    In view of the decision of the Court of Cassation of the  Republic on 27 March 1992 declaring the Washington Agreement  inoperative due to the defect of inequality between the parties;    In view of the 15 June 1993 decree of the National Assembly  acknowledging citizen Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president of the  Republic;    Considering, however, that the attributions of the National  Assembly are definitively defined by Article 98-3 of the  Constitution [words indistinct] cannot be extended to other  subjects;    Considering, nevertheless, that the 15 June 1993 decree  received no consideration from the person mainly concerned and  that it was followed by the signing, under the aegis of the  United Nations, of two documents called the Governors Island  agreement and the New York Pact;    Considering that those agreements shielded from the sanction  of the parliament have not been executed and are from here on  declared null and void;    Considering that the government called [Government] of  Concord [words indistinct] has been resigned for four months and  has not been replaced;    Considering that individual or group attempts to resolve the  crisis -- that have been made since then -- such as the 27  February 1994 Parliamentary Plan and a synchronous plan of the  U.S. Statement Department have been categorically rejected by  Mr. Aristide in his intransigence and stubbornness;    Considering that the country is experiencing one of the most  terrible crises of its history, a crisis which endangers not  only the institutional life of the state but also that of the  Haitian people who are subjected to the stringencies of all  deprivations;    Considering that in the meantime the Haitian people are  experiencing a painful, deadly, and unprecedented situation for  both their sons and their ecology [words indistinct] national  boat drifting, without chief, without executive, shaky  institutions, a state attacked at its very foundations;    Considering that under these conditions of exceptional  gravity, the parliamentarians, joint guardians of the national  sovereignty, are duty bound to [word indistinct] the boat by  filling this institutional vacuum created and deliberately  nourished;    Considering that in fact this refusal by President Aristide  to endow the country with a head of government in violation of  Article 147 is equivalent to a resignation;    Considering that there is good reason to take note of this  presidential vacuum with all legal consequences;    Considering on the other hand that the international  community has widely shown its inability to resolve the crisis  while taking into account that Jean-Bertrand Aristide [words  indistinct] to maintain and/or to reinforce the illegal and  criminal economic sanctions have forced the responsible  authorities in the country to find a constitutional solution to  the problem;    Considering that to guarantee the enduring of the state and  [word indistinct] this committee [words indistinct] there is  good reason to reconstitute the executive power in order to  achieve normalization of the national life;    Considering that citizen Robert Malval, prime minister, who  resigned 15 December 1993, told the parliament in a letter dated  7 February 1994 that he and the members of his government were  no longer responsible before the parliament and therefore have  no authority or competence to convene the National Assembly, it  is now the responsibility of the legislative power to take the  necessary measures alone;    Considering consequently that from this point on it is  urgent  to fill the presidential vacuum in compliance with the  provisions of Article 149 of the Constitution to ensure the  stability of the institutions and the continuation of the  Haitian state, the Senate of the Republic has adopted the  following resolution:    Article 1. The Senate takes note of President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide's obstinate refusal to carry out his constitutional  obligations. Consequently, the Senate takes note of his  resignation, declares a presidential vacuum, and revokes the 15  June 1993 decree.    Article 2. In compliance with Article 149 of the  Constitution, the president of the Court of Cassation is endowed  with the powers of provisional president of the Republic.    Article 3. The provisional president chooses his prime  minister in conformity with the Constitution for the formation  of the government that will have to work toward holding the  forthcoming elections in the country and presidential [words  indistinct] in accordance with a timetable for the return to  constitutional order.    Article 4. An ad hoc deadline is granted to the Provisional  Government, given the exceptional circumstances for establishing  the necessary structures. This deadline will not extend beyond  the date of 7 February 1995, planned for the installation of the  Communal Section Administration Councils, mayors, deputies,  one-third of the Senate, and the next president-elect.    Executed at the Legislative Palace in Port-au-Prince on 10  April 1994, the 191th year of independence.

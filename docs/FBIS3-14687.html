			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Mar (MENA)--Talal al-Hasan, Jordanian  minister of state for foreign affairs, has said that the intense  ministerial participation in the Arab League Council's meetings  showed sincere intentions and sound hopes for Arab solidarity.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, the minister said  Jordan  is eager to support the Arab League and realize the idea of  comprehensive pan-Arab security to allow an Arab reconciliation  and solidarity able to overcome the differences. He added that  Jordan is also eager to forsake the past to enable the Arab  nation to face up to its challenges and dangers.    He said his country will not abandon the principles of the  peace process in which it believes, primarily Security Council  resolutions, the principle of land for peace, Israel's  withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, primarily  Jerusalem, and securing the Palestinians' legitimate rights, on  top of which is their right to self-determination.    On the blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah, which Jordan  tried  to link with the resumption of negotiations, he said the  blockade causes huge losses to the Jordanian economy, adding  that it was enforced as a result of the Gulf war to which Jordan  was not a party and for the results of which it was not  responsible.    He added that Jordan presented legal documents to the United  Nations and every country concerned and explained the need for  and importance of lifting this blockade as a security measure to  guarantee the region's stability and advance the peace process.    Commenting on recent terrorist incidents in Jordan, Talal  al-  Hasan said they were isolated. They are being investigated and  the law will take its course. He noted that Jordan has always  enjoyed stability and security.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUMANE SOCIETY FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST ZOO IN THE DEATH OF ANIMALS;  </P> <P> ANIMAL CARE: IT SAYS THE ZOO AND A TRANSPORTATION COMPANY ARE GUILTY IN DEATH  OF FOUR ANIMALS.  </P> <P> The Humane Society of the United States has filed ethics complaints against the  San Diego Zoo and an animal transport company, alleging that both are guilty of  "gross negligence" in the treatment of four San Diego Zoo animals that died en  route to a Massachusetts zoo in April, officials said.  </P> <P> Lisa Landres, a Humane Society investigator based in Washington, said her  office has filed the complaints with the ethics committee of the American Assn.  of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA), which is looking into the deaths of  the four carnivores that were trucked to the Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro,  Mass.  </P> <P> In addition, she said, the HSUS has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department  of Agriculture for alleged violations of federal animal welfare regulations.  </P> <P> "San Diego (Zoo) made an unwise choice," Landres said, explaining that she  believes carnivores of this type -- a fishing cat, a sloth bear and two palm  civets -- should be shipped by air, not by truck. "It's a combination of making  a very bad choice and then having a transporter who obviously did not feed or  water the animals. . . . The whole thing was preventable. We're talking gross  negligence."  </P> <P> San Diego Zoo officials, who on Wednesday had expressed outrage over the  animals' treatment and called for an AAZPA investigation of the shipper, the  Zoological Animal Exchange, on Thursday rejected the suggestion that they were  partly to blame.  </P> <P> "The facts are that 13 healthy animals were put on a truck in San Diego, and  four of those arrived dead on the East Coast," said Jeff Jouett, a zoo  spokesman. "The issue is the quality of care received in transit, not whether  the animals went by plane or by truck. The hauler was licensed by the USDA, was  registered with the AAZPA, and came with good references from zoos who had used  them before."  </P> <P> He added: "Lisa Landres has no experience moving carnivores of any type for the  San Diego Zoo. And it's disappointing but predictable to see a lobbying  organization like HSUS take a stance without knowing the facts or having an  understanding of the issues involved."  </P> <P> Landres, a one-time San Diego Zoo elephant keeper, resigned last fall because,  she said, the zoo was punishing her for being outspoken about the beating of  the elephant Dunda in 1988. She said Thursday that her former employer is  passing the buck.  </P> <P> "San Diego needs to take a little responsibility here," she said. "They knew  this was a bad decision. Ultimately, they were their animals. They are the ones  who loaded them on the truck. They were responsible."  </P> <P> The four animals that died were part of a larger shipment hauled by the  Zoological Animal Exchange, a hauler based in Natural Bridge, Va. On the same  truck were several other San Diego Zoo animals, including six Nubian ibex, a  wild goat species, for the Bronx Zoo in New York and a Sumatran tiger for Zoo  Atlanta in Georgia.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the Bronx Zoo and Zoo Atlanta said Thursday that their animals  arrived in good condition and have remained healthy. But Dennis Branchaud, the  superintendent of parks in Attleboro, Mass., who oversees the Capron Park Zoo,  said that, when the truck pulled up in late April, his staff was horrified to  find their four animals, a gift from the San Diego Zoo, dead of apparent  dehydration.  </P> <P> A woman who answered the telephone at the Zoological Animal Exchange said the  company's owner, Eric Mogensen, would not comment on the complaints.  </P> <P> Jouett said a San Diego Zoo curator had recommended that the animals be flown  instead of trucked -- a process that is generally believed to be less stressful  for animals that are traveling long distances -- but that the three receiving  zoos did not heed that recommendation.  </P> <P> "We fly animals whenever possible. It is our preference. But it is not always  possible," he said. "But to say that carnivores shouldn't be trucked is  ridiculous. The pertinent issue is how the animal is cared for from point A to  point B. Whether it is eating meat or eating hay has absolutely nothing to do  with it."  </P> <P> The San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park is the largest mover of zoo animals in  the world, Jouett said. Last year, the zoo alone moved 410 mammals. Two died,  both of them herbivores.  </P> <P> "We've used trucks, planes, boats, and animals arrive alive and well if the  transporter is qualified, competent and experienced," Jouett said. "We had  every indication and reason to believe when the driver left here that the  animals were in capable hands. Our impression now is that is not the case."  </P> <P> James Doherty, the general curator of the Bronx Zoo, said that his staff had  arranged to transport only the ibex via the Zoological Animal Exchange, which  he had used before.  </P> <P> "We made the arrangements for the ibex to be picked up and, as far as we knew,  they were the only animals on the truck," Doherty said, noting that it is quite  common for hoof stock to be trucked. "We knew nothing about Zoo Atlanta or the  other zoo. . . . I don't know of anyone at Capron Park Zoo. I'd never heard of  it before. I knew nothing about a tiger going to the Atlanta zoo."  </P> <P> He added, "It's unfortunate the way it came out."  </P> <P> Dr. Terry Maple, the director of Zoo Atlanta, said his staff had arranged with  San Diego to "piggy-back" on the Bronx Zoo's scheduled shipment.  </P> <P> "There was no debate about it. We said, let's use the shipper that's already  coming," said Maple, who said that this week he heard for the first time that  San Diego would have preferred flying the animals. "I understand (now) that San  Diego felt that the shipment of animals should have been flown. That was not an  option that we discussed with the sender that I know of."  </P> <P> Branchaud, meanwhile, said that, although he signed off on the choice of the  Zoological Animal Exchange, which he had used before, he was not involved in  arranging the transport. He said all he knew was what the San Diego Zoo told  him -- the date he could expect the animals to arrive.  </P> <P> "All I knew is they were coming on that date," he said. "We were just the ones  who had to discover the sad news."  </P> <P> "We're extremely upset over the whole business. It hurt us quite a bit," he  said. Recently, he said, the San Diego Zoo has replaced one of the dead animals  with a healthy sloth bear. It arrived by plane.  </P> <P> The USDA regulations regarding animal transportation specify that live animals  be offered fresh water at least every 12 hours and fresh food at least once in  each 24 hour period, and that a sufficient quantity of food and water accompany  the animal during transit. Drivers are also required to visually observe the  animals no less than once every four hours.  </P> <P> The USDA also requires that the owner of the animal, in this case the San Diego  Zoo, provide written instructions to the hauler concerning the food and  watering requirements of each animal being transported. Jouett said this was  done.  </P> <P> "The animals traveled with keeper transfer documents that included their diets  and care requirements," he said. "We explained the individual animals'  personalities and care requirements to the driver. We offered containers of  water, meat, feeds, hay, feline diet and were told by the driver, 'No, thanks,  I've got it under control.' "  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the AAZPA, Karen Asis, said she could not confirm or comment  on any formal investigation, but acknowledged that the case "is under serious  consideration by the AAZPA." She said the group's ultimate recourse would be to  suspend any member found guilty of wrongdoing. But it is unlikely any action  could be taken before this fall, she said.  </P> <P> San Diego animal rights activists said the animal deaths raise questions about  how well the AAZPA is monitoring its members.  </P> <P> "How many incidents does it take to prove that we must have an independent body  to govern Zoo activities," Sally Mackler, director of San Diego Animal  Advocates, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Pat McDonnell contributed to this report.  </P></p>

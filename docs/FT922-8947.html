			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Serbs step up siege of Bosnian capital: All food and medicine for Sarajevo blocked SERB irregular forces, backed by the Yugoslav federal army, yesterday tightened their grip around Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, after a weekend of heavy fighting in which 43 people were injured and several buildings, including the Bosnian Red Cross, were set ablaze. The siege of the city coincided with the publication of new casualty figures. Mr Haris Smajkic, a Bosnian health ministry official, yesterday said at least 1,320 people had been killed, 6,700 wounded and 1,900 reported missing since the fighting began six weeks ago. In addition, 320,000 people have been displaced, and over 350,000 have left the war-torn republic since it declared independence last month. The repeated air and artillery bombardment of Sarajevo signals a determined effort by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army to crush resistance by Bosnian Territorial Defence forces. These forces are mostly Moslem and Croats. The appointment of General Ratko Mladic, who yesterday replaced Gen Milutin Kukanjac as commander of the federal army headquarters in Sarajevo, confirms an even more aggressive stance by the federal army. Gen Mladic was the hardline federal army commander of the Knin corps, a Serb-stronghold in Croatia. He is also a close ally of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbian Democratic party, whose own paramilitary wing is besieging Sarajevo. As Serb irregulars wage a war of attrition on the Bosnian capital, all food supplies to the inhabitants of the city have been halted. Serb gunmen have erected road blocks on all routes leading to Sarajevo. The federal army controls the airport. Both forces have completely blocked the delivery of medicines. Bosnian health officials say blood and medical supplies have been exhausted. The constant artillery assaults have badly damaged the city telecommunications network, and Radio Sarajevo regularly carries desperate messages from people trying to contact missing relatives. Serb forces have also repeatedly attacked Sarajevo radio and television transmitters, to try to further erode the authority of the Bosnian government. The government is backed by the republic's Moslems, who make up 44 per cent of the republic's 4.35m population. A witness yesterday described the grim existence of the inhabitants of the city, whose peace-time population is 525,000. He said: 'People leave their shelters during a lull in the fighting. They go outside to try to keep up some sort of a life. But shells fall around them and snipers will shoot at anything.' Bosnian leaders have again appealed for the despatch of United Nations peacekeepers and foreign military intervention. Elsewhere in the republic, the south-western city of Mostar is also under attack. The European Community and the US so far have ruled out military intervention.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (1): Painful step towards democracy - Thailand needs a government which can channel the country's dynamic but unguided economic growth in the right directions - and impose the rule of law on a society where power is often measured in money and guns IT did not take long for Thailand to return to normal after four days in May that shook the nation. The economy is booming and parliamentary politics have been restored to their perennial state of instability. Between May 17 and 20, Thai troops shot dead about 50 pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of Bangkok in the most serious outbreak of political violence since the 1970s. The protests were directed against Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the army commander who masterminded a coup in February 1991 and had himself installed as prime minister by a coalition of pro-military parties following a general election in March this year. Gen Suchinda was forced to resign after the bloodshed - but not before he had issued an amnesty decree which pardoned himself and his military colleagues. The legal controversy over the pardon was ended last month when the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the amnesty could not be overturned. But many of the middle-class Bangkok residents at the centre of the May demonstrations are incensed that Gen Suchinda remains a free man. At least 170 people are still reported to be missing following the protests and suspicions remain that troops took away several bodies and buried them secretly. The exact death toll is unknown. 'Many people still feel that justice was not done,' says Mr Savit Bhotiwihok, a cabinet minister and a Democrat Party MP. 'It leaves a bad taste.' A new election was held in September and the Democrats emerged as the largest party in parliament at the head of a group of broadly liberal coalition partners opposed to military intervention in politics. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat leader, became the first elected Thai prime minister for 16 years not to have a military background. Mr Anand Panyarachun, a much-praised businessman and economic reformer who served two terms as interim premier following the 1991 coup - first appointed by the military and then, later, by the King - was an unelected appointee. But Mr Chuan and his allies - dubbed the 'angel parties' by the liberal press to distinguish them from the pro-military 'devils' - won the election by the narrowest of margins. They were supported by the urban elite, but most poor voters in the countryside - who knew little and cared less about Bangkok politics - continued to sell their votes to corrupt politicians. In the light of the election results, the events of May can be seen not so much as a dramatic turning point in Thai history as another painful step on the long road towards a properly functioning parliamentary democracy. The armed forces have had their influence in politics and business reduced rather than eliminated. One of the Anand cabinet's last acts before the September election was to remove air force officers from the board of Thai Airways International and replace them with civilian managers who have already started to revitalise the airline and root out corruption. The same medicine was applied to other military fiefdoms in domestic and international telecommunications. And one of the first acts of Mr Chuan's administration was to seek to revoke laws which had allowed the military to break up civilian demonstrations without seeking approval from the cabinet. But few political analysts are bold enough to suggest the armed forces are a spent force in politics or to predict that the Chuan government will last its full four-year term. Already there are signs of strain in the five-party coalition. Yet now more than ever Thailand needs a government which can channel the country's dynamic but unguided economic growth in the right directions - and impose the rule of law on a society where power is usually measured in money and guns. The economy, after a brief disruption during the May violence, is expected to grow at 7-8 per cent this year and continue expanding at the same rate into the second half of the 1990s. But successive governments have failed to plan transport and communications networks - Bangkok is notoriously congested and short of telephones - or invest in the new schools needed to create a skilled workforce for the long-term industrialisation of Thailand. Tourism, like industrial exports, suffered only a temporary decline as a result of the May crisis, and arrivals in 1992 are now expected to exceed last year's 5.1m. Thai officials, however, are worried that the environmental damage caused by uncontrolled development of industry and of the tourist resorts themselves is beginning to deter potential holidaymakers. The British consumer magazine Which? this year named Bangkok and the beach resort of Pattaya, with its sewage-tainted water, massage parlours and clinics for sexually-transmitted diseases, as the two sleaziest holiday destinations in the world. Although it is true that other south-east Asian economies are experiencing similar growing pains, the problems in Thailand are particularly severe. As this year's two elections have shown, Thailand embraces two nations - the urban rich, who bemoan the loutishness of their politicians and the poor state of government services but are unwilling to pay much in the way of taxes to remedy the situation, and the rural poor who often migrate to the cities to find work as labourers, domestic servants or prostitutes. In attempting to introduce laws compatible with the growing sophistication of urban Thailand - such as those requiring compulsory third-party vehicle insurance and the wearing of motor-cycle helmets - the government found little support from MPs whose constituents rely mainly on tractors, bicycles and oxcarts. Likewise, the wild movements of share prices on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, and the charges of price manipulation recently filed against a dozen speculators - one of whom had the equivalent of nearly Dollars 2m in cash lying around his office - by the newly-created Securities and Exchange Commission must have seemed of scant relevance to north-eastern rice farmers. Average non-agricultural incomes are 13 times as high as those of farmers. Of the total workforce, 83 per cent have primary education only. 'This is a land of primary education,' says Mr Narongchai Akrasanee, a director of the Thailand Development Research Institute. 'The economic boom of the last decade has not substantially changed this picture.' In contrast to Mr Anand, who concentrated on macro-economic policy and the interests of the Bangkok business community, Mr Chuan, a southerner, quickly identified rural and regional development as a priority. The government has promised that more money will be channelled directly to the provinces. It has pledged to support the continued development of the fast-growing eastern seaboard, and vowed to start a project in the south to build a road, rail and pipeline 'land bridge' linking the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, a trade route which could divert cargo from the congested Strait of Malacca. Mr Chuan's ministers are also attempting to sort out the tangle of mutually incompatible mass transit railway projects for Bangkok agreed by previous governments, but they believe the best solution to the capital's traffic problems is to lure investors to the provinces. 'I would prefer to see the funds being used for the new strategic growth of Thailand,' says Mr Savit. 'You have to provide new alternatives elsewhere which are competitive with Bangkok.' There is little doubt that the government has good intentions. The question is whether the mild-mannered Mr Chuan is strong enough to hold his coalition together without compromising his policies into insignificance, and whether his government will last long enough to carry out the tenuous mandate it inherited from the events of May.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Salih Brkic report from Tuzla] </F>   [Text] The chetnik shelling of the region around Tuzla is  continuing. Last night and all today the Mt. Majevica chetniks  have been pounding Vukovije and Dubrave with heavy artillery.  They are firing the shells from the area of Poljanice on Mt.  Majevica, and they have destroyed or badly damaged some dozen  houses in Vukovije and Dubrave. It is obvious that the  criminals from Mt. Majevica are showing that they are ready to  fire at [Tuzla's] Dubrave Airport, which the world wants to open.    The general alarm has been sounded three times in Tuzla, and  it is still in force.    Everything that has been happening around Tuzla these days  shows that the decisions of the international community that  Tuzla become a protected area are for the chetniks only a dead  letter.</p>

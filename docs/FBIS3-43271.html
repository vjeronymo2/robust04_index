Regarding the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the cabinet  was briefed on the final agreement on the Uruguay-Round of  negotiations. Started in 1986, the eighth round of multilateral  trade negotiations ended on 15 December 1993. [passage omitted]    The cabinet decided to set up within the framework of the  public sector-private sector liaison group a commission to  examine the repercussions of the General Agreement on Trade and  Tariffs Agreement on the Ivorian economy and to propose ways and  means of enabling our country to receive the maximum benefits  from this agreement. [passage omitted]    Concerning the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources,  the cabinet heard a report on the negotiation of a new fishing  agreement between Cote d'Ivoire and the European Economic Union.  The previous agreement expires on 14 January. The cabinet  authorized a delegation to be sent to Brussels to negotiate the  terms of this new agreement.    Regarding the Ministry Delegate to the Prime Minister in  Charge of Economy, Finance, and Planning, the minister briefed  the cabinet by commenting on certain decisions made at the  ministerial meeting of the West African Monetary Union [UMOA]  held in Dakar on 20 December.    This organization reviewed the measure to suspend the buying  of the Central Bank of West African States bank notes that are  exported outside the territories of member countries of the  franc zone. It confirmed and strengthened this measure which  contributes to the adjustment efforts being made by the UMOA  member countries.    As part of these measures, the banks are henceforth  authorized to get a maximum commission of 2 percent on manual  exchange operations of the CFA franc for the French franc  carried out at their teller windows by customers going abroad.    Regarding the same ministry, the cabinet was briefed on the  measures adopted to meet state commitments. These measures  concern a large part of the population. Indeed, on the  instruction of the president of the Republic and in spite of the  economic and financial difficulties facing our country, the  treasury on 29 December settled some of its outstanding  financial commitments in order to somehow lessen the burdens of  the people at the end of the year.    The monies paid out cover a large number of budget posts,  namely salaries. They are salaries of the civil service and  national public enterprises [EPN] for December 1993 and payment  of arrears for the greater part of the [EPN]. At this level,  the payments made amount to 18 billion CFA francs.    The scholarships of university students and students in  institutions of higher learning: On this point, an amount of  600 million CFA francs was paid to students in institutions of  higher learning covering December and the arrears. As for  scholarships of university students, 337 million CFA francs was  disbursed as October payments while waiting for the decisions of  the scholarship awards commission which is sitting on  scholarship attributions for the 1993-94 academic year.    Pensions: Payments made were for December and the arrears.  At this level, the sum of 1 billion CFA francs was disbursed.    State contractors: At this level, the sum of 600 million CFA  francs was disbursed to pay small- and medium-scale enterprises.    The payments made also concern subsidies to state  enterprises, the necessary expenses for the running of our  consular and diplomatic chancelleries, some expenses to be  incurred in restructuring the financial system, etc.    In all, the financial effort made by the government covered  a  global amount of 30 billion CFA francs.

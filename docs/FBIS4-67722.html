			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antra Gabre: "Number of Syphilis Victims </F> Increased Three-Fold"]    [Text] What an era! What morals! -- What else can be said  after hearing that a female employee of an intimacy club  infected her two year old son with syphilis last year. In 1993,  overall, according to data from the State Clinical Center for  Skin Diseases (formerly the Skin and Venereal Disease  Dispensary), in the course of everyday life, "thanks" to their  parents, two children have developed gonorrhea and two syphilis.    According to the figures for last year, the morbidity rate  increased three-fold for syphilis, 1.2 fold for gonorrhea, while  the morbidity rate for fungal diseases increased 1.2 fold, and  urogenital chlamydial infection was a common diagnosis.  Furthermore, these are not absolute indices, only the registered  cases, and many people seek the services of private medical  firms for treatment of their venereal diseases.    A three-fold increase in syphilis is a very high index, and  the prognosis by specialists at the center is that syphilis  morbidity will not decline. In 1993, 45 per 100,000 inhabitants  suffered from this disease in 1993 (in 1992, the respective  number was 13), with the majority being women, and for gonorrhea  -- the respective number was 204 (153 in 1992), with the  majority being men. In 1992, those suffering from venereal  diseases were persons with a higher education, while last year,  69% of all patients had a mid-level education, 53%  -- from 20  to 29 years of age. Unfortunately, the statistics for last year  show that even 13 to 14 year old girls have had to seek help  from venereal disease specialists.    Children are primarily infected by fungal diseases -- which  are passed on to them by infected animals. There is quite a  number of "wild" cats roaming the streets of Riga, and,  therefore, parents should look out for their children. In  comparison with 1992, the number of skin disease cases was lower  for this past year. Deputy chief physician Dace Galvina explains  this as related to the institution of patient fees, and the  relocation of dermatologists to the State Clinical Center for  Skin Diseases, the result of which is that patients from the  outlying rayons of the city do not visit these specialists.    Likewise, lice infestation, or pediculosis, is becoming more  widespread. Not only head lice, but also clothing lice have been  observed. They are primarily being spread by vagrants, beggars  and the very poor. In Riga, there are two locations where a  person can be deloused -- the bathhouse at 249 Brivibas Street  and the Riga Disinfection Station -- but because there is lack  of means, not everyone can afford to pay for this service.    Dr. Galvina reminds us that during the first six months of  this year, while the Center for Sexually Transmitted Diseases is  being set up on Pernavas Street, patients may visit venereal  disease specialists at the State Clinical Center for Skin  Diseases.</p>

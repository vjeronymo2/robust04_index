			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Peres' Statement and the Israeli  illusion," AL-BA'TH says: The Israeli officials' contradictory  statements on peace and the terms of reference of the peace  process continue. The latest of these statements was made by  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Yesterday he asked Syria to  normalize its relations with Israel, and emphasized that the  normalization process should have begun with the negotiation  process.    AL-BA'TH adds: This means that Peres wants normalization  before the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied land. It is not  ruled out that Israel wants normalization of relations while our  land is under occupation. The statements by several Israeli  officials, especially Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Peres  emphasize this fact.    It says: In their statements, Rabin, Peres, and others have  so far not referred to full withdrawal from the Golan, but they  always and only emphasize withdrawal in the Golan. This  emphasizes that Israel wants the peace process to entrench its  occupation of Arab land, and then the Arabs should normalize  relations with it. By this, Israel would have both peace and  land. This is what Israel seeks through deeds, not words.    The newspaper stresses that these statements do not benefit  the peace process, but are directed against it. The Israelis  are mistaken if they believe Syria may give up its declared  policy on the peace process.    The newspaper says: Syria's acceptance to participate in the  peace process stemmed from its clear principles and constants,  based on implementation of resolutions of international  legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle.    The newspaper stresses that full and comprehensive Israeli  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories is unnegotiable as  a condition for continuing the peace process with all its  details.    The newspaper speaks about the Israeli policy which depends  on maneuvers and evasion of the requisites of the peace process,  and says: That policy is totally rejected by Syria. Syria  always emphasizes that the basic condition for achieving a just  and comprehensive peace is Israel's full withdrawal from our  occupied land. Short of this, the peace process will continue  to be stalemated.    The newspaper warns against the Israeli maneuvering policy  because it will lead the peace process to a dead end, which is  what Israel seeks.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Israel should remember that  the conflict is continuing and resolving it will not be easy.  It is time for Israel to be aware that there will be no peace,  security, and stability in the region while our Arab land is  occupied.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Franc futures rebound SHORT-DATED French franc futures rebounded sharply yesterday as the currency regained some of its recent losses against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. After two days of growing strain inside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, the D-Mark lost ground against European currencies yesterday and money market rates eased in France, Ireland and Denmark. Profit-taking in the currency market was cited as one reason for the easing of interest rate tensions. Dealers also said that the Bundesbank's injection of a net DM10.9bn into the banking system in its weekly securities repurchase operation was more generous than had been expected. Funds were mostly allocated at the established lower rate of 8.75 per cent. However, German call money remained constant at 8.75 per cent to 8.80 per cent because liquidity was needed to offset the loss of cash from tax payments this month, and from end-of-month pension payments. The impact of yesterday's easing was mostly felt in French interest rate markets. The December franc contract rose 19 basis points to a high of 90.20. It later fell back to a close of 90.04, however, as the franc came under new pressure in US foreign exchange trading. Rates in the French cash market were easier. Three month money closed at around 10 3/4 per cent from 11 per cent the previous day, while 1-month money closed at around 11 1/4 per cent from 12 per cent. German futures reflected disappointment that there had not been a drop in the Bundesbank's repo rate. The December Euromark contract fell 9 basis points to a close of 91.33 yesterday, while the March contract was also down 9 basis points to a close of 92.42. At this level, it prices in nearly 130 basis points off 3-month money in the next four months. Recent movements in futures markets reflect a belief that the currency turmoil is a short-term phenomenon. One trader noted yesterday that the March French franc contract closed virtually unchanged on its level last Wednesday, despite big fluctuations ion the December contract. The sterling cash market remained extremely quiet. Three-month money was again unchanged at 7 1/4 per cent offered. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 450m at the start of its operations. The December short sterling contract fell 6 basis points to close at 92.93.</p>

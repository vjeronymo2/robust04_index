The officer, Lt-Col  Thatthiam Yiamnakhon, said that newspapers always described Gen  Wimon, when he talked to reporters, as "talking too much". But  whenever he did not talk, newspapers would say that he was  angry. Lt-Col Thatthiam said military society, like others, had  its own characteristics and way of life.    Military society adhered to traditions passed on to soldiers  for generations and was hard to change. Soldiers always thought  systematically, had a clear line of practice and did as they  were told by their commanders. Soldiers were taught to speak  and express opinions according to their responsibilities. They  did whatever was decided by their bosses, who usually took full  responsibility should anything go wrong, he said. Relations  between commanders and their subordinates were so close that the  soldiers were ready to follow their bosses anywhere without  complaining.    "For the subordinates, their show of pain, dissatisfaction  and sentiment on behalf of their bosses is normal," he said.    Lt-Col Thatthiam said it was normal for soldiers to feel  unhappy at newspapers which used "improper" words to describe  their top boss.    "Newspapers may think the army chief is a public figure who  must be able to tolerate criticism, but soldiers who study only  military matters throughout their life do not easily understand  this," he said.</p>

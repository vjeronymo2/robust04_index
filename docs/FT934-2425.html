			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Observer: Old boys Kroll Associates, the international corporate sleuths, is known to be a company that likes to get its name in the story, if not in the headlines. But on the subject of Michael Oatley, its UK director of operations and the man reported to have acted as intermediary between the British government and the IRA in 1990, it is unusually reticent. Oatley joined Kroll in February 1991 after 'retiring' from the British intelligence agency MI6. At one time he was seconded to the Northern Ireland Office and did work in the Foreign Office's Middle East department. Beyond that, Kroll won't be drawn, pleading the Official Secrets Act. Yesterday 58-year-old Oatley was away on Kroll business at an 'undisclosed foreign destination'.</p>

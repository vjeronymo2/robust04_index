			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: IMPERIAL BEACH  </P> <P> In Sacramento, an Assembly committee Monday gave unanimous approval to a bill  that would allow the financially strapped City of Imperial Beach to give 403  acres of its beachfront to the San Diego Unified Port District.  </P> <P> The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wadie A. Deddeh (D-Bonita), would allow the  transfer to relieve Imperial Beach of an estimated $1.2 million in costs each  year to maintain the beaches and pay off bonds worth $2.7 million to  reconstruct a fishing pier that was nearly destroyed by storms in the early  1980s.  </P> <P> The city needs to deed its beachfront to the port or else go broke by January,  1992, according to a state auditor general's report issued in March.  </P> <P> Deddeh's Senate bill to allow the transfer passed by an 11-0 vote Monday in the  Assembly's Natural Resources Committee, which forwarded the measure to the  Assembly Ways and Means Committee for another review.  </P> <P> If the non-controversial bill passes the Assembly as expected, it will go back  to the Senate for concurrence in technical amendments and then be sent to Gov.  George Deukmejian to be signed into law.  </P></p>

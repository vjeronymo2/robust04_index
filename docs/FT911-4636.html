			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / NatWest puts Dollars 150m into troubled US subsidiary NATIONAL Westminster Bank has injected Dollars 150m (Pounds 84.2m) in fresh capital into its troubled US subsidiary to cover mounting losses caused by the recession and a heavy exposure to the depressed New York real estate market. New York-based National Westminster Bancorp, which is wholly owned by the British clearer, yesterday reported a Dollars 190.9m loss in the first quarter, and disclosed that almost a tenth of its total loan portfolio is non-performing. Its loan loss provisions have risen sharply to Dollars 221.9m, from Dollars 55.9m a year earlier. The latest setback follows losses totalling Dollars 488m in 1989 and 1990. The British parent contributed Dollars 200m in new capital last year. Mr John Tugwell, who took over less than a week ago as chief executive of NatWest Bancorp, said that the first-quarter performance was 'clearly unacceptable'. He cautioned that 'until the economy improves, it would be an imprudent banker who says that the end (of the problems) are nigh'. But the British bank also affirmed continuing support for NatWest Bancorp. Mr Tugwell, who was in charge of NatWest's international division and who still sits on the main board in London, said: 'We have the basis of a good business here, and are looking forward to the day when the economy turns around and the problems are behind us'. Mr Tugwell replaced Mr Bill Knowles, who resigned last month. Several other changes have taken place in the senior management ranks, including the appointment of a senior vice-president for credit policy. NatWest Bancorp, with assets of Dollars 22.5bn, has 260 offices in New York and New Jersey, where it serves mainly the retail market and mid-sized businesses with annual revenues below Dollars 250m. The bank entered the US market in 1979 with the purchase of the former National Bank of North America. The problem property loans, which account for 45 per cent of the bank's total non-performing portfolio of Dollars 1.47bn, are centred on residential and office projects in New York City. The bank is obtaining independent appraisals on all the buildings to determine what write-offs may be necessary. Mr Tugwell said the rest of the non-performing portfolio consists of a diverse mix of business which has been affected by the general economic downturn. NatWest Bancorp is forging a new strategy of strengthening its profitable consumer and small-business operations, especially by developing new sources of fee and other non-interest income. The bank already has some 100,000 credit card holders, and may enter the insurance and investment-products business when regulatory barriers are eased. London stocks, Page 44</p>

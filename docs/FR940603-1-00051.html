			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Award of the contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon completion of the bid evaluations, the contracting committee will promptly report all findings and recommendations to the borrower's board of directors. The board will either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Resolve to award the contract to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reject all bids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certifications by the contracting committee.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The chairperson of the contracting committee shall certify as follows: ``The procedures for informal competitive bidding as described in 7 CFR 1726.202 were followed in awarding this contract.'' The certification executed by the chairperson of the contracting committee shall be submitted to REA in writing where required by subpart A of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1726.203 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Multiparty negotiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Multiparty negotiation may only be used where permitted under subpart F of this part or where prior REA approval has been obtained. The borrower must use the following procedure for multiparty negotiation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Selection of qualified bidders.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The borrower, on advice of its engineer, will compile a list of qualified bidders for each proposed contract. The borrower will send invitations to bid only to persons or organizations on its qualified bidder list for the specific project (see &sect;1726.23).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Invitations to bid.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The borrower, acting through the engineer, is responsible for sending out invitations to prospective bidders, informing them of scheduled bid openings and any other action necessary to procure full, free and competitive bidding. In any event, however, sufficient invitations need to be sent out to assure adequate competition and so that at least three bids will be received. Subject to the criteria in the preceding sentence, the determination of how many and which bidders will be permitted to bid will be the responsibility of the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice and instructions to bidders.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The borrower must indicate in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders'' section of the bid documents that bids will be opened privately. The borrower may elect to conduct clarifying discussions with the bidders. If such clarifying discussions are held, at least the three apparent low evaluated bidders must be given an equal opportunity to resolve any questions related to the substance of the bidder's proposal and to arrive at a final price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any factors, other than lowest dollar amount of the bid, which are to be considered in evaluating the proposals of qualified bidders ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , power consumption, losses, etc.) must be stated in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders.'' The borrower will, if applicable, include the relative weight assigned to each such factor and the way in which each factor will be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Handling of bids received.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The borrower or the engineer, as applicable, will indicate, in writing, the date and time of receipt by the borrower or the engineer on the outside envelope of each bid and all letters and other transmittals amending or modifying the bids. Any bid received at the designated location after the time specified must be returned to the bidder unopened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bid opening.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The contracting committee will conduct the bid opening in private. The contracting committee will open each bona fide bid which has been received prior to the deadline, and review it for any irregularities, errors, or exceptions. It must be verified that any addendum to the specification has been acknowledged by each bidder. The adequacy of bid bonds or certified checks must also be verified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conditions affecting acceptability of bids.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The borrower must take the following specified action if any of the following exist:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fewer than three bona fide bids received.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If fewer than three bona fide bids are received for the contract project, the borrower must obtain REA concurrence prior to awarding the contract. The borrower may, however, elect to return all bids unopened, make changes in the specification or the qualified bidders list or both and invite new bids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Significant error or ambiguity in the specification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is found which could result in the bidders having varying interpretations of the requirements of the bid, the borrower must either issue an addendum to each prospective bidder correcting the error or ambiguity before bids are received, or reject all bids and correct the specification. If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is discovered after the bids are opened, the borrower must reject all bids, correct the specification and invite new bids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Negotiations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The contracting committee may elect not to hold any negotiations and recommend award of the contract. Otherwise, the contracting committee must give at least each of the three apparent lowest evaluated bidders an equal opportunity to attend negotiations for the purpose of resolving questions regarding the specification and contract terms and to arrive at a final price. Neither prices of other bids nor relative ranking of any bidder are to be revealed under any circumstances. Upon completion of the negotiations, the contracting committee will determine the bid that is in the borrower's best interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Award of the contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon completion of the bid evaluations, the contracting committee will promptly report all findings and recommendations to the borrower's board of directors.

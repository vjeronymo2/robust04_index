			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Estrella Baltodano from the "Cosmovision" </F> newscast]    [Text] A few minutes ago, a special meeting was held  between National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman and  Sandinist People's Army [EPS] Chief General Humberto Ortega  Saavedra. After the meeting, Gen. Ortega said various issues  had been discussed, including the country's pacification,  security for the Nicaraguan people, and the military  organization law.    Addressing local and international reporters, Gen. Ortega  reiterated that he will not step down under pressure from the  United States or because of anyone's whim. Gen. Ortega Saavedra  said:    [Begin Ortega recording] The problem is not whether Humberto  Ortega leaves the Army. That is not Nicaragua's problem. The  problem is whether I am capable of bequeathing to Nicaragua the  Army it has never traditionally had. The problem is that  Humberto Ortega will not leave the Army because of what happened  on (?2) September, which resulted from pressure from the United  States and from whimsy. Neither Humberto Ortega nor anyone else  will ever leave this Army within that context.    The problem is not whether Humberto Ortega leaves but how he  leaves. We are capable of providing the country with a  military law that will consolidate this Army as the nation's  Army, an Army with a pledge to defend national sovereignty and  safeguard the security of all Nicaraguans regardless of their  race, religious creed, or political affiliation. To this end, I  believe that to insist that the problem is whether or not  Humberto Ortega steps down this year would be to view the issue  quite superficially.    I must state clearly that I will never leave this Army, nor  will the Army allow it -- it is a matter of dignity and  principles -- under the conditions that were raised on 2  September. I will never retire under such conditions.    This not mean that I am trying to enthrone myself or that I  want to remain here forever. That is not the case. My  departure should not result from pressures; it should be the  result of a decision among Nicaraguans regarding what is the  most advantageous thing to do within the framework of the law  and the framework of dignity; it must not be the result of  pressure, let alone pressure from foreigners.

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Observer: That's Liffe After months of searching, Liffe has finally found a replacement for its retiring chief executive Michael Jenkins. The prestigious job has already been spurned by one candidate. A high-flyer within the finance department of Hanson is thought to have turned down the position, which was last year paying just short of Pounds 200,000. Now it emerges that the futures and options exchange has again looked outside the narrow confines of the City, this time coming up with Daniel Hodson, deputy chief executive and group finance director of Nationwide Building Society. While both Jenkins and exchange chairman Nick Durlacher were not around yesterday to explain their choice, it is clear that 48-year-old Hodson has had a varied career. An old Etonian and graduate of Merton College, Oxford, Hodson says his 'profession' - he cringes slightly at the word - is treasury management. After a number of years at Chase, he moved to Unigate, where he was made finance director in 1981. In the late 1980s he spent two years, as chief executive and then chairman, at Davidson Pearce before the advertising agency was taken over, at which point he moved to Nationwide. A well-known figure in corporate treasury circles, he is one of the founder members, and now president, of the Association of Corporate Treasurers. Meanwhile Liffe, which has just celebrated its tenth anniversary in grand style, should be assured of entertainment at future parties. Hodson, governor of the Yehudi Menuhin school in his spare time, does not play the violin but does describe himself, with characteristic understatement, as 'a rather indifferent singer'.</p>

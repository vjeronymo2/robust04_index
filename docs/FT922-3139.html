			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: BBC chief faces watchdog scrutiny SIR MICHAEL CHECKLAND, director-general of the BBC, and Sir Peter Gregson, permanent secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry, will be among witnesses called by the all-party public accounts committee in the weeks leading up to parliament's summer recess. The reconvened public-spending watchdog, which will again operate under the chairmanship of Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and a former Treasury minister, recommences hearings next Monday. New members of the committee include Mr Denzil Davies, a former Labour defence spokesman. It is thought that an early task for Mr Sheldon will be to question officials to determine whether any parts of a National Audit Office report into the so-called Yamamah arms contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia can be made public. Sir Michael will be called to answer questions about the BBC World Service, which was urged to improve its efficiency by a recent report from the National Audit Office. Sir Peter will be asked about the privatisation of the regional electricity boards. The committee begins its hearings against a background of discontent among many MPs about delays in the reactivation of the select committee system. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow Commons leader, yesterday insisted there should be a select committee to cover 'each department of state', and in particular a committee to scrutinise Scottish affairs. If the government would meet these demands, there was 'no reason why they cannot be established very very quickly,' he said.</p>

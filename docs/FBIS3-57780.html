However, people  still need to show "care, patience, and understanding for each  other's life and experiences" in their dealings with one  another, Kohl said in his New Year address broadcast by Deutsche  Welle. After all, over 40 years of division has "left deep  marks."    The chancellor warned against any form of national  arrogance.  In Germany, love of the fatherland and an open-minded way of  thinking must never again go separate ways, he said. This is  the lesson the Germans must learn from their history. Kohl  added: "Those who fan the flames of xenophobia cannot claim to  be German patriots."    The chancellor once again voiced his support for the process  of European unification. The future of the Germans in peace and  freedom will always be closely linked with this. Kohl  emphasized: "The unification of Europe is a fateful matter for a  united Germany." He also affirmed Germany's willingness to make  its contribution to safeguarding peace and stability in the  world. In future Germany wants to "participate without  restrictions in the peacekeeping and peacemaking measures of the  United Nations.    Kohl added that, despite economic problems and the need to  consolidate the budget, Germany accepts its responsibility  toward the developing countries. Here the emphasis would be  more on the poorer developing countries and states "that are  making serious efforts to introduce political and economic  reform, and which above all respect human rights."    The deep changes in Russia are also a great challenge, the  chancellor stressed. Despite all concern and the necessary  vigilance with regard to the strong result for extremist forces  in the Russian parliamentary elections, there is no reason to  change the policy of supporting the reform process in the  country.</p>

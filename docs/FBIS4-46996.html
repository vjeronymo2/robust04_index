			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Center of Sociological Analysis of </F> International Conflicts of the Independent Russian Institute of  Social and National Problems: "Emigration, Migration, Migraine"]    [Text] On 1 December 1992 470,000 refugees and  800,000 forced resettlers were registered in Russia. In reality,  however, in the opinion of the heads of the Russian Federal  Migration Service (FMS), there were around 1.5 million of them  at that time. In November 1993, Tatyana Regent, chief of the  FMS, reported at a session of the Presidium of the Russian  Federation Council of Ministers that in 1993 Russia received  around 2 million forced resettlers and economic migrants.  Official sources estimate the number of refugees and migrants in  Russia to be between 1.7 million and 2 million. That figure  includes not only those who registered their status as a  refugee, but also individuals who did not register after  arriving from other independent countries.    The share of non-Russian ethnic groups among the total  number of immigrants in Russia, according to calculations by the  experts, amounts to 30 to 45 percent.  <H5>  Refugees and Forced Resettlers in Russia </H5>   The most active and large-scale migration of national,  principally Russian-speaking, minorities, and frequently  indigenous residents, is presently observed as coming mainly  from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Moldova. In  1992-1993, for example, some 800,000 persons left Georgia, a  third of whom are Georgians. As many as 778,500 individuals  departed Tajikistan, according to incomplete data. The stream of  migrants from Latvia, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and  Kazakhstan is also quite significant.    All those who have that right and apply to local organs of  the migration service are subject to registration as refugees.    The laws of the Russian Federation on refugees and on forced  resettlers, adopted on 19 February 1993, provide the following  formal-legal definitions of the corresponding categories of  people.    A refugee is any individual who has entered or plans to  enter  the territory of the Russian Federation who does not hold  citizenship of the Russian Federation, and who was compelled to  leave or has the intention of leaving the place of his permanent  residence on the territory of another country as the result of  violence committed against him or because of persecution in  other forms, or because of a real threat of being subjected to  violence or other persecution because of race or nationality,  religion, or language, or affiliation with a certain social  group or because of political convictions.    An individual who has committed a crime against peace,  humanity, or some other heinous premeditated crime cannot be  recognized as a refugee.    A forced resettler is a citizen of the Russian Federation  who  was forced to leave or has the intention of leaving the place of  his permanent residence on the territory of another country or  on the territory of the Russian Federation because of violence  or persecution in other forms against himself or members of his  family or because of a real threat of being subjected to  persecution due to racial or national affiliation, religious  beliefs, language, or membership in a certain social group or  because of political convictions causing hostile campaigns  directed against individuals or groups of individuals, massive  violations of public order or other circumstances that  substantially infringe on the rights of the individual.    An individual not holding citizenship of the Russian  Federation who left the place of his permanent residence on the  territory of the Russian Federation for reasons listed in the  first part of the article on resettlers may also be recognized  as a forced resettler.    A citizen of the former USSR, who resides on the territory  of  a republic that was a part of the former USSR, who arrived in  the Russian Federation under circumstances indicated in the  first part of this article and who acquired the citizenship of  the Russian Federation while on the territory of the Russian  Federation may be recognized as a forced resettler.    An individual who has committed a crime against peace and  humanity, or is guilty of some other heinous premeditated crime  cannot be recognized as a forced resettler. (See the law of the  Russian Federation on refugees and the law of the Russian  Federation on forced resettlers in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 1993, No  54, 20 March, p 4).    In accordance with these criteria, the status of a refugee  is  currently granted to those arriving in Russia primarily from  Tajikistan, Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, that is, from hot  spots where armed clashes occur. In addition, at present the  status of a refugee may be obtained by individuals arriving from  Latvia and Estonia, where they are becoming individuals without  citizenship. They have now been joined by refugees from  Ingushetia and North Ossetia who have left places of residence  in the Prigorodniy Rayon. Refugees from Chechnya and Dagestan  are also arriving in southern and central regions of Russia.  Individuals arriving from other regions, as a rule, receive the  status of forced resettlers.    In Moscow and its environs, as well as in St. Petersburg,  only those are now being officially registered who have  relatives there agreeing to register the refugees to their  housing area.    The new federal migration program has now been elaborated  together with drafts of supplements and changes pertaining to  laws on refugees and on forced resettlers which refine and  concretize criteria used to determine their status. The  proposals have been submitted to the Federal Assembly.    Until now, registration was not carried out at the time that  the border of the Russian Federation was crossed, which was  explained to a great degree by a lack of facilities on the  border. An individual intending to obtain the status of a  refugee or a forced resettler must personally apply to the local  organ of the migration service immediately upon arrival on the  territory of the Russian Federation. A refugee may not be  forcibly returned to the country which he left. The migration  service must examine the application within three days and issue  the applicant an appropriate document. After receiving the  document determining his status, a migrant acquires the same  political and social rights as a Russian citizen and is eligible  to receive assistance from state structures (grants, credit for  housing construction, medical and employment services) as well  as various privileges (interest-free long-term credit).    A presidential decree on measures for conduct of migration  control was signed on 16 December 1993, in accordance with which  it is planned to conduct the registration of migrants at the  time they cross the borders of Russia, in airports and at  railway stations. Preparations are currently under way to  implement that decree.    The opinion of experts on the number of migrants in all  categories (refugees, forced resettlers, economic migrants) in  Russia differ from official and unofficial figures of the  migration service. In the view of some of them, at the present  time this figure is around 4 to 5 million persons. The volume of  illegal migration is estimated at more than 500,000 persons per  month. According to predictions by specialists, a minimum of 2  million to 3 million persons, and a maximum of 4 to 6 million  may arrive in 1994 on the territory of Russia from the near  abroad and several autonomous republics of the Russian  Federation (North Caucasus) (some experts predict 10 million at  the minimum), along with over 100,000 coming from the far abroad.  <H5>  Russians as a National Minority </H5>   The most unfavorable living conditions for Russian national  minorities has developed in the region including Azerbaijan,  Georgia, the republics of Central Asia, and in Russia--Dagestan  and Chechnya. These regions account for up to 80 percent of all  Russian emigration. From one-third to a half of the almost  800,000 former local Russian residents have already departed the  most unstable Muslim republics of the former USSR--Tajikistan  and Azerbaijan. In the past four years (1990-1993), for  instance, the Russian-speaking population of Tajikistan actually  shrank by one-half: Of the almost 390,000 Russians (according to  the 1989 census) fewer than 200,000 remain.    Tajikistan, where practically 100 percent of the remaining  Russian residents intend to emigrate; Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,  and Kazakhstan, where 60 percent of the nonindigenous residents  are ready to emigrate; Armenia, where 70 percent of the  population in the republic intends to emigrate outside the  country, mainly to Russia and the United States; Latvia and  Estonia, where 80 percent of the Russian-speaking population  hold a negative view of the state of interethnic relations and  are ready to emigrate; all have the greatest emigration  potential for Russia at the present time. As indicated above,  the listed countries should also include Azerbaijan, Georgia,  and Moldova, where the number of those wishing to emigrate, both  Russians and indigenous residents, is steadily growing.  <H5>  The Migrational Balance of the CIS </H5>   At present, it is possible to speak about the substantive  change in the situation in the migrational balance of the former  Union republics. Beginning in 1993, immigration into Russia has  increasingly exceeded emigration from it. For instance, by  comparison with 1991, the number of people entering Latvia from  Russia and other former Union republics for permanent residence  decreased in 1993 by a factor of 2.7, from 12,600 to 4,600,  whereas the number of those departing Latvia during that period  increased by a factor of 2.2--from 23,900 to 51,800. In the  opinion of some experts, at the present time the correlation  between immigrants and emigrants in the migrational balance of  Russia with other former Union republics may be expressed as a  ratio of 8:2.    Departures from Russia for Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia,  Moldova, and Tajikistan have practically ceased. There was a  considerable drop in departures to Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and  Kazakhstan. At the present time, fewer people depart for Russia  than enter only in Ukraine and Belarus. In the opinion of the  experts, emigration and immigration streams will become equal in  Lithuania in 1994. The return of Estonians to Estonia, primarily  from Russia, as well as from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and  Abkhazia continues at a rate of approximately 600 persons a year.    At the present time, all of the former Union republics are  experiencing severe economic difficulties. That circumstance  significantly diminishes the streams of economic migration,  which always existed in the former Soviet Union, and the primary  role is acquired by refugees and forced resettlers for social,  national, and political motives. During 1990-1993, the share of  Russian residents in Kazakhstan decreased from 40.8 percent to  36.4 percent. This datum is evidence that in the superficially  peaceful Kazakhstan there are growing social and political  tensions.  <H5>  Causes and Consequences of the Influx of Refugees and </H5> Resettlers    Immigrants who left for Russia from Georgia, Azerbaijan,  Moldova, and Tajikistan almost all indicated the threat of  physical violence as their principal motive for coming to  Russia. The same reason was indicated by around 50 percent of  immigrants who left Central Asia.    Migrants from the Baltic countries point to problems with  acquisition of citizenship (in Latvia and Estonia) and  concurrent discrimination in education, at the place of  employment, in social security, and so on. Those leaving Central  Asia also speak of day-to-day crime against the nonindigenous  population, and add the Islamization of the way of life to the  listed reasons.    Adoption of new laws on citizenship in a number of countries  on the territory of the former USSR, as a rule, stimulates  emigration among the Russian population. Eighty percent of the  Russian population in Estonia and Latvia, for instance, wish to  leave those countries specifically because of the new  citizenship laws adopted there. Some 40,000 Russian-speaking  residents of the Estonian city of Narva, or two-thirds of all of  its residents, want to leave for that reason. Rejection of a  regulation on the possibility of dual citizenship is prompting  the exit of Russians from Kazakhstan. At the same time,  recognition of dual citizenship in Turkmenistan diminished  emigration of the nonindigenous population out of that republic.    The massive influx of refugees into individual regions (for  instance, in the south of Russia) throws virtually all of the  social and economic infrastructures and almost all of the  ancillary support systems out of balance. The food problem is  acutely exacerbated, and the social security system cannot  withstand the growing load. The situation in the sphere of  consumption is deteriorating. There is an increase in crime. The  situation with housing becomes much more difficult, and there is  a catastrophic shortage of it not only for local residents (in  Russia 10 million people are on the waiting list for state  housing), but also for hundreds of thousands of military  personnel returning to Russia from the near and far abroad, to  say nothing of refugees. The state of affairs on the employment  market is growing increasingly more tense. Possibilities for  finding work are shrinking rapidly.    All this compels one to view growing immigration as a  potentially explosive issue. In Kuban, for instance, the number  of migrants already comprises 15 percent of the kray population  and beyond 15 percent, according to the theory of threshold  figures, the normal and controllable course of events ends.    The situation is further aggravated by the fact that the  government of the Russian Federation is unable to offer migrants  really effective assistance. A total of 43 billion rubles [R]  were appropriated for the Russian FMS for 1994, when the Moscow  migration service alone needs R56 billion. For minimal  realization of laws on refugees and on forced resettlers, R165  billion is needed, in January 1993 prices, while full  realization of these laws in the same prices requires R240  billion.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Management: BBC produces a comedy of errors The long-predicted crisis at the BBC came not, as expected, in news and current affairs or drama. It was the comedy department, famous for programmes such as Porridge and Dad's Army, that really stuck the boot in. The department gave way to the temptation of a cheap deal and decided to take all BBC comedy programmes outside the corporation for editing and post production. It was just the sort of crisis that the critics of Producer Choice, the controversial new policy that will allow BBC producers progressively to buy in services from the outside world, had predicted. Work was going outside the corporation for short-term financial reasons and away from BBC staff - leaving the accountants to sweep up the double charging problem and point to the need for further redundancies. The centre simply had to move quickly to deal with such a crisis. A competing in-house bargain offer was quickly produced and the desertion of BBC comedy was nipped in the bud. This crisis involved mythical comedy programmes such as Bexley Heath Blues rather than genuine hits like One Foot In The Grave. It was a moment of high drama in a management simulation called Fast Forward in which senior BBC figures such as Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, and his BBC2 counterpart, Alan Yentob, played themselves. The simulation created by the Office For Public Management, a consultancy set up to help harassed managers cope with change, squeezed three years' experience of Producer Choice into two days. The aim of Greg Parston and Laurie McMahon of the OPM was to put maximum pressure on Producer Choice until the system crashed. Then potential problems could be anticipated and dealt with. With the exception of blips like the activities of the comedy department and a Harry Enfield Christmas Show that didn't make it on the air until Easter, Producer Choice failed to crash. 'It was almost as if, short of them deliberately wrecking it (Fast Forward), it would be very difficult to crash,' says Laurie McMahon. He watched, fascinated, as BBC producers, programme commissioners and resource managers, each dressed in different coloured T-shirts, gradually shed their institutional inhibitions and behaved, if not entrepreneurially, at least in an autonomous way. 'Fast Forward is like a flight simulator, except that in this case it's flown by about 20 pilots and about 50 cabin crew,' says McMahon. He believes that because they were able to 'fly it' and make sense of the experience, there should be no fundamental problems with Producer Choice. 'They've made the managerial leap out of the institutional way of thinking about things into a much more relaxed and managerial view of life,' he adds. The points now emerging from the Fast Forward debriefing include the need: to tie in clearly programme commissioning with the strategy of the corporation; to reach clear agreement on underspending to avoid everyone trying to squirrel money away for a rainy day; to emphasis the fact that quality is paramount at all stages and avoid becoming totally cost driven; to realise the importance of production planning in coping with uneven cash flows. For Powell, the conflicts exposed boil down to one fundamental issue - short-term versus long-term. The radical new relationships between what will, in effect, be separate businesses, fully-costed and expected to break even, will have to be carefully managed to ensure that in-house skills and resources are not decimated in pursuit of short-term savings. 'I think it can be managed as long as people are clear what they are trying to do,' Powell says. Throughout the simulation, the concerns about Producer Choice were used to draw the learning out. Michael Starks, responsible for implementing Producer Choice by spring 1993, believes that, by playing the game, producers realised that decisions about quality and price were in their hands. Now the inevitable has happened. Fast Forward is seen as such a success that everyone in the BBC from news and current affairs, to regions and radio wants one. Despite all the fun and games and elegant simulations, the introduction of Producer Choice is definitely no laughing matter. Estimates of a potential overspend at BBC Television Centre in the run-up to implementation of Producer Choice are heading towards Pounds 45m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on speech by President Husni Mubarak before Chinese </F> media delegation; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] President Husni Mubarak described the relations  between Egypt and China as being historic relations, since Egypt  was the first Arab and African nation to recognize the People's  Republic of China.    In a speech to a Chinese media delegation representing  Chinese media organizations, President Mubarak said that recent  international developments, both in the Middle East and in East  Asia, have brought attention to the vital importance of joint  consultations between Egypt and China for the purpose of  objectively evaluating these developments and seeking just and  reasonable solutions from all parties, which would support peace  and security throughout the world.  <H5>  More Profound Mutual Understanding With Asia </H5>   President Mubarak said: "Egypt is an African nation, but it  is also an Asia nation by virtue of the fact that it is located  on the crossroads of three major continents. For this reason,  Egypt's cultural and religious ties with a large number of the  Islamic nations and peoples in Asia impel Egyptian policy to  become increasingly interested in achieving more profound ties  of mutual understanding with the Asian continent."    The President added: "The economic and political importance  of the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, and the degree to  which they have come to participate in the world's production  and international trade, leads us to predict that the next  century will be the century of the Asian continent."    The President went on to say: "In light of the traditional  ties of friendship between Egypt and most of the nations and  peoples of Asia, Egyptian policy is one of pursuing active  diplomacy with most of the nations of that continent as well as  participating with other nations in the search for solutions to  problems which may appear from time to time." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Deep-Rooted Relations </H5>   In response to a question concerning the goal and  significance of his anticipated visit to China, President  Mubarak said: "Relations between Egypt and China are both  historical and political. With regard to the historical  dimension, Egypt was the first Arab and African nation to  recognize the People's Republic of China."    "With regard to the political dimension, the anchor of these  relations has been a deep-rooted friendship based on  cooperation, mutual consultation, and coordination regarding the  various Arab and world issues, due to the major role played by  China in the world arena and due to the importance of Egypt  among the Arab and African nations in the Middle East and  Africa."    The president said: "Egyptian-Chinese relations are nearly  40  years old. This has been a fertile period, full of developments  in the world arena in most of the continents of the world and in  the relations of the superpowers, after the profound and radical  changes that have taken place in the balance of power that had  been stable since World War II."  <H5>  Appraisal of the Situation </H5>   The president continued: "There is no doubt that the leaders  of both China and Egypt have their own particular views and  assessments of the nature of these changes and their likely  effects on the issues of international and regional security and  stability in the world as well as issues such as disarmament,  etc."    He added: "Recent international developments in the Middle  East and East Asia have brought attention to the special  importance of having mutual consultations between the two  nations for the purpose of coming up with an objective appraisal  [of the situation] and seeking just and reasonable solutions  from all parties which would support peace and security  throughout the world."    President Mubarak then replied to a question from the  Chinese  media delegation concerning his appraisal of the current  situation with regard to Egyptian-Chinese relations and ways  that would lead to strengthening ties of cooperation between  Egypt and China during the period of important changes the world  community is witnessing at the current time:  <H5>  Mutual Trust </H5>   "Egyptian-Chinese relations are characterized by a special  nature that makes them different from bilateral relations that  we have with many other friendly nations. In addition to the  ancient historical tradition that each of the two nations has,  as well as the great degree of mutual trust that has existed  between the peoples and leaders of the two nations over a period  of dozens of years, cooperation between the two countries has  been achieved in many areas of joint action in economic,  cultural, scientific, and other fields."    "Also, there have been many levels of cooperation between  the  official agencies and parliamentary, party, and labor union  organizations. This has created a common basis for mutual  understanding between the two peoples, which has greatly  strengthened the firm ties of friendship on the highest levels  that exist between Cairo and Beijing."    President Mubarak continued: "Naturally, if our political  relations have reached this degree of trust and this height, we  aspire to have our economic cooperation and trade reach these  world levels also, taking into consideration the great leap  achieved by the Chinese economy in growth and prosperity and the  important steps achieved in the Egyptian economy in recent  years."  <H5>  Trade </H5>   "These two factors should lead to an opening of broad  horizons and possibilities for the expansion of trade between  Egypt and China, to an increase in their share of the world's  trade, benefiting the peoples of the two friendly nations, and  to benefits being gained from the great technological and  industrial progress which has been achieved by China in recent  years."  <H5>  Experience in Economic Reform </H5>   Concerning a question about the aspects of similarity  between  Egypt's and China's experience with economic reform and what the  results have been of these experiments in terms of great  achievements and expertise gained, which could be utilized for  the mutual benefit of the two nations, President Mubarak said:  "Egypt, as a developing country, which in the early sixties  adopted the idea of central planning for its economy, has faced  big problems and taken on many burdens as a result of the  numerous armed conflicts that have taken place in the Middle  East and has had difficulties in connection with developing the  necessary infrastructure for economic development and increasing  its rates of growth. In addition to this, in Egypt we have  experienced a continual increase in our population, which has  been higher than the rates of our economic growth and which has  been disportionate to the nation's natural and economic  resources."    "In view of these problems, in the early eighties Egypt  initiated a comprehensive review of its economic plans and  programs, bearing in mind the requirements of modern economic  thought and the application of reform programs in a manner that  would be in accordance with our particular circumstances and  social conditions and the needs of our citizens in Egypt."    The president went on to say: "With the application of two  five-year plans since 1982 and the beginning of the third plan  in 1992, the reaping of the fruits of the monetary, fiscal, and  structural reform in the Egyptian economy, and the following of  policies of economic liberalization and privatization in  accordance with the circumstances of Egyptian society by  choosing the method of gradual development rather than that of a  sudden leap, we have been able to restore to the Egyptian  economy a large measure of its activity, vitality, and ability  to produce, export, and provide employment opportunities for  thousands of young people."  <H5>  Diagnosis and Cure </H5>   President Mubarak said: "The problems are still not over.  However, the diagnosis has been accurate and the cure has not  been a sudden one. Signs of health and strength have begun to  appear again in the Egyptian economy in the fields of industry,  agriculture, urban and rural development, and raising the level  of services.    "There is no doubt that the achievement of stability in  Egypt  and in the Middle East would provide the climate necessary for  pushing forward the wheel of economic progress and attracting  investment."  <H5>  Similarity in the Two Experiments </H5>   President Mubarak said: "We find a considerable degree of  similarity between the Chinese and Egyptian experiments in the  area of economic reform, in spite of the peculiarities of each  one. The transition from a policy of central planning to that of  adopting market mechanisms, giving free rein to individual  initiative, and having private enterprises, in addition to the  important role played by community ownership, are among the  common denominators of the two experiments."    President Mubarak added: "The nature of the experiment in  economic reform in each of the two countries--that is, the  experiment that took into consideration the special social  circumstances of the two peoples in Egypt and China, or what we  call the `social dimension of the process of economic  development'--was one of the more obvious aspects of similarity  when it came to correcting the path of the economy and adapting  it to the new economic circumstances which prevail in the world.    "Also, the development of the public sector, the creation of  free trade zones, the policy of encouraging foreign investments,  and the development of small industries are features of the  Chinese experiment that are similar to the models we are  following, on a smaller scale, of course, in our experiment in  economic reform in Egypt."    President Mubarak asserted: "Both the Egyptian and Chinese  experiments are the result of the nature of the circumstances of  economic development in Egypt and China, and are not merely a  blind response to some plans or advice that might not  necessarily be appropriate for the distinctive features of the  two economic experiments."  <H5>  Egypt's Ties to Asia </H5>   In response to a question concerning the general principles  of Egypt's foreign policy and its policy toward the continent of  Asia, President Mubarak said: "Egypt, as you know, is an African  nation, but it is also an Asian nation by virtue of its location  on the crossroads of the three great continents of Asia, Africa,  and Europe. Furthermore, a part of Egypt's territory--Sinai--is  in the continent of Asia."    He added: "The areas of Egypt's contemporary political  influence, as well as the realms of Egypt's activity throughout  the course of history, have been basically Africa and Asia due  to Egypt's relations with the Arab peoples and nations starting  many centuries ago and continuing till the present day.    "Egypt's ties to the Arab nations in Asia are not merely  attributable to cultural and historical ties, but are also  attributable to well-known vital economic interests, since the  Egyptian economy is affected both directly and indirectly by the  circumstances of the thousands of expatriate Egyptian workers in  the Gulf nations.    "The developments experienced by the Gulf area since the  beginning of the eighties have confirmed to what great degree  the security situation in the Gulf affects the security of the  Arab world and consequently the security of Egypt, and this was  clearly shown during the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran  and the Gulf war in 1990."  <H5>  Cultural and Religious Ties </H5>   President Mubarak continued: "In addition to this, we of  Egypt have cultural and religious ties to a large number of the  Islamic nations and peoples in Asia, and this has impelled  Egyptian policy to be oriented toward dedicating a large part of  its concerns and activities to strengthening the bonds of mutual  understanding between us.    "We cannot ignore the economic and political importance of  the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, ties that have reached  the point where they account for nearly half of the world's  production and international trade. This leads us to predict  that the 21st century will truly be the century of the continent  of Asia, which is witnessing the appearance of large economic  blocs.    "Because of all these objective considerations and in light  of the traditional relations of friendship that have linked  Egypt to most of the nations and peoples of Asia for a long  time, Egyptian policy is pursuing an active diplomacy with most  of the nations of the [Asian] continent on the political,  economic, and cultural levels. For the sake of achieving  security and stability in this continent, which is inhabited by  most of the world's population, Egypt is exchanging visits and  delegations with these nations and is following their  developments with great interest, and is participating along  with other nations and organizations of the international  community in the search for solutions to the problems that may  appear from time to time."

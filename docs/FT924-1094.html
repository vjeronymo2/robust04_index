			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Brokers take their pick - Trusts recommended as good buys for the small investor for next year INVESTORS are always being urged to move their savings into investment and unit trusts, but which ones should they choose? A bewildering variety of funds ison offer, and several different classes of share. So, the Weekend FT asked four private client stockbrokers to pick three trusts for the small investor to buy for 1993 and beyond. Although we gave them the choice of unit or investment trusts, all opted for the latter - perhaps because of their lower costs and long-term outperformance of their unitised rivals. Brian Tora, of Greig Middleton, starts by recommending Merchants' Trust. He says: 'If you are looking for income, this is one of the most successful UK equity income trusts around. Over the past five years, it has changed from being an international fund to owning almost exclusively UK blue chip stocks. 'Kleinwort Benson is the manager and, despite yielding more than the FT-A All-Share index, it has been able to increase the dividend without buying income or resorting to convertibles or more risky investments. The discount is modest at 5 per cent, but at this level still offers better value than a unit trust.' Tora's next choice pick is Alliance. 'For the growth-oriented investor, this is quality indeed. An Pounds 850m plus trust, it has a worldwide portfolio. The most important geographical areas are the UK, which represents 50 per cent and the US with 31 per cent. 'Dividend growth has been consistent, averaging 11 per cent plus over the past five years but even so the discount is in double figures. With the US moving out of recession and many major UK companies - well represented in Alliance's portfolio - benefiting from their North America exposure, this could be a good trust to hold for 1993.' Finally, he opts for Abtrust New Dawn but warns that 'this is for the racier punter, convinced that the Far East is still the economic powerhouse of the world and prepared to take the risks that these volatile markets will deliver. A relatively small trust at Pounds 40m, it has recovered in recent months from a dull period as a result of high exposure to Indonesia and Thailand and by eschewing Hong Kong. The fund manager, Hugh Young, takes a cautious view of Hong Kong but is very optimistic for China overall. The 15 per cent discount takes good account of the riskier nature of these markets'. Paul Killik of Killik picks three UK-invested trusts because of his belief that the London market offers good value at present. He opts for Law Debenture Corporation 'for capital appreciation combined with a market yield. The company's corporate trustee services makes the comparison of share price to net asset value, somewhat misleading with this trust. A fair value for trustee services would imply a reasonable discount for the quoted investments. Managed by Touche Remnant, this has been an outstanding long term performer.' Like Tora, Killik recommends Merchants Trust which 'offers an above average yield of 5 per cent, with prospects for growth of both income and capital. Kleinwort's flagship trust is entirely invested in the UK, has shown good long term performance, has minimal gearing and a strong revenue reserve position.' Killik's third choice is Drayton English &amp; International Trust. 'On a 50 per cent discount to net asset value, with the unquoted element of the portfolio now below 15 per cent and a new manager on board, the gearing employed by this fund will enhance any strength in the UK smaller company sector, which is widely expected to outperform. 'The trust has assets of about Pounds 50m and debt of Pounds 25m. The shares are attractive for capital appreciation with a good yield but have a higher risk/reward profile.' Edwin Lilley of Bell Lawrie White in Edinburgh says: 'I start by selecting the ideal widows and orphans stock, a generalist which will never be in the top quartile (25 per cent) of performers, but then I would not expect it to see it in the bottom quartile either. One of the few independents remaining, Scottish Investment Trust seeks capital and income growth through international investment and has consistently achieved these two objectives.' 'It is a conservatively managed trust with a long established management team and is an ideal core holding. On a 15 per cent discount to net assets which is well above the sector average, a yield of 3.5 per cent, and with a modest amount of gearing to take advantage of the improving outlook for equities, the shares represent very solid value. 'Smaller companies have consistently underperformed their larger counterparts over the past three years but 1993 should see a broadening of investor interest away from the FT-SE constituents. Interest rates, one of the keys to recovery for smaller companies, have more than halved from earlier highs, and the prospect for further reductions in 1993 is real. 'My second choice therefore is Fleming Mercantile,' says Lilley 'as it is the largest and one of the most successful smaller company specialists. It has approximately one third of its assets overseas, mainly in Hong Kong and the USA.' 'The Fleming's bank connection has allowed the trust to get into a number of interesting situations at an early stage in their development and at around 20 per cent, unquoteds account for a significant part of the portfolio. The 15 per cent discount looks abnormally high in the context of its fine record over recent years.' For his third choice, Lilley picks the capital shares of River &amp; Mercantile as 'a geared play on economic recovery in the UK. Although the portfolio has a slight leaning towards higher income/recovery situations the list looks much stronger than one tends to see in the portfolios of other trusts with split capital structures. 'Nervousness over future dividend payouts has resulted in large falls in many higher yielding stocks and the net asset values of splits have suffered with capital shareholders being hit particularly hard because of the gearing. 'River &amp; Mercantile's status also suffered due to the rights issue flop early in 1992 which left 80 per cent of the stock with underwriters. On the current discount, the capital shares offer exceptional value.' Nigel Sidebottom of Gerrard Vivian Gray starts with Bankers Investment Trust. 'This international trust, managed by Touche Remnant's Michael Moule, has an excellent long-term performance record. Moule has consistently demonstrated his ability to outperform markets while sticking to a low risk value-based approach to investment through the 10 years he has managed the trust.' 'Among the main international general investment trusts only Alliance has had comparable performance (in terms of NAV total return) over three and five years. Over 10 years, Bankers is well ahead. The current geographic exposure is 50 per cent UK, 23 per cent North America, 10 per cent Europe and 6 per cent Far East. The shares are on a 4.2 per cent discount and yield 3.5 per cent. The trust currently has about 15 per cent gearing through loans and debenture issues.' The trust is not Pep (personal equity plan) qualifying. However, TR provides an attractive savings scheme with a minimum Pounds 25 monthly investment.' Sidebottom's second option is for zero coupon shares in Jos Holdings. 'These zeroes were created earlier this year when a conventional trust was reconstructed; they are redeemable on January 31, 2003 at 249p. With a current price of 108.5p, they will provide an annual compound growth of 8.6 per cent if held to redemption. There is 102 per cent cover, that is no growth is required from the underlying portfolio for the zero holders to receive the promised redemption value. They therefore provide virtually assured capital growth. 'Investors not making use of their Pounds 5,800 annual capital gains tax exemption will receive the 8.6 per cent redemption yield as a tax-free return which compares very well with the net returns available from the building society. Jos invests principally in UK and European equities and is managed by Kleinwort Benson.' The income shares of St David's Investment Trust, says Sidebottom, are suitable for investors requiring an exceptionally high income. 'The trust has a fixed life and the income shares will be redeemed at 90p on November 30, 1998 and so ultimately investors buying the shares now - at a price of around 124p - will suffer some loss of capital. On the assumption, however, that dividends grow at 5 per cent per annum, the income shares will provide a gross yield to redemption of around 16 per cent. 'The trust is managed by Brian Banks at Guildhall Investment Management. The underlying portfolio is invested wholly in the UK and aims to generate both rising income and capital growth from a spread of blue chips, recovery stocks and special situations.' Prices, discounts and yields reflect those prevailing on Friday morning.</p>

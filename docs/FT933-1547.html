			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Spring Ram in board shake-out SHARES IN Spring Ram rose by 7 1/2 p to 68p after the kitchens and bathrooms group announced a boardroom shake-out and changes in accounting policy which revealed heavy losses and substantial gearing. The accounting changes meant Spring Ram declared a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.4m in the six months to July, compared with a restated profit of Pounds 8.2m. The group, previously always believed to have net cash, also revealed that it had net debt of Pounds 34.9m, giving gearing of 39 per cent. Mr Martin Towers, the new finance director, said the previous management had used 'very aggressive' accounting to maintain Spring Ram's high-growth record. Taking a more conservative line, the new regime had restated last year's profits, lowering the half-year total from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 8.2m and the full-year total from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 21.1m. Mr Roger Regan, installed as chairman by disgruntled institutional investors, yesterday requested and received the resignation of Mr Bill Rooney, chief executive and founder of the Yorkshire company. Two other directors also resigned, Mr Ron Farr, chief executive of special products, and Mr David Riley, chief executive of the bathrooms division. Mr Regan said the only executive member of the board at the time of his appointment to remain would be Mr Alan Bell, chief executive of the kitchen division. Mr Stuart Greenwood resigned as finance director prior to Mr Regan's arrival. Asked about compensation for the departing directors, Mr Regan said he expected to hear from their solicitors, but he would take 'a very hard line'. Price Waterhouse, the accountants which carried out a financial review for Mr Regan, has been appointed as auditors, replacing Arthur Andersen, which audited Spring Ram's 1992 accounts. Panmure Gordon has been replaced as stockbroker by de Zoete &amp; Bevan. Mr Regan said he was 'not in a position to give any indication as to the result for 1993,' although he was encouraged by the group's robust sales. He would contact Masco, the US building products group involved in preliminary discussions with Spring Ram in August about a takeover, to see if there was a basis for further talks. Losses per share of 10.9p compared with restated earnings of 0.7p. The interim dividend was passed. Lex, Page 18; Analysis, Page 20; Auditors' role, Page 20</p>

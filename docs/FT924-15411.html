			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Economics: Indicators hint at German slowdown THIS week sees the first of the monthly string of statistics on the German real economy. They are expected to show that the west German economy is in mild recession with manufacturing orders and industrial production falling and unemployment rising. As the west German economy has slowed, employment growth has also eased. Unemployment, which has been rising steadily since the beginning of the year, is expected to increase by 20,000. Most forecasters believe it will continue rising for the rest of the year. In the UK the economic highlight of the week is last month's retail prices index. The figure is due to be released on Friday morning, shortly before Mr John Major, the prime minister, rises to address the Conservative Party at the end of its annual conference in Brighton. Any inflationary effects of sterling's recent devaluation will not yet have fed through to the index, so at least on his inflationary record, Mr Major should have little explaining to do. The following are some of the other economic highlights and events of the week. The figures in brackets - from MMS International - are the median of economists' forecasts. Today: Luxembourg, EC foreign ministers' meeting; UK, August credit business; Denmark, August current account (DKr1.5bn); US, September 21-30 car sales (6.2m); Canada, September Bank of Canada reserves (-CDollars 4bn). Tomorrow: US, Federal open markets committee meeting in Washington; Germany, September unemployment - west (up 20,000), August employment - west (up 10,000), September vacancies - west (down 5,000), September unemployment - east (down 19,000), September short time work - east (down 14,000). UK, Conservative party conference opens in Brighton. Wednesday: US, August wholesale trade, August consumer credit (Dollars 1bn repayment); Australia, October consumer sentiment, August leading indicators. Thursday: US, initial claims week ended September 26 (420,000), state benefits week ended September 19, money supply data for week ended September 28; Canada, September housing starts (up 165); Australia, September unemployment rate (11 per cent), September employment (down 2,500); Germany, parliamentary debate on Maastricht in Bonn.

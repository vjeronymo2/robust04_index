			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Recall Notices_40 CFR Part 51.370  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The federal regulation requires the states to establish methods to ensure that vehicles that are subject to enhanced I/M and are included in an emission related recall receive the required repairs prior to completing the emission test and/or renewing the vehicle registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act 166 and the Commonwealth's I/M regulation provide the legal authority to require owners to comply with emission related recalls before completing the emission test and renewing the vehicle registration. The SIP includes procedures to be used to incorporate national database recall information into the Commonwealth's inspection database and quality control methods to insure recall repairs are properly documented and tracked. The submittal includes a commitment to submit an annual report to EPA which includes the recall related information as required in 40 CFR part 51.370(c). The recall compliance program contained in the SIP submittal meets the federal requirements and is approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> On-Road Testing_40 CFR Part 51.371  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On-road testing is required in enhanced I/M areas. The use of either remote sensing devices (RSD) or roadside pullovers including tailpipe emission testing can be used to meet the federal regulations. The program must include on-road testing of 0.5% of the subject fleet or 20,000 vehicles, whichever is less, in the nonattainment area or the I/M program area. Motorists that have passed an emission test and are found to be high emitters as a result of an on-road test shall be required to pass an out-of-cycle test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Legal authority to implement the on-road testing program and enforce off-cycle inspection and repair requirements is contained in Act 166 and the Commonwealth's I/M regulation. The SIP submittal requires the use of RSD to test 20,000 vehicles per year in the I/M program area and will be implemented by the contractor. A description of the program which includes test limits and criteria, resource allocations, and methods of collecting, analyzing and reporting the results of the testing are detailed in the submittal. The on-road testing program described in the SIP meets federal requirements and is approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State Implementation Plan Submissions/Implementation Deadlines_40 CFR Part 51.372&hyph;373  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Pennsylvania submittal included the Commonwealth's final I/M regulations, legislative authority to implement the program, a final RFP, portions of the contractor's proposal, the signed contract between the Commonwealth and the contractor, a modeling demonstration showing that the program design meets the performance standard, evidence of adequate funding and resources to implement the program, and a detailed discussion on each of the required program design elements. The submittal states that all inspectors and stations will be certified by December 22, 1994 and the start date for implementation of full-stringency cutpoints will be January 1, 1997. The submittal also includes a commitment to include onboard diagnostic checks in the I/M program within 2 years after promulgation of onboard diagnostic check regulations for I/M programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act 166 provides the legal authority to implement the program. However, part of this provision states ``this program shall be established in all areas of this Commonwealth where the secretary certifies by publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that a system is required in order to comply with Federal law.'' Act 166 requires ``at least 60 days prior to the implementation of any enhanced emission inspection program developed under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall certify by notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that an enhanced emission inspection program will commence''. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation states that the program begins 60 days after publication of the notice. It is stated in the Pennsylvania I/M SIP that ``it is not possible at this time to furnish a copy of that notice since it will be published in calendar year 1994.'' The SIP goes on to state that ``when that notice has appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bulletin, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Department shall furnish a copy to the EPA as an amendment to this SIP''. EPA interprets this language as a commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to publish the bulletin notice announcing the start date of the program and submit it as an amendment to the SIP by December 31, 1994. EPA also interprets this language to mean that the program will commence no later than March 1, 1995. Although the federal I/M regulation requires programs to commence on January 1, 1995, EPA believes that Pennsylvania can test the appropriate number of vehicles in calendar year 1995 and that therefore a two-month delay in the start date is de minimis. EPA is therefore proposing to find that the SIP submission and implementation deadline requirements set forth in the federal I/M regulation are substantially satisfied based on the condition that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit to EPA by December 31, 1994 the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice certifying the need for the program and that the program begins sixty days after the date of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania SIP based on the Commonwealth's commitment to meet this condition. If the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice is not received by December 31, 1994, EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter to the Commonwealth indicating that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

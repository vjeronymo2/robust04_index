			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: An encounter in Peshawar with Afghan men of war - James Henderson watches buzkashi, a test of skill and a battle for power and influence PERSIA AND INDIA have long been known for their horseback sports. Polo was played there for centuries before it made its way to Britain. At their centre, Peshawar (now in the North West Frontier of Pakistan) has seen countless waves of horseborne raiders and polo players pass through. Recently it has seen another sport, brought by the Afghan refugees fleeing the war in their country. Driving along the old Charsadda Road out of Peshawar on a Friday morning, we passed a stream of horsemen trotting after one another. Dressed in huge coats, they sat deep in fleece saddles, their legs thrust forward in leather stirrups. They were Afghans; by their Mongol features we could tell that many were from the central Asian steppes. They congregated on a patch of open ground where there was a frenzied crush of horses, constantly shuffling and kicking up billowing clouds of brown dust. Suddenly a horse emerged at the gallop, knees and hooves flailing, its rider high in the saddle. He spurred his horse away, chased by other riders who grappled at him, but eventually he broke free and charged off. It was a game of buzkashi, a traditional Afghan pastime, uprooted from the highland valleys and the northern plains of Afghanistan and brought to Peshawar by the refugees. In a time of war, this is one of the few pleasures that they allow themselves. These men are the descendants of the central Asian hordes - Mongol horsemen at play. Originally, buzkashi evolved as a test of skill for the horseman, leisure as an extension of work, in which the players competed for the control of a dead calf. It may seem like a rough business (just as you hear lurid stories of polo games played with the heads of war victims, so buzkashi was reputedly played with their bodies), but it is also a clear and subtle expression of the Afghan way of life. Superficially, the riders are struggling for control of the calf, but beneath the breathtaking spectacle there is a parallel struggle for local power and influence. As each rider makes a successful run, wresting the calf free and charging off, he drops the carcass back in the centre of the press and rides over to one of the older men watching on horseback a little away from the main action. These are the khans, the patrons of the game. They hand over money to the skilled rider (the khan is perhaps the owner of the horse that he is riding). The rider becomes famous but his khan gains even more in stature. In a country where political power may only stretch for a few miles within a fertile valley, a successful buzkashi will extend a khan's influence. A crowd of spectators had gathered, clustered on high ground above the field of play. Vendors plied up and down with plastic bags of nuts and sliced sugar cane, a sweet thirst-quencher in the heat of the Pakistan winter. The word buzkashi means 'goat-dragging,' but generally the riders use the carcass of a calf. Its head and hooves are chopped off, making it more difficult to grab, and it is gutted. It can weigh as much as 100lbs, so it is a vast weight to lift with one hand (the other hanging onto the saddle), particularly when feet, stirrups and horses hooves are thrashing about in the dust. When it has been hauled up into the saddle and the rider is trying to make his way out of the crush, other riders will try to grab it from his hands by pulling at another leg. It is so heavy that the rider has to lean over to counterbalance the weight. Horses are even trained to ride in a circle to make the balancing easier. As with the rest of Afghan life, there are few formal rules. The riders simply congregate and when there are enough of them to make a game, they start to play. There are no referees and no limits to the pitch. It is a violent crush, but the riders rarely seem to come unseated. Just as in real life, informal alliances are struck between riders as they reach for the calf. A 'run' is made when a rider breaks free, carrying the calf, and outpaces the others. Early on, a new calf is unwieldy and difficult to catch hold of, but it softens as the game hots up; the game continues until it disintegrates. We stood as close as we dared, about 50 yards from the centre. I have a picture of a friend running at full stretch with a posse bearing down on him. He nearly had to jump into the river to get clear, but he survived unscathed; one man we saw was carted off to hospital. The frenzy of the game is compelling. In the shifting melee the horses move against one another, bulk against bulk, in a fearsome merry-go-round. Whip clenched between his teeth, a rider on the fringes who wants to get into the centre will rear his horse and jump it forward, forcing his way into the middle. In the crush, a horse's head rears and for a split second it freezes against the skyline, mouth open wide and eyes staring wildly. The riders are manoeuvring, trying to get above the calf, looking for an opportunity to reach down and grab it. In the confusion a space opens and a man drops from the saddle, just keeping his grip in the stirrups, leaning to grasp the calf from among the stamping hooves. He heaves himself back into the saddle and hooks the calf under his thigh. He kicks his horse on, cutting a path out of the crush, looking to break free. But another man is at his side, also grappling for the prize. He lunges and grasps the calf by another leg. Their horses cut free and gallop side by side, followed by a pack of other riders. The two men face each other, locked in combat over the calf that is slung between them. But the first man, whose grip is more secure, turns his horse sharply and the calf slips from the other's grasp. Still galloping, the victor heaves at his burden, leans sideways again and charges off alone, 100 yards clear. Then he turns back towards the crush. Triumphant, he trots until he gets within 10 yards and then he spurs horse into the melee, rearing it up on its back legs to get into the centre. As he comes to a halt he drops the calf to the ground again, ready for the next play. A moment later he trots over to the khans to collect his reward. He is accompanied by a huge man in thigh-length leather boots, coarse woollen coat open to the waist and Charles Bronson moustache, who addresses the crowd, shouting how bravely the deed was performed. The crowd laughs when he describes how, with all that exertion, the rider's hat flew off. The crier praises the rider and the horse. As the rider collects his money, the man praises the khan who is the horse's owner.</p>

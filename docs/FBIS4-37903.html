			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Jun (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak left Cairo for the Libyan Jamahiriyah this afternoon.  He will meet with brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi.    The two leaders will discuss the developments of the  Libyan-Western crisis, "the Lockerbie crisis," in light of  Libya's recent offer to put the two Libyan suspects on trial  before a tribunal consisting entirely of Scottish judges that  would meet at the International Court of Justice.    President Mubarak and Col. al-Qadhdhafi will review the  developments of the Middle East peace process and current  consultations over ways of boosting the negotiations on the  other Arab-Israeli negotiating tracks. They will also discuss  inter-African conflicts and some important international issues  that have implications for the Arab region.    President Mubarak is accompanied on this two-day visit by  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa; Information Minister Safwat  al-Sharif; Engineer Sulayman Mutawalli, minister of transport  and communications; Dr. 'Atif 'Ubayd, public business sector  minister and minister of state for administrative development  and environmental affairs; Dr. Zakariya 'Azmi, director of the  presidential office; and Dr. Usamah al-Baz, foreign ministry  first under secretary and director of the president's office for  political affairs.</p>

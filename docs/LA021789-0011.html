			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> CBS breathed a sigh of relief Thursday and reported that its highest-rated  entertainment series, "Murder, She Wrote," will return next fall for a sixth  season. The network, running third in the prime-time ratings, already had  locked up the professional services of the show's star, Angela Lansbury, but  needed more time to work out an agreement with the show's producer, Universal  Television.  </P></p>

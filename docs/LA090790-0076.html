			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Fed Voids Bank-Insurance Law: The Federal Reserve Board voided a Delaware law  allowing banks to sell insurance nationwide in what banking officials described  as a turf battle between the central bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. The order targeted Family Guardian Life Insurance Co., a company  controlled by Citicorp's wholly-owned Citibank of Delaware, and ordered the  operation closed. The reserve board said safeguards placed in the law by the  FDIC were so restrictive they, in effect, barred banks from the insurance  business, and by federal law a subsidiary or division also cannot engage in  that business.  </P></p>

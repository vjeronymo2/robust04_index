			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Big German unions accept 3% pay rise THE two biggest public sector trade unions in Germany last night accepted a pay deal of just 3 per cent for the current year, boosting hopes for wage restraint throughout the German economy. The deal, agreed after two days of negotiations with both central and state governments, could open the way for further relaxation of interest rates by the German Bundesbank in the coming weeks. The public sector workers, numbering 3.2m, are seen as leaders in the current wage round. The offer of a 3 per cent pay rise was made by the public sector employers, led by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, after a day of rising hope in the negotiations. It was immediately recommended by the negotiators for the oTV, the main public sector union, and the DAG, the smaller, white-collar union. By 10.30 last night, the full wages commissions of both unions had voted in favour. The outcome, after just three full rounds of negotiations, is in sharp contrast to the confrontation in the public sector last year, when an 11-day strike, chaos in public transport and piles of rubbish on the streets were resolved by grudging acceptance of a 5.4 per cent pay deal. The new accord will be widely welcomed in governments - wages account for 40 per cent of the overburdened budgets at the level of the 16 state governments - and in industry, where employers have been urging severe wage restraint. Three per cent is clearly below the inflation rate, which averaged 4.5 per cent last year and is forecast at 3.5 per cent in 1993. The employers' offer yesterday was a significant improvement on the original 2.25 per cent on the table, but well short of the union demand for up to 5.5 per cent. A deal of about 3 per cent was always regarded by economic observers as the best possible outcome.</p>

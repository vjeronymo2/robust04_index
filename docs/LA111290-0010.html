			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DISCOVERING THE LETHAL SIDE OF HERBS;  </P> <P> PLANTS: COMFREY IS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY DAMAGING TO THE LIVER. MANY OTHER  POTENTIALLY TOXIC HERBAL PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOLD, EXPERTS FEAR.  </P> <P> The 49-year-old woman had developed a rare liver ailment with symptoms seen  only in chemotherapy patients, end-stage cirrhosis of the liver and a rare type  of liver poisoning caused by a substance known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids.  </P> <P> Dr. Paul M. Ridker, a cardiology fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital at  Harvard Medical School, knew the woman did not drink and had never undergone  chemotherapy. He also knew there had never been a case of pyrrolizidine  poisoning reported in North America. But nothing else explained the woman's  symptoms.  </P> <P> "We eventually found the woman had been drinking large amounts of comfrey tea  and taking comfrey pepsin tablets daily for six months," Ridker says. "We later  analyzed the tea and tablets in the lab and found the preparations contained  large amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which caused her liver disease.  </P> <P> "Harvard is a major teaching hospital but it took us four years to link the  comfrey with the liver disease. My point is, I think the herb problem is much  larger than physicians realize and that many other such cases are going  unreported."  </P> <P> Ridker and others now recommend that people avoid food products containing  comfrey, but their concern is not limited to comfrey. Experts are becoming  increasingly wary of other herbs, herbal teas and other herbal preparations.  They are concerned that many potentially toxic herbs may be sold in health food  stores, drugstores and even supermarkets.  </P> <P> Sales of herbal products are large -- anywhere from half a billion to a billion  dollars yearly, according to the the Herb Research Foundation. The sales are  spurred by claims that comfrey, for instance, is good for wound healing and  aiding digestion. Other herbs, like aloe, are used in hopes they will soothe  burns and wounds or remove excess gasses from the gastrointestinal tract.  </P> <P> Says William Jarvis, professor of preventive medicine at Loma Linda University  and president of the National Council Against Health Fraud Inc.: "Herbs can  actually be very potent medications. However, mother nature doesn't supply a  standard dose. A herb can be stronger, or weaker, depending on the part of the  plant consumed, the time of the year it was harvested, how long it has been  stored and even if it was a dry year when picked."  </P> <P> Although the majority of herb products are probably safe, experts say at least  26 commonly available herbs contain toxic compounds which have caused disease  in the gastrointestinal, cardiac and nervous systems. Other herbal-caused  health concerns have ranged from liver failure to skin inflammation to abortion  to lowered blood pressure to death.  </P> <P> After comfrey, the most dangerous herbs, say Ridker and other experts, are  buckthorn, pokeroot and teas with pure licorice, all of which may contribute to  high blood pressure. Teas made with tonka beans, woodruff or elilot, herbs that  contain organic coumarins, can suppress coagulation. Even every grandmother's  favorite, sassafras, can be dangerous to the liver because of its high content  of safrole.  </P> <P> When Ridker looked up articles about the unusual poisoning printed in  scientific journals, he became even more concerned. He discovered that a woman  in England had died because she consumed a lot of comfrey tea. In the early  1970s, a weed containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids fell into some wheat being  harvested in Afghanistan. When the farmers and their families consumed bread  made from the contaminated wheat, 25% of the 7,200 villagers developed the  liver ailment within two years.  </P> <P> Other outbreaks of such poisoning have occurred in Jamaica, Africa and India  after people consumed comfrey or other plants containing the liver-damaging  substance. In one case in Switzerland, a pregnant woman drank a tea containing  pyrrolizidine alkaloids and gave birth to a baby with a damaged liver.  </P> <P> Groundsel and gordolobo, two other widely available herbs, also contain  pyrrolizidine alkaloids.  </P> <P> New Zealand, Japan and Canada have banned most comfrey and comfrey products.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating comfrey products and  considering a ban.  </P> <P> Experts say many consumers regard herbs and other plant products as harmless  because they grow naturally in our good earth. However, cocaine, opium, tobacco  and marijuana, which are far from harmless, can all be considered herbs.  </P> <P> R. Frank Chandler, professor of pharmacy and director of the College of  Pharmacy at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, analyzed 65 popular herbs  such as pokeberry, chamomile, feverfew and cayenne. Chandler then summarized  the herbs' main ingredients, their major uses, safety and side effects. (See  chart.)  </P> <P> "The safety of herbs depends on the herb under consideration and how it's  prepared," says Chandler. "Just because a herb has been used for several  thousand years for a particular purpose, there's no guarantee it's safe or  effective. Moreover, there are cases of herbs interacting with prescription  medications."  </P> <P> Moreover, because the Federal Drug Administration has classified herbs as food  products -- and not drugs -- manufacturers are not required to prove that herbs  are safe or effective. Thus, willy-nilly herbal use can be risky.  </P> <P> However, the herbal picture is not all as dark as death.  </P> <P> "Except for comfrey, I'm not concerned about herbs or herbal teas consumed in  reasonable, ordinary amounts," says Norman Fransworth, a professor in the  College of Pharmacy at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  </P> <P> "True herbalism includes scientific testing, honest reporting of the results  and safe use of effective herbs by informed practitioners," says Varro E.  Tyler, vice president for academic affairs and professor of pharmacognosy at  Purdue. Pharmacognosy is the study of drugs derived from natural products.  </P> <P> "Herb use can be a Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde situation," says Tyler, who is also  the author of "The New Honest Herbal" (J. B. Lippincott Co.) He says "  'Paraherbalism,' a pseudoscience about herb use, is usually characterized by  popular myths." He lists them as:  </P> <P> * Herbs are "natural" and do no harm.  </P> <P> * Whole herbs are more effective than their isolated active constituents.  </P> <P> * "Natural" and "organic" herbs are superior to synthetic drugs.  </P> <P> * Astrological influences may be significant. (Some practitioners prescribe  herbs according to astrological signs.)  </P> <P> * Tests in animals are not applicable to human beings.  </P> <P> The American Botanical Council, an herbal educational group in Austin, Tex., is  promoting a new regulatory classification for herbs, called "traditional  medicines."  </P> <P> "That category would let us review the safety and efficacy of herbs," says Mark  Blumenthal, executive director. "Currently, it costs somewhere around $125  million to get one new drug approved in the United States. And, we do need to  provide for appropriate labeling of herbs so the proper directions can be  given. But in the present regulatory climate created by the federal government,  that's just impossible. Consumers are not getting adequate directions for  taking herbs although it's clear people really want these products. Eventually,  we would like to develop an American Botanical Code, which would be a thorough  and authoritative reference work on herbs."  </P> <P> According to the council, only about 2% of 500 commonly available herbs have  been subjected to clinical testing. Of the herbs that have been tested,  feverfew has been used by physicians to treat migraine; gingko leaf extract is  used for circulatory problems, tinnitus and short-term memory loss; milk  thistle seed extract is used for liver toxicity conditions, and valerian root  ingredients became a sedative. About 25% of prescription medications were first  taken or synthesized from plants, experts say.  </P> <P> Ryan J. Huxtable, professor of pharmacology at the University of Arizona,  suggests the following guidelines for consuming herbs:  </P> <P> * If ill, see a physician, not an herbalist.  </P> <P> * Do not take herbs if you are pregnant, nursing or trying to get pregnant.  </P> <P> * Do not take a large quantity of one preparation or on a daily basis.  </P> <P> * Use only preparations that list the plants on the package.  </P> <P> * Do not consume anything that contains comfrey.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POTENTIALLY HARMFUL HERBS  </P> <P> The following are some herbs used for various physical problems  </P> <P> HERB: MAJOR USES: SIDE EFFECTS: COMMENTS:  </P> <P> HERB: Comfrey  </P> <P> MAJOR USES: wound healing, digestion aid  </P> <P> SIDE EFFECTS: harmful to the liver  </P> <P> COMMENTS: contains high levels of pyrrolizide alkaloids.  </P> <P> HERB: Feverfew  </P> <P> MAJOR USES: migrain prevention fever reduction gas removal from GI tract help  menstral flow  </P> <P> SIDE EFFECTS: oral ulcers  </P> <P> COMMENTS: not for use during pregnancy  </P> <P> HERB: Goldenseal  </P> <P> MAJOR USES: digestion aid stop bleeding after childbirth  </P> <P> SIDE EFFECTS: ---  </P> <P> COMMENTS: dangerous in high doses  </P> <P> HERB: Juniper  </P> <P> MAJOR USES: diuretic, antiseptic flavoring reduce GI gasses  </P> <P> SIDE EFFECTS: kidney irritation dermatitis  </P> <P> COMMENTS: not to be used during pregnancy or kidney disease  </P> <P> HERB: Poke root  </P> <P> MAJOR USES: laxative, antirheumatic,respiratory tract conditions  </P> <P> SIDE EFFECTS: severe cramping vomiting, weakness low blood pressure spasms  </P> <P> COMMENTS: should not be consumed  </P> <P> HERB: Sassafras  </P> <P> MAJOR USES: antirheumatic, diuretic  </P> <P> SIDE EFFECTS: toxic to liver, carcinogenic  </P> <P> COMMENTS: listed by FDA as a food adulterant  </P> <P> Source: R.

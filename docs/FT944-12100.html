			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Lome 'will not survive century' The Lome convention, the treaty under which the European Union grants trade and aid concessions to the former European colonies, will not survive the century in its current exclusive form, a senior EU official said yesterday. Mr Peter Pooley, director-general of the development directorate, said in London: 'I don't see Lome lasting as an exclusive club beyond the end of the century.' The EU this year began to negotiate the fifth Lome accord with developing country governments, but he said: 'If there is a Lome V, it will be a more generalised one.' There was no reason to exclude such countries as Bangladesh from the convention, he said. A new accord would also seek to differentiate between countries of different development levels, and differentiate one region from another, he said. Lome IV was agreed as the Berlin Wall was falling, but failed to take account of the consequences.</p>

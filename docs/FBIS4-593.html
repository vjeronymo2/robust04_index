			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- The international  mediation process ground to an abrupt halt on Wednesday [13  April] morning when kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi  accused the government and the African National Congress of  unilaterally changing the terms of reference. Mr Buthelezi  accused the ANC and the government of colluding to keep the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] out of the election by not allowing  the mediators to consider a change in the election dates.    An irate Mr Buthelezi accused the government and the ANC of  reneging on the terms of reference agreed to between the ANC and  the IFP at the weekend. The international mediators, including  Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington were holed up in a  Johannesburg hotel room for discussions while Mr Buthelezi and  his team waited in the lobby. They were due to have departed to  a secret location to begin the mediation intended to resolve  outstanding constitutional issues.    Dr Kissinger, after a meeting with ANC President Nelson  Mandela on Wednesday morning, said the mediators did not  consider the election date to be part of the terms of reference.  The initial terms of reference agreed to by a joint IFP/ANC  working group on Sunday made no mention of the election dates.  However, the IFP has consistently maintained that the  resolution of constitutional differences that have so far kept  it out of the elections would inevitably reopen the debate on  the election dates.    At the Skukuza summit last Friday, it was agreed that the  government would join the mediation process as a full  participant. Following this, new terms of reference had been  drafted that specifically entrench April 26-28 as the election  dates.    Mr Buthelezi said he received the new draft on Tuesday night  and that he objected to it. On Tuesday, ANC Secretary General  Cyril Ramaphosa told the Transitional Executive Council he  wanted to make it clear that a postponement of the election was  not up for negotiation. In a reference to the IFP, Mr Ramaphosa  said there were parties who still hoped the elections could be  postponed. He was later involved with Deputy Constitutional  Development Minister Fanus Schoeman in drawing up the new terms  of reference.    Mr Buthelezi said his negotiators would meet the ANC on  Wednesday afternoon to try iron out their differences on the  terms of reference. "The new draft (of the terms of reference)  is not acceptable to us. The ANC and the government are trying  to make sure there is no chance of discussing a new election  date," he said.    He said the ANC and the government had brought the mediators  to South Africa under false pretences.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Japan's ruling party presses for economic boost JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party has increased pressure on the government to boost the country's flagging economy by unveiling a package of proposals costing up to Y7,000bn (Pounds 29.5bn). The LDP's announcement, made on Saturday, comes amid intense debate among party chiefs and government officials over the need to boost the economy. While the party has won some support for action from some ministries, including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the powerful Ministry of Finance has so far resisted demands for immediate increases in public spending. The Bank of Japan has also fended off calls for further cuts in interest rates. The LDP's plans were criticised in newspapers yesterday for containing no specific reference to a supplementary budget, or any other means of raising money to pay for the proposals. But by making an announcement ahead of final agreement with the Finance Ministry, the party achieves an important goal. It signals to the Japanese people and the outside world its willingness to increase government spending at a time when the economy is slowing and the US is pressing Japan to take action to revive economic growth. The announcement comes before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, leaves tomorrow for a meeting with President George Bush in Washington, followed by the Group of Seven summit of leading industrialised countries in Munich. Mr Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the LDP's policy committee, who announced the package, declined to comment on the size of a possible supplementary budget. His reticence reflects party officials' caution in the face of the Finance Ministry, which has yet to give a firm indication about authorising additional spending in the current financial year. The LDP's plans propose Y1,000bn in low-interest loans for small businesses, hard hit by the economic slow down. They also include tax breaks for investment in equipment, plus extra spending on science, technology and the environment, and help for repairing nuclear power stations in the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: Devaluation is no answer, and 'siren voices' must be resisted Sir, Once again, some of Britain's industrialists cry 'devalue' ('Business chiefs join call for devaluation of sterling', July 31). I do not believe this would solve Britain's economic difficulties. Way back in 1981, when the pound was worth nearly two D-Mark more than it is today, my company was the first hop merchant to win the Queen's Award for Exports. We had succeeded in selling English hops to a number of foreign countries which have continued to import them ever since - irrespective of currency parities. Mind you, we did it through sheer hard work, and we didn't pay ourselves huge salaries. . .If the Germans can export with a rock-hard currency, why shouldn't we British?

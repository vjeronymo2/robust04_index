			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / ITV companies ask government to reduce 'severe' levy on revenue THE Home Office and the Treasury have agreed to examine ITV companies' claims that they are paying too high a special levy on its revenue and profits at a time of severe recession in the advertising industry, Raymond Snoddy writes. The 15 regional companies of the ITV system collectively paid a Pounds 113m levy last year on total profits before levy of Pounds 200m. The total profit after levy of Pounds 87m last year compares with Pounds 228m in 1989 and Pounds 205m in 1988. The figures do not include TV-am, the commercial breakfast station. Under the new levy scheme, which came in at the beginning of last year, the companies pay 10 per cent of their revenues after deducting their Channel 4 subscriptions and a Pounds 15m 'free slice' on which the levy is not paid. They also pay 25 per cent of profit after levy and an extra Pounds 2m free slice. Sir Brian Bailey, chairman of the ITV Association and of Television South West, has warned Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, that such a 'severe tax' on top of normal company taxation could be imposed on an ITV company operating at a loss. The special tax regime for commercial television has changed many times over the years from a revenue tax to a profits tax and back again to a predominantly revenue-based tax. The ITV companies argue that because of the advertising recession they experienced nil growth in 1990 over 1989 - a significant decline in real terms. The new levy changes were drawn up on the assumption of 6 per cent a year growth in income. The current estimate for ITV's net advertising revenue for 1991 is Pounds 1.614bn - the second year in a row of no real growth. When the government announced the levy changes in December 1988, the intention was to restore the yield to the Treasury to the pre-April 1986 basis. The ITV companies argue that because of the recession they have ended up paying significantly more than that. The present levy system runs until the end of 1992, when it will be replaced by the sums of money bid in next month's competitive tenders for new franchises. The bids, which will go straight to the government, could amount to anything from Pounds 250m to Pounds 400m a year, depending on the intensity of the competition.</p>

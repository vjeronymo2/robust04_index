He was born  in the Zhitomir region. He graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk  rail transport institute with a diploma in railway process  management. His career choice was not an accident, but followed  a family tradition.    After graduating from the institute, he was sent to  work as a dispatcher-on-duty at the Darnitsa station. The young  specialist's professional skills and initiative did not go  unnoticed. He rose to become a station chief, the head of the  Kiev branch of the South-Western Railroad, deputy railway  director and, when the State Rail Transport Administration was  established, he became its first vice-president.    There is probably no other sector which reflects the  economic crisis more quickly or fully than transport, especially  rail transport. It is a barometer which very precisely measures  the level of well-being and economic welfare in society.    Ukrainian Railway Director General Leonid Zheleznyak  took part in a press conference held by Ukraine Transport  Minister Orest Klymnush. He called the existing situation in  rail transport catastrophic.    A HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent asked Ukrainian Railways  Director General Leonid Zheleznyak to explain how and why a  sector once considered very stable found itself in a  catastrophic situation, and, most important, what we are to  expect in the near term as well as in a more distant future.    [Pysanska] Leonid Leonidovych, without idealizing the work  of  rail transport under socialism, it will probably be correct to  say that initially there were none of the current problems. What  is their cause?    [Zheleznyak] The transport system of the former Soviet Union  functioned well because the economy did. I do not want to call  it nostalgia, but as a specialist in railway management I never  had to worry where I would get hard currency to purchase  imported engines, spare parts and equipment, all of which was  distributed centrally.    It may have been a bad thing. But regardless of whether it  was good or bad, Ukraine received each year heat-powered and  electric engines, locomotives and railroad cars worth 75 million  hard currency rubles. My job was to distribute them properly in  order to prevent breakdowns in the transport system. Remember  the kind of trains that used to run to Moscow, Simferopol,  Odessa and Lvov?    Of course, none of it happened by itself: there were  difficulties and 17-hour work days, but all that work produced  tangible results.    Today we work no less, but we are facing a catastrophic  reduction in transport volumes. They have fallen by half from  last year because there has been a decline in industry.    Here are some examples. At the Lvov transit terminal, which  functions as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe, we  used to handle up to 1,000 cars of imported goods per day.  Today, there are barely 200 cars of such goods. We had to close  transit yards and cut experienced personnel.    Having left the Union and divided property--justly or  not--the state made a fatal error: it broke up economic links  which had been built over several decades. It was the beginning  of a breakdown of a well-functioning transport system.    [Pysanska] But everything that belonged to us--six railroads  and all the factories--remained our property.    [Zheleznyak] We quit the ruble zone without signing an  inter-state banking agreement. This is why we have been unable  to settle accounts with other countries. We have the factories,  but demand for their output has gone down; output levels are  declining by as much as 25 percent per year, and nobody buys  freight cars any more (with the exception of tanker cars).  Demand is falling even for the once-desirable output of the  giant heat-powered engine builder, the Lugansk plant, because  neither we nor other railroads have much to transport.  Production has effectively been suspended. Yet, 30,000 highly  skilled professionals used to work there.    This is why tens of thousands of freight cars run empty--and  not only here in Ukraine: there is nothing to transport in them.  The number of cars which need repairs is growing. But this is  only the beginning. The tragedy will come later, when industry  finally begins to recover while transport will continue to  decline, for this is a special feature of this sector. As a  result, output will not get where it is needed.    This is why we are currently trying to explain to the  government of Ukraine, and our colleagues in other CIS states  are trying to explain to their own governments, that if efforts  are not made to stabilize rail transports now, then later, to  remedy the situation, hundreds of billions of dollars will be  required.    [Pysanska] What funds are being invested in rail transport  today?    [Zheleznyak] You may not believe it: none. This has been the  case for the past three years. We have not been maintaining  equipment and this tactic is leading to disaster. We no longer  properly repair tracks while stock constantly moves over them.  One out of every six kilometers of track is in an unacceptable  condition. Last year alone, we repaired 700 kilometers of track  less than we had planned. Today, 35 million wooden ties should  be replaced, but even one tenth cannot be done, since there is a  shortage of timber. Nor can we purchase them, since ties cost  $17 each.    [Pysanska] But could this situation not have been foreseen?  As a specialist, we could have warned them, used arguments,  persuaded, etc.    [Zheleznyak] But did anybody ask, did anybody listen? In our  country, politicians manage the economy, and results turn out  accordingly. Ukrainian Railway and transport ministry managers  constantly inform the Cabinet of Ministers, the Supreme Council  and the president, explaining that this kind of management will  result in a breakdown of rail transport, which is already  starting to happen. Today, no one can say that specialists did  not report this fully. We are convinced that regardless of  political changes economic links must not be destroyed. We  carried out the decision by heads of states who had signed an  agreement to divide freight cars. Accordingly, we won our 18.4  percent share of the total, but as I have already said tens of  thousands of them stand idle.    [Pysanska] How will it turn out?    [Zheleznyak] If we continue to work with current prices and  tariffs, as well as under the existing system for setting them,  which we have not yet been able to master, we are headed for an  economic famine and will not be able to provide for our needs  for oil products and electric power. The economy will  effectively come to a halt.    Even though we do not support the policy of constant tariff  increases, the other path, that of direct subsidies from the  budget, has already been tried. We have proposed many times to  set a profitability level for rail transport, which is how it is  done elsewhere in the civilized world. This is where we see a  solution. Because raising prices for freight transport quickly  translates into higher costs of goods. Today, railways are  losing K30 billion a day from their commercial activities.    [Pysanska] One often hears proposals to charge near-abroad  countries when they transport their freight on Ukrainian  railways.    [Zheleznyak] This is amateurish talk. No one and nowhere  ever  transports freight free of charge. We charge them in accordance  with international rules and agreements.    [Pysanska] What is your opinion about customs controls on  long-distance trains?    [Zheleznyak] I have no opinion about this shameful practice.  Not even taking into account the humiliations which poor  passengers are subjected to, it has also caused a worsening of  service. It used to take 11 hours 50 minutes to get to Moscow,  but now it takes 15 hours 30 minutes. What gauge to use to  measure lost time, and who is to compensate passengers for it?    If our state has set up borders, let them be. But let us  look  at the civilized world. When traveling from one European country  to another by train, the passenger gives his passport to the  conductor at the start of the trip and gets it back at the end.  Nobody unceremoniously breaks into his compartment in the middle  of the night armed with a submachine gun, wakes up his kids and  shakes out bags to make sure that an enemy would not get through.    There, among capitalists, if you buy something and want to  transport it out of the country, at the border you can be  reimbursed 12 percent of the purchase price for shipping it at  your own expense, and they will thank you for it. We, on the  other hand, are afraid that something would be exported. The  government is trying to compensate for its inability to develop  a pricing policy and manage the economy by humiliating  passengers.    Every once in a while I get an order from a presidential  representative demanding to stop a train for three hours to  allow for a thorough search of passengers. As a character in a  popular film says, I am embarrassed for the state and ashamed  for the nation.    [Pysanska] What would you propose to do?    [Zheleznyak] Are you talking about the sector? It cannot be  analyzed apart from the economy. We have submitted to the state  a program to prevent a catastrophe that is awaiting us. We have  a program, but no money.    What am I doing to change the situation? Everything in my  power. I raise issues and do not fear to talk about unpleasant  or unacceptable things. I am not even afraid to work in a sector  which is moving full-speed toward an abyss--because I doubt that  anyone could do more.    [Pysanska] You and other people who have worked--and worked  well--on the railroad all your lives; are you not ashamed to  feel helpless?    [Zheleznyak] I am ashamed that having destroyed a finely  tuned transport system, one that used to function reliably, we  not only did not create a better one but created nothing at all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (CNS) -- China's Minister of  Public Security, Mr. Tao Siju, speaking at a meeting recently,  said that problems regarding unfairness in enforcing the law,  bending the law for the benefit of relatives or friends and  imposing fines instead of instituting criminal proceedings had  been rectified to some extent since the anti-corruption campaign  got underway last year. The unhealthy trend of participating in  smuggling by public security departments in coastal regions had  also been effectively stopped.    However, such achievements should not be over-estimated, Mr.  Tao said, and special attention should be paid to problems  facing public security departments. He called for public  security departments at various levels to take serious action  with crimes committed by leaders and members of the police,  particularly cases involving bending the law for relatives or  friends, bribery and corruption and torture as well as seeking  private benefits through the office they hold.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Arts: Enlightened, not shackled - Concert Any London concert involving Frans Bruggen is an event, whether he brings his own Orchestra of the 18th Century or conducts the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment. On Tuesday he opened the OAE's new season with an all-Bach programme of marvellous rich invention and elegance. If there were any agnostics who still required evidence that period-instrument playing need impose no interpretative shackles these flexible, warmly expressive performances must have furnished it. The substance of the evening was two of the orchestral Suites, the First and Fourth. Neither was conceived in grand, sonorous terms but as sequences of lithe, sharply characterised movements full of neat wind figuration (from the oboes in particular) and carefully marshalled, airy strings. Bruggen keeps his players on a loose rein, confident enough in their good sense to leave much of the orchestra to make its own way while he concentrates on shaping a musical strand or watching over its progress. His buoyancy and freshness are infectious; even Bach suites, familiar enough now in their authentic garb, emerge newly illuminated. A conductor was not required for the E major Violin Concerto; the soloist Elizabeth Wallfisch directed it herself. Her playing was neat and carefully detailed, but the effect was just a little too monochrome, especially alongside the other glowingly coloured performances. Bruggen himself also explored three movements from Bach cantatas, each with another existence in an instrumental work. The Sinfonia from Geist und Seele wird verwirret seems to have begun life as part of an organ concerto, that for Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir is a parody of the prelude from the E major violin sonata; both have virtuoso organ obbligatos, expertly dispatched here by John Toll. The sonatina from Gottes zeit, ist die allerbeste Zeit proved to be a strange little funeral study, with pairs of keening recorders and viole de gamba; it made a sharp contrast to the grander music all about it, a moment of intimacy in an evening of extrovert accomplishment.

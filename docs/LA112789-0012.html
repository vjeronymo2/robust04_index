			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SWITZERLAND;  </P> <P> VOTERS TURN DOWN ABOLITION OF ARMY  </P> <P> Swiss citizens voted to keep their army as the best way of maintaining their  nation's neutrality, even though the highly mobilized force has scarcely fired  a shot in anger during its four centuries of existence. A proposal to abolish  the army by the year 2000 was rejected by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. Although it  has only about 1,800 full-time military personnel, Switzerland can mobilize  625,000 trained soldiers in 48 hours -- more, it says, than West Germany. The  initiative drive had sparked a fierce debate on the usefulness of the army in a  small, neutral country.  </P></p>

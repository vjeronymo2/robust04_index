			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Those who fancy Joanna Lumley in school uniform (calm down and form an orderly queue between London and Edinburgh) will need to watch Absolutely Fabulous, Jennifer Saunders' comedy series set in the fashion business. So far it has been very funny (9.00 BBC2). That is followed by a Horizon special which will presumably get the biggest audience ever for this science series: 'The Truth About Sex'. Cameras followed researchers as they interviewed some of the 20,000 subjects of the National Sex Survey. Commissioned by the government, then dropped, this has been financed by the Wellcome Trust. Spurred by what was expected to be a forest-fire epidemic of AIDS, the survey set out to establish what proportion of the British population is homosexual or bisexual, and how promiscuous people are, especially those in the high-risk categories for Aids, homosexuals and drug addicts. In the AIDS Update 92 on ITV (10.40) dealing with AIDS in Africa it will be interesting to see whether the broadcasters have the courage to investigate the social and sexual reasons for the difference in the incidence of AIDS between countries.</p>

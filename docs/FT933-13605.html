			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices PENT-UP resentment from British workers over the imposition of Japanese-style working practices could have a 'devastating effect' on industry as the recovery continues, according to a report commissioned by the government and due to be published tomorrow. The review of the influence of Japanese companies on UK labour practices finds 'little evidence that Japanese-style international competitiveness can be achieved in Britain by copying some, or even most, Japanese working methods'. It also raises questions about the effect of having to 'work as hard as humanly possible' on the quality of employees' lives. The study, conducted for the Department of Employment by Industrial Relations Services, an independent pay and conditions research group, says British manufacturers are using the threat of Japanese competition to push through reforms in working practices. The report's author, Ms Sue Milsome, says this tack has proved more persuasive than the more accurate 'but less compelling' argument that 'competitive pressures demand changes in working and management practices'. Labour law reforms and the recession have probably had more influence on working methods in Britain than the example of companies like Nissan, she says. The report warns that the introduction of some working methods favoured by Japanese companies could increase British industry's vulnerability. For example, 'just-in-time' production means companies do not keep buffer stocks. A sudden stoppage by workers could mean immediate lay-offs in other plants, as happened during the 1988 Ford strike, the report also says. It warns: 'At some point . . . the British economy will recover. If there is a great deal of pent-up resentment against Japanese-style working practices, and the fragility of production systems has been increased . . . worker dissatisfaction leading to industrial action could have a devastating effect.' The study also points to the current debate in Japan over karoshi - death through overwork. Karoshi, it says, is mainly as a result of the large amounts of unpaid overtime performed by Japanese workers. It concludes that the Japanese economic miracle, which has so impressed western observers, is probably coming to an end. 'It may be that Japan's employment practices, in particular, will be jettisoned as Japan becomes a mature economy, so British employers should be wary of imitating practices that are only appropriate in a climate of ever-increasing growth.'

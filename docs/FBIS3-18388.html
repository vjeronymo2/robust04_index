Orta report: "People's Party Wishes To Standardize </F> Powers in All Autonomous Communities"]    [Text] Barcelona -- The People's Party is proposing a  standardization of the powers of all the autonomous communities  which will respect singularities in the cultural or linguistic  fields through a program to be implemented within the maximum  period of two legislative terms, with the aim of completing the  state of the autonomous communities, according to what People's  Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar explained yesterday when  presenting in Barcelona a document entitled "Basic Principles  for a National Agreement To Complete the Implementation of  Autonomy."    In this document, the People's Party proposes to the  government and all the political and social forces that they  make their contributions in order to "give final shape" to Title  VIII of the Constitution and prevent "going so far as to change  the state's structure under the euphemism of new interpretations  of the statutes."    Aznar emphatically denied that the document could be a  reformulation of the LOAPA [Organic Law on the Harmonization of  the Autonomy Process]. He explained that a major agreement is  necessary "in order to give final shape to the state of the  autonomous communities," and emphasized that this can only be  done with everybody's contributions, in order to shape a stable  system, irrespective of who holds power. "I am trying to make  the most rigorous effort possible. If there is anything that  this document does not resemble at all, it is the LOAPA. The  comparison is risible." Next, he stated that the document  speaks of single administration, state transfers, and fiscal  joint responsibility. "Which of these things is in the LOAPA,  which was a law of downward harmonization?"    With constant references to the framework of the  Constitution, Aznar warned that, in his opinion, "no government  holds sufficient legitimacy to transfer powers without taking  the constitutional pact into account," and added -- with respect  to possible agreements between the Spanish Socialist Workers  Party and Convergence and Union -- that "mere application of the  parliamentary majority to transfer state powers to the  autonomous communities respects the formal requirements of  democracy but makes any decision of this kind reversible, and  could call the constitutional pact into question."    On these premises, Aznar explained that outside the  "framework laid down by the national agreement there can be no  bilateral relations which, directly or indirectly, could go so  far as to change the configuration of the state of the  autonomous communities by transferring state powers," and the  document even says that yielding to the constant autonomy  demands could cause a "process of comparative grievances," which  would lead to the "weakening of the state's power," entailing a  "a crisis difficult to resolve in the constitutional model of  the state of the autonomous communities." The document contains  nine points:    1. To define the powers of the state which are  nontransferable and cannot be delegated because they pertain to  the principle of national sovereignty.    2. To determine the powers which, since they can be  autonomous or state powers, are capable of transfer or  delegation.    3. Applying the single administration principle, to reduce  the state's peripheral administration and organize inspection  services in the matters which are thus laid down in the  Constitution.    4. To define the functions and services which, while still  coming under the state, correspond to transferred powers.    5. To lay down a program with a maximum period of two  legislative terms to carry out a process of basic  standardization of powers among all the communities, excepting  the singularities resulting from distinctive features.    6. To shape a funding model based on the principle of fiscal  joint responsibility.    7. To establish a program of transfers to local authorities.    8. To set up a permanent body for the autonomous  communities'  participation in defining the government's stance in the  European Union on matters for which they are responsible.    9. Constitutional reform to establish the Senate as a house  of territorial representation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- A high-ranking U.S.  Official will hold talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi  Fukuda on Friday [10 June] to discuss political and security  matters, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff,  who arrived in Japan on Thursday, will discuss a wide range of  diplomatic issues with Fukuda, the officials said.    Tarnoff's visit comes at a time when discussions are  intensifying over ways to deal with North Korea's alleged  development of nuclear weapons.    But the officials said the nuclear problem is not the only  topic scheduled for discussion at the talks since the meeting is  part of regular high-level bilateral consultations on political  and security matters.    Tarnoff is expected to visit Seoul after the Tokyo trip.    Japan, the United States and South Korea agreed last weekend  that the U.N. Security Council should "urgently" consider action  against North Korea for its refusal to cooperate with the  International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

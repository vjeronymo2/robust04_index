In reaction to reports  in the Algerian press that the weapons were possibly loaded in  Antwerp, sources at the port confirmed yesterday evening that  the 5,331-tonne El Djorf called at Antwerp on 14 January en  route from Hamburg and left on 20 January.    The Algerian press agency, APS, had reported -- citing  newspapers in Algiers -- that automatic guns, shotguns, and  ammunition were found on board and were were presumably destined  for extremist Muslims in the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front].  Several crew members were detained.    According to those arrested, the weapons were "accidentally"  loaded in Antwerp instead of Hamburg. According to the Algerian  Government, Germany has become the crossroads for arms smuggling  from Iranian and Pakistani organizations to Muslim extremists.  There are currently a number of FIS leaders in Germany,  including spokesman Rabah Kebir, as well as Okba, Salman, and  Ikbal Madan, the sons of jailed FIS leader Sheik Abassi Madani.</p>

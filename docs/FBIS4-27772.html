			<p>BFN     [Text] A top Foreign Ministry official disclosed on 2 June  that the government has decided that it will ask the UN Security  Council [UNSC] to issue a warning to the DPRK (North Korea).  The government decided that this is how it plans to deal with  the issue of suspected development of nuclear weapons by North  Korea in view of the Japan-U.S.-ROK meeting to be held in  Washington on 4 June to discuss the issue. The same official  indicated that the Washington meeting will be held so the three  nations can act in concert, with an eye on the UNSC meeting. He  also pointed out that two options were available -- a resolution  to impose sanctions or a resolution of warning against North  Korea. Considering that the PRC would have no choice but to  veto a resolution for imposing sanctions, the official indicated  the government plans to ask the UNSC to issue a warning against  North Korea.    So far, the UNSC has twice adopted a presidential statement  asking North Korea to follow IAEA regulations on inspection of  its nuclear facilities. Although a warning is different from  sanctions, it is expected that this will be a firmer action than  a presidential statement.</p>

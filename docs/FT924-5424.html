			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Minister hints at road tax increase ACTION TAKEN in next year's spring Budget to recoup the revenue lost through the abolition of the five per cent car tax which took effect on November 12 could result in the annual vehicle excise duty being increased from Pounds 110 to Pounds 141. This possibility was acknowledged by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, in the Commons last night when MPs approved the Car Tax (Abolition) Bill. He stressed that the full range of motoring taxation - leaded and unleaded petrol, and diesel fuel as well as the vehicle excise duty - would be considered by Mr Norman Lamont,the chancellor, before determing how to effect the recoupment. If the recoupment burden fell entirely on fuel, it could result in an increase of 2.2p per litre in the price of leaded petrol and 1.8p in the price of unleaded petrol and diesel fuel, he added, saying he could not anticipate the chancellor's decision. Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour Treasury spokesman, asked why the government was assessing the cost of abolishing the tax at Pounds 750m rather than the Pounds 628m figure that would be arrived at after accounting for the extra VAT proceeds the government would rake in from a forecast 70,000-vehicle increase in sales. 'Recouping the revenue in this way does not actually give any extra fiscal stimulus,' he said, adding that Labour nonetheless welcomed the abolition. 'It just shifts the burden of tax from the shoulders of those who can afford new cars to those who cannot.' Mr Smith said that a second Labour concern was that abolition of the tax would not provide 'the scale of stimulus that the motor industry needs.' Consumer confidence remained very shaky owing to the fear of unemployment and outstanding debt, he said. Even if the forecast 70,000 sales increase did indeed materialise, that would still leave sales 29 per cent lower than in 1989. For the Liberal Democrats, economic spokesman Mr Alan Beith urged the government to consider placing the recoupment burden on company cars.</p>

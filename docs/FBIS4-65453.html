			<p>BFN     [Text] The 17 November organization hit the IBM offices  eight minutes after midnight with two 2.6-inch-caliber antitank  rockets. The offices are on the corner of Filellinon and  Dhedhalos Streets near Sintagma Square in the capital's center.  The explosions caused only material damage. A homemade  launcher, consisting of a tripod and a metallic pipe, was found  in a building across from the offices. A few minutes before the  attack, an unidentified person telephoned SKY radio warning  about the strike and claiming responsibility in the name of 17  November.</p>

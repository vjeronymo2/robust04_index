			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb strongman  Radovan Karadzic, after sharp warnings from Paris, said Thursday  [12 May] he would find a way to free 11 French aid workers held  by his troops for the past month for alleged arms smuggling.  Karadzic was quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency as saying  he had decided to "find a legal way" that would allow the  release of the 11 French nationals employed by the Premiere  Urgence (First Aid) group who have been held since April 8 in  the outlying Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica.    (In London, European Union negotiator Lord Owen confirmed  the  aid workers would be freed "very soon." He told AFP he had  received this assurance overnight from a trusted intermediary  who was speaking on Karadzic's behalf. Owen said the Frenchmen  would be freed "without condition and without trial.")</p>

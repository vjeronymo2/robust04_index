			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Jardine surprises as profits improve 18% to Dollars 270m JARDINE Matheson, the diversified Hong Kong trading company controlled by the Keswick family, yesterday posted a higher-than-expected 18 per cent increase in net earnings for 1991. At the same time, the company said it expected to call a shareholders' meeting in April to seek approval to change its primary listing from Hong Kong to London. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange was due shortly to announce the rules under which companies could change their prime listing, company executives said. Jardine's profits rose to Dollars 270.8m from Dollars 229.8m in 1990 on turnover 20 per cent higher at Dollars 7,190.2m from Dollars 5,992.1m in the previous period. Directors recommended a final dividend of 13 cents a share. Taken with the interim of 3.4 cents it makes 16.4 cents - up 15 per cent on 1990's pay-out. Earnings per share on a fully-diluted basis rose 14 per cent. Mr Henry Keswick, the company's chairman, said that in 1991 Jardine achieved record earnings, excellent cash-flow and a strong balance sheet. The group's main markets - the Asia-Pacific region - had shown good growth. He said that although it was too early to make an earnings forecast for this year, trading in the early months of 1992 had been quite encouraging. At a news conference, the company's managing director, or taipan, Mr Nigel Rich, appeared to indicate 1992 would be a year of consolidation on the takeover front. It had no plans to make a significant acquisition, although he did not rule out subsidiaries responding to opportunities when they arose. Mr Rich did, however, confirm Jardine's interest in building and operating Terminal 9 - a container terminal planned by the Hong Kong government for operation later this decade. He said the company was keen to form a consortium to bid for the terminal. Many of Jardine Matheson's interests are separately listed and have already reported their results. The interest in yesterday's statement was the performance of Jardine Pacific, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, which collects together Jardine's traditional trading business and many of its new ones. Mr Keswick said it achieved another year of excellent growth, with net earnings up 31 per cent to Dollars 122.1m from Dollars 93m. Its share of Jardine Matheson's total profits rose to 45 per cent from 40 per cent. He said Jardine Pacific's security, restaurants and aviation and shipping divisions did particularly well. In its engineering and construction division, Gammon had a good year and prospects were enhanced by the government's decision to go ahead with building a new airport in the colony. The company had extraordinary gains of Dollars 90.5m on the float of 32.3 per cent of Jardine Insurance Brokers on the London stock market and an extraordinary gain of Dollars 37.7m on the sale of investment properties by its indirectly-held subsidiary, Hongkong Land.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / US economy shows 2% growth in first quarter: Rise in consumer confidence boosts recovery hopes REPORTS THAT the US economy grew at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, the fastest pace since the election of President George Bush early in 1989, boosted hopes yesterday that the country was firmly on a path to recovery. Spirits were also lifted by a sharp 8 point rise to 64.8 in a closely followed index of consumer confidence. Optimism, however, was tempered by news of a 15 per cent drop in new home sales last month, the sharpest monthly fall for a decade. Economists also cautioned that the sectors leading recovery  - personal consumption and residential investment  - were likely to lose momentum. Mr Bush, speaking before his convincing victory in yesterday's Pennsylvania Republican primary, hailed the figures as evidence of recovery. He acknowledged that some sectors were still hurting but added: 'I think most people would say 2 per cent growth is not recessionary.' Mr David Mullins, the Federal Reserve vice-chairman, said the economy was on course for growth of 3 per cent later this year. This compares with annual rates of growth of 5-6 per cent in the early stages of most previous US recoveries. Mr Michael Boskin, chief White House economist, welcomed the news but said: 'We won't be satisfied with growth rates until the economy achieves the momentum required to create a steady decline in unemployment.' Unemployment is 7.3 per cent, the highest level for six years. The figures for gross domestic product represented a rebound from last year's fourth quarter, when annual growth dropped to 0.4 per cent, prompting fears of a 'double dip' recession. The economy has now grown slowly for the last four successive quarters. Growth was fuelled mainly by sharp increases in personal consumption and residential investment, both of which showed signs of flagging towards the end of the first quarter. The main offsetting factor was a sharp fall in business inventories. Most analysts expect growth of 2-3 per cent at an annual rate in the present quarter, led by a rebound in production as inventories are rebuilt. Analysts noted, however, that the consumer confidence index would be expected to rise well above 100 in a healthy recovery. Sales of new single-family homes fell 14.8 per cent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 513,000. Figures for February were also revised down. The falls wiped out earlier gains, leaving sales only 3 per cent higher than in last March. Economists were surprised by the plunge in home sales but said it probably exaggerated the underlying deterioration in the housing market. Figures for housing starts and buyer interest were relatively encouraging. Bush and Clinton win in Pennsylvania, Page 4 New economic allies begin the long haul, Pag e4 Dow little changed, Page 45</p>

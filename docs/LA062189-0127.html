			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HELLER QUITS FED BOARD, BLAMES PAY  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Gov. H. Robert Heller announced today that he is  resigning, effective July 31, citing the decision by Congress earlier this year  to reject a pay increase for top federal officials.  </P> <P> Heller, a Ronald Reagan appointee from California who served on the Fed board  for three years, stressed that he is resigning for personal reasons and not  because of any policy differences with the six other members of the Federal  Reserve Board. "I certainly wouldn't go if pay wasn't an issue," he told  reporters. Heller's salary was $82,500 a year.  </P> <P> Heller -- formerly head of international research for the Bank of America --  will join VISA International, the credit card company, in San Francisco as an  executive vice president in charge of relations with 21,000 member banks and  public officials.  </P></p>

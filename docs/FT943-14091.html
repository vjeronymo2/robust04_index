			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / WTO decision delayed Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday decided to postpone a formal decision on the future headquarters site of the World Trade Organisation until next week. But trade diplomats say it is now almost certain that Geneva will win the day over Bonn, the only other contender. Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's Gatt ambassador, who is conducting the consultations on the issue, told a meeting of trade officials yesterday that four-fifths of delegations had expressed an official view. Other countries are being given until noon on Monday and delegates will meet again next Tuesday, when the final decision is expected. Diplomats reported Mr Szepesi as saying there was a 'clear tendency' towards one of the candidates. Though he did not say which, the assumption is that most countries are opting to stay in Geneva, where Gatt now has its headquarters. The Gatt secretariat is due to be transformed into the WTO on January 1 next year. A smiling Mr William Rossier, Swiss ambassador to Gatt, emerged from yesterday's meeting to say Geneva's chances were 'completely intact'. 'We're almost there,' said another senior ambassador who favours Geneva. Some uncertainty remains because neither the US nor Japan has yet pronounced. However, France has publicly come out in favour of Geneva, a francophone city, as have other French-speaking countries. Germany claims the support of about 20 countries but, with the exception of Belgium, these are mostly small developing nations. The contest between Geneva and Bonn has been keenly fought, with both cities offering multi-million-dollar packages of office accommodation and diplomatic perks to attract the future WTO. However, trade diplomats said yesterday that, following big improvements in the terms and conditions offered by the Swiss, there was nothing to be gained materially from moving to Bonn, and much to lose. Other trade officials expressed fears that many Gatt staff would refuse to move, disrupting the WTO's work.</p>

Air Mandalay will have its  headquarters in Mandalay, operating domestically to Yangon  [Rangoon], Pagan and Heho. International sectors Phuket and  Chiang Mai in Thailand are also being considered. Air Mandalay  will operate two Avions de Transport Regional (ATR) 72-210's.  The Franco-Italian twin turboprops capable of carrying up to 72  passengers is also in service with other airlines in Indochina.    The service will be well timed to coincide with the Myanmar  government's declared "Year of Tourism" in 1995.    Pilots and technical staff are expected to be expatriates,  however cabin crew will be recruited locally. The airline is a  subsidiary of Techmat Holdings Pte Ltd which was registered on  Nov 6, 1991.    The group has an authorised and paid-up capital of $30  million [Singapore currency] and $3.05 million respectively.  Turnover for the financial year ended December 1992 was  $614,133, while pre-tax profit was $1,730. The group's  shareholders and directors are Thai, French and Singapore  nationals.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Chen Jinhua, minister of the State </F> Planning Commission, at National Meeting on General Inspection  of Commodity Prices; date and place not given: "Continue To Do  a Good Job of the General Inspection of Commodity Prices"]    [Text] Progress and Main Achievements Made in the  Nationwide General Inspection of Commodity Prices    In early March this year, the State Council decided to  launch  a nationwide general inspection of commodity prices in the wake  of the in-depth development of the reform and the enforcement of  the macroeconomic regulation and control. This is an important  step which we have taken toward inhibiting inflation in  consideration of the general interests of reform, development,  and stability. By following the State Council's policy  decision, the general inspection of commodity prices has scored  initial results across the country over the past two months or  so. The following are some main achievements:    1. A deeper understanding has been gained of the  necessity to exercise regulation and control of prices under  market economy conditions. During the general inspection  of commodity prices, the State Planning Commission and the  Propaganda Department have organized a propaganda campaign  through the mass media with the main theme of deepening reform,  intensifying regulation and control, and advancing the wholesome  development of the market. We have widely publicized and  elaborated on several viewpoints through the news media. For  instance, the view that the decontrol of prices does not mean  the completion of reform, laissez-faire policies should not be  applied to the market prices, and the creation of the price  mechanism through the market requires the deepening of reform in  various aspects; and the view that the establishment of a sound  price regulation and control system is an important part of the  shaping of a socialist market economic structure. By  systematically publicizing and implementing all the price  regulation and control measures, the party and the government  have proved they are really concerned about the public's  livelihood and are striving hard to manage commodity prices in  accordance with the latest development of the socialist market  economy. Local leading comrades have realized that the price  regulation and control is one of the government's important  functions and producers and traders have realized that  independent pricing does not mean that the state's supervision  and control of prices are void.    2. The inspection of commodity prices has expedited  implementation of all the price regulation and control measures  formulated by the state. Some localities have already set  up their grain marketing risk funds and nonstaple foodstuff  price regulation funds. The marked price system has basically  become a common practice among state-owned and collective-run  retail shops and executive government organs which render  services for fees and substantial progress has been made in  introducing the marked price system among private enterprises  and individual retail stalls. The state has formulated and  promulgated the specific procedures for monitoring the prices of  daily necessities and services and local authorities have  expanded their price monitoring network to cover vegetables,  medicines, salable residential flats, hairdressing services,  bath house services, and so on, according to their local  circumstances. Shanghai Municipality has taken the lead in  formulating and promulgating the "Interim Regulations Against  Price Cheating and Staggering Profits" and the "Detailed  Procedures Governing Investigation and Handling of Cases of  Staggering Profits Related to the Entertainment Business,  Catering Industry, Clothing, and Mechanical and Electrical  Products," which have played a positive role in curbing the  practice of seeking staggering profits and in protecting the  consumers' interests. These have been appreciated and endorsed  by the public. Shenzhen City has lifted restrictions on the  wholesale dealings in vegetables and pork and exercised control  of the price margin in retail sales. This has not only ensured  reasonable profit margins for the traders but also protected the  producers' and consumers' interests.    3. A number of cases of violation of laws related to  commodity prices have been investigated and handled.  Incomplete statistics show that a total of over 190,000 cases  of violation of laws related to commodity prices were  investigated across the country from 10 March to 10 May. The  amount of ill-gotten gains involved in these cases totaled  nearly 400 million yuan. Over 100,000 of these cases have  already been handled and the amount of fines resulting therefrom  came to more than 88 million yuan. Of the cases involving  malpractices, more than 41,000 are related to basic daily  necessities, over 4,800 are related to the prices of monopolized  capital goods, more than 2,700 involved prices of agricultural  means of production, and more than 8,100 cases were related to  charges for public utilities and services. Through the  investigation and handling of cases of violation of price  control laws, the trend of arbitrary price increases and  unreasonable service charges is being checked.    4. The general inspection of commodity prices has  caused the producers and traders to intensify self-regulation of  prices. Through the investigation and handling of cases of  violation of the state's price-control laws, enterprises have  been guided to observe the principle of legal operation, fair  transaction, and equal competition, and producers and traders  have realized that legal pricing behavior is the principle that  must be observed by enterprises when they are marching toward  the market. At the same time, the enterprises have been helped  to establish and improve the price control system and heighten  their sense of self-restraint regarding pricing. Shandong  Province has extensively introduced a sound self-restraint  mechanism regarding pricing, the core of which is the  appointment of price monitors and the establishment of five  systems (specifically, the accounting system, the  decision-making hierarchy system, the marked price system, the  regular price inspection system, and the market survey system).    While fully appreciating the achievements made in the  general inspection of commodity prices during the previous  period, we must also be aware that we have not done an equally  good job everywhere else. In just a few localities, people have  not thoroughly realized the important significance of the  general inspection of commodity prices, so they have acted a  little slackly; on the other hand, since the legislation process  has lagged behind, management has been inefficient, policies  have not been clearly defined, and there has not been sufficient  manpower to carry out the inspection. These few localities have  been facing great difficulties and obstacles in the  investigation and handling of cases of violation of laws related  to price controls. All these issues deserve much attention and  should be resolved at the next stage through effective measures.  <H5>  Carry Out the General Inspection of Commodity Prices in </H5> Depth and In Line With the Principle of Realizing Reform,  Development, and Stability in a Balanced Way    Reform, opening up, and the economy have kept on developing  along a good track since the beginning of this year. All the  reformatory measures in the fields of finance and taxation,  banking, foreign exchange and foreign trade, and the investment  structure have been basically operating well since they were  introduced and some of the measures have scored better results  than expected. At a time when major reform projects have been  presented, economic operations on the whole are gradually  developing in a direction in favor of macroeconomic regulation  and control. In the first quarter, the GDP increased by 12.7  percent over the same period last year, while the gross  industrial output value in January to April increased by 18.4  percent. The financial situation has remained stable and  revenue has continued to increase. The net amount of money  withdrawn from circulation was 5.07 billion yuan in January to  April, an increase of 41.92 billion [amount as published] over  the amount of money withdrawn in the same period last year;  meanwhile, the financial revenue increased by 22 percent over  the same period last year. The foreign trade import-export  volume and the state's spot exchange balance continued to  increase. In January to April, the total import-export volume  increased by 21.2 percent over the same period last year and,  meanwhile, the state's spot exchange balance increased by $8.1  billion over the figure at the beginning of the year. The  margin of growth in fixed assets investments continued to narrow  since efforts were made to intensify the management of extending  loans for financing investments in fixed assets, to bring newly  started projects under strict control, and to launch a general  inspection of investments. In January to April, the value of  investments made by state-owned units increased by 38.4 percent  over the same period last year, with the growth margin  decreasing by 30.5 percentage points as compared with the same  period last year. The dramatically rising trend of the general  commodity price level has been slowing down in the wake of the  implementation of various macroeconomic regulation and control  measures and the start of the general inspection of commodity  prices. In April, the nationwide retail price index increased  by 19.5 percent over the same period last year, with the  inflation margin decreasing again by 0.7 percent as compared  with that for March. It is expected that the price raises will  continue to subside in May and June. However, we should also be  aware that the current balance between the aggregate supply and  demand is not very secure, some negative factors unfavorable to  agricultural production still exist, the threat of inflation is  still valid, the price raises are still quite high, and we are  still far from our set target in our efforts to bring inflation  rate under control. Therefore, we should never show any  slackness in our work.    To ensure that the set targets are reached in the general  inspection of commodity prices while maintaining a balance  between reform, development, and stability, in the next stage we  must continue to strive to really fulfill the five requirements  set out by the State Council: 1. To further implement the  price regulation and control measures put forward by the state,  speed up the pace in formulating specific measures to introduce  the marked price system and the price monitoring system, set up  the grain marketing risk fund and the nonstaple foodstuff price  regulation fund as soon as possible, and formulate price control  laws and regulations. 2. To curb arbitrary price raises and  unreasonable service charges for major categories of products  and services, stop the practice of raising prices under the  pretext of reform, and investigate and handle cases of violation  of price-control laws. 3. To continue to publicize typical  cases, positive and negative alike, thus giving fuller play to  the initiative of the masses and the role of public opinion in  monitoring prices. 4. To cause the producers and traders to  exercise self-restraint and self-supervision and to heighten  their sense of observance of laws and discipline as far as  commodity prices are concerned. 5. To make great efforts to  ease the price raises and to ensure that inflation continues to  slow down.    In light of the current economic situation, we must lay  stress on the following aspects in our efforts to fulfill the  abovementioned five requirements:    First, it is necessary to further advance various price  reform projects and implement all the regulation and control  measures.    In the process of the general inspection of commodity  prices, we must give a stronger push and guidance to all  localities on implementation of all the major measures adopted  by the State Council regarding price reform and macroeconomic  regulation and control. The establishment of the grain  marketing risk fund, the nonstaple foodstuff price regulation  fund, and the important commodity reserve system are important  measures taken by the state to lower commodity prices through  economic means. All localities must establish these systems  this year according to the requirements set by the State  Council. It is necessary to actively study ways to establish  the risk fund system regarding the supply of nonstaple  foodstuffs, to gradually improve the economic means for the  state to regulate and control commodity prices. The monitoring  of prices for basic daily necessities and of service charges is  a moderate administrative and guiding measure adopted to prevent  decontrol and drastic fluctuation of commodity prices, under the  precondition that the enterprise's decisionmaking powers  regarding price setting are respected. All localities must  formulate special implementation procedures in accordance with  their local circumstances. Within the range of commodities and  service items that are subject to price monitoring, those put  under state control must undergo rigid price adjustment; as for  those which are already free of state control, local authorities  must, according to the principles laid down by the State  Council, formulate specific implementation procedures governing  the price adjustment operation reporting and application system,  as well as the regulation of price differences and profit  margins. It is necessary to make every effort to stabilize the  prices of rice, food, and fuel.    Second, it is necessary to continue to investigate and  curb the practice of arbitrarily raising prices under the  pretext of reform.    To cope with new cases and new problems which have emerged  during implementation of the reform plans regarding finance,  taxation, foreign trade and foreign exchange, investments, and  prices, the State Council and departments concerned have already  formulated corresponding measures and methods which are now  being carried out, step by step. Through the general inspection  of commodity prices, we must oversee the producers and traders  conscientiously implementing these measures and methods and we  will lower prices which have been raised on their own without  approval. We must take it as an important task to ensure the  smooth implementation of all reform plans, work conscientiously,  resolutely stop the practice of marking up prices at every link  of the marketing chain, and strictly minimize any chain effects.  Cases of lawbreaking behavior, such as raising prices in  disregard of state regulations and seeking staggering profits,  must be promptly investigated and dealt with severely.    Third, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate a market  order which encourages open, fair, and just competition.    As a result of our efforts during the previous stage, the  price disorders have been rectified to a certain extent.  However, the phenomena of arbitrarily raising prices and  collecting unreasonable service charges are still pretty  serious. These are highlighted by the following cases: Some  marketing units sell nationwide standard-price commodities at  higher prices in disregard of state regulations; some  enterprises producing chemical fertilizers and steel products,  with their dominance over the market, sell their products at  high prices; a small number of industrial and commercial  enterprises have joined forces to monopolize the market; some  enterprises take advantage of reformatory measures to raise  prices; many medical services, education, postal and  telecommunication services, and rural power supply sector  grass-roots units arbitrarily charge their customers for  services; and it is a common phenomenon that some private  business owners and hawkers in the catering and garment  marketing sectors seek staggering profits by cheating their  customers. We should make unremitting efforts to stop these  practices, resolutely fight activities contravening  price-control laws, and develop a market environment which  promotes open, fair, and just competition. We must make further  efforts to set up the marked price system and expand it to cover  all commodities and services; see that private enterprises,  individual producers and traders, and stall owners and hawkers  in all market places practice the marked price system; increase  the degree of transparency of the pricing process; and we must  place pricing under the public's supervision.    We must keep integrating the general inspection of commodity  prices with investigations and study. We should further analyze  the causes contributing to price disorder in light of the  problems exposed in the general inspection of commodity prices,  draw lessons from our past experience, check out loopholes,  formulate in good time some measures to intensify price  regulation and control, and establish and improve the  regulations and systems concerned. With the aim of establishing  the socialist market economic structure, we must speed up  legislation regarding price controls; step up the formulation of  the "price law"; formulate antitrust, antistaggering-profit, and  anticheating laws and regulations; set standards to regulate  pricing behaviors; and draw up the "price monitoring and  inspection regulations." Those laws, ordinances, and  regulations which have been promulgated should be improved to  suit new circumstances. Some regulations and legal documents on  regulatory functions which urgently need to be revised should be  re-formulated. For instance, the "Interim Regulations Governing  Simple Trial Procedures for General Cases of Violation of  Price-Control Laws" and the "Regulations on Penalties on Cases  of Violation of Price-Control Laws Regarding Failure To Lodge  Application For and Report Price Adjustment." Those regulations  and legal documents on regulatory functions regarding price  control which no longer suit the actual circumstances should be  sorted out and rescinded. Prior to the promulgation of  nationwide applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations  regarding price control, local authorities may formulate some  local laws, ordinances, and regulations regarding price control,  on their own and in light of their local conditions. We will  work, step by step, to put the price regulation, control,  management, supervision, and inspection on a standardized and  legal basis, so that we can exercise price control according to  the law.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Samsung in China VCR move SAMSUNG Electronics of South Korea plans to establish a 50/50 joint venture factory in Tianjin, China to produce video cassette recorder (VCR) machines and components. Samsung's joint venture with Tianjin Telecommunications and Broadcasting is the single largest corporate investment by a South Korean company in China. The two companies will invest Dollars 60m in the joint venture, Tianjin Samsung Electronics, which is expected to produce 600,000 VCRs by 1997 with an annual turnover of Dollars 200m. The South Korean government recently decided to build an industrial park in Tianjin for small Korean companies involved in such labour-intensive industries as textiles and electronics. China is attractive as a source of cheap labour. The Samsung move is the first big investment to be concluded since China signed an investment guarantee agreement with South Korea in early May. South Korean investment in China has been insignificant until this year when it suddenly became the most popular area of foreign investment by Korean companies. Korean investment in China amounted to Dollars 84.9m during the first half of 1992, a fivefold increase against a year ago. Korean investment is likely to increase rapidly once the two countries establish diplomatic relations, possibly this year or next.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Japanese voters shun party The launch of the New Frontier party, Japan's new political opposition alliance, has made little impact on voters, according to a poll published yesterday. A telephone survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the economic newspaper, found that a mere 14.8 per cent supported the NFP. The survey of 1,500 people was carried out in the 24 hours after the NFP's launch on Saturday. One explanation for the NFP's low rating, offered by the newspaper, is that voters find little new in its leaders, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former Liberal Democratic party prime minister, and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, an influential political strategist. The pair made voters feel as if time had been reversed, a Nihon Keizai Shimbun editorial said. It argued that the nine political parties which merged to form the NFP did so primarily to improve their chances under a new electoral system to take effect on December 25, and lacked a clear message. The NFP's low popularity score may also equally reflect a general ebb in public interest in politics, after three confusing changes of government in the past 18 months.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Shop centres report last-minute boost one of Britain's biggest shoping centres - were expected yesterday to end the Christmas period only about 2 per cent below last year. A surge in the number of shoppers across the country provided an unexpected Christmas bonus for retailers. Bullring manager Mr Richard Cooke said that Christmas trading had got off to a disappointing start in November and early December. Many retailers said that more shoppers than normal had saved their buying until the final week. In most parts, shops and shopping centres said they expected results to be at worst similar to last year, and perhaps better. Mr Grenville Peacock, chief executive of the Bentalls chain of stores in south-east England, said large numbers of shoppers were out yesterday, although average transactions might turn out to be down between 10 per cent and 15 per cent compared with last year. Central London was busier than it had been all year, although a series of bomb scares closed Tube stations around Oxford Street. Mr Andrew Bauer, manager of Whiteleys shopping centre in Bayswater, west London, said there was 'a heck of a lot of last-minute buying going on. We opened early today and thank goodness we did. People were waiting to get in.' He said shoppers were targeting their spending very carefully, having spent weeks window-shopping. Mr Alan Witkin, chairman of the tenants' association at Brent Cross shopping centre in north London, said a 'Christmas finale' was under way, with car parks and shops full. In northern England, the news was even better. Mr Peter Hills, head of marketing at Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said there had been a big surge of business. Two days had been lost because of the IRA bombings in early December, 'but there has been a tremendous recovery, with several record days', he said. Mr Bill Russell, assistant manager of Liverpool's Clayton Square shopping centre, said trade was going well. 'Liverpool has had economic problems for many years, but Merseyside people really enjoy Christmas and always go out and spend on their children.' Across the Pennines, Mr Peter Coles-Johnson, chief executive of Leeds Chamber of Commerce, was more cautious. 'This year will be a record for local spending, but then inflation usually ensures that such records are broken year by year anyway,' he said. 'However, I think there will prove to have been a genuine increase.' Mr John Taylor, chief executive of Sheffield Chamber of Trade, said many people had waited until Monday before starting Christmas shopping in earnest. 'In the past, sales started picking up at least a week earlier. Since then, sales have been increasing steadily in the city centre.' A similar surge was reported in north-east England, although bomb scares also damped trade in Newcastle. At Eldon Square, Europe's largest city centre shopping centre, Mr Gordon Allanson, manager, said the surge meant turnover this year might be slightly ahead of last, rather than between 1 per cent and 2 per cent behind, as he had predicted only 10 days ago. At nearby Bainbridge, one of the largest department stores in the John Lewis Partnership, managing director Mr Brian Forbes Turner said this year's trend towards shoppers seeking value for money and selecting smaller purchases had continued, but in greater volume in recent days. Last week, the store finished 1 per cent down on the same week last year. Saturday sales were well up, however, and this week was proving strong. China, glassware, jewellery, leather goods, knitwear, lingerie and computer-related items were all doing well. At Gateshead's MetroCentre, Mr John Bryson, manager, said the late, strong turnout of shoppers meant turnover was likely to be up on last year. 'The British nation has gone on holiday, for a long holiday,' Mr Bryson said. 'They're spending to a surprising degree so close to Christmas. The way things have gone in the first 2 1/2 days before Christmas has cheered everybody up.' Edinburgh stores have had a mixed Christmas because of the EC summit on December 11 and 12, normally one of the busiest pre-Christmas shopping weekends. Mr Andrew Douglas Miller, general manager of Jenners, a privately-owned department store in Prince's Street, said the summit cost the store business it might never recoup. 'There was a massive police presence and people were advised not to bring their cars into town, so many didn't go Christmas shopping. Trade didn't pick up until about last Thursday. This week, however, is a lot better than the equivalent week of last year.' Clydesdale, Scotland's largest independent electrical retail chain, said it had had a good Christmas in an economy where the effects of recession have been less dire than in the south. 'We're doing remarkably well compared with last year,' Mr John Downie, managing director, said. House of Fraser, which operates eight stores in Scotland, said Christmas turnover was 21 per cent up on last year. 'Christmas has arrived north of the border. Our managers are wearing their broadest smiles in a long time.' Reporting by Neil Buckley, Ian Hamilton Fazey, Chris Tighe and James Buxton</p>

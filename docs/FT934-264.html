			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Vatican-Israel pact ready The Vatican and Israel are due to sign an agreement today normalising diplomatic relations and smoothing over a troubled past between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people. The agreement has been painstakingly negotiated by a bilateral commission established in July 1992 although the groundwork was laid in 1964 when Pope Paul VI visited Jerusalem. Both the Holy See and Israel stand to benefit from the agreement, finalised in Rome yesterday. It formalises the Catholic Church's right to operate in the Holy Land and lays the framework for property and fiscal rights in the state of Israel. Both sides also believe diplomatic relations will help in a small way towards the Middle East peace process. Until now the Vatican has been reluctant to formalise relations for fear of prejudicing its relations with Arab countries, as well as because of the complex question of property rights in the Holy Land and the issue of the status of Jerusalem. Yesterday, Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said in Rome he expected ambassadors could be exchanged within months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Libyan Government has called on Indonesia as  chairman of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] to play a more active  role in efforts to end the economic sanctions imposed by the UN  Security Council on Libya three years ago.    Ibrahim al-Yarabu, secretary general of the International  Islamic Missionary Movement, told newsmen in Jakarta today that  the NAM had responded to the matter by introducing a resolution  that calls for lifting the economic sanctions, but the  resolution had yet to be pursued. The NAM influence will be  felt further if the resolution is implemented.    The UN Security Council imposed the sanctions on Libya  following the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie,  Scotland in December 1988 that killed 270 people. Ibrahim  al-Yarabu's visit to Indonesia is the second for discussions on  the sanctions.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Pakistan seeks to assure investors PAKISTAN is expected this week to pledge to maintain its existing international financial commitments in spite of the political crisis caused by the dismissal of Mr Nawaz Sharif's government and the dissolution of the national assembly. Pakistani officials were expected to leave Islamabad last night for Paris where they are due to meet representatives of aid donors, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and developed country governments. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the former finance minister who was sacked with the rest of Mr Sharif's government on Sunday, was due to have led the Pakistani delegation. In his absence, a senior official will head the team. Mr Aziz told the Financial Times yesterday there would be no change in Pakistan's attitude to foreign donors or investors. 'There's a certain continuity in our policies,' said Mr Aziz. 'I'm sure the new (caretaker) government will carry on talking to donors and trying to attract foreign investors.' Mr Aziz was speaking after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved the national assembly and dismissed Mr Sharif's government, accusing Mr Sharif of damaging the country and its economy. He also accused Mr Sharif of corruption and nepotism. Mr Ishaq Khan was responding to a televised speech Mr Sharif made on Saturday in which he accused the president of conspiring to overthrow him. The exchanges followed an increasingly acrimonious struggle between the two men about the appointment of a new army chief, over Mr Sharif's attempts to secure the leadership of the Pakistan Moslem League, Pakistan's largest party, and over Mr Sharif's attempt to curb the president's powers. Party leaders yesterday started preparing campaigns for elections, which Mr Ishaq Khan said he would hold within three months. Mr Sharif, who hails from Punjab province, yesterday announced he would travel by train from Islamabad to Lahore, the Punjab capital, stopping along the way to campaign. The degree of support the dismissed prime minister can command in his home province is seen as crucial to his political future. The Moslem League has split between his supporters and backers of the president. Meanwhile, supporters of Ms Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition Pakistan People's party, said they were delighted at the opportunity to fight Mr Sharif at the polls. One of Ms Bhutto's aides declined to comment on the party's view of Mr Ishaq Khan - the president who dismissed Mr Sharif is the same man who sacked Ms Bhutto's government in 1990.

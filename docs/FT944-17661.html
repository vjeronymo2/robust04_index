			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Camdessus stands ground over SDR Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday expressed confidence that there would soon be agreement on the vexed issue of a distribution of special drawing rights - the Fund's reserve asset - to its members, writes Peter Norman, Economics Editor, in Madrid. But at a press conference marking the end of this year's IMF and World Bank annual meetings, Mr Camdessus appeared to cast doubt on a resolution of the issue by making clear he was sticking by his own proposal for the issue of SDR36bn (Pounds 33.55bn). This proposal, which was rejected by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries at a difficult meeting of the IMF's policy-making interim committee on Sunday, is at the higher end of suggestions for the allocation of the IMF's own reserve assets to boost world monetary reserves. Yesterday's press conference was striking for the passion that the SDR issue generated in Mr Camdessus. He misheard or misunderstood questions about the global economy and financial markets, giving answers that related to the SDR allocation instead. The managing director's continued zeal for the SDR contrasted with the approach of many industrial country governments in recent days. Following the interim committee, they made a determined effort to ring-fence the stand-off over the SDR allocation, in an attempt to convey the message that the world economy is now in a better state than in many years and has a good chance of achieving sustained non-inflationary growth. Mr Camdessus said there was 'a reasonable hope and probably a little bit more than that' for early agreement on a package comprising an SDR allocation and a strengthening of the systemic transformation facility (STF) which the IMF uses to support former communist countries developing market-based economies. 'I am confident that in the coming weeks we will have an agreement on this package,' he said. He said work had been progressing 'in the corridors' since Sunday's interim committee failed to agree the SDR allocation and SFT strengthening. He claimed the differences among the IMF members were 'not that big'. According to Mr Camdessus, all governments recognised that: There should be an SDR allocation. The STF, which is due to expire at the end of 1994, should be extended beyond the end of this year. A solution to the SDR problem must be found that conforms with the Fund's articles and that the SDR's role in the international monetary system must be preserved. He admitted there were differences about the size and structure of the allocation. But he believed it was possible the IMF's 179 members could reach agreement on the issue inside the Fund's executive board and before the next interim committee meeting in April. Mr Camdessus acknowledged that no one, including the IMF management, could be certain their proposals would be supported by all the membership. But he saw no reason to withdraw his own plan. He showed no sign of moving towards other proposals for a smaller SDR allocation, such as the SDR16bn one-off special allocation backed by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries or suggestions from other countries for issues of SDR22bn and SDR30bn. Indeed, Mr Camdessus insisted his SDR36bn plan was essential to restore the place of the SDR in global reserves to the average of the past 20 years. He insisted his plan would have no inflationary consequences for the world economy.</p>

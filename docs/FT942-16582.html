			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Leadership poll boosts Heseltine Mr Michael Heseltine's credentials for the Conservative leadership were bolstered yesterday when an opinion poll suggested that he was Mr John Major's nearest challenger to lead the party. One-third of Tory supporters think he should lead the party into the next general election. In findings that could further damage Mr Major's leadership prospects, the MORI poll put him just four points ahead of Mr Heseltine among Tory supporters - and well behind him when the views of all voters were taken into account. But as Mr Major prepared to celebrate the second anniversary of the Tories' general election victory, the poll dealt a blow to the leadership aspirations of other potential challengers. Yesterday's poll, published in London's Evening Standard newspaper, indicated that only 12 per cent of Tory supporters thought chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, until recently considered the frontrunner to succeed Mr Major, would best lead the party into the next general election. Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Michael Howard, regarded as leading challengers from the right, polled just 4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively - less than Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, who polled 7 per cent. Among the public at large, 32 per cent rated Mr Heseltine the best prospective leader, against just 19 per cent for Mr Major and 11 per cent for Mr Clarke. Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, marked the election anniversary by publishing a booklet purporting to setting out the government's achievements.</p>

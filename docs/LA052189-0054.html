			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRENATAL CARE HARD TO DELIVER IN 'FERTILE 5TH'  </P> <P> It was close to quitting time, but the waiting room at the Van Nuys public  health center was filled with pregnant women. Many, in their last stages of  pregnancy, had waited hours to see a doctor.  </P> <P> As Dr. Norman Kaplan, the county-run clinic's obstetrician-gynecologist, rushed  along the threadbare carpet from one examining room to another, he had one  thing to say: "We need more doctors!"  </P> <P> Kaplan and other clinic staff members are trying to cope with what Los Angeles  County health officials call the "Fertile 5th." The term was coined by 5th  District Supervisor Mike Antonovich to describe the unprecedented baby boom in  the area he represents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Patients Poor  </P> <P> Outpacing the rest of the county, the 5th District's nine public health clinics  in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys have been flooded with  pregnant women, most too poor to pay for private care. The situation has  prompted the clinics' medical staffs to worry that care will be jeopardized if  relief does not come soon.  </P> <P> The number of pregnant women coming to the centers -- many of which are cramped  and decrepit -- jumped 76% from January to April. But the need for prenatal  care has been snowballing for years in the north county district, in part  because of a huge influx of Latino immigrants, health officials said.  </P> <P> In the 1984-85 fiscal year, the clinics handled 17,590 prenatal visits. If  present trends continue to the end of this fiscal year, June 30, the clinics  will have treated 35,320 women -- a 101% jump over the patient load five years  ago.  </P> <P> "The entire north county is in a crisis in prenatal care," said Karen Menacker,  the public health nursing supervisor at the Van Nuys clinic.  </P> <P> That would come as no surprise to the hundreds of expectant mothers in the 5th  District who earlier this year waited an average of almost two months for their  first appointments. Average waits were even longer at facilities in Canoga  Park, Pacoima and Valencia -- ranging from 78 days to 107 days.  </P> <P> Pregnant women who never see a physician or who must wait until the last  trimester risk medical complications for themselves and their babies, said Dr.  Paul Toot, chief of obstetrics at the county's Olive View Medical Center in  Sylmar, where many of the clinic patients go to have their babies. Such infants  are more likely to be born underweight or to start their lives in  intensive-care units, he said.  </P> <P> At other public clinics elsewhere in the county, a pregnant woman who called in  February, for example, had to wait less than three weeks on the average before  her first visit, county officials said. In the San Gabriel Valley, the wait was  slightly more than a week and in the coastal communities, it was two weeks,  county officials said. In South-Central Los Angeles, the wait was four weeks --  about half of what it was in the north county.  </P> <P> The situation grew more dire for those on the prenatal front lines in the north  county when tentative budget cuts were announced by the county earlier this  month. The cuts will become effective later this year if the state does not  provide more money for local health care, county officials said.  </P> <P> Slated for extinction is the Burbank clinic, where the clientele are primarily  pregnant women and those seeking birth control. During an average month, 1,594  people use this center, and county physicians predict that other clinics in the  Valley will have to take many of its cases, should it close.  </P> <P> When it became obvious that the north county clinics were severely overbooked,  the county in February ordered emergency measures taken.  </P> <P> To free up staff for prenatal duty, clinic physicians and nurses began spending  less time treating those with other ailments such as diabetes, hypertension and  chronic backaches. Sessions for the detection and treatment of venereal disease  and tuberculosis were combined for the same reason. Meanwhile, extra nurses  hired to spend more time with pregnant women with gestational diabetes and  other complications instead have been helping with the overflow.  </P> <P> "It's like putting a finger in a dike, and it just isn't stopping it," lamented  Dr. Dorris Harris, medical director of the north county clinics. "Even though  we are seeing more patients, more patients are showing up."  </P> <P> The clinic medical staffs are dreading August and September, when the clinics  will be bombarded by children who need immunizations to enter school. At some  facilities, nurses typically set up card tables on lawns to handle the rush. No  one is sure how the needs of expectant mothers and those of the schoolchildren  will be juggled.  </P> <P> Larry Roberts, the county's deputy director for health center operations, is  hoping that extra money comes from the state to prevent the closing of the  Burbank clinic and to provide relief to deluged facilities. But he is not sure  whether the health department will receive any of the additional $2.5 billion  the state discovered last week. He expressed frustration at his limited  options.  </P> <P> "We cannot stop the women from getting pregnant," Roberts said. "What do we do?  We don't have any more money."  </P> <P> The reasons for the baby boom are easier to grasp than solutions to the  clinics' prenatal crunch.  </P> <P> With fewer obstetricians welcoming Medi-Cal patients, the public clinics have  become a last resort to more people, clinic officials said. Meanwhile, the  population of the county's northern tier continues to grow and many of the  newcomers are from Latin America, county officials said. Some of these  immigrants are seeing a physician for the first time and many do not practice  birth control for religious reasons, officials said.  </P> <P> But even the middle-class bedroom communities in the Santa Clarita Valley are  contributing to the prenatal push. The Valencia staff members were surprised  when they began seeing suburban housewives in examining rooms. Some were  between insurance policies when they conceived or did not have the money for  insurance after paying their mortgages or other bills, clinic officials said.  </P> <P> Phyllis Rothwell, holding her stomach as the fetus fidgeted inside, said she  lost her insurance coverage last year when she quit her job as a nurse to study  for her real estate license. By the time she and her husband, a masonry  contractor, looked for a new policy, she said, she was pregnant and no  insurance company would accept her.  </P> <P> Rothwell had been receiving her prenatal care at Holy Cross Hospital's  maternity clinic. But the hospital wanted $1,600 for the delivery in advance,  which was not available after the couple were hit with a tax bill for thousands  of dollars, she said.  </P> <P> "We have good credit. We have good credit cards. No one would let us make  payments, I couldn't believe it," complained Rothwell, who said she is happy  with the care she is receiving at the Valencia clinic.  </P> <P> Anyone qualifies for the clinics' services. The medical care is cheap compared  to that of private physicians. The first seven prenatal visits are $25 apiece  and subsequent visits are free.  </P> <P> At the Van Nuys clinic, Kaplan, the obstetrician-gynecologist, said he has been  forced to shorten the amount of time he spends with patients.  </P> <P> "I don't know how much good you're doing, going through the motions," he added.  "Maybe the county feels going through the motions is better than receiving no  health care at all."  </P> <P> But Kaplan's patients do not seem to notice being whisked through their  appointments. And though they might have to wait hours to be seen once they  arrive at the center, they are mostly appreciative.  </P> <P> "They treat me well. It's a good service," said patient Matilda Reyes, 34,  through an interpreter at the Van Nuys clinic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE DEMAND FOR PRENATAL CARE  </P> <P> Prenatal visits in North County public health clinics  </P> <P> VISITS  </P> <P> 1984-85: 17,590  </P> <P> 1985-86: 23,197  </P> <P> 1986-87: 25,860  </P> <P> 1987-88: 29,874  </P> <P> 1988-89*: 35,320  </P> <P> * Projected.

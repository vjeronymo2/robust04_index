			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Threequarters of sunken oil tanker's cargo still on board MORE THAN 700,000 barrels of oil are estimated to be still on board the Haven, the Cypriot-registered supertanker which has sunk off Italy's north-west coast, threatening an environmental disaster in some of the most scenic parts of the Mediterranean. Admiral Antonio Alati, the harbourmaster at Genoa, said yesterday that some 724,000 barrels of the original 1m barrels remained on board. The 232,163 deadweight tonnes tanker - a sister vessel of the Amoco Cadiz which caused a pollution disaster off France in 1978 - sank on Sunday after exploding and catching fire. Italian pollution experts say removing the crude oil may prove more difficult and costly than cleaning up the oil already spilled. If the vessel's valves are intact, the crude oil could be pumped out through a hose. Otherwise, it would be necessary to make a hole in the side of the tanker and suck it out. The whole operation could cost as much as Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) if recovering the oil takes as long as it did when a tanker, the Tanio, sank off the coast of Brittany in 1980. Oil pollution experts say that estimates are premature. The Italian government will be able to draw on funds for the clean-up from an international compensation fund set up by the International Maritime Organisation. A formula based on the size of the ship makes the tanker owner, which is registered as Venha Maritime in Cyprus, liable for the first Dollars 18m of the clean-up cost. After that, the international fund will provide supplementary payment up to Dollars 81.5m. Good weather yesterday helped efforts to deal with the existing six-mile oil slick by surface skimming. Light winds were blowing the slick towards the French coast, causing concern in Monaco and on the French riviera that the oil might wash ashore. Oil has reached Italian beaches. Off Livorno, attempts continued to put out fires on board the Agip Abruzzo, the tanker which was rammed by the ferry Moby Prince on Wednesday night. Local firefighters said the tanker could burn for days without igniting its remaining cargo of crude, amid signs that the fire was diminishing.</p>

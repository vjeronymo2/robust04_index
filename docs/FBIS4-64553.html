			<p>BFN     [Text] Korsoer, Denmark, May 3 (AFP) -- Nordic defence  ministers called Tuesday [3 May] for the United Nations to take  a tougher line over its peacekeeping operations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Concluding a two-day meeting in Korsoer, near Copenhagen, to  assess the situation of Nordic peacekeepers in the war-ravaged  republic, the ministers said it was "important to reinforce the  decision-making process" to give the UN a credible role and  protect its troops in crisis and war zones.    While the UN possessed an effective network of civilian  mechanisms, there were chinks in its military armour which had  to be eliminated, Norwegian Defence Minister Joergen Kosmo  asserted.    He said he and his colleagues were "satisfied" with  assurances given them Monday by the commander of UN forces in  Bosnia, Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, who promised the  Nordic troops would receive the air protection they required.    "New procedures" which the UN forces had set in motion would  accelerate the provision of air cover, Rose told the ministers  after he was invited to address them on the UN mission in the  former Yugoslav republic.    But the Nordic ministers said in response to Rose's call for  more troops for the international peacekeeping effort that their  nations were not in a position to add to the contingent the  Scandinavians already have on the ground.    Danish Defence Minister Hans Haekkerup said the Nordic  nations have proportionately more troops in the UN force than  any other country, while Swedish counterpart Anders Bjork called  on the United States in particular to contribute to the peace  mission.</p>

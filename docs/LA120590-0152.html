			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> PASSIVE SMOKING PERILS STRESSED  </P> <P> A study found that 91% of nonsmokers were regularly exposed to high levels of  cigarette smoke, suggesting that the Environmental Protection Agency has  underestimated the risk of passive smoking, a researcher says.  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Cummings of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.,  also said childhood exposure to parents' cigarette smoke could be a greater  risk than an adult nonsmoker's exposure to a spouse's or colleague's smoke.  </P> <P> If that is correct, lung cancer could be about to increase among nonsmokers of  the "baby boom" generation, a result of their parents' widespread adoption of  smoking after World War II, Cummings said.  </P> <P> He presented his findings Tuesday at a meeting of an EPA panel considering the  merits of the agency's draft passive smoking study, which concludes that  cigarette smoke is a known cause of cancer in nonsmokers.  </P></p>

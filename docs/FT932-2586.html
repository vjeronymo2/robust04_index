			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Paris tries to avert split on telecoms FRANCE is pressing Bonn to reconsider its apparent decision to opt out of EC telecommunications sanctions against the US, before next week's EC summit at Copenhagen. The Community and the US are at odds over a provision in the EC's public procurement directive giving European companies a 3 per cent price advantage when bidding for government contracts. In protest at the price preference in the telecommunications field, Washington has denied EC companies the right to compete for a certain amount of its contracts. As a result, Community ministers agreed earlier this month to deny US companies a similar amount of business. However, Germany insists that its 1954 accord with the US takes precedence over EC solidarity on this issue. This view was repeated yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, in a letter to Sir Leon Brittan, the European commissioner responsible for external trade. He said the EC decision on sanctions contained a specific reserve clause protecting such prior obligations. He repeated his determination neither to discriminate against US enterprises in public procurement contracts, nor to impose counter-sanctions. Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EC affairs minister, yesterday described the German attitude as 'serious'. Germany had agreed to the procurement directive and anti-US sanctions, he complained, and 'there can be no European identity unless decisions taken together are applied together'. 'Either a member state (Germany) has not respected its commitment,' Mr Lamassoure said, 'or the state of EC law is such that it allows a member state to wriggle out of a unanimous decision - in either case, it is not good.' Paris is pressing Bonn directly, as well as through Brussels, in the hope of defusing the issue. Mr Lamassoure pinned hopes on the fact that Chancellor Helmut Kohl has not yet publicly backed his economics minister on the matter, and may not be pushed to do so before the Copenhagen summit where the German leader is certain to be lobbied by President Francois Mitterrand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has  commented skeptically on the idea that the Ames affair might be  a response to the political activity displayed by Russia in  resolving the Bosnian crisis. Foreign Ministry spokesman  Grigoriy Karasin said today that it was important to avoid  emotional and overdramatized attitudes and that it was necessary  to analyze the situation before drawing any conclusions.    At the same time experts continue commenting on the  situation  from very different angles. Here is a report by Andrey  Pishchayev.    [Pishchayev] Recently, a similar incident occurred between  the United States and Israel but the scandal promptly died down.  On this occasion, however, the American side is talking about a  great detriment to its national interests and has nearly started  wondering whether it ought to continue its friendship with  Russia. [passage omitted]    Many questions arise in connection with this scandal. CIA  staff had been closely watching the Moscow agent for two years,  so why did they choose to arrest him at this particular point?  President Clinton knew about the forthcoming arrest when he was  leaving for the Moscow summit with Boris Yeltsin.    [Begin V. Kremenyuk, deputy director of the Institute for  U.S. and Canadian studies, recording] The fact that this  incident emerged just now confirms that Clinton was not quite  satisfied with the results of that summit, and that he was  particularly displeased with the outcome of the recent crisis in  Bosnia. [end recording]    According to Kremenyuk, the reasoning behind President  Clinton's sanction of the spy's arrest went like this:    [Begin Kremenyuk recording] Let us make it clear that they  [Russians] are no peacemakers but merely the same dirty spies  that they always used to be. Let us create a small crisis that  would enable us to put some pressure on Yeltsin. [end recording]    In the opinion of Russian diplomats, it would be too petty a  revenge on Russia. Anyway, we can only guess why the Ames  affair has emerged so unexpectedly.</p>

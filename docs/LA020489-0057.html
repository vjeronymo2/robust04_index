			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK: LIRIOPE MUSCARI;  </P> <P> LILY TURF EVERGREEN PERENNIAL WITH VIOLET FLOWERS  </P> <P> It's easy to overlook Liriope muscari, to dismiss it as not quite colorful or  dramatic enough. But one of the most effective shade landscapes I've ever seen  was a simple stone path around the north side of a house, the path bordered  with more than a dozen liriopes in full purple bloom. They were gorgeous --  exotic and practical.  </P> <P> Liriope is a shade-loving, blooming alternative to the ubiquitous impatiens.  Unlike impatiens, however, liriope also does well in the sun (except in the  hotter desert areas). There are several varieties with variations in flower and  leaf color, but all range from about 12 inches to 18 inches in height and all  have shiny black berries after flowering. Those with variegated leaves --  Silvery Sunproof, Variegata and Gold Banded -- bring a sense of shimmery light  to shaded areas.  </P> <P> Planted in sun, liriope probably will need at least average water, but in the  shade it can get by with less. The flowers, resembling grape hyacinths, look  good in a mixed bed or lined up as an edging. They require average soil and  little care; just cut them back in winter or spring if they look shabby.  </P> <P> In addition to the variegated-leaf varieties, look for Majestic, with an  abundance of dark violet flowers borne above green leaves, and Big Blue, with  deep-green leaves and lavender flowers. If you have difficulty finding these  locally, most of them can be found in the Wayside Gardens (Hodges, S.C.) and  Burpee Ornamental Gardens (Warminster, Pa.) catalogues. Also, for the patient  adventurer, Park Seed Co. (Greenwood, S.C.) carries Liriope muscari Exiliflora  seeds. JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Jane Eyre' as Bronte puppet - Theatre Among the many great novels of the 19th century, Jane Eyre is one of the few that stands out like a myth. The austere, unpretty, uncompromising governess Jane Eyre and her haunted employer Rochester with his hidden past: these two are archetypes for all time. As I watched Fay Weldon's stage adaptation, currently at the Playhouse, I realised how much Charlotte Bronte's novel had influenced others - Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, of course; and, more subtly, Henry James's Turn of the Screw. Come to think of it, Jane Eyre is even a forereunner of the Diana-and-Charles story: innocent teenage girl involved in educating the young is irresistibly drawn to moody mysterious hero with guilty secret; on the brink of marrying him, she stumbles on the secret other woman in his life . . . As long as it focuses on the changing relationship of Jane and Rochester this adaptation has plenty going for it. Neither Alexandra Mathie (Jane) nor Tim Pigott-Smith (Rochester) is ideal - she is too self-consciously pious, with a bad attack of nobility about the nostrils; he too much the angry lout  -but the story of their surprising attraction is alive. And Fay Weldon's script is at its most sensitive, intelligent and faithful while it keeps them in its sights. Elsewhere, however, this is a dire and coarse evening. Weldon has had the idea of telling Jane's early life, not directly as in the novel, but obliquely: (a) Jane narrates it to her pupil, Adele (b) Adele helps to act it out, holding up a 'Jane Eyre' doll and ventriloquising her lines. The core of the novel lies in the unrepentant first-person account of Jane's anger as a child; Weldon has boiled this away. Later, she reduces the St John Rivers episode to its most melodramatic and sexist ingredients. This novel deals with the fine and brave feelings that make its heroine unusual - a kind of rebel; but Weldon has so cheapened everything that we are surprised that Jane is as polite as she is. More silly yet, Weldon keeps bringing on the Brontes themselves to comment on the story to one another. OK, yes, we do think of all the Brontes at Haworth whenever we pick up one of their books - but we forget them once we start reading. Jane Eyre in particular is an all-absorbing world. Not so here: Weldon even puts lines from the book into the Brontes' mouths. Thus it is not Jane Eyre but Anne Bronte who speaks the great lines 'Women feel just as men feel . . . they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation . . .' In context, this actually robs the words of their true feminist impact; and the whole device weakens Jane by making her look like a Bronte puppet. Most of the supporting players take several roles. Thus Jane Campion plays Emily Bronte, Mrs Rochester, Blanche Ingram, Celine, Mrs Reed and Miss Scratchard; and she is perfectly dreadful in all of them - crude, exaggerated, superficial. Almost everyone onstage keeps reminding you that they are Actors Acting. This production comes to us from Theatr Clwyd and Thorndike Theatre Productions, and is directed by Helena Kaut-Howson, who must take responsibility for all this. The ludicrously melodramatic music would grace a Hammer Horror production. There are elements of Gothick horror and of feminist protest in Jane Eyre, but they are worked into a texture more romantically poetic, more morally subtle, and more emotionally poignant than Weldon &amp; Co. know how to handle.

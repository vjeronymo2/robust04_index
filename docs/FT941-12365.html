			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Union Railways make house sale losses Losses of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent have been made on house sales in the Kent village of South Darenth by Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary responsible for developing the high-speed rail link to the Channel tunnel. Of the Pounds 135m that BR spent on potential sections of the link which have been excluded from the route, it spent about Pounds 40m buying up 370 houses in South Darenth at the height of the property boom in 1989. The bill was higher than BR expected because it used out-of-date maps which failed to show an estate built in the early 1980s. BR is now trying to sell the houses.</p>

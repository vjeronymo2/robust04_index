			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKEFELLER URGES MORE SERVICES FOR  CHILDREN  </P> <P> The National Commission on Children will deliver a report to President Bush and  Congress next year recommending an expansion of services to address the needs  of unwanted children, the panel's chairman said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We just have to get our act together on kids," Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV,  (D-W.Va.), said at a news conference during the commission's one-day tour of  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "If we don't do something for them now, tomorrow is going to be a dismal day in  this country."  </P> <P> According to a fact sheet distributed by the commission, there were 2.4 million  reports of abused and neglected children nationwide in 1989. The more than 100%  increase over the last decade has taxed the government's ability to care for  unwanted children, officials said.  </P></p>

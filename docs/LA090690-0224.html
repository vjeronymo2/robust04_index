			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST : COMPTON;  </P> <P> APPEAL ON ZIP CODE POLICY GETS ONLY 2 VOTES AND FAILS  </P> <P> Despite the fact that Compton has several ZIP codes, the City Council rejected  an appeal from Councilwoman Jane Robbins to support federal legislation that  would make ZIP code boundaries the same as city boundaries.  </P> <P> The city staff backed Robbins' request, saying the inconsistency causes  emergency service confusion and significantly affects apportionment of federal,  state and local revenues. Vice Mayor Maxcy D. Filer voted against the  resolution and Councilwoman Patricia Moore abstained. Councilwoman Bernice  Woods supported Robbins' motion. Mayor Walter R. Tucker was absent.  </P></p>

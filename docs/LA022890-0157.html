			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> USX WANTS REVIEW OF BIAS RULING  </P> <P> USX Corp. plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review an appeals court's  ruling that the company discriminated against 8,000 black job applicants at a  steel mill, a spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The appeals court last week upheld a 1983 U.S. District Court decision for the  second time.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court last year ordered the appeals court to restudy the case under  more stringent standards for proving bias that the high court imposed June 5.  </P> <P> USX spokesman Ernie Glenn said the company will seek a review of the U.S. 3rd  Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on the ground that the appeals court misapplied  the Supreme Court's new interpretation of civil rights law.  </P> <P> The June 5 decision said minorities could not rely solely on statistics to  prove discrimination but must link the data to a specific corporate employment  policy.  </P> <P> The decision also let companies justify practices that statistically appear  discriminatory by showing they followed a reasonable employment policy.  </P></p>

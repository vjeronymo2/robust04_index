			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: MAI From the outside, MAI looks like an enigma wrapped in a money broker. In an industry notorious for its volatility, MAI has a very consistent record. Diversification is frequently the death knell for a focused business. Yet the cash thrown off by MAI's money broking machine has been invested in industries from television to debt collection, and the company continues to do well. MAI even has a property division, whose concentration on prime locations and top-quality covenants was well-timed, making the investment a quasi-financial asset and home for part of the company's cash pile. The management has skilfully kept this collection of disparate plates spinning, as the market has recognised in its rerating of the stock over the past year. Perhaps the unifying characteristic of the businesses is no more than that MAI's management feels it understands them well. If so, then at least the board is playing to its strengths. There are problems - the insurance company Safeguard, for example, is being mauled by direct insurance sales, and will find it hard to become competitive. But then, Meridian, which has the southern ITV franchise, will move into profit soon. The company has ambitions in media and value-added information services which pitch it against stiff competition. Yet it still pursues opportunistic value investments like Intrum Justitia. At some point, a limit to management resources may force it to choose which path it wishes to tread. Fortunately, that moment has yet to arrive.</p>

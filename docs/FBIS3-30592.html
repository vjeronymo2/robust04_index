			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Arms Industry; Protest Getting More </F> Radical"]    [Text] All factories of the defense industry took  part in a protest organized by the Interunion Strike Committee  on 3 February. The eight-hour strike took place in 19 factories;  the remaining 12 only put up flags, organized rallies, or had  two to four hours of strike. The committee has announced that,  if the government does not change its position, it will make the  protest more radical. The government's view is that it did all  it could, taking into account the budget situation, and that the  strike "is proof of a lack of responsibility."    Negotiations between the Interunion Strike Committee (which  includes the National Section of the Arms Industry of the  Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity," the Trade  Union of the Electromachine Industry, and the "Metalworkers"  Federation) and the government on 1 February did not result in  an agreement. The trade unions are demanding, among other  things, additional resources for restructurings, establishing  the level of government orders to be such that it would  guarantee maintaining the country's defense readiness (about 5.5  trillion zlotys), compensation in return for sustaining  production readiness in case of war in 1990-93, salary increases  that would compensate for price increases, and also securing  preretirement pension benefits. "We are a country of hunger and  neglect"--this is the way Stanislaw Glowacki, chief of the arms  industry branch of "Solidarity," commented on the situation in  the sector.    The Industry and Trade Ministry said that, during the talks,  the government "presented realistic budget and legal  possibilities of implementing the postulates; it presented  positive effects of the industry's restructuring. The  government also showed that there are possibilities of  increasing budget means for 1994 for the arms industry." The  ministry also added that the trade unions "rejected an offer to  sign a protocol of agreement and failed to come up with  alternative possibilities of solving the problem, limiting  themselves to revindication." The ministry said "forcing  changes in the budget by means of strikes" is the kind of  behavior that "indicates a lack of responsibility."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Mar 1 (TANJUG) -- The Republic of Serb  Krajina (RSK) and the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) will be a part  of the single payments system with the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) as of March.    On January 24, the Yugoslav Government began implementing  its  monetary system reconstruction and economic stabilization  program. A new dinar, fully backed by gold and foreign exchange,  was issued in stead of the old inflationary dinar.    Payment operations of the F.R.Y. with the RSK and the RS  have  not been discontinued in the meanwhile, but were carried out in  old dinars.    As it was announced, the RSK government will at the session  of its parliament on Tuesday suggest the urgent adoption of laws  and regulations which will make possible the RSK's joining of  the single payments system with the F.R.Y.    RSK Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic said the greatest  difficulties are expected in the implementation of tax policy  measures and in the domain of customs.    The RSK was proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated areas  in Croatia in 1991 in response to Croatia's forcible secession  from the former Yugoslav federation and its attempt to downgrade  the status of the Serbian people to one of national minority.  It has been a U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992.    The RS was set up by Serbs in 1992 on their ethnical and  historical territories in the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia- Herzegovina.    Since Monday, February 28, the RS has been in the single  payments system with the F.R.Y., Bosnian Serb Prime Minister  Vladimir Lukic said.    "The republican government has harmonized and adopted all  provisions from the F.R.Y.'s monetary system reconstruction and  economic revival program," Lukic said.    It is now only a matter of technique, he added, when the new  Yugoslav dinar will appear as the only means of payment in the  RS.</p>

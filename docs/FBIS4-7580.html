			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 31 (CTK) -- The cancellation of  privatization projects which were approved by the government of  ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar will discourage foreigners from  investing in Slovakia, Meciar's close aide Ivan Lexa told CTK  today.    "No one will be certain about whether this 'nationalization'  will not be repeated in the future," Lexa, former state  secretary at the Privatization Ministry, said after a session of  Meciar's "shadow" cabinet.    "This is an international precedent. Valid agreements and  resolutions have been abolished without a legal document. No  investor will be certain as to whether the next government will  not cancel the decisions of the previous one," Lexa said.    Citing legal and factual shortcomings the new government of  Jozef Moravcik on Tuesday [29 March] canceled 13 privatization  projects out of a total of 45 approved by Meciar's cabinet at a  time when his remaining in power was uncertain. Current  Privatization Minister Milan Janicina even mentioned the  possibility of launching criminal proceedings in several cases.  This, however, aroused doubts even in the Slovak press, as the  ex-Premier's aides and their relatives participated in this  privatization.    At a press conference, Lexa described the cancellation of  the  13 projects as an "act of socialization and nationalization." He  said it was a politically-motivated decision aimed at "heaping  as much dirt as possible on Meciar."</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Tube map reaches final destination THE TUBE map drawn by hand in the 1930s from which today's map was developed was yesterday donated to the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden. The map, a design classic, has been copied by transport systems from Paris to Tokyo. It will be on display at the museum from December 15. Mr Harry Beck's schematic 1931 drawing, now displayed in 1,037 sites in London alone, replaced a series of complicated geographical maps. It set a standard for style and clarity which other transport systems have sought to match. The museum is particularly pleased with the acquisition because Mr Beck had a 'difference of opinion' with London Transport and left the original to his wife - who in turn left it to a friend who was persuaded to part with it.</p>

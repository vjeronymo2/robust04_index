			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Technology: Creating false images - The latest software makes it possible to alter photographs digitally Forget the adage that the camera never lies. The latest generation of image editing software makes it possible to alter photographs digitally so well that it is virtually impossible to spot the change. This technology is creating an entirely new image-editing industry - and raising legal and social questions. Time magazine recently drew criticism over a digitally altered photograph of OJ Simpson, the US football star accused of murder. Critics said the altered picture made him look menacing. Vancouver-based Western Pro Imaging Labs has launched a service for divorced people called DivorceX that allows them to digitally 'cut out' their ex-spouses from family photos. Keith Guelpha, the company's president, says the gaps are filled in with elements of the existing background. It is also possible to place a new partner in the photo once a former spouse has been removed. The technology is standard off-the-shelf equipment - a personal computer, a good colour scanner, some powerful image-editing software and the ability to output to photographic paper, film or colour laser devices. Unlike traditional methods of re-touching photographs, which require considerable skills, in digital image editing most of the hard work is done using a system costing only a few thousand dollars. Photographs can also be altered to change features - people can be made thinner, fatter, or younger. They can acquire a firmer chin or lose a scar. 'A normal person would never be able to tell the difference,' says Guelpha. 'If it's a good picture to start with, the blending is seamless.' With the advent of digital photography (using products such as Apple Computer's QuickTake digital camera), the 'real' image may never even hit photographic paper before it is edited on the computer screen. The image, stored digitally in the camera's memory, can be transmitted directly into a PC. The industry itself is conscious of the potential for misuse of digital imaging. For example, 'polishing' photographs throws doubt on the legal use of photographic evidence. Guelpha says he takes care to ensure his digitally-altered photographs are for legal purposes only.</p>

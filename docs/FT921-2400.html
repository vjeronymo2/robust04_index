			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Afghan response to UN plan: Peace assembly to be held in Europe AFGHAN President Najibullah offered yesterday to hand over power to an interim government proposed by the United Nations as part of a plan to end the 13-year-old civil war in his country, Reuter reports from Kabul. He made the offer in a broadcast over the state radio and television after talks with a UN envoy. 'I agree that once an understanding is reached through the United Nations process for the establishment of an interim government in Kabul, all powers and executive authority will be transferred to the interim government as of the first day of a transition period,' he said. Mr Najibullah, whose regime has survived the withdrawal of Soviet troops, said he would not insist on his participation in a proposed assembly of 150 Afghans from all sides of the war which the UN plans to hold in late April in Vienna or Geneva as a prelude to the interim government, which must halt the war and hold elections. He said the interim government must have the appropriate powers and authority to 'guarantee the unity, safety and security of the Afghan people, as well as the territorial integrity of Afghanistan'. 'The interim government should also guarantee full respect for human rights, and organise and conduct free and fair elections for the establishment of an elected government of Afghanistan.' No immediate reaction was available from guerrilla parties fighting the Kabul government. Radical guerrilla groups have already rejected the UN peace plan, which has been backed by the moderate guerrilla groups as well as Pakistan and Iran.</p>

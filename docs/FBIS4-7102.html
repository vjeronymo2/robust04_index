			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Breakaway of the SDPJ From the Coalition </F> Will Qualitatively Change the Hata Government"]    [Text] Tsutomu Hata, chairman of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], was elected the next prime minister. Some ruling  coalition parties made moves to organize their parliamentary  group just before a new cabinet was about to be formed and  reacting against their moves, the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] broke away from the coalition. The formation of a  new cabinet was deferred until after 26 April. The moves by some  ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ's isolation are likely to  further precipitate a realignment of the established political  parties in the future.    Some ruling coalition parties abruptly formed a  parliamentary  group called "Kaishin" with the aim of leaving the SDPJ out in  the cold, although the SDPJ shored up the coalition framework  for the Hosokawa government and the formation of such a  parliamentary group would change qualitatively and greatly the  character of a new coalition government to be led by Mr. Hata.    The Hosokawa government managed to stay in power for eight  months while showing from time to time the fragility of its  coalition. The Hosokawa government was able to resolve such  pending issues as the enactment of the Political Reform Law and  the liberalization of rice imports thanks to broad public  support.    Disgusted by nearly 40 years of rule by governments of the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and angered by a series of cases  of political corruption under the LDP government, the people had  hoped for new and fresh politics. The emergence of the  fresh-imaged Prime Minister Hosokawa, who distinguished himself  from other politicians, and the common platform of a change of  government and political reform combined to give cohesive force  and impetus to the Hosokawa government. The Hosokawa government  was inaugurated amid public blessings.    What about the Hata government? There is no doubt that the  people feel friendly toward Prime Minister Hata who is an  ordinary person and a man of common sense. Nonetheless, the  people have come to look coolly at the coalition government. An  attempt to change the current coalition framework by forcibly  ousting the SDPJ from the coalition gives us the impression that  the attempt is a result of a high-handed political tactic  employed by Mr. Ichiro Ozawa who is known as the kingmaker of  the Hata government.    The people pinned high hopes on the Hosokawa government to  push forward political reform, because such political parties as  the Japan New Party and Sakigake [Harbinger], which distanced  themselves from conventional politics, succeeded in rallying  broad-ranging political forces while acting as an intermediary.    The Hosokawa government suffered a delay in decisionmaking  because of intragovernment disagreement, but the interparty  check-and-balance process enhanced to some extent the  transparency of decisionmaking and the functions of the  coalition government. If the SDPJ were pressed to change itself  so as to act according to realpolitik, it would be a plus for  the party.  <H5>  Shinseito-Led Hata Government </H5>   For the Hata government, which will take charge of politics  after enactment of the Political Reform Law, there is no longer  such a major domestic agenda as the political reform which held  the ruling coalition parties together and made it possible for  the Hosokawa government to enjoy broad public support. The  showdown between Shinseito and the SDPJ, which first surfaced  following their disagreement over the national welfare tax and a  reshuffle of the Hosokawa cabinet and then intensified in  choosing a successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa, resulted in  ousting the SDPJ from the coalition. The political situation is  now entering a new phase.    Prime Minister Hata has publicly said he would continue to  pursue reform policies. The breakaway of Sakigake from the  coalition and the isolation of the SDPJ will lead to a change in  the character of the Hata government as a reformist government.  The expressions of "the rooting out of political corruption" and  "the thorough establishment of political ethics" are not found  in the basic policies for a new coalition government.    Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, affiliated with Shinseito, took the lead  in forming a new coalition government. The basic policies for a  new coalition government include what Shinseito has advocated.  We have no choice but to be concerned about the political  tactics and structure that put the management of the political  situation in the hands of a specific senior politician and keep  the public in the dark about the decisionmaking process.    The Hata government is seeking its reform policies not in  political reform and administrative reform, but in the  establishment of political leadership. For the time being, the  Hata government will have to deal with the reform of the current  tax system, security, and the situation on the Korean peninsula.  We want to point out once again that the establishment of  political leadership is not simply a synonym for an arbitrary  imposition of the leaders' wishes from above.    Political leadership means the leadership of politics over  the way things are done within a bureaucracy. To that end,  politics must stand on broad public support and take charge of  stressing the interests of the public over the interests of  government ministries and agencies that are perpetuated by  bureaucratic sectionalism. If political leaders have a high  sense of ethics and deep insight, then the political leadership  will be guaranteed. What we hope is that Prime Minister Hata, a  man of common sense, will establish a political leadership based  upon the sense of the citizens.    Another thing that concerns us in connection with the  inauguration of the Hata government, which is expected to be  under Shinseito's thumb, is its relationship with the LDP, the  opposition party. It is a matter of course that the coalition  government, which came to power on the platform of rallying  political forces to end LDP domination, sees the LDP as its  major political rival. The coalition partners have been trying  to split the LDP and keep it out of power in line with their  major strategic goal, but such a strategic goal is not in tune  with the present political situation.  <H5>  Responsibility of the LDP as an Opposition Force </H5>   Essentially, political parties must be formed, realigned,  and  merged in accordance with their policies and lines. The  structure has been built whereby the established political  parties have been pitted against each other and split into  ruling and opposition parties primarily on the basis of their  past deep-seated grudge relationship built upon the so-called  "pro-Ozawa" and "anti-Ozawa theory." The policy distortion  exposed by a big fuss over "Watanabe's breakaway from the LDP"  and the strange political structure built upon the "pro-Ozawa"  and the "anti-Ozawa theory" represents Japan's warped politics.    We see the Hata government as one emerging from the process  of realigning the established political parties, with the  aforementioned political situation taken into consideration. It  is necessary to rally political forces again and promote the  realignment of political parties primarily on the basis of  policies.    If the political parties fail to do so, as seen in the  history of giving birth to the Hata government, the political  parties' goals will be only to cling to power, defend their  organizations, and increase the seeds of future intraparty  splits and confrontation.    The Hata government is increasingly led by Shinseito. If the  Hata government, which formed the parliamentary group, has the  ability to play a pivotal role in pushing for a full-fledged  realignment of the established political parties in the near  future, it is urgently necessary to rally political forces to  counter the Hata government. Promoting a political system in the  name of national unity and a national salvation cabinet is not a  desirable tendency for present day politics which recognizes the  existence of diverse opinions. The inauguration of the Hata  government makes it a most important task for the LDP to reform  and regenerate itself as a political force to counter the Hata  government.    This is also true for the SDPJ which broke away from the  coalition government.</p>

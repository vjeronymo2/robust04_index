			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Economics Notebook: A test of faith in the UK's recovery creed In the last few weeks a malaise has settled over the UK financial markets. Anxiety is growing that even the cautious faith in a sustainable recovery expressed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new Chancellor, may be too optimistic. The fear among a number of economists and investors is that the promising indicators of the first quarter reflected a one-off boost from sterling's devaluation and lower interest rates rather than a sustained improvement in the economy. Even if the UK does not drift back into recession, expectations are mounting that once the optimism of the spring dies down, there will be little recovery left to speak of. The unease has been picked up in the UK money markets. The December sterling futures contract is pricing in another base rate cut by the end of the year, and it is harder to find City economists supporting the view that interest rates have hit bottom at 6 per cent than it was a few months ago. Last week, SG Warburg Securities, which for some time has been relatively bullish about growth, joined the crowd in forecasting that the Chancellor was likely to cut rates to 5 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming, sums up the general concern: 'The buoyancy of consumer purchases of cars, household goods and leisure items in the first quarter bears the hallmarks of a temporary spending binge rather than the beginning of a sustained trend.' What, then, lay behind the strong growth of the first three months of the year if it did not reflect a solid, underlying improvement? Mr Bill Martin, economist at UBS, says there was a one-off surge in consumption provoked by keen high street pricing and better terms on hire purchase agreements after the interest rate cut. Stock-building may also have provided a short-term boost to output and there was an upsurge in confidence after the rate cut. But these factors will not be enough to sustain the sparkle of the first quarter through the rest of the year, say the gloomier economists. In a recent report, Professor Wynne Godley, one of the Treasury's outside advisers known as the seven wise men, says: 'With a severe recession developing in Europe and with inadequate capacity in tradeable goods and services, the growth of net export demand over the next few years will not, on present policies, be any faster in the future than in the past.' The upshot, he says, is that 'it will not be possible to achieve sustainable growth fast enough to reduce unemployment by any significant amount over the next four or five years.' The worries of Prof Godley and economists such as Mr Martin focus on: The overhang of debt. Professor Godley believes that with household debt still around 100 per cent of the annual flow of disposable income, personal saving is likely to stay very high. Survey evidence backs up the fear that consumer spending remains constrained by deteriorating personal finances. Last week, the consultancy Business Strategies Limited reported a rise in the proportion of people falling into debt, particularly in the south-east. On the corporate side, the big overhang of excess capacity in many sectors, together with weakened balance sheets, is checking investment. Tax increases next year and a squeeze on real disposable income. Even the more bullish economists fear that next April's tax increases will sharply reduce consumer spending. Mr David Smith, economist at Williams de Broe, expects growth to be buoyant this year, but warns: 'I am much more concerned that next year will be very disappointing because of the tax increases.' He adds that the prospect of further tax rises will dwell at the back of people's minds so long as the budget deficit remains as high as it is. Meanwhile, consumers face a squeeze on real incomes as the rise in average earnings continues to slow. European recession. Sluggish growth in Europe has been singled out by the Organisation for Co-operation and Development as a significant drag on growth in the UK. Even the competitive gains of devaluation may not be enough to sustain exports as the UK's main markets slide into recession. Credit controls. Professor Godley points out that in previous recoveries there has been some sort of relaxation of credit regulations which has given an underlying boost to demand. This recovery will not benefit from such a move and caution among banks will act as a further hindrance to recovery. Not everyone is as gloomy about medium-term prospects. Mr Tim Congdon, another of the seven wise men, says in the Treasury report: 'It is already clear that the main macroeconomic figures for this year will be the best since the late 1980s.' He says bright economic prospects can be explained by the large amount of excess capacity as a result of reduced output during the recession. This, he argues, will allow for strong non-inflationary growth. Other City economists take a similarly bullish view. 'A lot of the negative factors can be off-set by the lower exchange rate and lower interest rates and there is a feeling that we are near the trough in Europe anyway,' says Mr Paul Turnbull, at Smith New Court. The economy is now poised between sliding back into unspectacular growth or continuing with the gains already made this year. If the economic figures expected over the next two weeks are bad, the chancellor may be tempted to cut interest rates again. But he will need to keep an eye on the level of the pound. Since its recent rise partly reflects optimism about the UK recovery, a run of weaker figures may push the currency back down. In this case, Mr Clarke will have to decide whether to cut interest rates while the pound is weak, or whether to cling to base rates of 6 per cent in the hope that conditions for a strong upturn really are already in place.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (21): Plethora of airports - Hong Kong BY THE end of 1997, the delta of Southern China's Pearl River could be the focus of five new international airports. Hong Kong will vie with Macao, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Guangzhou to lure the hordes of businessmen heading for the world's fastest growing region, writes Simon Davies. Hong Kong had hoped to establish a monopoly role for itself, but the scope of its ambition is currently proving to be its undoing. In 1994, Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport, now the fourth busiest in the world, will hit full capacity, at a time of boom for the Asia-Pacific aviation industry . But the world's most expensive airport project, which was to have been a monument to the success of the British administration in Hong Kong, has instead become a symbol of the uncertainties represented by the colony's post-1997 government. China is apparently unhappy at the Dollars 21bn price tag on Chek Lap Kok and related infrastructural projects, which compare somewhat unfavourably with Japan's Dollars 10bn Kansai Airport, and the Dollars 1.3bn expansion of Singapore's Changi airport. Without Chinese approval of the financing plan, it would become the world's most expensive white elephant. The political stand-off has dragged on for a whole year. Surprisingly, millions of tons of mud have been displaced during that time and a vast artificial island has begun to appear, providing a platform for the airport. The underlying logic is that since the airport was in principle agreed by Britain and China in 1991, work will carry on where possible, and eventually it will become cheaper to complete than to scrap. Despite the delays, Mr Hank Townsend, the provisional airport authority's chief executive officer, argues that the June 30 1997 deadline for the opening of the new airport is still achievable. 'My concern would be that as we approach this fall (without approval for the financing plan), the mid-June deadline becomes less probable,' he said. It seems impossible that it will open on time - the Chinese could be forgiven for wanting to host the ribbon-cutting ceremony for such a momentous project. But with Chinese officialdom stating that it wants the airport, it appears equally impossible that it will not be completed. More of an issue is the role the airport will have left to play once it does open. Kai Tak has been a major beneficiary of the booming Chinese economy. Many of the 21m people who flew though the airport in 1992 did so because it is the only realistic means of access to southern China. This is particularly galling for the Taiwanese. Under government regulations, they can visit China only via a third country. As a result of this, 1.64m Taiwanese visited Hong Kong last year, representing the largest individual source of tourists. Inevitably, direct links will be set up by 1997, and Hong Kong is likely to forfeit a large chunk of this business, accounting for 23 per cent of all visitors last year. The loss of this business could coincide with the opening of a new Hong Kong airport with capacity for 35m passengers. Another factor which will affect passenger demand for Chek Lap Kok is a rapid increase in local competition. In mid-1996, the Portuguese enclave of Macao will finally open its international airport. With a capacity of 2m, it is unlikely to leave a mark on Kai Tak, which processed 22m passengers last year. However, on the other side of the river, Shenzhen has greater ambitions. It plans to process 3m passengers by the end of 1993 and already has capacity to take 8m, or almost one third of Kai Tak. At the same time, Guangzhou, the provincial capital city, is working on a replacement airport and Macao's neighbouring city of Zhuhai wants to get in on the game. All this smacks of excess. Yet Mr Townsend argues that over-capacity is not an issue. 'If you have the capacity, people will find a way to use it. The rapidly increasing standard of living is creating an enormous middle class. You are tapping a whole new segment of the market that hasn't existed before.' He is not alone in this opinion. Mr John Meredith, senior director of the International Air Transport Association, expects Asia-Pacific average passenger growth of 8.6 per cent between 1990 and 1995, and 7.5 per cent between 1995 and 2000. 'The proposed new airports in south-east Asia will be full by the time they come onstream. Asia-Pacific is set to outstrip the rest of the world in passenger traffic,' he argued at a recent conference. Iata estimates the number of flights in the region will double in the next decade. Hong Kong should play a major part in this boom. It remains the natural service centre for southern China because of its strength in infrastructure and communications. Its future must depend on its ability to provide what China needs, and the airport will be integral to this.</p>

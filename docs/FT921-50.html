			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Labour and the trade unions THE REFORMS imposed upon Britain's recalcitrant labour market over the past decade stand as one of Mrs Thatcher's most important achievements. The Labour party is committed to retaining a significant part of the Conservatives' trade union legislation. But Labour's own agenda of 'partnership' and 'fair treatment' for individuals at work calls into question much of the wider deregulation of the Thatcher years, and could radically change UK industrial relations. The Conservative programme of union reform is now largely complete and has been revived in the past few months in response to political not industrial priorities. Judging by the government's white paper on industrial relations, published in February, Mrs Thatcher's successors believe the UK is approaching a near perfect labour market in which unions and collective bargaining are marginalised. That is wishful thinking. Britain's industrial relations are more tranquil than they have been for decades and pay setting has become more flexible. But easier hire and fire for employers has made only a small dent in Britain's structural unemployment. Further, despite unemployment at more than 2m for most of the decade and the toughest labour legislation this century, Britain's employed 'insiders' still pay themselves too much. Collective bargaining Mr Michael Howard, the secretary of state for employment, points to the New Earnings Survey figures, which suggest that collective bargaining no longer pays. In 1983 those covered by bargaining earned Pounds 3 a week more than those not covered. By 1991 those covered were earning Pounds 7.50 a week less. These figures reflect the fact that real pay for non-manual workers rose 33 per cent between 1979 and 1989, while for manual workers, who form the bulk of those covered by collective bargaining, real pay rose only 11 per cent. In other words Britain's pay problem is not, mainly, a collective bargaining problem. One aim of Labour's National Economic Assessment is to exert pressure for a better trade-off between pay and employment. An intended reform of public sector pay to iron out lags and spurts could also be helpful, if it were achievable, although it is worth noting that Labour does not face an immediate public sector pay catch-up problem. Average pay in the public sector is now higher than in the private sector. Review body For the longer term Labour has hinted that it might extend the principle of the pay review body, which now covers nearly half of all public sector workers. If it does it must ensure that it is done in a way which offers as much flexibility as possible for public sector managers, while discouraging leapfrogging of the kind which caused such problems in the 1970s. The big worry is that Labour's neo-corporatism over pay would mean a new status for the unions. State funding for political parties, to which Labour is committed, could eventually loosen its political ties with the unions, but that will take time. In office, the party would need to demonstrate that the unions' success in getting potentially damaging policies - such as the minimum wage, a union recognition law, and repeal of some of the 1980s union legislation - close to the top of Labour's agenda in opposition does not mean legislation will be introduced as they demand. Encouragingly, Labour has recognised that the legitimate aim of a left of centre party to improve the rights of people at work can no longer be pursued through empowering unions. Hence the commitment to a raft of 'positive' rights for individuals at work, which will bring Britain closer to the continental model of industrial relations. The sort of rights embodied in the European Community's Social Charter, such as a commitment to works councils for consulting workers, equal rights for part-time workers, and improved sex equality measures, do not have to imply a rebirth of raw union power. But business is right to be worried at the damage a Labour government could do to British labour costs and flexibility. Labour would be wise to recognise these anxieties and to be prepared to adapt policy in the light of them.</p>

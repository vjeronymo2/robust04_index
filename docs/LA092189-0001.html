			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: HIS CLOUD RAINED ON HER CAREER  </P> <P> The cloud hanging over spying suspect Felix Bloch has cast its shadow over his  wife, and she has resigned as executive director of a charitable foundation. An  official of the American Austrian Foundation said that the FBI's investigation  of the allegations against her husband had damaged Lucille Bloch's  effectiveness on the job. No charges have been filed against Bloch, who has  denied any wrongdoing. "Just imagine the terrible pressure and the problem she  is having," said Thomas J. McGrath, a Manhattan lawyer who serves as the  foundation's secretary. "I'm sure every time she turns around, they say, 'Oh,  you're that man's wife.' " Bloch, formerly the No. 2 official at the U.S.  Embassy in Vienna and a veteran of 30 years in the Foreign Service, has been  under surveillance since June. The Justice Department began the probe after  Bloch was photographed handing a briefcase to a suspected Soviet agent in a  Paris restaurant, U.S. sources have said. The foundation, which is moving from  Washington to New York, runs programs including fellowships in Austria for  journalists and sponsors cultural events.  </P> <P>  -- They met to try and come up with a metaphor for our times -- something to  rival the "Roaring '20s," the "Dark Ages," and the "Age of Enlightenment" --  but the task proved daunting. "Everybody was satisfied but no final metaphor,  alas, emerged," Bernard Levin, chief columnist for The Times of London, said of  the 60 intellectuals who attended the third annual Conversazioni on Culture and  Society, in Boston. After dissecting political changes in the Soviet Union, the  influence of religion on world events and cultural illiteracy, several  conferees proposed metaphors. Levin, in his presentation, pointed to the drug  epidemic and the collapse of form in the arts to coin the "Age of Disorder."  American economist Walt Rostow talked of the European Community's plans for  dropping border restrictions and suggested "Age of Regionalism." While neither  was adopted, Levin applauded the attempt. "The whole idea is that we thrash out  these things," he said.  </P> <P>  -- Former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are  no longer being considered for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, a leading  Norwegian newspaper reported. The Oslo-based Nobel committee makes no official  comment on candidates for the award, but Norwegian media reports have proved  accurate in the past. The panel is to name the peace prize winner on Oct. 5.  The conservative daily Aftenposten said the five-member committee had ruled out  Reagan and Gorbachev in a meeting this week.

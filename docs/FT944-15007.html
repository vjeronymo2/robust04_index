			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Observer: Communist capitulation What do Lord Prior, chairman of GEC, Robert Kuok, the Malaysian tycoon owner of the South China Morning Post, and communist official Zhang Baifa have in common? They are governors of Beijing's newest club. Appropriately known as the Capital Club, it is not only located in the Chinese capital, but is also housed on the 50th floor of a building called the Capital Mansion. Membership fees - Dollars 5,000 for individuals and Dollars 7,500 for corporate members - are also pretty capital-intensive. Officially opened last Saturday, the club is one of a growing band in Beijing and other Chinese cities where the new business elite can rub shoulders with Chinese politicos. In this case, other governors include the vice-mayor of Beijing, who is a close confidant of Deng Xiaoping, and the vice-mayor of Shanghai. Sadly, members of the new and much-hyped London Capital Club should not expect reciprocity, however. The developers of the Chinese venture, Club Corporation of America - specialists in 'member-sensitive staff' according to the bumf - have nothing to do with Dieter Klostermann, the Hong Kong-based chairman of the confusingly similar-sounding CCA Group which is behind the London project. Klostermann, who broke away from the American group in 1980 to set up his own Far Eastern operation, will presumably see his old associates' first incursion into Asia as something of a provocation. He has his own plans for Beijing - if there is anyone left to sign up.</p>

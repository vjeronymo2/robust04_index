			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bogota, 15 Jan (DPA) -- Several radio stations  today reported that two airplanes, apparently belonging to the  U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), flew over Colombia's  Caribbean area for several hours.    The airplanes began flying at low altitudes over the cities  of Barranquilla and Cartagena at approximately 0900 (1400 GMT)  and after noon they were still flying.    Up until late afternoon no Colombian authority had reported  any reasons for the flights, which caused concern among  residents of these Caribbean cities, which are visited by large  numbers of tourists.    Unofficial sources have informed DPA that within the next  few  hours the government of Cesar Gaviria will release an official  statement explaining the presence of the airplanes in Colombia's  air space.    It seems as if the airplanes are conducting routine flights  between several bases, within the framework of agreements signed  between Colombia and the United States to wage war on  drug-trafficking gangs.    This situation has emerged at a time when Colombia is facing  a huge controversy over the presence of U.S. troops who are  working on various fronts.    The most controversial case has been reported in the western  town of Juanchaco, where U.S. troops are building a school,  health center, and highway, to which several political sectors  are opposed.    Detractors say the foreign troops are taking advantage of  their stay in Colombia to conduct intelligence tasks and other  unclear activities that violate Colombia's sovereignty.    Gaviria's government has insisted that the U.S. aid is legal  and a noble gesture, because the projects they are carrying out  are for the benefit of the country's poor sectors.</p>

However, that support is strictly for humanitarian purposes  only, he said.    Thailand will repatriate them at the appropriate time," Gen  Wichit told reporters gathered at Government House.    The defense chief said the government is depending on  soldiers to do their jobs responsibly in order to maintain  security along the Thai-Cambodia border under the current round  of heavy fighting.    "The news reports describing the current situation are still  confusing," he said. "It is not certain whether the government  has captured the Khmer Rouge headquarters in Pailin as reported.  I think the Khmer Rouge will have to resort to guerrilla  warfare tactics or face being overrun by the Cambodian  government troops."    The fighting between Khmer Rouge troops and the Cambodian  forces intensified Saturday, resulting in the apparent  government capture of Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold  and a major source of gems and timber which the rebel forces  sold to underwrite their operations.    Situated in the northwestern part of Cambodia, Pailin  borders  Thailand at Chanthaburi province. When there is heavy fighting,  Khmer Rouge families -- mostly women, children and elderly  people -- flood Thailand's eastern soils at Ban Phakkat of Pong  Nam Ron district in Chanthaburi.    Both groups are still engaged in heavy battle. The  government dispatched soldiers to try and wipe out the Khmer  Rouge forces, and the rebels have returned to the guerrilla  warfare tactics which have served them well in the past. The  sound of gunfire can be heard at the border from time to time,  and many Thai businessmen who run gem operations in Pailin have  returned home.    Supreme Command spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani said in a  press conference that he received reliable information that the  Cambodian government has indeed captured Pailin. Approximately  25,000 Khmer Rouge family members have poured across the border  into Thailand.    "We sent Thai soldiers to help these refugees for  humanitarian reasons," he said. "We treat refugees the same as  we have always treated them. If the situation quiets down and  returns to normal, we will send them all back home.</p>

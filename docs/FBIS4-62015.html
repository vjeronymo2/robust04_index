Kohl earlier said the farewell ceremony would take place in  Berlin where the Second World War ended.    The ceremony should signal an end to a certain historical  phase, according to Yeltsin. Germany, Russia and the whole of  Europe are entering a new era of relations, an era of  reconciliation, he said and added that the ceremony would be a  prologue for the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the end  of World War Two to be marked in 1995.    Yeltsin stressed that Kohl had confirmed the German position  to politicallly include Russia into the G-7, to accept it into  the Council of Europe and to promote an early partnership and  cooperation agreement between Russia and the EU [European Union].</p>

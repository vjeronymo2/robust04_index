Does the introduction of so  many reform measures have necessary conditions? Will it give  rise to social instability and dissatisfaction on the part of  the masses?    [SCRE] The year 1994 is a year of crucial importance for  economic structural reform in China. A number of reform  measures, including those of taxes, banking, foreign exchange,  planning, investments, and enterprise system will be introduced  and put into effect, and the difficulty and strength of reform  will be quite great. Of course, there are also certain risks.  We should point out that in working out reform plans, the  parties concerned have already considered the possible impacts  these reform measures may produce, and have planned measures to  cope with the situation. Separate taxation system structural  reform is undoubtedly of important significance to rationalizing  the distribution relations between the central authorities and  localities, mobilizing the two initiatives, promoting the  rational growth of state revenue, appropriately strengthening  the financial resources of the central authorities, and  enhancing the macroeconomic regulation and control ability of  the central government. However, such reform has also taken  into account the interests of localities and enterprises, and  has adopted some transitional measures so as to gradually  achieve the goal of reform.    As to the return amount of local taxation, the central  financial authorities are taking 1993 as the return base year.  Subsidies provided by the central authorities, local profits  turned over to the higher authorities, and related matters of  settling accounts which were in effect under the original system  will remain temporarily unchanged after the separate taxation  system is carried out, they will be gradually standardized after  a period of transition, and be supplemented by other  complementary reform measures so as to ensure the successful  progress of the new system.    Carrying out the tax system reform of a unified 33 percent  income tax rate for home-investment enterprises will inevitably  produce a major impact on fair tax burdens, on providing  enterprises with the opportunity of equal competition, and on  orderly competition and the stable growth of China's economy,  and should be carried forward rapidly. However, taking into  consideration the actual situation of the low profits of some  enterprises, China has taken some transitional measures, such as  making allowances for the tax rate. In short, after more than  ten years of economic structural reform, the economic and  psychological bearing capacity of the Chinese people has been  greatly strengthened, the material benefits of reform make  people feel confident of government reform measures and their  results, the new system has relative superiority and a  scientific basis, and the considerations given by reform  measures to the vested interests and corresponding arrangements  made in transitional rules and regulations have all provided  ample conditions for carrying out the new system. However, we  will not lower our guard against problems that may crop up and  will take necessary measures at any time to overcome them to  help bring about smooth reform.    [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] As far as I know, the GDP for 1993 broke  through three trillion yuan, with a growth of 13.4 percent, and  the retail price index was 13 percent. What are the trends of  economic development and commodity prices this year?    [SCRE] Economic development this year will remain high, and  the trend is "medium growth and medium inflation." Calculated  by the current growth capacity of China's economy, the economic  growth rate for 1994 is potentially about nine percent. If we  lay down hard and fast rules to expand demand, and the growth  rate increases too rapidly, inflation will be aggravated. To  make a big step forward this year, we are objectively required  to have a rather loose economic environment. Therefore, it is  not suitable for the economic growth rate for 1994 to exceed 10  percent.    Judged from the angle of demand, planned fixed asset  investment for the whole year is 1.3 trillion yuan, social  commodity retail sales will be 1.6 trillion yuan, price reform  will make quite a big step forward, and including the time-lag  of basic money input from the previous year, it is estimated  that China will strive to keep the inflation rate under 10  percent.    Last year the central authorities mainly relied on economic  means, and not on administrative means, to strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control, and did not take measures  to control prices by laying down any hard and fast rules. Due  to the control of total demand, the present price rise has  slowed down.    The introduction of banking, fiscal charges, and other  reform  measures in 1994 will not lead to price increases. The  introduction of price reform measures will only affect pricing  structure changes. The central authorities attach great  importance to inflation. When prices of grain and edible oil  went up recently, the central authorities immediately took a  number of measures to ensure market stability. Now some prices  have gone down to a certain extent.    The purpose of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control is to achieve a basic balance between general supply and  general demand, avoid a tight macroeconomic environment, and  reduce the inflation rate. The state will flexibly wield the  tool of currency policy, control money supply with satisfaction,  and make its growth rate stay at 20 to 25 percent. It is  estimated that price increases this year will be under 10  percent. In making plans this year, the state has taken full  consideration of the pressure of high-speed economic growth on  inflation. In making arrangements for the scale of fixed asset  investments and the extent of total social commodity retail  sales, it has also allowed for unforeseen circumstances. The  growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) has also been  readjusted from 13 percent for 1993 to 9 percent.    [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] The Chinese mainland recently took  measures to curb price increases of grain, but there was little  essential growth of peasants' income in recent years. How  should this contradiction be handled?    [SCRE] There were increases in the peasants' income in  recent years, but after deducting the factor of price increases,  they were very small. For instance, the per capita net income  of peasants in 1993 was 880 yuan, an increase of 90 yuan over  that of the previous year, but after deducting the factor of  price increases, actual growth was only about 2 percent. Do  increases in the peasants' income rely mainly on rises in the  price of grain and other agricultural products? Of course, and  necessary price rises are necessary, which are also an aspect of  raising the peasants' incomes. This year, due to the impact of  the release of raw coal and crude oil prices, it is necessary to  further raise the purchasing prices of grain and cotton. But  the price level is affected by supply and demand relations, and  it is impossible for it to stay at a high level for a long  period of time. In fact, the prices of grain and other  agricultural products in China are already close or equal to  international market prices. It seems that, from an  agricultural point of view, to increase the income of the  peasants it is necessary to take the road of high yield, best  quality, and high efficiency. Apart from developing high-yield,  best-quality, and highly efficient agricultural products that  suit market needs and reduce the peasants' burdens, to develop  nonagricultural industries is the key and breach for increasing  the peasants' income.    At present, there are over 100 million surplus laborers in  China's rural areas, and there will be a new increase of over  ten million laborers each year in the future. How we tackle the  problem of employment for these laborers is a matter of major  importance for raising peasants' income. The solution to the  problem is to make great efforts to develop primary, secondary,  and tertiary industries, of which the stress should be on  developing township and town enterprises. Why are the peasants  of economically developed areas in China rich? It is mainly  because they get a large amount of income from township and town  enterprises. At present, the income peasants derive from  nonagricultural industries already accounts for 37 percent of  their total income, and the great majority of the income of  peasants in economically developed areas come from  nonagricultural industries. Therefore, the key to major  development of the rural economy and to increasing the peasants'  income is to fully employ peasants and to develop township and  town enterprises.    [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What reform and policy measures will the  state take in 1994 to reduce the burdens of state-owned  enterprises?    [SCRE] An outstanding problem that currently constrains  state- owned enterprises to transform mechanisms and move toward  the market is that they carry heavy burdens. In light of this  problem, in 1994 the state intends to adopt, while actively  blazing new trails in the enterprise system and building up a  modern enterprise system that meets the requirements of market  system, corresponding policy measures and complementary reform  measures, reduce enterprise burdens in real earnest, and  concentrate its efforts on creating conditions for state-owned  enterprises to participate equally in market competition. The  state intends to:    1. Adopt a unified tax rate, fair tax burdens, and  strengthen the loan repayment capacity and funds capacity of  state-owned enterprises. From 1 January 1994, a 33 percent  income tax rate has been in effect for home-investment  enterprises. The collection of budget regulatory taxes, energy  and communication construction funds, and budget regulatory  funds from large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is  abolished. According to industrial policy, after-tax profits of  old state-owned enterprises of sole proprietorship that need  support can be retained by enterprises for their own use.  Businesses should conscientiously implement the "General Rules  for Enterprise Financial Affairs" and "Norms for Enterprise  Business Accounting," and standardize enterprise cost  accounting. Loan interest should be charged to cost, and those  enterprises with proper conditions can increase depreciation.  The loan repayment capacity of enterprises is enhanced by the  above measures.    2. Rationally solve the debt burden problem of state-owned  enterprises. Enterprises that find it difficult to repay  outstanding loans on fixed assets can postpone repayment after  being examined and verified as having bad debts and overdue  accounts, a part of which can be handled by a bad-debt reserve  fund by banks according to relevant regulations.    3. Gradually separate the nonproductive undertakings of  enterprises and solve the problem of enterprises "running  society." Schools for children of workers and staff run by  enterprises and other service undertakings and social functions  undertaken by enterprises should be separated from enterprise  production and operations as soon as possible. Some should be  carried on by the government, and others by social  self-government organizations.    4. Pay close attention to solving the redundancy problem of  ailing enterprises. According to a sample survey, there are  about 20 million redundant members at their posts in ailing  state-owned enterprises. These redundant members can be  digested and dispersed by vigorously initiating tertiary  industry and setting up servicing economic entities. Moreover,  pay close attention to working out certain policy measures, and  encourage a number of staff and workers to go to work in  township and town enterprises, "foreign-funded" enterprises, and  private enterprises, or look for jobs by themselves.    5. Enterprises that carry heavy burdens, and that lose money  for a long time and without hope of eliminating deficits, should  be transformed through bankruptcy, annexation, reorganization,  and joint ventures, thus fundamentally solving the problem of  enterprise burdens.    [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What is the situation of experiments with  the shareholding system in China, and what are the plans for  1994 ?    [SCRE] Under the guidance and encouragement of Comrade  Xiaoping's talk during his inspection tour to southern China,  the experimental work of China's shareholding system has entered  a new stage of development. As an important form of equity  system reform of state-owned enterprises and the transformation  of enterprise operations, the shareholding system has won  people's attention. The experimental work of the shareholding  system started in 1984, and up till now it has been carried on  for ten years. Although the time for experiments is not long,  and the number of enterprises under experimentation is small,  the shareholding system has shown powerful vitality in the  market economy, injected new vigor into the equity system reform  of state-owned enterprises, and promoted the setting up of a  modern enterprise system.    According to incomplete statistics, there are 3,800  enterprises experimenting with the shareholding system. Through  their method of buying shares, these enterprises can be roughly  divided into three categories: First, shareholding enterprises  that include shares held by their own staff and workers, which  account for about 47 percent. By this form of shareholding  system, a number of share ownership certificates are issued to  enterprises' staff and workers, from whom 23.5 billion yuan have  been raised. Second, shareholding enterprises whose shares are  purely held by legal persons, which occupy about 46 percent.  They are mainly joint stock companies whose shares are held by  specific legal persons, and companies with limited liability,  invested in and organized by legal persons. Third, shareholding  enterprises whose stocks are issued to the public, which  accounts for about 7 percent. These joint stock companies are  divided into three types depending on how their stocks are  issued and listed. The first type is: A shares, which are  issued only inside China, mainly purchased by the public of  China. The second type is: While A shares are issued, B shares  are also issued, which legal persons and natural persons outside  China are allowed to purchase, and the costs of which are  calculated in renminbi. Transactions of B shares can only be  made in the securities markets inside China. The third type is:  While A shares are issued, H shares are also issued to buyers  outside China, which are listed in Hong Kong. At present, there  are six joint stock limited companies listed in the Stock  Exchange of Hong Kong, which includes Tsingtao Brewery, Shanghai  Petrochemical, Guangdong Shipyard, Beiren Printing, Maanshan  Iron, and Kunming Machine, and HK$8.4 billion have been raised.    By the end of 1993, 196 companies were listed for  transaction  in the securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, of which  33 listed companies issued B shares, and the market price of  listed shares amounted to 300 billion yuan. There were 25 kinds  of directional fund-raising corporate shares listed in the  jointly run STAQ [preceding acronym published in English;  expansion unknown] Market and China Securities Exchange NET  [preceding acronym published in English; expansion unknown]  System, of which 23 kinds were listed for transactions. These  listed companies were distributed over 19 provinces,  municipalities, and cities whose plans were separately listed.  Listed companies expanded in scale from small and medium-sized  enterprises to large and especially large enterprises, extending  to industry, commerce, urban construction, energy,  communications, telecommunications, and other trades. To  standardize the shareholding enterprises under experimentation  before the end of 1990, the State Commission for Restructuring  the Economy approved and acknowledged 119 fundraising companies  to continue making standardization experiments.    The next step, whether enterprises carrying out shareholding  system reorganization or issue stocks and list for transactions,  is still making experiments, and not spreading out over large  areas. The principles of experimental work are: Active  experiments, strict standardization, steady progress, and  healthy development. The requirements for experimental work  are: Making experiments resolutely, not trying to make too many  experiments, but be sure they are good, and not running into  disorder. We must still exercise margin control over  enterprises that are going to issue and list their shares this  year, and whether their shares are issued inside or outside  China, preferential measures should be taken toward large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises in energy, communications,  telecommunications, raw and processed materials, and other  trades. We should continue restricting monetary enterprises and  real estate development enterprises from issuing shares, nor do  we advocate large numbers of commercial enterprises issuing  shares. This year we will continue recommending a larger number  of enterprises than that of last year to issue and list their  shares in Hong Kong and the United States.    [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] Please say a few words about the current  situation of the futures market in China, the present policy of  developing the futures market, and issues related to it.    [SCRE] Since leading comrades of the State Council gave us  instructions in 1988 to study futures, the development of  China's futures market -- from research, planning, to making  experiments -- has been healthy. Up till now, a number of  broker companies and exchanges for futures transactions have  been set up, and the business volume of some exchanges has  reached a considerable scale. However, there have been some  problems in the course of development of the futures market,  some of which are quite serious. For example: Recently, some  localities and departments competed with each other to set up  futures exchanges or retail markets with the goal of developing  a futures business, and blindly set up futures broker companies.  Some law enforcement departments also participated in futures  brokering activities. Some futures broker companies of foreign  investments, Chinese and foreign joint investments, or joint  investments in disguised form deliberately deceived their  clients, and some illegal elements inside and outside China  colluded with each other in futures swindling activities. Some  organizations and individuals lacked a basic understanding of  the futures market, blindly took part in futures business inside  and outside China, and were taken in and deceived, resulting in  losses. Therefore, we must strictly standardize and control the  futures market, and everything must go through experiments.    China's present policy of developing the futures market is:    1. In the present experimental work of the futures market,  we must uphold the principle of "starting by standardization,  stepping up legislation, everything goes through experiments,  and strict control," strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control, and carry out unified guidance and supervision and  management. The State Council has decided that the State  Council Securities Committee shall be responsible for the  guidance, planning, and coordination of the experimental work of  the futures market, and that specific jobs shall be done by  China Securities Supervisory and Management Committee.    2. Examination and approval and registration of new futures  business and broker organizations will be temporarily suspended  without exception. Existing futures business organizations and  broker companies are required to complete formalities again for  examination and approval, and those that are not approved shall  suspend making futures transactions and futures broker business  without exception.    3. Ban illegal futures broker activities.    4. Strict control should be exercised over state-owned  enterprises and public undertakings taking part in futures  business. Law enforcement departments and their affiliated  organizations must not take part in futures broker activities.  It is strictly prohibited to use bank loans for futures  business.    China's attitude toward foreign capitals entering China's  futures market and China's enterprises, public undertakings, and  individuals engaged in futures business outside China is:  China's futures market is still in its experimental stage and  has just started, and the building of laws and regulations is  unsound. Therefore, there is no corresponding legal guarantee  at present for foreign capital to enter China's futures market.  It is not suitable, nor is it safe, for them to enter. When  China's futures market becomes somewhat mature, and when laws  and regulations become amplified, we welcome foreign capital in  China's futures market. Regarding China's state-owned  enterprises, public undertakings, and individuals engaged in  futures business activities outside China, our attitude is: 1)  State-owned enterprises and public undertakings taking part in  futures transactions should be kept under strict control.  Generally, they are allowed to carry out transactions in  appropriate commodity futures and index-linked foreign exchange  futures, while making spot transactions on import and export  trade. 2) Non-state-owned enterprises and individuals that have  the capital may engage in futures speculation outside China, and  all risks are borne by themselves.    [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What are the plans for China's import  structure reform? What are your views on last year's import and  export trade deficit?    [SCRE] The Chinese Government encourages exports and imports  that are beneficial to China's economic development. Last year,  there was a deficit (7.8 billion dollars from January to  November) in China's foreign trade, for which there were many  reasons. It was a problem accompanied by last years' high-speed  economic growth. But, from a structural point of view, it also  explained that the Chinese Government had greatly reduced  administrative control over imports, and indicated China's  action of further connecting tracks with international practice  in its import structure. China reduced its import duty rates  twice in one year (from 43 percent to about 36 percent, which  can be regarded as average), and will in the days to come  further reduce its import duty rate. Beginning last year, China  carried out plans of reducing in five years about two-thirds of  its commodities controlled by import quotas and permits, and  commodities controlled by import examination and approval, and  the import of machinery and electronic products was changed from  the system of examination and approval to primarily the system  of registration. In the future, China will further reform its  import control system, further reduce administrative  intervention, strengthen economic means, and maintain a basic  balance in imports and exports.</p>

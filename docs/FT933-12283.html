			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Geese to keep birdies away: The strange battle over a golf course MARY Holloway does not look like the sort of woman to do battle with a Japanese golf company. A mild-mannered housewife, she lives in a picturesque house in the depths of Weavers Down wood, west Sussex, and is happiest, she says, tending her flock of geese and looking after her garden. But two years ago she embarked on a campaign that has sent an ominous warning to the golf world and left a Japanese company embroiled in a bizarre battle - one that has pitted golfers against ancient common-land rights and a motley collection of cows, goats and geese. Weavers Down common, a valley dotted with elegant houses sporting names such as 'Squirrels', seems a strange place to stage a golf battle. Indeed, when Kosaido, a Japanese printing group, took over an ailing local golf club, Old Thorns, eight years ago, it caused barely a stir in the tranquil woods. Though some locals muttered about the arrival of the Japanese, and the new shiatsu centre, conference complex and Japanese restaurant which had appeared at the club, most accepted the new mangement. The battle started when Kosaido announced that it intended to extend the course. On paper, this seemed unremarkable. Kosaido, which manages 11 other golf courses around the world, owned the land, and with golf booming in Britain there seemed little doubt that it could attract the necessary business clientele. But the site was part of the 1.5m acres of common land in England and Wales. Back in the Middle Ages local houses had been allocated 'estovers' - rights for wood-cutting and animal grazing. Though some of the 20th century 'commoners' had let these rights lapse, a newly-discovered sense of ecological outrage prompted the rest to action. 'I think we felt annoyed that they just assumed they could build a new golf course. We've already got so many golf courses round here anyway,' says Mary. Taken aback, the Japanese' first response was to offer a business solution. In a letter, they offered to buy the rights: Pounds 1,300 for the wood-collecting rights, and rather more for geese and cattle grazing. But the commoners refused to budge, and threatened to appeal to the Royal Commoners' Commission if the Japanese infringed on their grazing rights. Kosaido then produced a new, environmentally-friendly plan which promised to let some of the land revert to its original heathland state, and respect its common land status. After all, it pointed out, other golf courses in England were already built on common land. But surely this did not mean that the cows would be allowed to graze on the golf course? asked the commoners. Yes, replied Kosaido, adding that it all boiled down to the '4-inch rule.' 'Since free-ranging cattle require grass of at least 4in length around which to wrap their tongues while feeding,' the cows would ignore the greens, it said. But what if the cows wandered across the greens during play? And what about the geese? 'Geese would love bunkers. And they can make a tremendous pooh,' chuckles Mary, gleefully. She claims that the commoners had also taken expert golfing advice which showed that most golfing greens could not withstand a cattle herd. Undeterred, Kosaido submitted its application to the local council, arguing that since it already had permission to build a new hotel, the extension of the golf course was a necessity. 'We have nothing to say. We certainly don't want any publicity over this,' Kosaido declared nervously. At this point, though, the commoners discovered they were not alone in arguing that there were already too many golf courses in the world. English Nature, for example, was concerned about the well-being of the solitary bees and Dartford warblers. And the local reptile society announced that the land was home to the little-known smooth snake and sand lizard, and thus a proposed Site of Special Scientific Interest. 'We were rather surprised when they popped out of the grass. We'd never heard of them before,' says Sam Howes, assistant planning officer from Chichester District Council, whose task it had been to plough through 100-odd protest letters. Meanwhile, the Royal Commoners' Commission, whose job it is to decide on the status of common land, expressed confusion. 'We can only deal with cases that are referred to us by the county council,' it admitted. This week, just when the council was due to meet to decide the case - it was expected to support Kosaido - an 11th hour fax from English Nature, contesting the status of the access roads through the snakes' habitat, prompted deferral of the hearing. The commoners says that if Kosaido wins planning permission at the next hearing they will take their case higher - and carry on a grazing war on the golf course with their geese and goats.</p>

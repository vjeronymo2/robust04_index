			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Council tendering target reduced The government yesterday announced a scaling down of its ambitious plans for exposing local authority services to private sector competition. English metropolitan councils will be required to put out to competitive tender 65 per cent of their white-collar construction services, rather than the 90 per cent ministers proposed in 1992. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities claimed the reduction in competitive tendering for construction was the result of 'pressure from local authorities', and said it would attempt to reduce the figure still further during consultation, which lasts until May. Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, said the proposals, announced in a consultation paper, were the result of 'frank, positive and useful discussions between central and local government'. The construction services are architecture, engineering, surveying and valuation, which account for a total budget of more than Pounds 1m. They will be the first white-collar services compulsorily exposed to competition under the government's competitive tendering programme. The 90 per cent target was to have applied for all white-collar services. A series of separate exemptions for small councils and for those that have recently started large projects means that many authorities will be required to market-test much less than 65 per cent of their services when competitive tendering becomes compulsory in October next year. Authorities will also be free not to take the cheapest bid; they can make their own judgments about the trade-off between quality and cost, provided the procedures are 'fair and even-handed'. However, local authorities in England and Wales will have to publish accounts to enable the costs of their services to be compared with others. Mr Baldry said he assumed comparisons would 'identify the best and stimulate the rest'. Officials made clear that they would not publish the data in the form of 'league tables'. It will appear as a memorandum to council accounts, and will be subject to audit. The new statements of support service and costs will be introduced next year for legal and construction-related services and will later be extended to cover information technology, finance, personnel and administration. They must show the total cost of each service to the council  - whether it has been provided by private contractors or in-house  - and how much has been charged to other council departments for use of services. Councils reacted negatively, with Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Labour-controlled Newcastle city council, saying the new statements would be 'bureaucratic, time-consuming and expensive to prepare'.</p>

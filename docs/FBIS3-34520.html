Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres cast doubts  about the possibility of achieving a true breakthrough on the  Syrian-Israeli track because, as he put it, the Syrian ice has  not yet thawed. In fact, Peres and other Israeli officials are  making contradictory statements every day and deliberately  casting doubt about Syria's peaceful intentions.    The Geneva summit, which has given strong momentum to the  peace process and, according to Peres himself, breathed new life  into the peace process, has proved Syria's credibility to the  entire world. This is demonstrated by the fact that all U.S.  officials, led by President Clinton and Secretary of State  Christopher, have praised Syria's positive and constructive  stand and its determined effort to build a just, comprehensive  Middle East peace. This is also demonstrated by the fact the  entire international community has praised President Hafiz  al-Asad's genuine interest in peace and his call to establish  the peace of the brave in the region. Such a peace requires  Israel to rise to the level of the aspirations of the region and  the world.    Syria agreed to hold the current talks in Washington in  appreciation of the U.S. role and in the hope that Israel will  change its previous policies, put an end to the policy of  intransigence and maneuvering, and respond to the UN security  Council resolutions regulating the peace process. Right from  the first session, the head of the Israeli delegation to  Washington said the talks were held in a businesslike  atmosphere. However, the Israeli officials soon tarnished this  positivity with their negative statements. Following an Israeli  request, it was agreed to hold the Washington talks away from  the media. This is understandable, since it is known that the  Israeli rulers call for secret negotiations. However, Israeli  officials are making statements daily that cast doubt on the  Washington talks.    Insisting on playing the same tune, Israeli officials still  demand a definition of the nature of peace, despite tha fact  that the Geneva summit clearly specified the nature of peace and  stressed Syria's readiness to implement all requirements of a  just, comprehensive regional peace.    However, definitely running amid noise and clamor and  deliberately raising doubts in all directions, Israeli officials  want a separate deal that is closer to a spectacle than to a  peace, such as the Oslo agreement. Brought about by secret  talks, the Oslo agreement has faced, and its still facing,  obstacles.    If there is any positivity in the current Washington talks,  then it is definitely the result of the positive Syrian  position, not the Israeli position, which has not yet rid itself  of the policy of maneuvering and procrastination. Syria has  expressly declared its readiness to establish a just,  comprehensive peace in the region and to abide by all its  requirements. But has Israel declared its readiness to enforce  UN Security Council resolutions and to fully withdraw from the  Golan Heights? Syria is still awaiting the answer.    If there is any ice, then it is definitely on the Israeli  side, rather than on the Syrian side. If Rabin admits that  Syria is serious about the establishment of peace, what prevents  Israel, knowing that the ball is now at its court, from  declaring commitment to full withdrawal, instead of casting  doubt, raising its endless security fears, and threatening to  hold a referendum on the Golan and peace with Syria?    At this point, we recall statements by Rabin and other  Israeli officials that Israel will not declare readiness to  withdraw from the Golan before Syria defines the nature of  peace. The Geneva summit defined the nature of peace. The  world is still awaiting a statement by Israel on its readiness  for full withdrawal.    Peace in the region is a matter of occupied territories and  usurped rights. Consequently, peace requires an end to  occupation and the restoration of land and rights. Unless it is  just and comprehensive, peace in the region stands no chance of  lasting. Certainly, peace is not separate deals made behind the  scenes, evading the hopes and aspirations of the region's  countries. Peace cannot mean capitulation to Israel and an  acknowledgement of the legitimacy of its occupation and  settlements.    Syria will always adhere to a just, comprehensive peace. It  will never budge from this stand. No one in the world will  blame Syria for this brave stand. Nay, the world supports  Syria's quest for a just, comprehensive peace, especially since  the world has seen the failures of separate deals. Undoubtedly,  the world is expecting Israel to adopt the long-awaited positive  stand.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CLEARWATER NOT CHOKED UP ABOUT LEADING  </P> <P> Keith Clearwater isn't worried about the pressure of leading a golf tournament  going into the final round.  </P> <P> "I'm not afraid of this at all," Clearwater said Saturday after shooting a  bogey-free, six-under-par 66 that gave him a two-shot lead in the third round  of the Atlanta Classic. "Golf is not important enough to be afraid of it."  </P> <P> He had a 54-hole score of 204, 12 under par on the 7,018-yard Atlanta Country  Club course.  </P> <P> Ranked 164th on this year's money list, Clearwater held his two-shot advantage  over second-round leader Larry Mize, South African Nick Price and Wayne Levi.  </P> <P> "It's just frustrating because I couldn't get anything going," Mize said after  a 71 that included two birdies and a bogey.  </P> <P> Price had a 69 that included four consecutive birdies during one stretch, and  Levi capped an erratic round when he rolled in a 40-foot downhill eagle putt on  the final hole.  </P> <P> Dale Douglass shot a four-under-par 66 to take a one-stroke lead over Gary  Player and Charles Coody after the second round of the rain-delayed $500,000  Seniors event at the Chester Valley Golf Club in Malvern, Pa.  </P> <P> Douglass, who began the round three strokes off the pace, completed two rounds  at 136. Both Player and Coody shot 68s on a dark, misty afternoon.  </P> <P> At 138 was Lee Trevino, who shared the opening-round lead at 67 with Mike and  Dave Hill, and Ken Still, who has never won on the Seniors Tour. Trevino had  two bogeys and a birdie for a one-over 71. Still had five birdies against two  bogeys for a three-under 67 over the 6,406-yard layout.  </P> <P> Nancy Lopez scored two of the only four birdies managed in winds that gusted to  45 m.p.h. and won $95,000 on the front nine of the LPGA's first Skins Game at  Frisco, Tex.  </P> <P> Lopez won $45,000 with a downhill 20-foot birdie putt on the sixth hole at the  Stonebriar Country Club course, and added another $50,000 with a 12-footer on  the eighth.  </P> <P> Betsy King, the current holder of the U.S. Women's Open and Dinah Shore titles,  was the only other money-winner. King won $45,000 with a putt for par-five on  the third hole.  </P> <P> Jan Stephenson, trying to make a comeback from a career-threatening finger  injury, and veteran JoAnne Carner were shut out.  </P> <P> The ninth was halved, so the $25,000 prize on that hole is carried over to  today, when the final nine holes will be played, with $310,000 up for grabs.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley's 10-foot birdie putt on No. 18 capped a round of 66 that provided  a four-shot lead over Patty Sheehan after the third round of the LPGA Corning  (N.Y.) tournament.  </P> <P> Bradley, who started three strokes behind 36-hole leader Alice Ritzman, birdied  Nos. 2, 4, 7 and 9 to vault into the lead, then overcame a bogey at No. 10 with  birdies at 12 and 15 to take charge.  </P> <P> The birdie at No. 18 allowed Bradley to keep a safe margin over Sheehan, the  1983 Corning champion who followed 16 consecutive pars with birdies at 17 and  18.  </P> <P> Arizona's Susan Slaughter, who was second a year ago, birdied the first hole in  a sudden-death playoff to beat Michiko Hattori of Texas to win the NCAA women's  championship at Hilton Head Island, S.C.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Arizona State won its first title, shooting a final-round 304 for a  1,206 four-day score, 16 strokes ahead of UCLA on the 6,141-yard, par-72 Arthur  Hills Course. Florida was third at 1,223, followed by San Jose State at 1,225.  </P></p>

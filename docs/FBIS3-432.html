In a memorandum submitted to  the president of the republic, the opposition parties say under  the prevailing conditions it is difficult for them to take part  in the elections on an equal footing with the Mozambique  Liberation Front and the Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo]. The memorandum says the government has no right to  monopolize the State General Budget, alleging that the budget  comes from tax payers, including members of the unarmed  political parties.    The political parties rejected what they described as Renamo  maneuvers designed to divide the country into two occupied  areas. The parties demanded the immediate abolition of so-called  Renamo areas and their rapid reintegration into state  administration.    Speaking to newsmen after he received the memorandum, the  president of the republic said he believed the unarmed  opposition parties will not demand an immediate response to  their grievances because these require an in-depth assessment of  the situation. Joaquim Chissano said it is necessary for the  country's leading forces to work closely.    Yesterday's meeting was requested by the unarmed political  parties.</p>

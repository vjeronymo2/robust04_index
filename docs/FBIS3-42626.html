			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Terekhov, International Academy of </F> Information Services, under the rubric "Expert Review":  "Refugees and Emigrants: How Is a Catastrophe to Be Averted? It  Is Necessary To Take Some Measures Urgently"]    [Text]  <H5>  Causes and Specifics of Forced Migration </H5>   Migration geared toward the interests of the economy and  production and predicated on regional imbalances in labor  resources, territorial differences in the standard of living,  and uneven distribution of jobs and places of study prevailed in  Russia and other republics of the former USSR until the  mid-1980's. Forced migration of the population picked up in the  Russian Federation beginning in the mid-1980's.    The problem of interethnic relations, which generates the  terrifying phenomenon of refugees, is becoming the foremost  problem among the factors inducing forced migration.  Unemployment caused by economic crisis became a second factor  inducing migration of the population. The growth of unemployment  everywhere in combination with interethnic conflicts aggravated  two interconnected problems--refugees and mass emigration.    The third cause of forced migration, ecological catastrophes  and natural disasters, is also important. Chernobyl, the Aral  Sea basin, the Semipalatinsk region, and Novaya Zemlya are the  best-known foci of such catastrophes.    At present, as in the 1980's, the demographic potential of  the Russian Federation increases by virtue of interrepublic  migration processes. However, for a long time now the migratory  flow has consistently trended down. Between 1981 and 1985 Russia  received an average of 185,300 people a year as a result of the  interrepublic redistribution of the population, and in  1986-1990--156,600 people, whereas in 1991 the inflow of labor  resources to the republic came to just 51,600 people.    Qualitative changes have also occurred in the nature of  migration processes in Russia.    Firstly, the attraction of northern and eastern regions,  which have a labor shortage, diminished; in the late 1980's  these regions began to experience population loss. For example,  population loss due to migration in Western Siberia and the Far  East increased by factors of 15 and seven, respectively, in 1991  as compared to 1990.    Second, the migratory outflow of the population (as a result  of diminishing needs for out-of-town labor and a sharp increase  in the cost of living) caused a reduction in population in the  cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg by 0.5 and 0.6 percent,  respectively, in 1991, which had not been registered previously.    Third, population inflow to southern regions of the republic  has picked up. Compared to 1990, the number of migrants to the  North Caucasus increased by a factor of almost two in 1991. The  main role in this was played by streams of refugees and  displaced persons resettling in North Ossetia, Krasnodar Kray,  Stavropol Kray, and Rostov Oblast.  <H5>  Hidden Discrimination and the Russian Issue </H5>   As has already been said, since the late 1980's forced  migration has become a new feature and the most acute problem in  migration-related exchange of population between Russia and  neighboring foreign countries. Aggravation of interethnic  relations and discrimination along ethnic lines and language and  political convictions were the reasons for the forced migration  of the population.    The above negative trends of national isolationism emerged  in  many republics as early as the 1960's and 1970's. Individuals of  the indigenous nationality were recruited into leadership  positions in all areas of public life, and by the beginning of  the 1980's they were absolutely prevalent in numerical terms.  Principles of ethnic background, clannishness, and territorial  affiliation got the upper hand in cadre policy. Colleges of the  republic ended up in a sphere of particularly strong influence  of unfavorable manifestations. The policy of preferential  admission to colleges of individuals of the indigenous  nationality was deliberately promoted in the republics.  Disproportions developed between the ethnic structure of the  student body and the ethnic structure of the population of many  republics.    At present almost 28 million Russians (according to the 1989  census of the population), as well as citizens of other  nationalities which have national-state entities in the  territory of Russia, reside in the territory of the former  Union, beyond the boundaries of Russia. The latter nationalities  are the Tatars, Jews, Ossetians, Bashkir, Mordvinians, Chuvash,  Chechens, Udmurt, and Mari.    Russians account for 25.3 million, or almost 91 percent of  citizens of the above nationalities. Among the largest other  nationalities let us note the Tatars--1,127,000 people (4  percent) and Jews--841,000 (3 percent).    Apparently, the Russian issue will remain dominant in the  tangle of migration-related problems in the years to come. In  1991, 42 percent of non-Russian students and 29 percent of  professors of colleges of the former USSR believed that the  Russian people have always aspired to dominate and suppress  other peoples and nations. In the consciousness of these people  the policy of the Soviet party and political leadership and the  role and lot of the Russian people are identical notions.    The situation of Russians in interethnic relations with the  indigenous nationalities of the former Union is complicated by  the fact that, despite the rejection of nationalism, their  position is not supported culturally. Thus, the proportion of  those who have command of a second language among Russians  ranges from 1 percent in Kazakhstan to 37 percent in Lithuania.    In all republics, the proportion of Russians who are fluent  in the language of the indigenous nationality falls far short of  one-half. The statistics are highest in Ukraine, Armenia,  Lithuania, Georgia, and Latvia (one-fifth). The numbers are  extremely small in the former republics of Central Asia--from  0.9 percent to 4.5 percent.  <H5>  Migration Projections </H5>   Outside of Russia, Russians are mainly concentrated in four  former Union republics.    The former republics should be divided into several zones  from the standpoint of the possible scale of the movement of  Russians to Russia. The first embraces those who reside in  Ukraine and Belarus--12.7 million people, or just over one-half  of all Russians beyond the borders of Russia. These are  republics with long-standing, traditionally strong bonds with  the Slavic peoples. Apparently they cannot be considered a  source of forced migration of any consequence.    The second zone, represented by Kazakhstan, with 6.2 million  Russians, approximates the first. Until recently the historical  conditions for the formation of the population there provided a  relatively favorable background for the residence of Russians.    Uzbekistan, with 1.7 million Russians, belongs to the third  zone. In the consciousness of the Uzbeks, the quite high  industrial potential (compared to other Asian republics of the  former Union) is associated with the inflow of a considerable  amount of skilled Russian cadres during the Great Patriotic War.  The postwar boost to the industrial potential of the republic  was associated with the replenishment of Russian cadres to a  considerable degree. Apparently, Uzbekistan should not be viewed  as a zone for a mass resettlement of Russians.    A relatively large proportion of Russians (about 5 million)  is concentrated in the fourth zone, to which the rest of the  republics of the former Union belong. The Baltic states,  Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and Moldova are among these  republics. The mere enumeration of these territories with the  most unfavorable social situation testifies to the fact that  these are zones from which the most intensive forced migration  of Russians should be expected.    However, the main characteristics of interethnic relations  in  the Baltic area indicate a high degree of cultural compatibility  between Russians and the majority of the population of these  states.    In Georgia and Armenia, half of the resident Russians were  born in these parts, and about a quarter come from resident  families. Until recently mutual relations among Russians,  Armenians, and Georgians gave no rise to concern. However,  flareups of interethnic conflicts indirectly worsen the  situation of the Russians.    In the European regions, the standing of Russians is  comparatively the worst in Moldova. The situation in the  Dniester area has promoted tension in relations between  Moldovans and Russians.    The most unfavorable conditions for the residence of Russian  minorities have developed in the region that includes  Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Chechnya, and the republics of Central  Asia. This region accounts for up to 80 percent of the entire  last Russian emigration.    Between one-third and one-half of the almost 1.1 million  former Russian local residents have already left the most  unstable Muslim republics of the former USSR--Tajikistan and  Azerbaijan. Many Russians have left even more stable republics,  such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russian populations  accounted for between 8 and 13 percent in these four republics.  In Kyrgyzstan this statistic came to 26 percent, and in  Kazakhstan--41 percent. Now that the Muslims are coming to power  and becoming a majority, Russians feel less secure.    The flight of Russians from the Muslim republics began in  earnest four years ago. In Dushanbe fewer than one-half of the  300,000 original Russian residents remain.    Nonetheless, fewer than 20 percent of all Russians residing  beyond the borders of Russia may be considered potential  refugees.    Some projected estimates considerably exaggerate the refugee  problem. Prospects for forced migration are most likely  associated with the Russian populations of the Baltic area,  Azerbaijan, Transcaucasia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova,  and Georgia. Uzbekistan may provide "sustenance" to some extent,  and probably Kazakhstan (to a much smaller degree). The Russian  Federation may consider 6 million Russians residing in  neighboring foreign countries, out of 25.3 million, potential  refugees. The figure of 2 million refugees coming to Russia in  the immediate future is viewed as quite realistic.  <H5>  Reception and Resettlement Problems </H5>   Russians are mainly clustered in urban areas. The proportion  of urban population among Russians is much higher than among the  indigenous population. This is particularly characteristic of  Central Asia, Azerbaijan, and Transcaucasia. There are many more  Russians among the urban population than there are among rural  residents. The greatest numbers of Russians reside in large  cities. This picture is due to the professional structure of the  Russian population. Russians aspired primarily to work in  industrial sectors, in the areas of science and education. This  is particularly noticeable in the Asian states of the CIS.    Therefore, the problems of Russians beyond the borders of  Russia are mostly problems of the urban population, to the  greatest degree--of those in large cities. This suggests that  the probable refugees will have to be accommodated and placed in  jobs mainly in the cities. The existing view about the extensive  potential of the rural areas of Russia in this instance is  illusory.    Forced migration of the population cause problems both for  the resettlers themselves and the residents of regions they  enter. The settlement of migrants is one such problem.    The indicator of refugees holding residence permits as a  proportion of the total number of registered refugees reflects,  to a certain degree, adjustment at new locations and  resettlement. By the end of 1991 less than 40 percent of  refugees had obtained residence permits (and, therefore, had  been dropped from the rolls) in Russia as a whole. This  situation was largely due to difficulties in the permanent  resettlement of migrants. The greatest numbers of forced  migrants settled in Vladimir, Kursk, Orenburg, Orel, Ulyanovsk,  Samara, and Astrakhan Oblasts, and in Tatarstan--since 1991,  more than 90 percent of the refugees arriving there have  obtained residence permits. At the same time, no more than  one-third of the arriving refugees had obtained residence  permits in Kabardino-Balkaria, Krasnodar Kray, Ivanovo, Penza,  and Tambov Oblasts, and only 2 percent--in North Ossetia.    On the whole a trend may be noted toward an outflow of  refugees from the central and northern territories of Russia to  the southern regions. At present, 70 percent of all refugees are  concentrated in the southern regions of the Russian Federation:  North Ossetia, Krasnodar Kray, Stavropol Kray, and Rostov Oblast.    Immense difficulties develop in the job placement of  refugees. Specialists estimate that just over two-thirds of the  total number of migrants who wish to work will be able to find  work. According to conservative estimates, more than 2 million  jobs will be needed if events take an unfavorable turn. This may  substantially worsen the situation on the labor market in  Russia, especially in some of its regions.    It is possible to predict that in the environment of overall  socioeconomic and political instability, the streams of refugees  will remain extensive into the mid-1990's because new hotbeds of  tension continue to emerge at present, as well. At the beginning  of 1990 there were 25 of them in the territory of the former  Union, whereas by March 1991 there were three times as many--76.  <H5>  Emigration </H5>   We should note one more alarming phenomenon: some refugees,  disappointed in the ability of the state to protect their  interests, have lost faith in the opportunity to normalize their  lives within the country and are becoming emigrants.    Looking for salvation from economic difficulties, citizens  of  the former USSR are resorting to various tricks, circumventing  laws, quotas, and so on. Thus, many Russians and representatives  of other nationalities are leaving the country, together with  Germans, Jews, and Greeks, using ethnic emigration. For example,  of the 186,000 Soviet emigrants who arrived in Israel in 1990  alone, Russians and representatives of other non-Jewish  nationalities accounted for 35 percent. The refugee problem has  thus grown from a domestic into an international one.    In the late 1980's, emigration from the former Union had  already become precipitous, as statistics testify: in the 45  years since the war about 2.5 million people left the country,  whereas in four years (1987-1990), about 1 million people left,  or 38 percent of the entire outflow. Since 1986 the outflow has  increased sharply every year. According to data from the USSR  Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 1986 only 4,000 people  emigrated abroad from the USSR, in 1987--as many as 29,000, in  1988--75,000, in 1989--235,000, and in 1990, 600,000 citizens  left the country. In 1991 the outflow doubled, and this number  will keep growing.    According to some projections, up to 7 million people may  emigrate from CIS countries for permanent residence abroad  within 10 years, of whom no fewer than 1.5 million will be  specialists and 1.5 million will be skilled workers. According  to other estimates, about 2 million people awaited the Law on  Exit in order to embark on work abroad, and another 5-6 million  are morally prepared to take this step.    There are many refugees in the stream of emigrants because  the most skilled segment of refugees (18 percent of those polled  in various regions of the country) are oriented toward migrating  abroad.    Most emigrants (about 40 percent) are residents of Moscow  and  St. Petersburg and Moscow and Leningrad Oblasts; 8 percent are  residents of Omsk Oblast, 6 percent--residents of Altay Kray,  and 5 percent--of Orenburg Oblast.    However, the severalfold growth of emigration is hardly  possible in the immediate future because the actual scale of  departures will depend not only on the number of people in  Russia who strive to go abroad but also on the immigration  capacity of receiving countries whose potential is limited.    During the period of a mounting third wave of emigration  from  the republics of the former Union, a number of states changed  the tactics of immigrant reception, making their qualitative  selection stricter. Thus the leading universities of Europe and  America and the research departments of multinational  corporations will be able to place in jobs up to 200,000 leading  scientists and specialists in the next few years to come. This  is why, to Russia, emigration of the population means primarily  loss of highly skilled specialists and intellectual, creative  potential.  <H5>  Necessary Measures </H5>   Therefore, two of the most acute migration-related problems  of the present day, those of refugees and emigrants, are closely  intertwined because a considerable proportion of refugees are  potential emigrants. It is necessary to take this circumstance  into account in developing a modern migration policy. It is  necessary to urgently do the following in order to avert a  catastrophe associated with swelling streams of refugees and  forced migrants: to put representatives of the migration service  on the staff of embassies and consulates of all states of the  former USSR; to establish, on a parity basis with other CIS  states, an organization similar to the International Migration  Organization; to set forth the status of dual citizenship and  bilingualism with the preservation of Russian as the second  state language; to admit CIS countries to the International  Migration Organization and the Office of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees; to provide moral, financial, and  organizational assistance to Russian and Russian-language  communities in establishing cultural and educational centers and  similar centers of other nations in Russia; to take political,  legal, and financial measures aimed at overcoming the forced  migration of representatives of national minorities, the  Russian-speaking population.</p>

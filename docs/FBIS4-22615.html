			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Vostrikov, candidate of historical </F> sciences: "Russian Foreign Policy Priorities in Asia--The Ethics  of Pragmatism and Common Sense"]    [Text] It is generally known that for the international  influence of any state, "professionalism of foreign policy is  very important." (F.M. Burlatskiy, A.A. Galkin. "The Modern  Leviathan." Moscow: MYSL, 1985, p. 317). An accurate assessment  of the correlation of forces, the ability to determine a precise  position under adverse conditions, the ability to select proper  allies and partners--may compensate to a certain degree for  diminished economic potential and retarded dynamics of  development. This is especially urgent for the Russia of today,  which for certain reasons is undergoing one of the most critical  periods of its history. In order to avoid failure and subjective  defeats under such conditions, the foreign policy of the state  must be equal to the situation being endured. This can be done,  in our view, only if policy is based on fully realistic and  rational foundations which conform first and foremost to the  interests of Russia itself, and not on mythical or abstract  concepts oriented on theoretical considerations removed from  real life.    We are talking about bringing the foreign policy of the  Russian Federation into conformance with the principles  comprising the basis of foreign policy activity of the developed  democracies that constitute reference points for Russia. In  effecting the transition to a market economy, we must not forget  that "capitalism brought along with it the ethics of pragmatism,  the ethics of common sense. A lofty idealism resided in its  slogans of freedom, equality, and brotherhood, but it was an  idealism based on a sensible, utilitarian accounting of  realities." (A.N. Yakovlev. "Prelude. Cataclysm. Epilogue."  Moscow: NOVOSTI, 1992, p. 276). It is pragmatism and common  sense, in our view, that would advisably be put at the  foundation of the foreign policy strategy of the Russian state  under today's conditions. From this point of view the question  of selection of priority partners may be examined--with respect  to both the "near" and "far" abroad.    Relations with its great neighbor of the Far  East--China--will be of primary and vital significance to the  Russian Federation. These affect not just the interests of  Russia in Asia, but the entirety of Russia's international  policy. As it develops in dynamic fashion, China is today  playing an ever more prominent role in the Asia-Pacific region.  "No single Asian power in the Asia-Pacific region has at its  disposal the universal and powerful influence that belongs to  the People's Republic of China." (S.V. Solodovnik. "Stability in  Asia--Russia's Priority." MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, 1992, No. 2, p.  88). Expert analyses predict that in the future, China will be  quite capable of assuming a leading position in world politics  (a number of analysts even predict that the People's Republic of  China will turn into a superpower in the 21st century). An  expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation with the PRC will  conform to Russia's interests in developing its economic  infrastructure in the Maritime Kray region, Siberia, Sakhalin,  and Kamchatka. In the long term, should events develop  favorably, it is felt that the Chinese "springboard" could  facilitate to a certain degree the emergence of Russian capital  in the markets of Southeast Asia, where Chinese business "is a  permanent element of the socioeconomic structure of countries of  the region." (S. Goncharenko. "Partners or Competitors--How  Regional Chinese Capital Operates in the Countries of Southeast  Asia." VOPROSY EKONOMIKI, 1992, No. 3, p. 113).    The experience of the PRC's transition to a market economy  is  interesting in many respects and may prove quite useful to the  Russian Federation (especially since when one takes a sober look  at things, it is impossible not to see that during a  historically short period of time the PRC has been able to  approach the real market far more closely than the Russian  Federation, where a greater role has been devoted to talk).    In laying the foundation of Russian-Chinese relations today,  we are obliged to proceed from the long-term perspective, first  and foremost from a clear realization of the immutable fact that  China and Russia are fated to be neighbors forever, regardless  of whether one is pleased at this or not.    Of great significance to the security of Russia's interests  in the South and Central Asian regions is the preservation of  continuity in the development of relations with India.  Settlement of the problem of India's payment to Russia of its  long-term state credit debt opens up broad opportunities for the  development of mutually beneficial cooperation in the sphere of  trade, shipping, space research, modern technology exchange, and  exchanges in the military-technical sphere. India's  implementation of a large-scale program of economic reforms,  during which it "opens up new spheres for the application of  capital" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, 18-24 February 1993) will  create favorable conditions for Russian investors,  joint-stockholders, and private entrepreneurial structures.  Since time immemorial the peoples of India and Russia have come  to share deep-rooted traditions of humanitarian and cultural  cooperation. In addition, expansion of the Russia-India  political partnership contributes towards the consolidation of  stability in Hindustan and throughout Central Asia as well. This  is of major significance to Russia.    Prospects for developing and intensifying ties with Russia's  Eurasian "twin"--Turkey--appear to be promising and advantageous  for Russia. Quite a number of historic parallels can be seen in  the development of the two countries. Over the course of  centuries, Turkey, like Russia, has played the part of a unique  "bridge" between East and West, not belonging to one or the  other. Like its northern neighbor, Turkey has had to endure the  agonizing process of surmounting the empire syndrome and  effecting transition to a modern (secular) model of state  structure. Today Turkey, just like Russia, is resolving complex  problems of economic modernization. The history of Russo-Turkish  relations records a great many pages of drama and even tragedy.  At the same time, the past also contains a positive experience  of cooperation between the Russian Federation and Republic of  Turkey of the days of Kemal Ataturk. The similarity of  historical experience and economic systems of the two countries  presupposes their compatibility and complementary nature. This  experience is also valuable because today in Russia and other  CIS states, "with the conduct of liberalization of the economy,  a number of trends are being observed that operated in Turkey  during the 1980's. They deal with the fate of state enterprises,  pace and forms of privatization, and development of the  financial market." (S. Avdashev. "Turkey--A National Model of  Liberalization of the Economy." 1992, No. 11, p. 101). Nor would  it be in Russia's interests to ignore the strong influence  Turkey has in the Caucasus, the Balkans, Central Asia, and the  Black Sea region.    Capability for a constructive and highly effective  relationship is seen in the prospects for partnership between a  renewed Russia and Israel, where a tremendous Russian-speaking  community has formed that exerts significant influence on the  political, economic, and cultural life of the state. "One-fourth  are our former people"--as the words of the famous poet express  it. This is not only a natural and vital element linking the two  countries, but a powerful factor of rapprochement between Russia  and Israel as well. Repatriates from Russia have significant  capacities at their disposal for rendering intermediary services  in trade between the West and Russia, in investing capital in  the Russian Federation economy on a long-term basis, and in  implementing joint projects in both countries. Prospects appear  good for cooperation in the development of tourism, trade in  subtropical crops, processing and sale of diamonds, and in the  sphere of scientific research. The development of relations  between Russia and Israel would provide a weighty contribution  to stabilization of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean,  facilitating settlement of one of the most deep-rooted and  complex problems of modern times--the problem of the Near East.  It is important to emphasize in this regard that the deepening  of Russian-Israeli relations cannot and must not be effected at  the expense or to the detriment of Russia's traditional ties  with the Arab world (in particular, with Egypt, Palestine,  Syria, and Kuwait). On the whole, orientation on the Near East  should, in our view, constitute one of the priority directions  in foreign policy strategy of the Russian Federation in Asia.    In the "near" abroad, of exceptionally great long-term  relevance to the national security and interests of our state is  Kazakhstan, covering the "soft underbelly" of Russia and linking  it with the countries of Central Asia at the same time. The  geographic position of Kazakhstan, its virgin lands, natural and  raw-material resources, developed industrial infrastructure, and  the largest Russian-speaking diaspora outside the borders of the  Russian Federation make it objectively urgently necessary to  effect the very closest coordination and integration (a  "strategic alliance," if you will) in all spheres of activity  between Russia and Kazakhstan.    The traditional gravitation of Armenia towards Russia is to  a  great extent the result of the particular features of its  historical development and geopolitical situation. Occupying a  central position in the Transcaucasus and essentially  constituting the "key" to all of Asia Minor, Armenia is located  at a unique juncture of two worlds--the Christian and Islamic  worlds. Such a position has its obvious pluses as well as  minuses. Armenia's advantageous geographic position, its solid  intellectual potential, and the presence of a large and  diversified diaspora in many countries of the world, including  in Russia itself, make prospects for the development of stable  and all-encompassing cooperation between Russia and Armenia  quite promising.    Rich mineral and energy resources, developed  livestock-breeding, climatological and balneological factors,  and the presence of suitable economic "recesses," have created  favorable preconditions for cooperation between Russia and  Kyrgyzstan. Not of minor significance to the Russian Federation  is the presence in Kyrgyzstan of a large Russian-speaking  community that plays an important role in the socioeconomic and  scientific life of the state.    The high-priority nature of relations between Russia and  Uzbekistan has been determined by an aggregate of factors in the  geostrategic, economic, and cultural spheres, as well as by  historical tradition. The heart of the "mid-territory" of the  Central Asian region, Uzbekistan "is not only a buffer zone, the  boundary between the former USSR and the Islamic countries, but  is the place where new ideas and the reality of a new world  structure intersect." (M. Timonina. "They Are Aided By the Black  Rock, We--By the Golden Crucifix" SOTSIUM, 1992, No. 6, p. 41).  The interdependence of the economies of the two states, trade  ties that have become a permanent fixture, and civilized and  humanitarian traditions going back centuries upon centuries  constitute a solid foundation for profitable cooperation on a  broad scale.    In this manner, with all the dissimilarity, diversity, and  nonuniformity with respect to the above-enumerated countries,  there exist certain substantive aspects and features that are  intrinsic to a greater or lesser degree to practically all of  them. It is these most typical features which, in our view,  could be laid within the foundation of a system of criteria for  selecting priority partners in both the "near" and "far" abroad.  Their universal nature makes it possible, in our view, to  utilize this system beyond the boundaries of the Asian continent  as well.    Thus, in selecting priority partners for the Russian  Federation abroad, the main focus of attention must be  concentrated on the following fundamental parameters:    --mutual compatibility of economies, approximate  comparability of economic development;    --"key" nature of the geopolitical position of partners;    --internal stability;    --the secular principle in organization of state power.    We know that the main foreign policy task of any state is to  ensure its internal development. As it applies to Russia's  present conditions, this means primarily the preservation of the  country's economic potential and the safeguarding of political  stability, and not simply physical survival within the existing  state borders. Proceeding from this, the economy must be set as  the cornerstone, while the foreign policy itself of the Russian  Federation is subordinated to economic interests. Such  pragmatism in policy does not constitute anything  extraordinary--quite a number of countries in the world espouse  such an approach to their benefit. Nor does this run contrary to  the interests of the world community. Cooperation between the  Russian Federation and the above-mentioned partners will enable  it to actively participate in collective efforts to resolve  regional conflicts in the Near East, the Transcaucasus, and  Central Asia, thus contributing significantly to the  consolidation of international stability.    Rivalry in the international arena remains with us and will  continue in the post-confrontational world. Under these  conditions, only sober calculations, realism, and pragmatism can  guarantee the success of foreign policy efforts. Russian  philosopher Nikolay Berdyayev heaped severe criticism upon  abstract doctrinaires in politics who proclaimed general  principles without regard to relevant vital tasks and the given  moment in history. "The oversimplified abnegation of problems  and the specifics of the history in which any politics is formed  is an indicator of mediocrity or superficiality in this area,"  he emphasized, "or a lack of interest in this sphere of  existence, an absence of calling to it." (A.N. Berdyayev. "The  Fate of Russia." Moscow: 1990, p. 215). These words are  exceedingly relevant today. It is entirely apparent that even  today the adjective "free" as it pertains to Russia "is still  very difficult for our top brass to utter..." (Yu. Boldyrev.  "The Russian Era." IZVESTIYA, 6 February 1993). It is therefore  entirely logical to assume that without freedom of thought,  freedom to choose our own path of development, freedom to  determine our own Russian interests and priorities, the danger  of dogmatism in the foreign policy sphere will continue to exist.</p>

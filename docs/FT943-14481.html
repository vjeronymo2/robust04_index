			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Observer: Explosive stuff While the world is exercised about the vaulting price of coffee, scant attention has been afforded the recent surge in the price of methanol. This key ingredient in methylated spirits was going for less than DM200 per tonne last year; it now costs over DM550 per tonne. Although it is best known as a cheap if unpalatable alternative to whisky, meths is now an essential ingredient in unleaded petrol. Another sign that the price of supermarket petrol may soon be heading in the same direction as the price of supermarket coffee?</p>

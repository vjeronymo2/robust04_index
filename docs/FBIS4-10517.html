			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Annerys Gonzalez; from "The News" newscast -- </F> live relay]    [Text] Disip [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention  Services] members arrived at San Martin Avenue at 0910 [1310  GMT] this Tuesday to defuse an alleged explosive found near a  Banco Latino automatic teller machine. Well-protected members of  the Disip Explosive Division are proceeding to defuse the pipe  bomb. An official is signaling that the situation is under  control.    As you can see, people were ordered out of the building to  avoid any possible mishap.    Disip officials picked up a polyethylene bag--apparently  containing an explosive device--and put it inside this truck to  transport it to a location where it can be detonated. Members of  the Special Action Brigade of the Judicial Technical Police  [PTJ] and officials of the Disip Explosive Division arrived at  the location to take pictures of the pipe bomb before it was  detonated.    As you can see, all security measures are being taken to  carry out this operation. Additionally, vehicle traffic in the  area was stopped to prevent injury to people near the explosion  site. We expect the detonation of the pipe bomb found at Banco  Latino any minute. [loud explosion heard in background]    Vehicle traffic was finally resumed, and Disip officials  departed the area. The Disip and PTJ will investigate this  situation to determine who planted this explosive at Banco  Latino in San Martin.</p>

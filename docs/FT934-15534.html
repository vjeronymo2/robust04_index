			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (10): The allure fades - The cost of employing workers in western Germany looks especially high compared with the cost of labour in the fledgling democracies of eastern Europe / Germany TEN DAYS ago Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the flower of Germany's business and financial establishment, assembled in Frankfurt to watch Mr Hans Tietmeyer being anointed as the new chairman of the Bundesbank, that a 'stability-oriented' monetary policy was the best long-term guarantee for German growth and jobs. In the long-term, low inflation and a stable D-mark may indeed preserve the attractiveness of Standort Deutschland - Germany as a place to do business. But German industry, currently struggling amid the country's worst recession since the second world war, may be forgiven for judging high short-term interest-rates and a strong D-mark - the direct consequences of the Bundesbank's stability policy - as factors which diminish rather than enhance Germany's attractions as a business location. On the very day that Kohl was speaking in Frankfurt, newspapers carried the story of Daimler-Benz's decision to build a factory for its Mercedes-Benz automobile subsidiary in the town of Vance in Alabama in the south-east of the US. Following moves by other German companies to set up manufacturing facilties abroad, this came as a graphic reminder of the disadvantages of Germany as a business location. Taxes are high - taxes and social contribution levies are set to rise to a record 44 per cent of western German GDP by 1995, reflecting the planned introduction of a higher mineral oil tax, higher contributions to pensions insurance, a new solidarity levy, increased wealth tax. Wages are also high. The reunification of the two Germanies in 1990 brought about a boom for western German companies. Wages were increased as if these 'boomartig' conditions would carry on for ever: but the special economic circumstances brought about by reunification died away suddenly in the last half of 1993. The world recessionary cycle caught up with a vengeance and GDP for the west of the country will fall by 2.25 per cent this year - the worst recession in Germany's post-war history - 'there are not many things to make Germany attractive at present,' sums up Mr Joachim Fels, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt. ' Geographically the country is at the heart of the European Community and the new markets in eastern Europe. But against this you have to weigh the fact that costs are too high, in particular labour costs. 'German labour used to be highly productive, and the workforce remains highly educated and used to working in a high-tech manufacturing environment. But both direct labour costs and indirect labour costs - such as payroll taxes and social services contributions - are very high. Can productivity keep up with the rise in costs? The answer is no: unit labour costs are too high.' The cost of employing workers in Germany looks especially high when one takes into account the cost of labour in the fledgling democracies of eastern Europe. The quality of workmanship in Hungary or the former Czechoslovakia may not be up to Germany's fabled levels: but it does come considerably more cheaply. Goldman Sachs calculated in early 1992 it cost an average of DM6,575 to employ a worker in western Germany - compared to DM662 in Hungary, DM401 in the former Czechoslovakia and DM367 in Poland. TO illustrate what this means in practical terms, KPMG Management Consulting has put together a case study focussing on a proposed Pounds 100m project to build new television manufacturing facility. The company is seeking a greenfield site to build a modern factory which will produce 500,000 units a year and employ 1,225 people. Key criteria for chosing the investment location are costs; access to new growth markets - one of which is the east of germany - together with dependability of production and supply of components and sub-assembly. Initial calculations show that labour costs for the factory would amount to nearly Pounds 45m a year in Germany, Pounds 35m in the Netherlands, about Pounds 25m a year in the UK and Ireland and about Pounds 3m a year in Hungary. Set against this is the distance fron the manufacturing site to the companies main markets, weighted by market size. Taking the UK as 100, Hungary rates as 145 whilst Germany and France are at around 95. KPMG then assigned weightings to these and other criteria - the question of labour costs being five times more important than market proximity and research capability. Hungary emerges as nine times more attractive than the UK, its nearest competitor. Taking the UK as 100, Hungary achieves a score of 450. France and Ireland also score 100. Germany is the least attractive manufacturing location, with a score of about 70. A short-list of three locations is drawn up: Manchester in the UK, Dusseldorf in Germany and Budapest in Germany. At this stage the assessment of the relative merits of the three possible sites becomes more refined, taking into account qualitative factors such as sub-suppliers, working practices, productivity, health, unionisation, manufacturing's share of the country's GDP, as well as proximity to markets and research capability. It is clear that according to these qualitative considerations, Hungary is not as attractive as Germany or the UK. But factor in the costs and Germany remains the least attractive of the three: in pure profits terms KPMG calculates that the factory in Dusseldorf would make an annual after-tax return of Pounds 5.4m compared to Pounds 21.3m in the Manchester and Pounds 20.2m in Bundapest. If incentives were not available, the investment in Germany would yield a Pounds 7m loss, reduce the UK profits to Pounds 9m and barely change the Pounds 20m profit to be made in Hungary. European companies are making calculations such as these every single day of the week. Even allowing for qualitative factors, Germany looks unattractive. Recognising this, the German government has started to address the issue of German competitiveness, this autumn publishing a paper on securing the future of Germany's economic base. But the process of adjustment will be slow and, in the meantime, companies will chose to build their factories in Manchester or Budapest, rather than Dusseldorf. Or even go as far afield as Vance, Alabama.</p>

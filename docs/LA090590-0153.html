			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING: PENNEY'S ANTI-GUN DUDS A DUD  </P> <P> Boys clothes with an anti-hunting message have been pulled from J. C. Penney  store shelves because of hunters' complaints -- one of them from Michigan's  largest conservation and sportsmen's group.  </P> <P> Duncan Muir, public relations manager for the Dallas-based retailer, said the  decision was made after complaints from across the nation.  </P> <P> A card attached to each shirt in the clothing line shows a sketch of a bird  hunter aiming a shotgun over which a large red "X" has been marked. Under that  are the words: "Absolutely No Hunting of Wild and Free Animals While Wearing  This Garment."  </P> <P> Tags in the clothes indicate that they were made in Hong Kong.  </P></p>

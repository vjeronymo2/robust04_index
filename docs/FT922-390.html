			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Top-level coup in classic style: Bob Horton's departure from BP supports the view that non-executives can keep executives in check They were anxious to be gentlemanly about it,' says a British Petroleum official. The boardroom coup which ousted Robert Horton from the joint position of chairman and chief executive of BP on Thursday was indeed swift and relatively painless. The messy part came in a confrontation earlier this week. But once the news was broadcast to an astonished world, it was all over and the parties to it maintained a dignified silence. This was broken only by Lord Ashburton, the new chairman, who spoke of the board's 'great sadness' at Mr Horton's departure. Mr Horton spent yesterday at his Thamesside home in Oxfordshire. 'Life goes on,' he told the local newsagent when he slipped across the road to buy the newspapers with his name all over the front pages. The coup was also a classic display of the way the business establishment dispatches those who have outstayed their welcome. By showing that a board can bring down even a man who holds all the reins of power, it marks something of a triumph for corporate democracy. The intention, of course, was to do BP some good. But while that seemed to be the general expectation in the City yesterday, large questions about the future of the UK's leading, but financially stressed, company have still to be answered - hence the Pounds 1.8bn by which the market value of BP plummeted between breakfast and lunchtime yesterday. Mr Horton's downfall came as a total surprise, as much to senior people within the company as to outsiders. He had only been in the job since March 1990, and even though he made more enemies than friends with his high-handed manner and aggressive cost-cutting strategy, there were few signs of the pressures that were building up in the boardroom. It transpires that Lord Ashburton, better known as the City merchant banker Sir John Baring, and his non-executive board colleagues, had been nursing misgivings for some time. Not only was BP faring noticeably worse in the recession than its main competitors - profits were down 85 per cent last year - but Mr Horton's personal style was hitting morale and adding to the problems. The misgivings were strongest among the other business representatives on the board, people like Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman of BAT Industries, Dr Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen, and Charles Knight, chairman of the US company Emerson Electric. After sharing their concerns last week, they confronted Mr Horton at the beginning of this week. According to one account of the meeting, Mr Horton quickly understood that he was being given little choice, and offered to resign. His resignation was accepted at a full board meeting on Thursday afternoon. This was attended by the other seven executive directors - the heads of BP's various divisions - who all supported the changes and the new appointments. Although it was the non-executives who took the initiative on Horton's ouster, they seem to have had little trouble in getting the executives on side, a further indication of Horton's isolation. Lord Ashburton himself appears to have played the key role. Scion of the Baring family and former head of Barings merchant bank, he is a leading City figure and former director of the Bank of England. He is also the longest-serving BP non-executive director with 10 years on the board, which gives him considerable influence. His style is languid. But a banking colleague says: 'He has strong feelings about companies being run properly and effectively. He would be the sort of man to act in a situation like this. He has high standards.' The boardroom drama, rare in a UK blue chip company, would rank as a significant corporate event at the best of times. But it also comes at a moment when corporate governance is a fashionable topic, after the recent Cadbury Report on board accountability. The BP coup showed two things. It reinforces the view that non-executive directors can play a key role in keeping the executive directors in check. BP is particularly strong on non-executives. They are in the majority on the board by nine to eight, and only they sit on the board's auditing and compensation committees which oversee the accounts and directors' pay. It also bears out the Cadbury recommendation in favour of splitting the role of chairman and chief executive. Even though the British corporate tradition tends to separate them, the two positions have always been combined at BP. But Mr Horton's dominating style highlighted the dangers of concentration of power. In future BP is to have a non-executive chairman, Lord Ashburton, and a full-time chief executive, Mr David Simon, until now the chief operating officer. 'This creates a good balance,' said Mr Simon. 'My executives are fully in agreement that the change is appropriate.' But as well as providing for a more balanced distribution of power within the group, the changes are also intended to bring about a shift in style. Although people inside BP say that talk of Mr Horton's arrogant manner is overdone - he has often shown acts of great personal kindness - his evident enjoyment of power, his lack of tact and irritating name-dropping habit alienated many of his colleagues. Whether this was due to a supreme self-confidence or the exact opposite was a matter of debate within BP, but it led to much anti-Horton sniping, culminating in a famous spoof of an FT article, put together with evident relish on some internal BP desk-top printer, depicting Horton as a power-crazed eccentric. David Simon could hardly be more different. A quiet-spoken organisation man who lost out to Horton in the 1990 leadership stakes and operated in his shadow thereafter, he has never had a chance to show the full range of his leadership qualities. But insiders say that while he will be more user-friendly than Horton, he can be just as tough. The adjectives used to describe him are wily, subtle, diplomatic, and knowledgeable about the undercurrents of the British establishment, something for which Horton had little time. 'Simon knows all about dynamic positioning,' said an official, referring to the ultra-precise techniques used by floating oil rigs to adjust to ocean currents and winds, and stay stable in a storm. 'He has an ability to stay right over the hole. Horton had to be tethered down.' On a broader level, Simon's appointment may be welcomed. The removal of friction on the board should make it function more smoothly. He is widely approved of by the staff. And the City likes a financial man. But goodwill alone will not be enough to resolve BP's problems. These centre mainly on the group's high level of debt - the result of expensive acquisitions and a share buy-back in the 1980s - and a high cost structure. Ironically, the earlier success of its oil exploration activities has also tilted it towards oil production which makes it more vulnerable to changes in the oil price than companies which have a better balance between their production and retailing sides. The crucial question is whether the change of faces at the top will lead to changes in strategy - and the message from BP is no. The unpopular cost squeeze instituted by Mr Horton will go on, and so too presumably will the job cuts. The biggest uncertainty is in the stock market where BP's share price fell by 14 per cent yesterday on fears of a dividend cut and a possible Pounds 1bn-plus rights issue to ease the debt problem. Industry observers tended to dismiss the rights issue danger. Mr Paul Spedding at Kleinwort Benson Securities points out that for tax reasons, it is cheaper for BP to borrow money in the US than to raise more equity capital. 'It doesn't make sense,' he says. But they are more divided over the dividend. Under Horton, BP steadfastly refused to cut its pay-out even though it had to pay part of it out of reserves after the latest fall in profits. By halving the dividend BP could save itself several hundred million pounds a year, reduce its debt, and give itself a fresh start. A cut announced at the interim results in a month could also be blamed on this week's upheaval. BP's new chiefs are insisting that no changes in dividend policy have been decided. Simon himself is committed to not cutting the dividend. He told an analysts' meeting last September: 'We will not, save force majeure, cut our dividend. We have done it only once in our history and that was in the first world war.' What is more certain than dividend policy is another legacy of the Horton era. Simon sent out an internal statement yesterday to senior managers reaffirming the process of cultural change known as Project 1990, and laying stress on greater teamwork and openness. Project 1990 aimed to replace BP's bureaucratic 'command-&amp;-control' style of management with one based on a 'delayered' structure and a atmosphere of what Horton called 'openness, care, teamwork, empowerment and trust'. It is also understood that Simon stands by the proposed cuts in BP's corporate and business head offices, which are seen as an integral part of the group's existing strategy. Simon's fortunes will ultimately depend on the oil price. Horton told investors at the beginning of this year that all BP's businesses had been 'tested against Dollars 18 a barrel oil and found to be robust'. Since then a new spirit of co-operation within Opec has helped push the oil price up over Dollars 21 a barrel, which helps. The institutional view in BP is that the price should continue to rise in the long term, though not to dizzying heights. This suggests that this week's drama was only a prelude to better times at BP. 'We aim to be extremely competitive,' said Simon, 'but we're fighting a difficult market.'</p>

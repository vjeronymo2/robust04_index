			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cut in provisions and loan losses helps bolster BCI Net profit at Banca Commerciale Italiana edged up in the first half of 1994 to L151.3bn (Dollars 96.5m), against L149.1bn in the equivalent period, as the bank struggled against difficult trading conditions and narrowing interest margins. All Italian banks have been hit by the unfavourable environment, prompting a series of poor half-year results, particularly in comparison with a strong first half in 1993. BCI's net operating profit fell 43 per cent to L356bn. Net non-interest income was down to L651bn, against L783bn, and net interest income dropped to L1,281bn, against L1,404bn. Only reduced provisions and loan write-downs - down to L231bn against L274bn  -and a lighter tax burden allowed the bank to push up net profits. However, consolidated first-half net profits, declared for the first time this year, fell to L177.6bn from L185bn . However, BCI said it was well-placed to take advantage of any improvement inthe trading environment, and was continuing to put pressure on costs. Total deposits at BCI rose to L98,942bn, compared with L88,881bn at June 30 1993. Total funds under management, including deposits, stood at L245,000bn against L220,000bn. However, loans to customers shrank from L54,319bn to L49,117bn because of weak demand, while total loans rose to L86,929bn against L84,941bn at the end of the first half of last year. Last week, the bank completed a share issue which raised L1,575bn. The full conversion of the attached warrants would bring in a further L787bn before the end of next year. BCI was controlled by Iri, the Italian state holding company, until March, when the sale of the Iri stake raised some L2,700bn for the government. The announcement of a discounted issue of shares and warrants in May, so soon after the sell-off, was badly received by investors, but the share price has recovered. Yesterday it closed at L4,081, against an opening price of L3,977. The issue was priced at L3,000 a share and the privatisation price was L5,400.</p>

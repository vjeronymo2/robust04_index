			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The paper of Cong Giao Va Dan Toc [Catholicism and  People] issue No. 947 carried an interview with Prime Minister  Vo Van Kiet on a number of issues related to Catholicism in  Vietnam.    On the role of Catholics in Ho Chi Minh City, the prime  minister highly valued their patriotic spirit and dynamic  participation in the city's social programs. He stressed that  participation in activities that help construct the fatherland  is the responsibility and right of the Catholic people.    There are presently a number of issues remaining to be  settled between the Vietnamese Government and the Catholic  Church, such as the Vatican's appointment of the supervisor for  the Ho Chi Minh City diocese without any consultation with the  Vietnamese Government, and the Vatican's prohibition on priests  joining people-nominated agencies and the Solidarity Committee  of Vietnamese Catholics.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held that more effort was still  needed to settle issues caused by each side's lack of proper  understanding of the other. People in Ho Chi Minh City have  made considerable progress thanks to the implementation of a  freedom of religion policy and of the principle of harmonious  development between religious and secular activities, whereby  the contributions of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, the  Catholic Motivation Committee, the Solidarity Committee of  Catholics, and the Cong Giao Va Dan Toc Paper should be greatly  acknowledged.    The prime minister wished that there would be a succeeding  archbishop for Ho Chi Minh City who would not contradict the  lines of Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, the Solidarity Committee of  Catholics, and the Cong Giao Va Dan Toc Paper, and who would use  his role to better the contributions of the Catholics in Ho Chi  Minh City to the advancement of the people and prosperity of the  country, along with the harmonious development of religious  activities.</p>

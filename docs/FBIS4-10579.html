			<p>BFN     [Text] In addition to the political reasons of the  government majority in Congress for holding the 1995 general  elections with the electoral system established in the current  Constitution, there are concrete proposals of a technical nature  to prevent the new electoral institutions from falling into the  bureaucracy and slow procedures of the previous system.    For example, the National Election Board [JNE] will be  reduced from the current six administrative levels to only  three: National Board (five members); General Secretariat,  Internal Control, and Auditing (at the same level); and third  and last, Special Electoral Boards, Archives and Registry,  Public Relations, and General Services.    In other words, it will have seven sections that, according  to government bloc experts, will not need more than 30 employees.    It would be a National Election Board specialized in  electoral justice. It would only be a court.    The technical report says the JNE currently has more than  1,200 employees--without counting those on contract--and almost  half of them are here in Lima.    Regarding the National Electoral Process Office, ONPE, the  proposal for organizing this office has three levels: National  Headquarters; Planning and Organization, and Control and  Auditing; Decentralized Process Office, Information, General  Services, and Electoral Procedures, which would be in charge of  the systems, operations, and logistical offices.    The government experts said the ONPE should be a very small  institution that should not have more than 30 employees, but  temporary organizations with more employees can be established  during elections.    This office is the most complex of all to the point that the  Constitution itself says that the integration of all registries  of the country in a single office--which currently are in the  hands of the municipalities--will be made gradually.</p>

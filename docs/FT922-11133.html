			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / People: Bernays poached by Hill Samuel Richard Bernays, one of the top executives at Mercury Asset Management, has been poached by the TSB to be chief executive of its Hill Samuel Investment Management Group. Bernays, 49, replaces Neville Bowen, 56, who left earlier this year to head up Citibank Global Asset Management. HSIMG is one of Britain's largest fund managers with over Pounds 24bn under management or advice in a hotchpotch of investment businesses in the UK and overseas. Hill Samuel's investment performance has been improving; and Hill Samuel chief executive Hugh Freedberg says that profits on this side of the business have risen by 70 per cent over the past three years to Pounds 12.2m. However, it is still a very poor return for a group which has Pounds 24bn of funds under management and it is felt that HSIMG could benefit from a clearer sense of direction. Freedberg says that he has been looking for a 'blue chip name from a blue chip house', to head the operation for some time. Persuading Bernays to defect from Mercury Asset Management, where he is one of several vice-chairmen, is quite a coup for Freedberg. Mercury is the biggest and most successful of London's publicly-quoted fund managers and its top management team has been remarkably stable. However, James Dawnay, chairman of Mercury Fund Managers, left in November to join Martin Currie, and now Bernays, who has been with the group for 20 years, is on the move.</p>

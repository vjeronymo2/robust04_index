			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK savings In the unlikely event that the chancellor runs out of brainstorming material at Chevening this weekend, he could do worse than cast an eye over the Personal Equity Plan. Current rules are messy and penalise the less well off. Reform proposals have been coming thick and fast. Proshare, which exists to promote wider share ownership, is pressing for a rolling eight-year contribution limit of Pounds 80,000, to replace the Pounds 9,000 annual limit. That would allow recipients of a lump sum to invest immediately in equities. Given the size of the public sector borrowing requirement next year, Mr Lamont might prefer to see redundancy pay invested in gilts. The Unit Trust Association would like the PEP widened to cover corporate bonds and gilts. That might help fund the PSBR - as well as allowing unit trust companies to sell bond funds under the PEP umbrella. The idea appeals to corporate treasurers: simplified tax-exempt status for corporate bonds might give the domestic bond market a lift. But why stop at equities and bonds? The Institute for Fiscal Studies - which has no particular axe to grind - has suggested extending PEPs to cover all forms of financial asset, including cash deposits. The tax shelter would then cover savers who keep spare cash on deposit - typically the least well-off. That might be one for the chancellor to consider seriously - as long as he can overcome any distaste for a measure which would increase saving rather than spending.</p>

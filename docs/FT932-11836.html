			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Johannesburg golds up 7.5% GOLD shares continued to be driven by a higher bullion price, leaving a rise in the share index of 104, or 7.5 per cent, at 1,497, write Philip Gawith in Johannesburg and John Pitt in London. Demand has been coming from overseas, particularly the US and Europe, with investors attracted by high dividend yields. Since the beginning of the year the index has gained 47 per cent. Mr Dave Giese, gold analyst at Davis Borkum Hare, noted that in rand terms the price has gone to levels it has never reached before. Following severe cost-cutting programmes over the last three years, most South African mines were 'lean and mean'. Another analyst cautioned that buying was speculative, with highly geared marginal mines doing better than heavyweights.</p>

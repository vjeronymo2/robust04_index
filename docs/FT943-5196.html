			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (6): Unlimited cover is on the way out  -Claire Wilkinson discusses the forthcoming changes in reinsurance of UK employers' liability From the beginning of next year reinsurers plan to introduce limits on all employers' liability contracts, restricting cover to between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m per policy. For UK employers, by law required to purchase a minimum of Pounds 2m indemnity, these restrictions spell the end of unlimited cover. Increasing exposures to catastrophic liability claims, combined with a rise in occupational disease claims, have led reinsurers to make the break from tradition. The Association of British Insurers (ABI), estimates that employers' liability insurers, excluding Lloyd's, paid out claims of Pounds 541m in 1992, compared with Pounds 430m in 1988. 'Over the last few years the market generally for reinsurers has been hit by all sorts of losses so we have been trying to make our business more controllable. We certainly have not been making enough profits to justify continuing to offer unlimited cover,' says Stephen Riley, deputy general manager (non-life) at Swiss Re (UK). The 1988 disaster on the North Sea's Piper Alpha oil rig cost the market an estimated Pounds 120m and induced reinsurers to reconsider the issue of unlimited cover. Stephen Riley explains: 'the Piper Alpha loss gave force to the worries that there was potential for a large industrial accident to occur affecting large numbers of people and for there to be a mega claim. Frankly, the premium basis we were operating on was not sufficient to cover that claims exposure.' In the wake of Piper Alpha, the reinsurance industry imposed treaty restrictions, leading most insurers to exclude offshore exposures, or limit their liability to Pounds 2m per occurrence. Accidents apart, the growth of occupational diseases such as deafness and asbestosis has placed further pressure on the employers' liability market. Emerging diseases such as repetitive strain injury (RSI) have also contributed to the rise in claims. According to ABI estimates, industrial diseases now account for about 50 per cent of total employers' liability claims, compared to under 20 per cent some 10 years ago. While individual disease claims tend to be relatively low, liability is spread over many years, making it difficult for insurers to predict future claims. 'The problem is that you've got large numbers of people involved and the time lag between first exposure, manifestation and settlement of the claim can be 25-40 years,' says Stephen Riley. Reinsurers are not so exposed to the occupational disease problem, however. 'We don't have a major back-year problem on UK employers' liability, but it has to be said that employers' liability is not a profitable class of business,' he says. According to David Thomas, executive director, Willis Corroon London, the typical employer liability claims experience can take up to nine years to run off. 'For a risk insured in 1994, for example, it may be 2003 before all claims are paid and outstandings reduced to zero,' he says. Lack of profits and high exposure to long-tail risks has driven both insurers and reinsurers from the market in recent years. In 1993, two major players in the unlimited liability reinsurance market, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep (NRG), and NW Reinsurance Corp, ceased underwriting. According to Stephen Riley, their withdrawal increased the likelihood that there would be no further cover available or that many companies would have difficulty in placing unlimited reinsurance. At the same time insurers have been questioning their commitment to provide employers' liability insurance. 'It now appears that 80 per cent of employers insurance measured in premium terms is written by only eight insurers. Of these eight, three control something like 40 per cent of the market,' says David Thomas. Contraction in cover and impending limits on exposures will undoubtedly lead employers to seek protection outside the conventions of the commercial reinsurance market. Increasing levels of self-insurance and formation of captives are likely alternatives. But are reinsurers concerned about the potential competition posed by insureds? 'No captive or mutual is going to be able to retain all that risk unless it is very well capitalised. From our point of view, I don't see it as a major threat,' says Stephen Riley. Others view the competition as more of a challenge, as Ian Sinclair, managing director, underwriting, at Unionamerica Insurance Co, says: 'obviously we make our living by writing insurance and reinsurance. If our own insureds are trying to compete with us, that is not a very easy pill for us to swallow.' According to employers' liability reinsurers, the introduction of limits will enable them to gauge their future liabilities more accurately and ultimately to offer more capacity in the market. As Stephen Riley says: 'placing limits on it will certainly lead to more accurate assessment of the price that ought to be charged. In the long term if we all feel more comfortable about it, we will be able to offer more capacity to our clients.' It is also hoped the restrictions on cover may coax employers to take more preventive measures to limit their own exposures, in turn reducing the level of claims. 'Employers must recognise that the only way to control the cost of employer liability insurance is to control the cost of claims. Risk management is the key issue both for insurers and the insured,' says David Thomas. Claire Wilkinson is a writer on the Financial Times newsletter World Insurance Report</p>

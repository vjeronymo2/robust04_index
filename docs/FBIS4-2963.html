			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Yu Xiaodong, 29, quit  his job as a lawyer at the state-run Guizhou Economic Law Firm  in southwest China to set up a private law office.    The Huaxia Law Office was set up with 120,000 yuan (14,900  U.S. dollars) in investment provided by Yu and his two partners.    It has hired eight other lawyers and experts in finance,  real  estate and securities as consultants.    The Huaxia Law Office is only one among the burgeoning non-  governmental law firms in China, a major change from the past,  when all the lawyers were on the government pay-roll and called  "state legal workers".    The latest statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that  there were 502 non-governmental law firms in the country by the  end of 1993, two and a half times the number in 1992 or 10  percent of all the law firms in China.    This is part of a reform package to change the existing  lawyer system, "to serve the nation's drive for a market economy  and establishment of a democratic legal system," said Gan Jihua,  vice- chairman of the All-China Lawyers Association.    The non-state law offices include co-operative and  partnership and other forms of firms, he said, adding that the  state firms are still necessary, especially in less-developed  regions.    As a result of reforms since last June, China has witnessed  remarkable progress in the number of lawyers and law offices,  and their services to society, Gan said.    By the end of 1993 there were 66,700 lawyers, working as  permanent legal consultants for 185,800 government agencies,  enterprises and individuals.    They handled 483,300 domestic civil, commercial and criminal  cases in 1993, and 18,400 cases with foreign interests involved  -- 21.5 and 25.2 percent up respectively over the previous year.    Another reform measure was a decision to allow compatriots  of  Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to take the examination for the  lawyer's certificate on the mainland.    The Ministry of Justice also ratified applications by 41  overseas law firms to establish branches in China. Some 200  others are waiting to be approved, Gan disclosed. The Junhe Law  Firm in Beijing opened China's first overseas law firm branch  last August. China promulgated the "professional ethical code  for lawyers" at the end of last year. The country's lawyers'  law is still in the making, and is expected to be issued next  year. Gan said the draft has been revised 11 times. It will be  submitted to the State Council for discussion this year.    He said China's law industry still lags behind those in the  developed countries. For instance, the number of lawyers in  China accounts for 0.06 per thousand, while the rate in the U.S.  is three per thousand.    Minister of Justice Xiao Yang said that the country will  need  75,000 lawyers in 1997, and 150,000 by the year 2000.</p>

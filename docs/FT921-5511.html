			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Hyundai tenders for HK bridge THE Hong Kong government is expected to decide next week whether to allow a very low tender from less-experienced South Korean contractors to be short-listed to bid for a contract to build the world's second largest, single-span, suspension bridge. The contract to build the Tsing Ma Bridge, part of Hong Kong's HKDollars 98.6bn (Pounds 7.2bn) airport project, has prompted bids from European, Japanese and South Korean companies. Hyundai, Korea's second largest conglomerate, has bid HKDollars 2bn (Pounds 150m) less than the second lowest bid to build the crossing. The group, a big international contractor, has no experience of building a large suspension bridge. Hong Kong authorities, though tempted by the low price, are understood to have reservations about the group's technical expertise in suspension bridge construction on this scale. In an attempt to overcome these reservations, Hyundai has approached several large international engineering groups, including UK and Japanese companies, to see if a joint bid could be made. The Tsing Ma bridge will be the first large contract to be let under the airport project. The Hong Kong government, which is funding the bridge and other works, has been anxious to generate keen price competition. Rival bidders accept that it would be very difficult, if the Korean bid is shortlisted, for the authorities to choose another scheme. Hence the importance being attached to the tender review board's decision on which of four remaining bids will be allowed to proceed for final consideration. Hyundai, according to its rivals, has bid HKDollars 5.5bn (Pounds 400m) for the contract. The second lowest bid is understood to come from an Anglo-Japanese consortium of Trafalgar House and Costain of the UK and Mitsui of Japan, believed to have bid about HKDollars 7.5bn. There are two other bidders: an international consortium including Bouygues and Dragages of France and Hochtief of Germany, understood to have bid HKDollars 8bn, and a Japanese consortium including Nippon Steel, Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi and C Itoh, understood to have bid about HKDollars 10bn. The all-Japanese bid is not expected to make the short-list, leaving the battle for places to the three remaining groups. These could be reduced to two when the short list is decided.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MSL NOTEBOOK / JOHN GEIS;  </P> <P> SOCKERS DUO WORKING WITH USSF ON WORLD CUP  </P> <P> The United States Soccer Federation has recruited two members of the San Diego  Socker hierarchy to aid this country's preparation for the 1994 World Cup.  </P> <P> Sockers Coach Ron Newman will serve on the coaching committee, and Randy  Bernstein, the club's vice-president, will sit on the finance/resource  development committee.  </P> <P> The coaching committee had its first conference call Tuesday. Newman is the  only representative from the professional ranks.  </P> <P> "The big thing," Newman said, "is I and our league are being recognized as part  and parcel of soccer in this country. In the past it was 'Oh, they're from that  indoor league.' We weren't associated with (the USSF). It got to be very much  college-oriented."  </P> <P> The coaching committee will be in charge of reviewing and establishing  licensing requirements and curriculum.  </P> <P> The finance committee is scheduled to meet for the first time in January. Its  prime focus will be on marketing.  </P> <P> "I feel good about having input," Bernstein said, "because I think I have a  feel for the buying habits of both the public and of commercial sponsors."  </P> <P> Bernstein worked with USSF President Alan Rothenberg when both were with the  NBA Clippers in the early 1980s. The two remain friends, and during the summer  Bernstein helped persuade Major Soccer League owners to give the USSF new  direction by voting out former President Werner Fricker in favor of Rothenberg.  </P> <P> While Newman is excited about taking part in the development of outdoor soccer,  he is also upbeat about a development that is occuring in the indoor game: MSL  teams are playing overseas exhibitions.  </P> <P> Actually, when Baltimore on Tuesday defeated Oldham Athletic, 6-1, in  Manchester, England, it was bittersweet for Newman.  </P> <P> He says the eight-time champions should have a chance to trumpet the sport.  </P> <P> Newman spent last year trying to get in touch with Andy Williams, an English  Football League official who helped arrange Baltimore's trip.  </P> <P> "I called him, sent letters to him, talked to his secretary, but he never got  back to me," Newman said. "Now that the Blast beat Oldham, I'll have to write  to him and tell him, 'Good thing you didn't get the champions over there.' "  </P> <P> Newman is also somewhat bitter that St. Louis was chosen over the Sockers to go  to Zurich, Switzerland, for a FIFA-sponsored indoor tournament in early  January. FIFA is footing St. Louis' bill.  </P> <P> The Storm was picked, Newman said, because owner Milan Mandaric last year tried  to arrange a European trip for his club that was thwarted by Commissioner Earl  Foreman because of scheduling problems.  </P> <P> Newman believes that Foreman made it up to Mandaric by selecting St. Louis for  the Swiss tournament. Mandaric did not deny that.  </P> <P> "Before I even came into the league, I told Earl I had interest in playing in  one of the European tournaments," Mandaric said. "And I tried to get something  done last year, but couldn't because of scheduling difficulties.  </P> <P> "So when this came up this year, my desire was known."  </P> <P> Still, Newman is unhappy about the arrangement.  </P> <P> "That really ticks me off," he said. "I thought it was a little unfair. There  have been a few teams, Dallas, Baltimore and us, that have been trying really  hard to take trips to Europe. We've been doing it quietly, and we didn't go  through the commissioner.  </P> <P> "I just want to take our team to Europe. We've made this game a science, and  we're put down all over Europe. I just wanted to go over there and kick some  butt."  </P> <P> Europe may not be the only destination of MSL teams this year. Dallas has been  invited to Japan, and Newman is working on a home-and-away series between the  Sockers and a Mexican club.  </P> <P> Newman said he has been asked to conduct a seminar in Mexico City for 150  teams. The seminar, originally scheduled for earlier this month, has been  postponed until the middle of January.  </P> <P> When and if he does make it down there, Newman said he will attempt to arrange  the exhibitions.  </P> <P> "I don't see why we can't do a swap," Newman said. "We'll play down there, and  they'll play up here."  </P> <P> A league source said Baltimore has signed national team goalie Tony Meola.  </P> <P> Meola, who became the hero of an impotent U.S. team during World Cup qualifying  last year and led it to the finals in Italy, had been playing with Watford  (England), a last-place second division team which likely will drop down to the  third division next season.  </P> <P> Blast officials could not be reached in England, but a USSF spokesman said  Meola has been released by Watford.  </P> <P> Another league source said that the Blast earlier this season arranged a deal  with Meola, but could not work out a loan agreement with the USSF. Meola is  under contract to the USSF's national team until Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The Sockers made a goaltender move of their own Wednesday, releasing  developmental player Chris Wilson and signing Savva Biller to a developmental  contract.  </P> <P> Biller has no indoor experience, but Newman called him a natural goalkeeper. He  spent six months recently training in England with Peter Shelton, considered  one of the top goalies in the world.  </P></p>

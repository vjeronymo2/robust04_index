He said Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda  met with Israeli Ambassador to Japan Amos Ganor at the Foreign  Ministry and reiterated a statement issued Saturday by ministry  spokesman Terusuke Terada.    Fukuda urged Israel to take measures to help ensure the  creation of a trusting relationship with the Palestinians, Saito  said.    The Japanese Government will also convey the statement to  the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Governments of  Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and tell them of the meeting between  Fukuda and the Israeli ambassador, he said.    As many as 39 Muslim worshipers were killed and many more  wounded when a Jewish settler armed with an automatic weapon  entered the West Bank mosque on Friday and opened fire.    The ministry spokesman's statement said Japan "strongly  condemns" the act of violence and hopes it will not have a  negative effect on the current negotiations between Israel and  the Palestinians over the withdrawal of Israeli military forces  from Gaza and Jerico. It also said Tokyo strongly hopes that  despite the massacre, not only those parties directly involved  in negotiations but all Israelis and Palestinians will exercise  restraint and continue to work toward peace.</p>

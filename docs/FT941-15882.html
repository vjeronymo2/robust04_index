			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Investment for Vietnam Vietnam approved foreign investment projects worth Dollars 2.86bn (Pounds 1.9bn) last year, a rise of 47 per cent over 1992, the government media said yesterday. The ruling Communist party has been liberalising the economy for the past five years, and the country has attracted numerous foreign companies from Asia and further afield. Investment approvals amount to Dollars 7.5bn since 1987; Taiwan, prominent in the clothing industry, is the biggest investor with Dollars 1.5bn of projects approved so far. Doing business in Vietnam has proved difficult, however, and the total value of projects actually implemented is only about Dollars 2bn, with oil exploration accounting for much of the money spent. Investors complain about bureaucracy, corruption and the poor state of Vietnam's transport and communications. They are also concerned about the inadequacy of the legal system, although the government is attempting to alleviate this problem by enacting the sort of new legislation needed to regulate a market economy. The national assembly recently passed laws on bankruptcy, the establishment of economic tribunals to adjudicate in commercial disputes, and for environmental protection. The liberalisation of the economy has created strains among party leaders, with some calling for faster reforms and others lamenting the greed and corruption rampant in the new Vietnam. A special party conference next week is expected to discuss economic reform and the party's future.</p>

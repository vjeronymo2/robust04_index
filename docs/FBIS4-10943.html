			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sonia Moraes] </F>   [Text] The strike by the metalworkers of the Sao Paulo  industrial belt could spread, as of tomorrow, to the factories  for machines and electrical and electronic equipment. After  failing to reach an agreement at a conciliation meeting at the  Regional Labor Court (TRT) yesterday, the sector held a meeting  and decided to continue with the stoppage and expand it. The  measure is already affecting 12,500 workers of the sector.    According to the Diadema Metalworkers' Union, five more  enterprises will be paralyzed as of tomorrow, among them Kepler  Weber, which produces heaters. The TRT will make a decision on  the strike on Tuesday. Representatives of the enterprises  producing capital goods and electric and electronic equipment  claim that sales in the sector have not yet improved, as they  have in the automobile sector, and that enterprises cannot pay  the 19 percent salary increase paid by car manufacturers. The  workers, however, rejected the 4 percent readjustment offered by  the enterprises.    The strike began to lose strength in other sectors. Among  car  manufacturers, only Scania and Mercedes remain paralyzed. To  return to their jobs the employees of the two enterprises want  to agree on new contract terms in their collective bargaining  negotiations. "We want a clause establishing at least the  gradual reduction of the labor day," Jeferson Gaule Sampaio, of  the Mercedes factory commission, said.</p>

In a statement, a copy of which was obtained by KUNA, the  source added that the Interior Ministry granted residence  permits to a large number of Arab nationals including subjects  from the adversary states. It also added that the statements  made by that paper were absolutely untrue.    The source also denied that any official had made a  statement  in this regard and pointed out that those nationals enjoyed all  the rights and privileges that other people coming to Kuwait  have in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in the  country.    The source concluded its statement by stressing that despite  the continuation of severance of relations with those states,  the concerned bodies at the Interior Ministry were carrying out  all dealings concerning those nationals without any exceptional  measures.    Last Sunday, a local paper published a statement it  attributed to "a responsible source at the Interior Ministry"  according to which the ministry would not allow the nationals of  adversary countries to enter the country even if diplomatic  relations were resumed with those countries.</p>

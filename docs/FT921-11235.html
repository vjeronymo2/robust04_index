			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Wine: Sending wines to France - Jancis Robinson uncovers a plot to get the French drinking Napa and Coonawarra WHY IS the fine wine market like the M25 on a Friday night? Because, as one merchant put it last week: 'It's just completely blocked.' There may be some takers for the oceans of good red bordeaux available at the moment, but the red burgundy market has always been almost too complicated to contemplate, and never more so than now with negociants (merchants) such as Louis Latour and Drouhin discounting while others dither on the sidelines. Only futures in 1990s seem to be eliciting much interest, perhaps mainly from those who know they will not be buying futures in 1991 bordeaux. London's burgundy specialists are reacting in very different ways to this impasse. Anthony Hanson, of Haynes Hanson &amp; Clark, SW6, is taking time off selling to write a second edition of his controversial and much-needed book Burgundy. Jasper Morris, of Morris &amp; Verdin, SW1, has bought a house in Burgundy, the better to observe the machinations of what has been, until the market standstill finally persuaded them otherwise, France's most introvert wine region. Graham Chidgey, of Laytons, NW1, has diverted his energies more radically by finding mature Moldavian bargains for his new Russian Wine Company in W1. While Howard Ripley, of N21, always had his dental practice to keep him busy. But perhaps the most interesting diversion from the fruitless business of selling top quality burgundy to the British is what Simon Taylor-Gill of Domaine Direct, WC1, is up to: trying to sell top quality New World wines to the French. Certainly, it will not be easy. The French market has its own blocage problems, with fine wine bought cheaply flooding in to the supermarkets. But if anyone manages the impossible task of persuading the country that invented chauvinism to at least list the odd bottle from Australia, California and New Zealand, it may well be Taylor-Gill. Although he could not sound more Oxford to the English - in fact he always gives the impression of being in a great hurry to go and give a lecture - he was born in Australia and was taught French at the university between 1975 and 1978. He has spent much of his subsequent working life in France. Often calling himself plain Simon Taylor - 'as a teacher I find it easier not to present stuff you know they won't get right' - he has divided his French time between setting up tertiary education programmes in Paris and sniffing out the best wines in Burgundy, where he spends a week a month. He and his partner, Hilary Gibbs, founded Domaine Direct in 1981 to ship wine from small domaines in Burgundy to Britain because this negociant-busting activity seemed to fit in well with his trans-Channel life. 'I never set out to be a wine merchant - in fact if challenged it would be quite difficult to get that information out of me at a party,' he says defensively. But his donnish manner, intimate acquaintance with the wines he sells and insistence on such frills as refrigerated transport from Beaune to London for these particularly fragile wines, has steadily built them an enviable list of clients. Restaurants account for about three-quarters of their business and the Domaine Direct laser printer is now responsible for the layout, if not total content, of an impressive geographical spread of restaurant wine lists around Britain. There is a small problem, however. Even Taylor-Gill admits that he only drinks these lovely red burgundies on special occasions ('God, I do hope you don't quote me too closely on this') an economy measure reflected up and down the land. 'We would probably have been much better off just sitting in Jersey broking the stuff,' he admits. 'No we haven't made money - but we do know lots of nice restaurateurs.' Hence the emergence of Domaine Direct Distribution. Its immediate task is to persuade the better restaurants in France, and eventually beyond, that their wine lists are incomplete without some representation from the best New World upstarts. A first tryout in Lorraine in northern France was a wow, except that, blind, the assembled French company preferred Domaine Direct's Western Australian Chardonnay from Leeuwin Estate to some of their own white burgundies. The new company's Paris debut was a much more severe test - no French wines for comparison - with 50 top tasters from the Association des Sommeliers de Paris, including representatives from the Grand Vefour, Hediard and Fauchon. It is typical of Taylor-Gill that what really excited him about this event was not whether his wines went down well, but that from various members of the assembled French wine experts he heard 'four near-perfect tasting notes  -England doesn't prepare you for people who can give you a perfect food and wine match on the hoof either.' Jean Frambourt, association president, said politely that these ten alien bottles clearly contained wines of quality that had been made with a 'different approach' to the French one. Taylor-Gill admits that they found the whites in particular too sweet and too heavily stylised to suit the (anglophone) market instead of being, as a French wine is, made to express their appellation, their exact provenance. It is clearly going to be an uphill struggle. Tim Johnston and Mark Williamson of the famous Willi's Wine Bar have sold two bottles of their Rutherford Hill Cabernet Sauvignon 1986 in two years. The most energetic California exporter Robert Mondavi may have listings in France but they tend to be of the Hilton at Orly Sud variety. There are signs of some success already, however, even if they are probably the result of Taylor-Gill's brand of intellectual bullying on those he knows best in French restauration: you can now find the great Australian, Penfolds Grange, at two restaurants in Burgundy, and other New World wines via DDD at establishments in Alsace-Lorraine and St Etienne. After Paris, Lyon and Nice are Taylor-Gill's next targets, but he knows that this coals to Newcastle exercise has its limits. He is not even going to invest the air fare on a sales trip to Bordeaux.

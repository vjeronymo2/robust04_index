			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Defence of the realm TENNIS lessons. Chess lessons. My life at present is a whirlwind of instruction. Yesterday it was a chess lesson, one of a series that I and two friends are having to prepare ourselves for the Nigel Short-Gary Kasparov world chess tussle in London in September. The two friends are: John Major, prime minister of Britain, and Queen Elizabeth II, head of the House of Windsor. Our instructor is Nigel Short himself. We meet in utmost secrecy. Unusually, the Queen was accompanied by the Seven Dwarfs, her seven Welsh corgis, who are notorious, at Buckingham Palace, for savaging the flunkies. But the Queen soon settled them. Before the lesson started she produced seven silver bowls into which she spooned caviar. The dwarfs gobbled it greedily and collapsed in a malevolent heap. 'That's put paid to them,' she said. 'Nigel - let us start. One must get away on time. There are more ructions brewing - more media allegations. Where will it all end? Not that one isn't inured. No es para tanto.' 'Right-ho,' said Nigel, whose own mental and physical preparation for his match against Kasparov the barbarian is proceeding smoothly. 'Today I thought we'd study sacrificial play in the middle-game, especially sacrificial play aimed at destroying our opponent's defensive structure. Remember my golden rule: before launching any sort of attack, sacrificial or otherwise, always count the number of pieces you will be attacking with and try to ensure it exceeds the number of pieces your opponent will be defending with.' Nigel said he would show us a game he played against Agdestein in 1987, involving the Greek bishop sacrifice. With grandmasterly finesse he set up the pieces and moved them at great speed, so that all we could see was a blur of pawns and bishops and cleverly skulking knights. 'Right,' said Nigel. 'This brings us to move 14. From here, play went: 14, Bxh7+, Kxh7; 15, Ng5+, Kg8; 16, Qd3, Rfe8. So how did play continue?' John Major wriggled and frowned. 'I must say, Nigel,' he said, 'that sacrificial play leaves me with feelings of considerable unease. It does not seem logical to throw away a perfectly stalwart piece when you are doing jolly well anyway and embark upon a course of action that is little short of reckless. It reminds me of politics. I am being urged at the present time to sacrifice Norman Lamont, my chancellor of the exchequer. But as Michael has pointed out, alone among his colleagues, Norman is a hero, a man of considerable stature. Why should I cast him out?' The Queen trilled with merriment. 'In one's own line of business,' she said, 'one gets accustomed to stratagems, especially mid-game sacrifices. You work to five-year terms. A monarch thinks in centuries. Qui non proficit deficit. Anyway, the answer to Nigel's little teaser is strikingly obvious. What follows must be: 17, Qh7+, Kf8; 18, f5] . . . ' 'Absolutely brill,' said Nigel. 'Exactly how it happened. Then I put the boot in. It was completely open house.' 'Nigel]' exclaimed the Queen. 'One wishes you hadn't said that. Completely open house. That is one's current strategem, one's sop to the anti-monarchists, but one would rather you didn't remind one. Can you imagine the mess and noise when Buckingham Palace is thrown open to the populace this summer? One is dreading it entirely. And what will they be gawking at? Just a load of art works, mainly dusty pictures. One is sending the dwarfs to Scotland. They are liable to go berserk.' I had been quiet until now, but I could not resist the opening. I said: 'I agree with the character in Barry Unsworth's novel, Stone Virgin, who says, in all seriousness, that great works of art are more important than people - that life can spawn more life, but that you can't spawn Gothic Madonnas. 'Look at the floods in Venice in 1966, which triggered off countless restoration projects and set the money flowing. 'If it hadn't been Venice,' says this character, 'if there had only been people to worry about, what would anyone have done? I'll tell you. They would have sent a few food parcels and forgotten all about it'.' The Queen smiled. She said: 'Michael does go on.' She revived the dwarfs with smelling salts and telephoned for her car and detective. The rest of us did the same. So ended our second lesson.</p>

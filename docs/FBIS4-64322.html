			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egon Klepsch, president of the European </F> Parliament, by Helmut Weixler; place and date not given: "More  Than 280 Votes in Favor"]    [Text] [Weixler] Mr. President, next Wednesday [4 May]  the European Parliament [EP] will take the historic vote on  enlarging the European Union [EU] with Austria and three  Scandinavian states. The vote might be a very narrow one. Some  people doubt that enough of the 518 deputies will come to  Strasbourg.    [Klepsch] I think this is a fairy tale. So far, there have  been far more deputies present in each plenary week than are  necessary for such a vote. I do not see why this should be  different this week, unless there are deputies who are present  but do not want to participate in the vote for political reasons  and intend to block the accession of these countries in this way.    [Weixler] It is assumed that the southern countries, in  particular, might express their displeasure about enlargement.    [Klepsch] I do not get this impression from the southern  countries to such an extent. I think that it is rather  colleagues from the Netherlands, France, and Belgium who think  that the concessions, which the Council has so far made  concerning the deepening of the EU are insufficient.    [Weixler] Will their abstention endanger a favorable vote?    [Klepsch] A total of 259 votes in favor must be achieved.  If someone does not want to vote in favor, he can do three  things: be present and vote against, be present and abstain  from voting, or not participate in the vote at all.    [Weixler] Perhaps the vote will not be taken at all. Some  members of the Parliament, such as the Greens, want to postpone  the vote. The Institutional Committee of the EP has also  applied to assign the vote to the next parliament.    [Klepsch] The parliamentary groups have decided to hold the  vote on 4 May. However, standing orders permit bringing a  motion at any time to suspend or postpone a vote. We have  agreed to have this done shortly before the final vote.    [Weixler] This means tension until Wednesday at 1700. If  the vote is taken, it does not mean that agreement on  enlargement is ensured.    [Klepsch] There were some conditions that the Parliament  wanted to have clarified before the vote, and this clarification  has largely taken place. The first condition was that the  entire text of the treaty must be available in all the languages  of the EU in time -- that is, by mid-April at the latest -- so  that that committees have the opportunity to examine it in  detail.    [Weixler] Some deputies are very annoyed that the text of  the treaty was pushed through in two weeks.    [Klepsch] This may be, but the Council did keep its word.  The second question is the assessment of the compromise  achieved in Ioannina on the future blocking minority and the  qualified majority. There I must say that in Ioannina the  foreign ministers actually decided to set down what was desired  by the Parliament. There is only one ambiguity on one point,  namely that there may be certain delays concerning votes in the  Council. However, this is a normal practice of the Council, one  that we already have at the moment.    [Weixler] Has the Ioannina compromise been sufficiently  clarified to make the members of the Parliament agree?    [Klepsch] There are certainly some who do not think that  this has been sufficiently clarified, but I personally think  that it is all right. The third question was the preparation of  the revision conference in 1996, at which the great reform of  the EU institutions is to be started. In this connection, it  was set down in Ioannina that the Parliament is to be involved.  The detailed conditions still have to be negotiated.    [Weixler] The French do not seem to be particularly happy  about the increasing superiority of Germany in the EU. In  connection with Austria, there is still the specter of the  "German bloc" haunting the discussions. Do these fears also  play a role for the French behavior at the vote?    [Klepsch] I do not believe so. Because, luckily, our  Parliament has been divided along political lines and not along  nations; otherwise it would never have worked. And the central  problem in voting is always to which line one belongs and not to  which nationality. A greater difficulty seems to be that some  smaller nations are examining very carefully to what extent the  key positions that they have had so far will be weakened by  enlargement.    [Weixler] Some countries are grumbling that the would-be  members were granted too many concessions at the negotiations.  Did the EU permit itself to be overpowered by the would-be  members?    [Klepsch] I think that the result of the negotiations was  balanced and that it is approved of by the great majority of the  Parliament.    [Weixler] What result do you expect of the vote?    [Klepsch] A sufficient one.    [Weixler] A little more specific, please: 259 in favor, or  280, or how many?    [Klepsch] More than 280.    [Weixler] If we theoretically supposed that the vote ended  in a "no," what would happen then?    [Klepsch] Then the whole matter would have to be sent back  and new negotiations might have to take place.    [Weixler] But that would delay membership by years.    [Klepsch] Not necessarily by years, but it would certainly  mean a delay. One must see that we already have a delay now,  because the negotiators on both sides, the Council and the  would-be members, did not stick to the original date of 31  December 1993. Thus we are now five months late.    [Weixler] Does the fact that they will find valuable allies  in the new member countries in some fields promote enthusiasm  for enlargement on the part of European members of parliament?    [Klepsch] We proceed form this premise. I also believe that  the new member countries will strengthen transparency and  democracy. All the would-be member countries have a stable  democratic structure, a stable economic development, and are  good models of liberal rule-of-law states. This will strengthen  the central structure of the EU.    [Weixler] Since the Maastricht Treaty the Parliament has  more power than ever, but it seems that the European people  still think of it as a debating club, which basically has  nothing to say. How do you want to change this image?    [Klepsch] This image is completely unjustified. I do not  know any parliament that works more than the European  Parliament. For instance, the Parliament is not to be blamed  because the association treaties with Poland and Hungary took  more than two years to be ratified. We ratified them  immediately, but the national parliaments took their time. By  the way, the same might also happen with the ratification of the  membership treaties.    [Weixler] This might also take two years?    [Klepsch] I hope not, but that depends on the national  parliaments.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 6 (AFP) -- UN commander General  Michael Rose has cancelled a scheduled visit to the Moslem-held  eastern enclave of Goradze where a Serb offensive is under way,  UN spokesman Major Rob Annink said.    Annink said the visit had been called off because Serb  military chiefs had agreed to hold peace talks on Wednesday  afternoon [6 April] at Sarajevo airport.    The commander in chief of the Bosnian Serbs, Ratko Mladic,  was to meet with his opposite number in the Bosnian Moslem Army,  Rasim Delic, Annink said.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Water links to exploit US privatisation ANGLIAN WATER is to form a joint venture with American Water Works, the largest water utility in North America outside government hands, to exploit privatisation of municipal waste water services in the US. The move follows establishment of a similar venture between Yorkshire Water and an Indianapolis-based water company. Both joint ventures have begun the process of tendering to operate two large waste water, or sewage plants, for the municipality of Indianapolis. Together with Lyonnais des Eaux-Dumez and Generale des Eaux, the two French groups which are also tendering, the European water companies are exploiting an opportunity that has arisen since the US Environment Protection Agency decided to experiment with limited privatisation. The European water industry believes it is significantly more efficient at running sewage plants than the US municipalities have proved to be. One UK industry estimate suggests the Indianapolis plants could be operated with half their current staff levels. If the limited experiment with privatisation is rolled out to other US cities, European water companies could be well positioned to carve out a significant market share, UK industry executives said. Initially, the US municipalities will be seeking tenders to operate their plant. Full privatisation will have to wait longer. Federal law currently prevents the sale of assets, like many of the municipal water treatment plants, that were built with substantial Federal grant assistance. Mr Chris Mellor, finance director of Anglian, the UK's largest privatised water company, said his joint venture would seek operating and maintenance contracts and opportunities to control waste water systems in the US. Anglian and American are each paying Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 67,000) into the venture to fund working capital needs of what will initially be a marketing company. Following criticism of diversifications made by other privatised water companies, Mr Mellor stressed that Anglian was not diversifying but expanding into a related area. He said American Water had only limited experience in waste water and Anglian had no experience of operating in the US. The two were therefore a natural fit. US privatisation presented substantial export opportunities, Mr Mellor said. American Water Works owns 125 water utility systems in 20 states, has assets worth Pounds 1.5bn and annual revenues of Pounds 430m.</p>

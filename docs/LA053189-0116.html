			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 3-A TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS MAY NEED MORE THAN GOOD PLAN TO BEAT WOODBRIDGE  </P> <P> After advancing to the Southern Section 3-A championship tennis match, Sunny  Hills High School tennis Coach Steve White summed up the mood of the Lancers.  </P> <P> "This is great, this has been our dream for four years," White said after Sunny  Hills defeated Laguna Beach, 10-8, last Thursday.  </P> <P> One last step remains before the Lancers can cap their season, however. Sunny  Hills faces Woodbridge in the 3-A final at 3:15 p.m. today at the Sunny Hills  Racquet Club in Fullerton.  </P> <P> Third-seeded Sunny Hills has a 22-1 record. The Lancers' only loss was to  Newport Harbor. Top-seeded Woodbridge is 19-4.  </P> <P> White had to plan -- and the players had to perform -- a masterpiece of  strategy to defeat Laguna Beach, which boasted one of the top singles lineups  in the Southern Section but a doubles lineup that was less imposing. In high  school tennis, a player can play in either singles or doubles competition  during a match, but not both. Against Laguna Beach, the Lancers threw their  strength into doubles.  </P> <P> This time around, the Lancers face a more solid all-around team. Woodbridge is  as strong in singles as it is in doubles.  </P> <P> Randy Ivey, the Warriors' No. 1 player, looks like a linebacker, but seems to  get to almost every shot and hits winner after winner. You can't tell by his  expression whether he's winning or losing. Usually, he's winning.  </P> <P> Ivey advanced to the semifinals of the Southern Section singles tournament on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Alex Steinhardt plays at No. 2 singles and Chris Emery plays at No. 3.  </P> <P> Terry Wang and Eric Berg team to play at No. 1 doubles. Rajan Saggar and Brett  Isaacman are the No. 2 doubles team and Victor Ro and Darren Isaacman are No.  3.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills has a flexible lineup.  </P> <P> Glenn Henderson, a four-year varsity player, is at No. 1 singles. Hans  Erkelens, a foreign-exchange student from Holland, usually plays at No. 2  singles, but played No. 3 doubles against Laguna Beach. Ryan Henderson, Glenn's  younger brother, is at No. 3 singles.  </P> <P> Andrew Duncan and Jason Klingsberg are the Lancers' No. 1 doubles team.  Klingsberg is also an All-Southern Section water polo player.  </P> <P> James Choi and Brad Bosari are the No. 2 doubles team and Sameer Gavanker and  Nathan Winn are at No. 3.  </P></p>

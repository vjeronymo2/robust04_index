			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / School chiefs warn of resignations: Governors angry at letter from Patten stressing a 'duty' to ensure that tests are carried out SCHOOL governors yesterday predicted 'mass resignations' if they were asked by the government to enforce the national curriculum tests in the face of a teachers' boycott. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week sent a letter to every school governing body in England and Wales telling governors they have a 'statutory duty' to ensure the national curriculum tests are implemented. He also said that it was a teacher's 'professional and contractual duty' to administer the tests. Copies of the letter were to be sent to head teachers. The Appeal Court will announce tomorrow whether it is will overturn an earlier High Court decision not to bar teachers' unions from boycotting the tests. Mr Walter Ullrich, of the National Association of Governors and Managers, said: 'We regard this (Mr Patten's letter) as very bad advice. If governors felt that they might at any time be used as a coercion instrument you would get mass resignations.' He pointed out that governors were volunteers, and could easily resign without financial loss. 'Governors are unpaid public servants trying to do a decent job and expecting the government to be on their side in promoting good education, not having a private political battle with the teachers and misusing them.' The group is calling for the tests to be made voluntary this year. The leaders of the two associations for head teachers, neither of which is affiliated to the TUC, also reacted to the letter with anger. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'The government's tactics seem to us to smack of a macho management approach which we thought was a thing of the past.' The association is calling for the tests to be abandoned for this year. Mr Hart said: 'Despite protestations to the contrary, nothing would be lost by cancellation and much would be gained.' The Secondary Heads' Association, whose annual conference Mr Patten will address tomorrow, was also angered. Mr John Sutton, general secretary, said: 'The general exhortation to do one's duty will not go down well because this great difficulty is not one of our making, and we advised him time and again on how to avoid it. A period of quiet from Mr Patten would be perhaps most useful.' Heads and governors would play a much less important role if the Appeal Court rules that a boycott is unlawful. Mr Justice Mantell ruled in the High Court last month that teachers were engaged in a legal trade dispute because their complaint related to the terms and conditions of their employment. This followed an action brought by Wandsworth council in south-west London, against the NASUWT teachers' union, which is already boycotting preparations for the tests.</p>

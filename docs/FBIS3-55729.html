			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Radik Batyrshin report under the "Federal Assembly" rubric: </F> "Sergey Shakhray Does Not Like To Move Twice, and Acts as  Independent Deputies' Defender"]    [Text] Yegor Gaydar said yesterday that following talks  with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], the Agrarian  Party of Russia [APR], and the Russian Federation Communist  Party [RFCP], "Russia's Choice" started coordinating efforts  with independent deputies and the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord [PRES] faction.    The PRES leader held a news conference on the eve of the  Federal Assembly's opening session, in which he suggested that  the parliament begin its work with a vote of confidence in the  government or personally Viktor Chernomyrdin. According to  Sergey Shakhray, this would boost the current cabinet's stand,  for deputies from the radical opposition would raise this  question sooner or later anyway. He said that Viktor  Chernomyrdin responded to this idea favorably when meeting with  PRES chiefs, although he has not yet finally made up his mind.  Sergey Shakhray pointed out at the same time that reorganizing  the government before the parliament began its work "amounts to  an apple of discord between the government, the president, and  the parliament," because, in his view, this should have been  done after consultations with Federal Assembly factions. He  said he did not know what place would be accorded to him in the  government and, therefore, he did not take part in the move to  the White House because he did not like "to move twice."  Incidentally, yesterday Boris Yeltsin signed an edict on the  structure of the Russian Government and tasked Viktor  Chernomyrdin with naming the government's lineup, which puts off  the tide of resignations expected by analysts further into the  future. "We cannot accept the attempt of the four largest  factions ("Russia's Choice," APR, RFCP, and LDPR -- R.B.) to  strike a deal on the speaker and candidacies of committee  chairmen," the PRES leader said. He also supported the newly  formed group of State Duma deputies with an intimately familiar  name -- the Interregional Group of Independent Deputies. The  group is made up of around 50 deputies. The crux of the  grievances voiced by the independents and backed by Sergey  Shakhray is that they insist on the participation of regional  associations comprising deputies elected in territorial  districts in all talks on the candidacies of the speaker and  committee chairmen. They propose that all the State Duma's  working bodies be formed on a parity basis (with one half  allotted to the parties, the other half to the "territorial  deputies"). This is why the "independents," the PRES, and the  "republicans" (15 deputies from republics and autonomous  entities) oppose a vote based on party lists and insist on a  secret ballot for electing State Duma chiefs. According to  Sergey Shakhray, the formula of representation should be as  follows: the State Duma chairman should have two deputies from  parties and another two from "territorial" parliamentarians;  each of the eight committees should have accordingly either a  party chairman and a "territorial" deputy or the other way  around. Obviously, the PRES leader's throwing his weight behind  the 225 deputies elected in territorial districts could have  drastically boosted Sergey Shakhray's speakership chances, which  have dropped nearly to zero, had it not been for two "buts."  First, it is fairly dubious that the "territorial deputies" are  completely nonpartisan; second, the four "pillars" of the State  Duma have already given up "behind-the-scenes deals" and have  switched to open confrontation.</p>

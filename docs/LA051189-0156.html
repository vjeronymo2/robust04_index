			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW-RATED KEDG-FM TO CHANGE ITS FORMAT  </P> <P> KEDG-FM 101.9(the Edge), the troubled radio station that was a favorite of the  record industry and adults with a taste for adventuresome rock, will play its  last song Friday night.  </P> <P> The station will become K-LITE, changing its format from album-oriented rock to  adult contemporary music beginning Saturday morning, executive vice president  and general manager Bill Ward said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Where listeners had heard such critically acclaimed new artists as the Cowboy  Junkies and Melissa Etheridge as well as such veteran figures as Bruce  Springsteen and Elvis Costello, they will now hear Barbra Streisand, Neil  Diamond, Diana Ross and Barry Manilow, Ward said.  </P> <P> Ward expects that the new station will attract a larger audience than KEDG did  and will fill the void left last month when another adult contemporary music  station, also called K-LITE, went off the air to give way to KQLZ, "pirate  radio."  </P> <P> "We chose this format because K-LITE had a very loyal and large following and  it was on the air in the market for about 3 years," Ward said. "We felt there  was an obvious void and that it would be a real good companion station to our  AM station, KMPC."  </P> <P> Ward said the change in formats was due to KEDG's low Arbitron ratings, which  put KEDG's audience at about 14,700 listeners, or a .9 share.  </P> <P> Loyal listeners and employees at "the Edge" were shocked when they heard of  KEDG's demise, which was announced to the staff Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> "The deejays are just the greatest," said listener Kay Reindl, 23, of Reseda.  "All my friends listened to it. We thought nothing could touch 'the Edge.' "  </P> <P> Said J.J. Jackson, the station's program director: "We were completely blown  away. The general manager's a very nice man but I just think he didn't  understand what we were trying to do."  </P> <P> What Jackson, who also functions as music director and deejay, was trying to do  was "widen the parameters" of a rock station by playing mainstream favorites.  </P> <P> "I felt there had to be enough people in enough numbers to support a station  that had parameters as wide as we do," Jackson said. "We purposely didn't want  that hipper-than-thou attitude that many stations get. We just tried to play  those parameters real wide but keep away from formula bands."  </P> <P> For Ward, the station's philosophy -- and its playlist -- didn't work.  </P> <P> "It was quite inconsistent," he said. "The programming was never exactly in the  position we had hoped it would be." But Ward said the decision to change  formats was aimed at attracting a larger audience. "It has nothing to do with  personal taste at all," he said. "It's purely a business decision."  </P> <P> Jackson said he thought the station was not given enough time to catch on and  had not received sufficient promotion.  </P> <P> In spite of that, the audience, which he said "had the most intelligent  listeners -- doctors, lawyers, television producers, artists," had actually  grown in the past few months.  </P> <P> "We still get people all the time who say 'Gee I just found your radio  station,' " Jackson said. " We did all this with word of mouth."  </P> <P> The station made its debut as KMPC-FM in October, 1987. In March, its call  letters were changed to KEDG to avoid confusion with its popular sister  station, KMPC-AM, Ward said.  </P></p>

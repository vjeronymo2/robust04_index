			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Confusion on rates PERIOD rates in the sterling cash markets ended even firmer yesterday, as dealers took the whole day to remove a large shortage and the pound slipped further against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.45bn at the start of the day and later revised it upwards to Pounds 1.7bn. Once again, the market was sticky, and the Bank ended the day providing late assistance of around Pounds 650m. Dealers said that the slowness with which bills were offered was due to the determination of clearing banks to keep money tight. There was continuing speculation, too, that the Bank of England might offer money at cheaper rates. However, if the Bank had set out with the intention of instigating a base rate cut last Friday, that policy appeared to have been well-and-truly abandoned yesterday. Sterling dipped further on the foreign exchanges, ending the day at DM2.8720. Traders were bemused over the Bank's intentions. One discount house trader wondered why the Bank did not go ahead with a cut earlier this week. 'I believe that sterling would have been no worse than it now is at its current levels,' he said. 'The Bank should have taken the risk.' Instead, the Bank continued to deal in Bands 1 and 2 at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent, and in repurchase agreements (repos) at 9 15/16 per cent. One-month money ended the day unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent, but 3-month money, a key indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, moved up to 10 1/16 per cent from 10 1/32 per cent. Further out, rates firmed even more: 6 month money closed at 10 1/32 per cent from a previous close of 9 15/16 per cent, and 1-year money closed at 9 31/32 from a previous close of 9 13/16 per cent. Sterling futures reflected the bearish mood. The September short sterling contract closed down eight ticks from its previous close at 90.14 and the December contract was down 9 ticks to close at 90.38. In its morning operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 113m of Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 45m in a 'repo' for resale on 27 July. Later the bank purchased Pounds 23m in Band 1 and Pounds 210m in a similar 'repo.' In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 210m in Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 143m in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 265m in the 'repo.'</p>

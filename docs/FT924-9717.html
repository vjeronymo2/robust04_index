			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Private way for public roads: Budget constraints are forcing the UK government to seek new ways of financing transport Britain badly needs more roads and railways. People are tired of traffic jams and slow, overcrowded trains; recession has left the construction industry desperate for work; and after a sudden policy turnabout at the end of last month, the government has become a convert to the need for big capital projects to stimulate economic growth. But who is going to pick up the bill? At a time when ministers are agonising over ways of meeting next year's Pounds 244.5bn planning total, there is little enough money in the public purse to maintain existing spending programmes, still less increase them. The government, however, believes it has a solution. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has promised that next week's Autumn Statement will come up with ways of involving the private sector in the funding of capital projects. The idea is not a new one. In 1981, during Britain's last deep recession, there were similar pressures for capital investment to get the economy moving, and similar calls for private sector involvement to help it along. The Treasury responded by drawing up the so-called Ryrie rules to define the conditions in which private sector funding could be allowed. As befitted a government for which the control of public spending had become an icon, the rules were a model of fiscal rectitude. One rule, known as the non-additionality principle, decreed that private money invested in public sector projects could only be used in place of public spending, not in addition to it. Another, known as the value-for-money principle, decreed that private funding would only be allowed if it delivered a project more cheaply than public sector funding - a most unlikely eventuality since the government can borrow from the financial markets at much lower rates of interest than the private sector. Not surprisingly, the effect of the rules was to stifle private sector participation rather than to encourage it. But in a sense, it did not matter much. By that time, the government's privatisation programme had started to solve the problem in a different way - by transferring state-owned utilities and their accompanying capital requirements to the private sector. Transport was a prime target for privatisation. The national airline, airports, ferries, ports, road freight, buses and coaches were all sold. But roads and railways remained stubbornly in the public sector, and by the late 1980s were coming under unprecedented strains as a result of strong economic growth. The result was a renewal of calls for private sector involvement in funding transport infrastructure. In May 1989 Mr John Major, then chief secretary to the Treasury, announced that the Ryrie rules would be scrapped. Days later, the Department of Transport published a document called New Roads By New Means, heralding the dawn of an era in which the private sector would be allowed to build toll roads. Three years on, these moves have almost wholly failed to achieve their objectives. True, the privately-funded Dartford Crossing now carries London's M25 orbital motorway across the Thames, but that was an exceptional project approved before the abolition of the Ryrie rules. Since 1989, the construction of the privately-funded Second Severn Crossing has begun, but the only road or motorway project to have been given the go-ahead is the Birmingham Northern Relief Road - and that is not expected to open until the end of the decade. One reason why the private sector has proved so reluctant to finance as well as build the nation's transport infrastructure is that the abolition of the Ryrie rules was largely a sham; the Treasury simply re-created the rules in its so-called Green Book in April 1991. Its only significant concession was a softening of the non-additionality principle, allowing for consideration to be given to the use of private funding to supplement public spending. In reality, however, there is a much more obvious explanation for the private sector's lack of interest in road and railway investment than Treasury rules. It is the fact that companies cannot see an opportunity for making money out of it. The risks and costs, for example, can be immense. Lead times for transport infrastructure projects typically span a decade or more because of the interminable, and usually controversial, planning processes. Companies are reluctant to risk millions of pounds working up projects only to see them collapse or rendered unviable during the planning phase. And when projects do go ahead, companies may face colossal bills for land acquisition and environmental protection. The risks would matter less if companies could be sure of earning appropriate returns. But in Britain, where existing roads and motorways are free at the point of use, it is difficult for companies to charge tolls high enough to cover their costs without losing their customers to free alternative routes. Put simply, toll roads only work where users have no cheap or easy option. In other countries which operate them, such as France, they tend to work either because alternative routes are also tolled, or because free alternatives are unsuitable for drivers travelling long distances. In Britain, it has so far only been possible to introduce tolls on river crossings, where the alternative is another tolled crossing or a long detour. If the Birmingham Northern Relief Road works, it will only be because the motorway route for which it provides an alternative is full. It follows that another attempt to encourage the private sector to build toll roads through a softening of Treasury rules will be futile unless it is accompanied by measures to make such projects viable. The single most obvious solution would be to sweep away road tax and fuel excise duties and replace them with a system of electronic road pricing - in other words, charging people for use of public roads on a pay-as-you-go basis. This would not only put private roads on a more competitive footing with public ones, but would have the beneficial side effect of increasing the viability of rail. Transport and environment ministers are increasingly suggesting that road pricing is inevitable, if only as a means of tackling traffic congestion and pollution. Even so, they have made it clear that they are not quite ready for it yet. In the interim, therefore, the next best solution might be to introduce charges only for those public roads or motorways competing directly with privately-operated routes. One way of doing this would be to award concessions for route 'corridors' rather than specific roads, and allow companies to toll existing roads lying in the corridor to help pay for new ones. For example, if the government wanted the private sector to build new motorway capacity between Birmingham and Manchester, it could grant a company the Birmingham-Manchester concession and allow it to impose tolls on the existing M6 motorway to help meet its costs during the planning and construction of a new road. Similarly, a company could be granted a concession for the heavily-congested M25 London orbital motorway, imposing tolls on the existing road to pay for a widening programme. Precedents for this kind of arrangement already exist. The consortium that built the Dartford Crossing, led by Trafalgar House, the construction group, was given a concession to take over the existing Dartford Tunnel. Income from the tunnel and bridge tolls is being used to service the loans, and once these are paid off, the tunnel and bridge will revert to the government. In this case, the consortium's profit comes not from the toll revenue, but from the construction contract and the fees for arranging the loans. A similar agreement has been drawn up for the Second Severn Crossing, so it is clearly deemed as workable. But it has its drawbacks. One is that it confers undesirable monopoly powers on the concessionaire, implying a need for close government control over charges. Worse, where roads are involved, it means the imposition of tolls where none previously existed, so risking a public outcry and the possible diversion of traffic onto unsuitable secondary roads. In the face of these obstacles, perhaps the most attractive proposal comes from Sir David Hancock, a former Treasury official who is now a director of Hambros Bank. He suggests that, if a toll road proposal arouses no private sector interest because companies believe it would fail to deliver an adequate return, the government should make it more attractive by offering a grant towards the project's costs. Companies would then bid to see which required the smallest subsidy to proceed. One attraction of the idea is that the Treasury has already accepted the principle in other areas of transport. In some ways it resembles the scheme under which the government is prepared to consider grants towards the construction of jointly-funded light rail systems, such as the Manchester Metro, to reflect the benefits they can bring to local communities. A still closer parallel lies in the government's plans for railway privatisation, where the operation of loss-making passenger services will be franchised out to the private sector on the basis of which company requires the smallest subsidy to run them. The implications of adopting such a scheme for capital works could spread beyond roads. For example, the government continues to insist that it wants the private sector to provide the planned Channel Tunnel Rail Link between London and the Channel tunnel. In reality, there is no possibility that the link will deliver a return big enough to persuade the private sector to fund it on its own. But an auction to determine which company or consortium required the smallest government grant to undertake the project could get the line built at least cost to the exchequer. The idea is not a panacea. The Treasury, always highly suspicious of schemes which mix public and private sector finance, will see it as a way of using taxpayers' money to subsidise private profit. Mr John Fletcher, a director of Trafalgar House, says no scheme is likely to take off unless the government draws up a programme of works large enough for the private sector to consider it worthwhile getting involved. And even if the government does succeed in getting private funding off the ground, years will pass before any projects reach the construction stage - by which time, Britain can only hope, the country will long since have emerged from recession.</p>

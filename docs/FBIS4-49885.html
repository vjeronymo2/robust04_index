			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186) and XINHUA </F> reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "Wu Yi Views China's Foreign  Trade Strategy in the 1990's"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA)--Today, Wu Yi, minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation [MOFTEC], said that in  the 1990's our country must pursue a "large economic and trade  strategy" for foreign trade and economic cooperation to  substantially raise the work in this field to a higher level.    At the international symposium on China's foreign trade and  economic strategy that opened today, Wu Yi analyzed a number of  important factors in China's foreign trade and economic  cooperation in the 1990's: First, the tendency to form regional  economic groups is developing rapidly on the international  stage, and this will inevitably create a tendency to replace a  certain amount of trade outside a region with trade within the  region. This is the so- called "trade shift effect." At the  same time, trade protectionism will prevail in many fields of  international trade. Some countries will even try to politicize  economic relations, pursue unilateralism, and more frequently  exert unilateral pressure on their trade partners. This will  directly threaten the operation of the multilateral trade system  and will also be greatly unfavorable to the development of  China's foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation. Second,  China, being a developing country, is still facing a low level  of production and technology at home and uneven levels of  economic development have persisted between various localities  and economic sectors, so the country will continue to have a  rather low rank in the international economic and trade system.  Third, in the process of transforming the domestic economic and  trade structure, frictions between the new system and the old  will be unavoidable, so it is necessary to properly coordinate  reform and development.    Wu Yi asserted: In the 1990's, China's foreign trade and  economic cooperation must be based on importing and exporting  goods, with cooperation and exchanges in the fields of  commodities, funds, technologies, and services being developed  in a well-coordinated and interconnected way. The foreign  trade, production, scientific research, and banking institutions  should all participate in pursuing the "large economic and trade  strategy," thus substantially enhancing foreign trade and  foreign economic cooperation, moving it to a higher level, and  giving better play to its strategic role in promoting economic  growth, making structural readjustments, making technological  progress, and enhancing economic efficiency.    She said: It is necessary to create a multi-directional and  multi-channeled opening pattern in all fields of domestic and  foreign economic activities by furthering the depth and breadth  of foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation. It is  necessary to hasten the process of integrating the activities of  foreign trade, using foreign capital, making foreign investment,  and other foreign economic and technical cooperation and to  ensure the coordinated development of the commodity, technology,  and service trades. It is also necessary to strive to properly  integrate multilateral economic cooperation and trade, regional  economic cooperation and trade, and bilateral economic  cooperation and trade, thus building up our country's overall  strength in international competition.    She said that, in the 1990's, foreign trade and economic  cooperation should take the course of intensive development [ji  yue hua fa zhan 7162 4766 0553 4099 1455] and should strive to  transform the main body of exports from light industrial and  textile goods into mechanical and electrical appliances, heavy  chemical products, high and new technology products and from  rough processed products with low added value to intensive  processed products with high added value. It is necessary to  build up a reasonable foreign market structure which is composed  primarily of the Asia-Pacific market and supported by the market  of the neighboring countries and areas, with other markets  evenly spread in developed and developing countries, thus  guaranteeing the balanced and well-coordinated development of  China's foreign trade and foreign economic relations.    Wu Yi also revealed that China's first "Foreign Trade Law"  had been submitted to the seventh meeting of the Eighth National  People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation, and the  other laws and regulations related to the "Foreign Trade Law"  were also being drafted. In about three years, China will  basically set up a rather perfect legal system for foreign trade  and foreign economic activities.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by US sellers NEGATIVE remarks from a leading US fund manager over the outlook for Glaxo, published on Monday in a Wall Street financial newspaper, sent shares in the UK pharmaceutical group into reverse and renewed worries over the future of its leading drug, Zantac. In the article, the fund manager suggested that Glaxo's reliance on its anti-ulcer product - which supplies nearly half of group profits - was worrying given the threat of competition, recent regulatory concerns and the lack of other lines coming through for development. A 40 per cent fall in Glaxo's ADR price was predicted in the article. The reaction of UK drugs analysts was more sanguine. Mr Andrew Porter at Nikko said that the article was further evidence of the anxiety among the US investment community over President Clinton's plans for drug prices, yet to be announced. 'Today's fall has been overdone,' he said, 'and represents an excellent opportunity to get into the stock.' The shares fell 19 to 553p in turnover of 8.4m, the most heavily traded stock of the day. It was announced yesterday that the number of shares held by US investors has fallen by almost 1 per cent since last November, down from 23.8 per cent to a current level of 22.95 per cent, or 695m shares.</p>

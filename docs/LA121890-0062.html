			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'JOURNEY OF LOVE' ON A SEA OF MEMORY  </P> <P> "Journey of Love" (at the Beverly Center Cineplex) is a warm and gentle Italian  film in which a sturdy elderly couple (Omar Sharif and Lea Massari), after 40  years of procrastinating, abruptly decide to take off -- on foot yet -- for the  Adriatic Sea, which they have never seen.  </P> <P> As they follow the course of the river from their dying mountain village, they  find the past washing over them, yielding mainly happy memories but also, not  surprisingly, uncovering a few regrets and guilts.  </P> <P> Since this is a sunny film with virtually no action and few incidents, director  Ottavio Fabbri, his distinguished veteran writer Tonino Guerra and the stars  have no small challenge in sustaining interest. For the most part they succeed,  although the film could lose about 10 minutes and probably be only the better  for it.  </P> <P> What the filmmakers beautifully evoke through the couple's journey is an aura  of reconciliation -- with life, nature and mortality.  </P> <P> Sharif has been doing some of his best work in recent years, much of it in  Europe, some of it in his native Egypt, where he was a top romantic star before  being cast by David Lean in "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Dr. Zhivago." However,  virtually none of Sharif's recent films have surfaced in general release in the  United States. Now silver-haired, he remains as handsome and dashing as ever,  even in the humble villager's clothing of this film.  </P> <P> Similarly, Massari, who first came to international attention as the young  woman who disappeared in Antonioni's "L'Avventura" (1961), has been seen little  in America since she played the seductive mother in Louis Malle's "Murmur of  the Heart" (1971). Under the gray wig, padded clothing and creepy eyelid makeup  of the simple old woman she plays here, Massari remains as vibrant and sensual  as ever. She and Sharif clearly have lots of fun playing this adorable couple a  generation older than they actually are.  </P> <P> Much of "Journey of Love" (Times-rated Mature for one brief nude scene)  consists of a trek through some glorious countryside, photographed in muted  earth tones by Mauro Marchetti. Along the way, they encounter a philosophical  old priest (Ciccio Ingrassia), and, in effective counterpoint to their journey,  we watch unfold a near-silent vignette in which a beautiful young woman  (Florence Guerin) comes to terms with the loss of her handsome truck-driver  fiance (Stephane Bonnet) to another woman.  </P> <P> Completing the sentimental pleasures of this endearing little movie is Andrea  Guerra's romantic score with its waltz theme.  </P></p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Montedison plunges into L188bn loss in first half MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals, energy and agro-industrial group controlled by the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company, plunged into a first-half loss of L188bn (Dollars 159m) compared with net profits of L108bn in the same period last year. Before tax and minority interests, Montedison showed a profit of L45bn. Group earnings have been under pressure. However, extraordinary items have traditionally played an important role in lifting earnings. The company did not reveal what, if any, income had derived from extraordinary items this year, but said the total was less than the L350bn in one-off gains last time. Montedison's results suffered from its continuing predilection for acquisitions and heavy investments at a time of recession, notably in chemicals. Meanwhile, long-awaited disposals under its declared policy of concentrating on core businesses have not materialised. The company said earnings had temporarily gone 'out of phase'. Group borrowings grew by 24.5 per cent to L8,092bn from L6,499bn, while sales rose by 8 per cent to L7,562bn. Gross operating profits rose by 6 per cent to L932bn. About L1,100bn of the rise in debt stemmed from acquisitions, with deals in France, Italy and Hungary. Substantial extraordinary earnings could arise from last month's plastics joint venture with Shell, which should remove some debt from Montedison's balance sheet. Ferruzzi Finanziaria, meanwhile, reported a first-half consolidated net profit of L20bn, down from L83bn a year ago. Consolidated turnover totalled L9,620bn, against L8,630bn last time. Gross operating profit rose to L1,040bn from L970bn. Group net debt at the end of the half-year amounted to L10,720bn against L8,200bn a year earlier.</p>

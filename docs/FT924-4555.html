			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / BBC's finance chief to leave next year MR Ian Phillips, the BBC director of finance, is to leave the corporation at the end of February. Announcement of the departure comes a few days before the BBC governors are expected to publish a detailed report on a serious projected overspend at BBC television. The BBC has admitted that the possible overspend is about Pounds 20m. The final figure, however, is likely to be as high as Pounds 60m. The corporation said last night that Mr Phillips, who is 54, was leaving the corporation to 'pursue a range of other activities'. It insisted that it was 'pure coincidence' that the announcement of Mr Phillips' departure and publication of the report occurred at about the same time. The report is being produced by a governors' audit committee chaired by Lord Barnett, vice-chairman of the governors and a former chief secretary to the Treasury. Senior figures at the BBC declined to comment further on the reason for Mr Phillips' unexpected departure. Mr Phillips, who joined the corporation in 1988 from the British Railways Board, would have had responsibility for the finances of the corporation but would not have been in day-to-day charge of the finances of BBC television. The signs are that Lord Barnett has been conducting a thorough investigation of the reasons for the possible overspend, which has apparently been caused by a number of factors coinciding, such as over-optimism on co-production revenues and the transition costs of moving towards 'producer choice'. This is the system allowing producers to buy services from outside the BBC. The financial problems come at an embarrassing time for the BBC. It launched its policy for the future last week, following the government's green paper on the BBC. Both documents emphasised the importance of efficiency in the BBC's handling of licence payers' money. Christopher Dunkley, Page 19</p>

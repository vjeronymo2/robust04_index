			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Prospects fade for BAe jet deal with Taiwan THE PROSPECTS for a successful conclusion to talks between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace on a joint venture to build regional jets receded further yesterday when Taiwan admitted that difficulties over the deal had shown that it needed a new aerospace industry strategy. Mr Chiang Ping-kun, industry minister, said that when the original deal was struck in January 1993, 'there wasn't any strategy. It wasn't conducted by experts. The banking specialists weren't involved, for example'. Taiwan wants to enter the civil aviation sector as part of its industrial policy. But in recent months, opposition politicians and some Taiwanese banks lending money to Avro, the joint venture company, have argued against the deal on commercial grounds and the government had stepped in to try to save it. Mr Chiang repeated that the government would take no more direct part in the deal, but added that the proposed venture might go ahead. The decision would be taken by BAe and TAC, he said. The collapse of the joint venture would undermine the UK company's strategy for improving profits and threaten the jobs of 4,000 BAe staff, mostly in Woodford, Cheshire. BAe said it believed that a deal was still possible. However, its attempts for the past week to restart talks have been fruitless. Talks are unlikely to be reconvened before a TAC board meeting next Tuesday when one of three outcomes was likely, Mr Chiang said. The board could declare the deal dead, it could 'strive for better conditions under the existing structure' of the agreement or it could call for the basic contract to be renegotiated. BAe has in the past warned that the January contract meant that TAC had legal obligations and could not pull out without consultation. The differences between the two sides concern BAe's commitment to a new generation of aircraft that would be more suited to Asian markets than the RJ series, which was designed in the 1970s. TAC wants such a commitment while BAe insists that the joint venture be finalised before a study is conducted. Mr Chiang said that whatever happened his ministry would now formulate a new plan for the aerospace sector. BAe is expected to announce today the loss of 460 jobs at its Jetstream turboprop plant in Prestwick, Scotland. The plant employs a total of 2,500. Another 170 on-site subcontractors will also lose their jobs as part of the company's cost-cutting review. London stocks, Page 44</p>

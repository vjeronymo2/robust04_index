As the sons and  daughters of the Chang Jiang-Hai He areas marched into the new  year with high morale, Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier,  came to Anhui to inspect and investigate how the province was  preparing for certain major reforms the state is soon to launch.  Over a period of several days, Vice Premier Zhu and his  entourage, in the company of Anhui Provincial Party Committee  Secretary Lu Rongjing and Governor Fu Xishou, braved chilly  winds and snow to visit some grass-roots units and rural  households and discuss reform and development with the cadres  and masses.    Conduct on-the-spot checks of grain prices.    As the saying goes, "food is of paramount importance to the  people." People in urban and rural areas are ill at ease with  the recent increases in grain prices. Vice Premier Zhu's  concern for the masses could be observed from the fact that, as  soon as he arrived in Anhui, the first question he asked was:  "What is the price of grain in Anhui?" When told that the  provincial party committee and government had taken timely  measures to stabilize grain prices, he praised Anhui for having  set a good example for the whole country. To check that  measures for holding down grain prices had really been  implemented, he sampled two grain stores in Hefei.    When he visited the Wangdacheng village grain station in  suburban Hefei, the station manager told Vice Premier Zhu that  his station still could make a small profit because he bought  hybrid rice at 0.64 yuan a jin and sold it at 0.68 yuan. The  vice premier asked with concern: "Do you need state subsidies  then?" The manager replied firmly: "Not a penny from the  state." Vice Premier Zhu nodded with approval, and said: "I  think that when a business is properly run, and when it is  willing to concede some profit, grain prices will not rise  dramatically and the people will be satisfied."    It was getting dark and the provincial leaders asked Vice  Premier Zhu to return to his residence to rest. But Vice  Premier Zhu insisted on visiting another grain store. So he and  some aides came to a grain store on Jinzai Road and chatted with  the workers who were about to go home.    "How much does your grain cost?" "For nonglutinous,  long-grain rice it is 0.78 yuan per jin; and for hybrid rice,  0.75 yuan per jin." "What was the price before June?" "It was  0.56 yuan per jin." "Why has the increase been so steep?" "I  can't help it, the prices I had to pay were high." "It seems  that when there are too many middlemen, the high service charge  they collect jacks up grain prices." Vice Premier Zhu  continued: "The current increase in grain prices is abnormal.  It was jacked up by middlemen. Our food departments must play  a major role at this time and take the initiative in regulating  the market." A municipal leader immediately instructed the  leader of the food bureau: "Provincial and municipal  authorities have made a ruling. You should put up a notice  tomorrow stating that the price of each jin of grain is 0.70  yuan, not 0.75 yuan." "You can rest assured, Vice Premier Zhu,  that we will hold down the prices." All the onlookers applauded.    Conduct on-the-spot checks on tax officers.    Taxes are the country's financial pillars. To understand the  preparations being made for the implementation of the new  taxation system, Vice Premier Zhu made a surprise visit to a  taxation office under the city taxation sub bureau while  visiting Anqing. Tax officers did not expect Vice Premier Zhu's  visit. They were surprised but pleased, and gathered around him.    In a round of applause, Vice Premier Zhu greeted everybody  and asked: "The new taxation system will start on 1 January.  Do you all understand the system?" The officers answered  together: "We basically understand it because training classes  have been held." "Then let me just test you. The first question  is: Will the consumption tax cause price rises?" The officers  immediately replied: "No, no. This question was discussed on  yesterday's television program." Governor Fu Xishou, who  accompanied the vice premier's visit, smiled and said: "No  wonder you are all confident of your answer." "Let me ask you  another question. The past practice of collecting product tax,  business tax, and value-added tax is being changed. Now a  single value-added tax will be collected. Do you understood  this?" A young graduate from the Shanghai Jiaotong University  said confidently: "Yes." "Those of you who are university  graduates please raise your hands." Many hands were raised  immediately. Vice Premier Zhu was pleased and said: "You are  young and possess high educational qualifications. It seems you  have studied the new taxation system rather well. I feel  relieved about that knowing the new taxation law goes into  effect on 1 January."    Vice Premier Zhu asked a woman chief at the city taxation  bureau: "The new taxation system will be implemented soon. Have  preparations been completed?" "Basically there is no problem.  We have just received 7,000 receipt books, which will be  distributed soon to the officers in charge of the task." "Can  you distinguish counterfeit receipts from genuine receipts?" An  officer immediately replied: "The new receipt is water-marked  and can be distinguished from a fake one the moment it is placed  under a fluorescent lamp." "Is there any difficulty when  separate organizations and personnel are introduced for separate  state and local taxation tasks next year?" "We will abide by  organization and distribution." "It is rational to separate  backbone services." "Subordinates should obey their superiors."  Vice Premier Zhu nodded satisfactorily. Before leaving, he  joked: "My salary next year will all depend on you all then."  A round of applause immediately broke out in the room.    Seeking proposals personally.    Investigation and study is one way to formulate plans.  During his stay in Anhui, Vice Premier Zhu held discussion  meetings wherever he went to hear the ideas and suggestions of  grass-roots cadres and masses on reform measures. On the  afternoon of 20 December, the usual silence of the Langxie Study  on the Langxie Hill was broken and the atmosphere in the meeting  room became lively. Vice Premier Zhu made a special trip to  attend a discussion meeting in Chuzhou city, the "granary" of  eastern Anhui. He sought plans and ideas from city and county  cadres on the issues of grain purchases and sales as well as  reform of the taxation system.    Provincial party secretary Lu Rongjing, who presided over  the meeting, said: "Vice Premier Zhu's main purpose in  undertaking day and night schedules during his current visit to  Anhui is to hear directly your opinions on the grain issue.  Please feel free to voice your opinions."    As soon as the provincial party secretary stopped speaking,  city and county leaders vied to voice their opinions. They  spoke on Chuzhou city's grain production, achievements, and  difficulties, and forwarded their proposals. When Vice Premier  Zhu heard the city had purchased all its wheat and 91 percent of  its grain for this year, he smiled and said: "The crux of  whether grain prices can be held down lies in whether state-run  food departments have controlled grain supplies. We can only  control and stabilize the market once we have controlled 80  percent of grain supplies. How can state-run food departments  control grain supplies? Closing the market does not seem to be  a good way. I think purchasing should be done mainly by state  grain enterprises. Individual proprietors may also purchase,  but the purchase price must be within a range determined by the  state. The government will intervene and adopt measures to  check that prices exceed state standards. We must not allow  grain prices to rise. Of course, state purchase prices must be  reasonable, and the state should not purchase grain once it  controls the majority of supplies. What do you think of this  method? Will it work?" "Yes, yes." When the manager of the  city's grain, oil, and food company reported that the company  had been formed out of the city food bureau, Vice Premier Zhu  asked for details of the company's operations. He said: "There  is no choice but to reform the grain system. Is it possible to  divide food departments into two parts, with one part involved  in purchasing, processing, and wholeselling, while the other  part does sales? Otherwise, grain will not be procured and  sales will not be properly managed. The burdens for food  departments will then be increasingly heavier. Yesterday, I saw  two grain shops in Hefei city. The city has allowed the village  to run one of them, the operation of which has been separated  from state-owned food departments. It has thrived very well  without any losses. The prices of grain have also been held  very low. The other state-run grain shop is doing its own  purchases in counties and selling its hybrid rice at 0.75 yuan  per jin. When asked to lower the price to 0.70 yuan per jin, it  said this was impossible as it would incur a loss and require  subsidies. This must be changed." "This method is good." Vice  Premier Zhu's thoughts received unanimous consent.    Frank discussion pushed the meeting to a climax. Vice  Premier Zhu asked many questions and participants put forward  their ideas and proposals in a steady stream. Occasionally,  Vice Premier Zhu jotted a note or nodded in agreement. "All  your opinions are very good. We must safeguard the peasants'  enthusiasm for grain production while taking the capability of  urban residents and peasants in grain-poor regions into  consideration. After hearing comments from you comrades, we  have now got a basic idea of the situation. I hope you will  continue to come up with some feasible methods." "Thank you for  your trust, Vice Premier Zhu."    The discussion meeting went on for nearly two hours, almost  without people realizing it. Vice Premier Zhu did not show any  fatigue, and he then allowed the Chuzhou city taxation bureau  chief to sit at the main table....</p>

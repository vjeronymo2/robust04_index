			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UN to send force of 30,800 to Somalia: Troops will have strongest-ever rules of engagement THE UN Security Council last night voted unanimously to dispatcha peace-keeping force to Somalia that would be the biggest ever mounted by the world body, costing an estimated Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 1.09bn). A contingent of 20,000 troops plus 8,000 logistical support personnel, backed by 2,800 civilian staff, will have the strongest rules of engagement of any UN peace keeping operation mounted to date. The UN troops will replace the coalition led by the US that has battled to restore law and order in Somalia since December. The changeover is planned to begin on May 1 with the UN assuming virtual control of the country - on an even bigger scale than the present operation in Cambodia, which has a Dollars 1.4bn budget. There are fears that the factional conflict in Cambodia, which has hobbled UN efforts there, may be paralleled in Somalia unless the troops are empowered to adopt tough measures. Last night's resolution vastly extends the customary authority of UN peacekeepers. Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, termed it 'much more tough and robust' than any past resolution. It meant that force could 'operate without the consent of any government,' he said. The resolution, drafted during intensive private consultations, invokes the enforcement provisions of Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and stresses 'the crucial importance' of disarming trigger-happy bands that have spread terror and anarchy throughout Somalia. It also 'demands' that all local parties comply fully with agreements made at a peace conference in Addis Ababa, in particular implementing the ceasefire. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, will have to use the troops also to ensure the enforcement of the arms embargo already in effect. Although he initially proposed an operation lasting a year the resolution speaks only of a six-month period, mainly due to the high cost. However there is no doubt that the force, known as UNOSOM II - a small number of UN troops went in last year - will have to be renewed past October 31, whatever the cost. Among the UN's tasks will be relief and economic rehabilitation, the repatriation of Somali refugees and the restoration of law and order in a nation that for months has had no central governing authority. Low-flying US fighter aircraft led an American military push yesterday to block any attempt by one of Somalia's leading warlords to seize the southern Somali port of Kismayu, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. A 4,200-strong US amphibious troop force set off from Mogadishu for Kismayu by sea on Thursday following reports that warlord Omar Jess planned an offensive against dominant Kismayu warlord, Mohammed Said Hersi, also known as Morgan.</p>

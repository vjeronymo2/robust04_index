			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Working groups  of Ukrainian people's deputies continued their meetings on today  to prepare proposals on the new Supreme Council's working  bodies, the draft agenda of the Supreme Council's first session,  its media coverage, amendments to Ukraine's Constitution,  procedural rules for plenary sessions, and proposals on  Ukraine's way out of the economic crisis. Around 70 people's  deputies are working in the sub-groups representing all  Ukrainian oblasts, as well as political parties and public  organizations. They have prepared a draft agenda for the 13th  convocation of the first session of the Supreme Council to be  held in May-July, including, apart from the appointment of the  Supreme Council's leadership and the government, a report by the  president of Ukraine: "On the political and socioeconomic  situation," reports by the Cabinet of Ministers and the National  Bank of Ukraine, as well as debates on the draft Constitution of  Ukraine, a draft Supreme Council resolution on the division of  state assets between Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, and  appointment of the Constitutional Court, etc.    The working groups are discussing the Ukrainian Supreme  Council's prospective committees. However, proposals differ  considerably from group to group. [passage omitted]    Members of the working groups are to hold a joint session  chaired by Vasyl Durdynets, former first deputy chairman of the  Supreme Council, to coordinate the proposals. According to  confidential sources, Vasyl Durdynets is one of the surest  candidates for the post of Supreme Council speaker.</p>

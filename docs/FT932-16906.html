			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Marlboro price cut knocks shares on Wall Street PHILIP MORRIS declared an all-out price war in the US tobacco industry yesterday by slashing the price of its Marlboro brand to protect its market share from the rise of discount brands. The decision sent the company's share price sharply lower on Wall Street and contributed to a 2 per cent fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock market was also upset by an unexpected fall in US employment and a drop in bond prices. The cut - possibly by as much as 20 per cent - in the price of America's most popular cigarette and one of the world's most valuable trademarks is restricted to the US. It is expected to have little immediate effect on Philip Morris's international operations, which include an estimated quarter-share of the European Community market. A packet of Marlboro costs on average Dollars 2.15, nearly twice that of discount cigarettes at around Dollars 1.20 a pack, according to Philip Morris. Analysts think Marlboro will be cut by about 40 cents, narrowing the gap between the brand and the cheapest pack of discount cigarettes from around Dollars 1.06 to 66 cents. On the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 68.63 lower at 3,370.81, Philip Morris stock fell more than 20 per cent, or Dollars 15 1/4 , to Dollars 49 3/8 . This erased about Dollars 13.5bn from the group's stock market valuation. RJR Nabisco dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 and American Brands fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 30. In London, BAT's price tumbled 71p to 928p on exceptionally heavy turnover as traders feared the move could dent the UK group's profits. Philip Morris, which is the American cigarette market leader with an estimated 43 per cent share, said it expected operating earnings from its US tobacco business to be down as much as 40 per cent in 1993 because of its new strategy. Some analysts cut their 1993 earnings forecasts for the group from around Dollars 6.45 a share to around Dollars 5 a share. Mr James Johnston, chairman of RJR Reynolds Tobacco, the second largest US tobacco company, with a 28 per cent market share, said it intended to remain fully competitive and would take 'appropriate action' to protect its market share. The move follows a gradual erosion of Marlboro's brand share, which dipped to around 24.5 per cent of the US market in 1992 from 25.8 per cent in 1991 as smokers switched to cheaper branded cigarettes and generic varieties with no brand image. These discount cigarettes, substantially less profitable for the manufacturers, have seen their share of the US market grow from about 19 per cent in 1990, to about 36 per cent last year.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is ready to initiate the lifting of  international sanctions against former Yugoslavia after a  settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina is signed, Political  Advisor of the Russian Foreign Minister, Galina Sidorova told  Interfax. Sidorova said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  had met Chairman of the parliament of the United Republic of  Yugoslavia, Radoman Bozovic, today in Moscow and had made  Moscow's position known. "The sanctions were imposed due to the  specific situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the situation  changes, the need for sanctions disappears," Sidorova said.    Sidorova suggested that this new opportunity must be used to  settle the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia. She believes that the  Serbs should participate in the agreement recently signed by  Bosnian Moslems and Croats. "Russia will agree with any  decision acceptable for all Bosnian parties. However, it is  obvious that no settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina will work  without the participation of the Serbs." She spoke for an  urgent agreement on a cease-fire between Bosnian Serbs and  Moslems at the talks begun today in Sarajevo. "The sooner it  happens, the more chances there will be for the success of the  political dialogue," Sidorova stressed.    Bozovic emphasized the important role of the Russian  diplomacy on Balkans. He said the recent positive changes were  due to Russia's activities. Bozovic stressed that he had met  many Russian parliamentarians representing different political  blocs and factions. Practically all of them spoke for lifting  sanctions against Belgrade. These sanctions are  counter-productive and can only do harm, Bozovic said.</p>

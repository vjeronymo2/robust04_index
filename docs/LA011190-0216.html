			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHINA BARS GATT BID BY TAIWAN  </P> <P> China today dismissed as "utterly illegal and absurd" an approach by Taiwan to  join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Geneva-based world trade watchdog  organization must reject the application.  </P> <P> Taiwan's Economic Ministry said a week ago that the island had formally applied  to join GATT as an independent customs territory.  </P> <P> By filing the application, the spokesman told a briefing for foreign  journalists here, the Taiwan authorities were posing as the government of a  sovereign country although the island is part of the only legal Chinese state,  ruled by Beijing. Both Beijing and Taipei insist that there can be only one  true China.  </P></p>

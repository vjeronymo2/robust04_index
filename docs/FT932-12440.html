			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Swiss telecoms group tumbles to SFr46m loss ASCOM, the Swiss telecommunications equipment group, tumbled into a SFr46m (Dollars 32m) loss last year, and the directors are recommending that the dividend be passed. Last year, it paid SFr70 on the bearer shares. News of the loss, which contradicted earlier indications from the group that its 1992 profit would be 50 per cent lower than the previous year's, sent its shares sliding yesterday. The bearer shares closed down SFr180 at SFr1,380. The group, which has been striving to develop a competitive international presence in anticipation of the liberalisation of Swiss telecoms markets, said in a statement that the unexpected loss arose following a special examination of some of its activities which led to inventory write-downs. It cited its cable television activities in Germany and its private mobile radio business. It said it had also streamlined its product range to cut costs and invested in new market development. The statement said that the group's strategy of concentrating on the growth area of corporate networks was beginning to produce results. Total revenues rose 9 per cent to SFr3.37bn last year and orders received were up 10 per cent to SFr3.2bn.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (10): Shops march to war - Retailers have been hit hard A WAR has been raging in the Portuguese food retail sector. While the big supermarket chains notch up record sales year after year, the thousands of little corner shops have been deeply hit by the recession. The latter are also complaining about the devastating effects of the increasingly powerful and numerous super- and hypermarket giants and are fighting passionately for Sunday shopping to be banned. In Portugal, the modernisation of the retail market began much later than elsewhere in Europe. The first hypermarket was opened as late as 1986, and even today the sector's structure remains very traditional. In 1992, only 25 of the more than 152,000 registered retail outlets (about 66,000 of which operate in the food sub-sector) were hypermarkets. The number currently stands at 31, with a further 34 authorised. More than 80 per cent of all establishments have an area smaller than 200 square meters and an average staff of 2.3. There is one shop for every 250 Portuguese, but only one hypermarket for every 400,000 inhabitants. Nevertheless, the 33 members of the National Supermarket Association (ANS) accounted for Es396bn, or 40.2 per cent, of last year's total turnover in the Portuguese retail sector. Hypermarkets may have been late in arriving, but their expansion has been very rapid. They increased their sales quota from 5.4 per cent in 1987 to an estimated 31 per cent in 1992. Food retail figures for last year show a quota of 23 per cent for the hypermarkets, 19 per cent for the supermarkets, and 58 per cent for the traditional small shop. The international recession has left the Portuguese, like most Europeans, with less money to spend. That shoppers are now mainly going for low-price consumer goods is good news for the super- and hypermarkets. But the corner shops, unable to compete with low prices and long opening hours, are bitter about the effects of the crisis. 'We are seeing serious sales drops in some sub-sectors, such as shoes, clothes and even food,' says Mr Jose Manuel Mesquita, general secretary of the Portuguese Federation of Retail Commerce (FCRP).' We estimate that in food, sales have fallen between 25-30 per cent this year. According to the FCRP, some 4,000 trade establishments went bankrupt over the last 12 months. The Federation says the number of those unemployed in the sector was around 40,000 in 1992 and could rise to 60,000 by the end of this year. But the small retail shops are not just blaming the recession. In their view, the hypermarkets are also responsible for the difficult phase they are going through. 'I don't know which of the two is the bigger plague: the hypermarkets or the recession,' says Mr Mesquita. The Federation says it is not opposed to the existence of hypermarkets, but to the speed at which they are expanding. This summer, the government decided temporarily to suspend granting new hypermarket licences. The FCRP welcomes this move, but complains that there is no overall strategy for the retail sector. 'If the government feels the right way is to turn the country into a plantation of hypermarkets,' says Mr Mesquita, 'then it should go with that option and admit it.' One of the FCRP's main aims is to persuade the government to ban Sunday opening, except in certain areas, such as amusement parks or the regions bordering Spain, which rely heavily on Spanish weekend shoppers. It argues that small shops, most of which are run by families, cannot be expected to stay open seven days a week. In 1993, the 33 ANS members expect to increase their sales by 36.3 per cent compared with last year. While growth rates of private consumption are expected to show a drop from 5.3 per cent in 1991 to between 1.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent in 1993, the three largest supermarket chains, Sonae Distribuicao, Supa and Jeronimo Martins, expect a total turnover of Es540bn this year, a phenomenal 65 per cent increase on 1992.</p>

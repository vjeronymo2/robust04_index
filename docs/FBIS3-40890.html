			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 12 January Manila BALITA in Tagalog  on page 2 reports that in an apparent reaction to charges by  opposition senators that corruption is widespread in the  government, President Fidel Ramos has created the "Presidential  Commission Against Graft and Corruption." The commission will  have jurisdiction over administrative complaints about graft and  corruption filed against any presidential appointee, including  heads of state-owned firms. The commission is authorized to act  only in cases involving at least $357,000, in cases that have  caused harm to the national interest, and in special cases  assigned by the president. The commission chairman, to be  appointed by the president, will have the authority to summon  witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony, and solicit  assistance from other government offices.</p>

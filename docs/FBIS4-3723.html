			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, state  councillor and minister in charge of the State Commission for  Economic Restructuring, said recently that establishing a modern  enterprise system is vital to reinvigorate large and  medium-sized state enterprises.    In his recent tour of south China's Guangdong Province, Li  inspected a number of state-owned enterprises and talked with  leading members of these enterprises about the question of how  to conduct experiments in establishing a modern enterprise  system.    Li said that Guangdong had explored the reforms of the asset  system, social security system, maintaining and adding to the  value of state assets and improvement of management in  enterprises.    He said that the enterprises which are experimenting in  establishing a modern enterprise system should focus their  efforts on perfecting the system of legal status, determining  investment orientation, setting the organization form of the  legal status of the enterprises, and improving industrial  financial and accounting system.    He stressed the need to strengthen the leadership of the  experimental work and set up a responsibility system for the  experiment.    He urged the enterprises to continue their investigations  and  summing up of experiences in the experiment, so as to lay a  solid foundation for further reforms.</p>

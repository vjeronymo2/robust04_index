			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jan Taljaard] </F>   [Text] Bureaucratic footdragging and nitpicking inside the  Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF], the  misguided belief that a volkstaat [homeland] can be sustained  after being seized by military force and lack of discipline  within the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement, AWB] are among the key reasons given by General  Constand Viljoen for quitting the AVF. In a remarkably frank  "message on AVF developments" faxed to some of his closest  supporters this week, which has been acquired by the MAIL &amp;  GUARDIAN, Viljoen attempted to explain his actions.    The fax comes against the background of the growing  fragmentation of the right. Yesterday Viljoen's Freedom Front  registered a number of breakaway Conservative Party [CP] leaders  on its 30-strong national and 168-strong regional lists,  including CP MPs Corne Mulder, Pieter Mulder, Carl Werth (the  party's Natal leader), Pieter Groenewald and Leon Louw. CP boss  Ferdi Hartzenburg insisted that CP MPs standing as election  candidates for another party would be automatically expelled.    Viljoen is blunt in his condemnation of the AWB: "It is  known that I am taking a strong stand against the AWB,  especially because of the effect of some of their actions on the  image of the AVF and because of their refusal to obey military  leadership and orders."    Viljoen laid the blame for the military failure of the  rightwing forces in Bophuthatswana at its doorstep: "It has  come to my attention the military personnel of the logistics  base of Bop mutinied when they heard that the AWB was involved  and the weapons were intended for the AWB. Because of this a  great number of the Boer forces did not receive weapons and  could not be deployed."    Also taking a beating were AVF supporters who advocate armed  resistance in order to attain a volkstaat. Viljoen reasoned  that the rightwing will not be able to hold on to such a  volkstaat.    "Holding on to what you have conquered -- not only on a  military level, but also on financial and other levels -- is  something that has to be considered carefully. Many members of  the controlling structures differed with me ... and were feeling  the time had come for us to use our military power to gain what  we could not attain on the political front.    "Even though we are strong on the military level, it is  necessary that this strength be exercised as a last resort and  that cognisance be taken of the misery that could be the result  of military violence, as was the case in Bophuthatswana."    The fax makes it clear that Viljoen remains a fervent  advocate of the volkstaat ideal. He nevertheless cautions that  even if a sovereign volkstaat could be negotiated, it would be  economically and constitutionally linked to the larger South  Africa. He gives this as one of the reasons he favours a  negotiated option and participation in the election.    It also becomes apparent that differences on this issue were  the major bone of contention between himself and other members  the AVF. "If we were to establish a volkstaat on a legal basis,  there is a legal requirement: we have to prove our support  among the Afrikaners. The government refuses a referendum  before April 27. A referendum after April 27 is unthinkable.  The only alternative open to us at this stage is to take part  in the elections and then to use the votes for the AVF as  indication of this support.    "This is a difficult idea to accept, but our critics gave us  no choice."    The frustration felt by the military man of action when  confronted by the bureaucratic foot-dragging of professional  politicians becomes apparent: "My sense of urgency, the  government's speeding up of the process and a heavy workload  could most certainly have created the impression that I acted on  my own with the situation always changing, and without always  meeting with the appropriate committees and governing bodies."    Viljoen ends the four-page message on a rather despondent  note: "Naturally, it is not easy to argue clinically about  something that was so important to me during the past year. To  me, achieving our aim is an ideal -- our volkstaat an  all-consuming obsession. I cannot continue when I feel that  constraints are rendering me ineffective.    "There comes a time when it is best to make a decision. I am  committed to achieving our ideal, and hope to lead the  Vryheidsfront [Freedom Front] parallel with the AVF to do that."</p>

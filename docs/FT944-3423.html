			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Wise Stores files for protection Wise Stores, an eastern Canadian retail chain with 126 units, is filing for protection from creditors. The move results from its 1992 acquisition of Peoples Stores from Marks &amp; Spencer Canada, part of the UK stores group. Wise, a family-controlled company operating mostly in smaller cities, still owes CDollars 12.7m (USDollars 9.2m) to M&amp;S under the terms of the 1992 leveraged buy-out of Peoples Stores. It said M&amp;S, a secured creditor, had obtained a court order naming an interim receiver for Peoples. M&amp;S had agreed last August to delay loan repayments until July 1995.</p>

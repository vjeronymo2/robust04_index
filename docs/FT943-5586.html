			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (26): Alenia slims its workforce - Italy: A look at the consequences of recession Times are hard in Italian aerospace. Employment figures at Alenia, the state-controlled business that dominates the national industry, illustrate the severity of the recession over the past four years. When Aeritalia, with its predominantly aero activities, merged with Selenia (mainly electronics and defence) to form Alenia at the end of 1990, the aggregate workforce was just over 30,000. Alenia now has 26,000 on its books, of whom 3,000 are currently drawing benefits from the cassa integrazione guadagni labour lay-off fund and will never return to the drawing offices and production lines. 'I hope that we have seen the end of traumatic changes and that the 23,000 effective workforce is the floor,' says Fausto Cereti, Alenia's head. However, he recognises the generalised and continuing downward trend in jobs. 'Clearly, productivity is more likely to rise than fall. Competitors do not stand still, and the industry throughout the world is reducing its workforce. 'We are adapting our organisation and programmes to the enormous changes that the market is undergoing, both in terms of customers' spending levels and the entry of new suppliers,' explains Mr Cereti. He notes that Alenia has been suffering from a recession that has hit civil and defence activities simultaneously. 'The crisis in civil aviation and the drop in aircraft orders has not been counter-balanced by an increase in defence budgets. People have wanted the peace dividend since the fall of the Berlin Wall,' says Alenia's head. He does not foresee increased defence spending. 'Improvements on the defence side will come from reductions in production capacity.' Yet in February this year, Alenia's Finmeccanica parent, a sub-holding of the IRI state holding corporation, completed the acquisition of the defence interests belonging to the bankrupt EFIM state holding corporation. With Agusta helicopters, Agusta Omi, Oto Melara Officine Galileo and Breda Meccanica Bresciana now inescapably part of Finmeccanica, scope for further rationalisation seem greater. However, the outlook is not completely black. 'The civil market is giving signs of upturn. The situation is far from brilliant, but it is better than two years ago,' observes Mr Cereti. He believes that Alenia should start to see a healthier flow of orders around the beginning of next year. Much is still expected from its successful ATR joint venture with France's Aerospatiale. Firm orders for the ATR 42 and ATR 72 regional commuter aircraft stood at 422 at the end of last year, and further sales have since been achieved. 'The programme is going very well and is doing better than break even. The ATR 42 is being quietened by installing a six-bladed propeller, and we are considering completing the range with a cargo/military version and an 82-seater,' says Mr Cereti. Alenia's head executive says that ATR would welcome new partners. 'Italians would rather dine in the company of 10 than three. It is more congenial,' remarks Mr Cereti. He adds that ATR is sounding out other aerospace companies, and that British Aerospace would closely fit the identikit of an ideal partner. Although Alenia puts the spotlight on the ATR programme, mundane business counts for more in money terms. The elderly G222 transporter and maintenance work provided 14 per cent of aerospace revenues last year, against the ATR's 7 per cent. Manufacture of aircraft components for Boeing, MDD and Airbus also contributed more to the accounts, with 9 per cent of total aerospace revenues. Co-operation with other makers is a characteristic of the Italian state concern. It is anomalous therefore that its role in Airbus is relatively small, recent and not risk-sharing. This is unlikely to change soon. 'Airbus has difficulties in filling the capacity of its partners. But perhaps there will be space for Alenia in a new Airbus programme,' says Mr Cereti. Yet the ATR programme, the G222 transporter, aircraft maintenance and the manufacture of components together only contribute the same level of revenues as military aircraft alone. This sector is the biggest contributor to Alenia's aerospace revenues, with 30 per cent of the total. The business overall is highly dependent on the AMX light tactical fighter, the Tornado, the F104 upgrade and, most critical, the Eurofighter. Alenia is pinning its hopes on EFA, as Mr Cereti makes clear. About 15,000 workers will be employed on the programme when it is under way. He warns that EFA production must commence next year in order that design, development and manufacturing capability shall not be put at risk. Alenia has an urgent need for orders to absorb capacity. 'It is not possible to close facilities and then re-open them when EFA is ready. But is there willingness to pay the costs of maintaining idle plant?' asks Mr Cereti. Moreover, if or when EFA does enter production, Italy's state aerospace business will be working to a much smaller order book than it expected when the project started. 'EFA numbers will be fewer than were initially foreseen. Italy planned to take 180, and this was a minimum. There were expectations of further purchases. Now Italy says it will take 130, and this is the maximum,' says Mr Cereti, anticipating further cuts. What these critical times have done to Alenia's profit and loss account is unclear. Its last accounts were for 1991, when it reported L56bn (Pounds 23m) post-tax profit on sales of L4,812bn. It has since been merged into its Finmeccanica parent, which has not disclosed figures for Alenia. With the consolidated profit and loss account of stock market-quoted Finmeccanica crashing from L186bn on sales of L11,791bn in 1992 to just L33bn on sales of L10,772bn last year, its aerospace activities were probably heavily in deficit. Indeed, Mr Cereti acknowledges that conditions were much better three or four years ago.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["bag" report: "Debts Not To Exceed DM70 Billion"] </F>   [Text] Cologne, 18 May -- For the 1995 federal budget,  which the government wants to present in a few weeks, the 1994  net borrowing of 70 billion German marks is to remain the  yardstick. This was announced by FRG Finance Minister Theo  Waigel (Christian Social Union). Additional wishes by  individual ministries must be financed through redistribution.  The generally lower revenues of 1994 will "certainly" recur  next year, the minister promised.    The large auditorium of the university in Cologne did not  prove to be hostile territory for the minister. Invited by the  Economics Policy Institute of Cologne University, Waigel's  description of the problems of a finance minister was received  with sympathy by the students. Even when he asked for  understanding for the fact that the students' subsidies were not  raised because of declining real wages and cutbacks of  unemployment benefits and assistance and that he doubts that  "their reexamination in 1995 will yield positive results," there  were only a few protests.    Speaking to the students, Waigel primarily defended the  state  debts: "Anyone who today pretends that we incurred debts just  for the fun of it, ignores reality." Referring to former  Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (Social Democratic Party), Waigel said  that the latter's criticism does not take the historical  conditions of the past years into account and is thus directed  "against reunification and German solidarity."    Even though in 1995 the debt level will "temporarily brush  against the 60-percent marker," which the Maastricht Treaty has  defied as the upper limit in relation to GDP, in 1996 a decline  to a value "just below this limit" is expected. Thus, Germany  is clearly below the average in Europe. Even Japan and the  United States reach 64 to 68 percent.    Regarding the overall state deficit, in 1993 the FRG almost  reached the Maastricht mark of 3 percent with its 3.3 percent.  In 1995 the limit will be undercut. The current DM70-billion  deficit in the federal budget is hardly due to unification but  to "special burdens caused by the economic development."    More important than stimulating overall economic demand is  to  preserve trust in financial and monetary policy. The level of  long-term interests, which are about 2 percent below the  longstanding average, is evidence of the trust in financial  markets. Even though the economic research institutes warned in  their spring reports against "consolidation as an end in  itself," "we have not endangered the trust through insufficient  efforts for consolidation," Waigel said.    Regarding the privatization of Lufthansa, the Bundespost,  and  railroads, the finance minister rejected the accusation that he  is "selling off the last treasures from the federal coffers out  of financial need." After deducting the pension insurance  payments for the employees, the revenues of the Federal  Government are "relatively small."    The privatization of the roads is not a "source of  financing," either, Waigel stressed. He said that reports about  the fees and potential compensation are "wild speculation." The  point is to achieve better traffic conditions at appropriate  prices -- "in the end companies and private drivers will not be  worse off," the Christian Social Union politician promised.    Asked whether he seriously believes that tax on interest  rates can be harmonized in Europe, Waigel said: "Neither  Switzerland nor Austria will refuse a basic solution," and  "Luxembourg will not stand alone in the end." He thinks that  the fear of the British chancellor of the exchequer that capital  will emigrate to the Bahamas if harmonization is implemented in  Europe is unfounded.</p>

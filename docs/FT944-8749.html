			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Transatlantic sensationalism in televised courtrooms is less dangerous than Euro-artiness, to judge by The Trial (9pm, BBC2). Wonderful opening titles, faces from Central Casting - villains and eccentrics of Dickensian ripeness  -then cut to Edinburgh, that Jekyll and Hyde beauty-queen of cities. Scotland has blazed the trail in admitting courtroom cameras, and the first in Nick Catliff's series is a glossy mix of filmic values and incongruous tragedy. The petty crook accused of murder is first glimpsed, as serenely suffering as a madonna, beautifully, airily lit. His advocate is as sardonically rueful, fastidiously lugubrious, as Rumpole. One forgets this is real. Of course, it's not live, so no rough edges: smoothly edited eavesdroppings on accused and solicitor, lawyers discussing tactics; the camera roams freely in prison and court. Only occasional phrases, the post-verdict anti-climax and a woman sobbing off-screen remind us this is no soap opera. Which is worse, the obscene carnival of OJ Simpson or this anodyne style exercise?</p>

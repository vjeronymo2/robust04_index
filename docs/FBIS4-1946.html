			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial people's government sponsored a  telephone conference on the work of commodity prices on 8 March.  Vice Governor Wen Shizhen delivered a speech at the conference,  in which he urged governments at all levels throughout the  province to go into action immediately, to enhance the price  readjustment and control in line with the arrangements and  demands made by the central authorities, to carry out price  inspection, to strengthen the price management, and to  realistically do a good job in the province's price work.    Wen Shizhen pointed out: The current general situation in  the province's economy is fine. The province continued to  maintain a trend of faster economic development in January and  February and smoothly published major and important measures for  the reforms of tax systems and foreign exchanges. However, what  merits attention is that the pressure of current inflation has  increased further. Repercussions still remain of price hikes  cropping up at the end of 1993 in some commodities. Problems  concerning commodity prices are still the general concern of  society.    Wen Shizhen emphatically pointed out: In successfully  handling the matters of commodity prices, governments at all  levels should put their work emphasis on vigorously maintaining  relative stability in the prices of vegetables and grains; on  establishing the foundation of copying with grain risks, on  perfecting the foundation systems for the prices of nonstaple  foodstuffs; and on doing a good job in carefully organizing the  issuance of measures for reform in various prices. They should  also put their work emphasis on guarding against excessive price  hikes, on earnestly implementing the price policies of  supporting agricultural development and protecting peasants'  interests, on establishing or improving as soon as possible  commodity price system, and on perfecting the systems of price  management. As for important living commodities and the means  of production whose price restrictions have been relaxed and  whose price fluctuation is larger, governments should enforce  the systems of putting price hikes on file and submitting  application for price hikes. As for some of these commodities,  they may also enforce measures for differentiating their rate,  conducting control, and imposing temporary restriction.    Attending the provincial telephone conference of commodity  prices were the province's vice governors and vice mayors in  charge of commodity prices and responsible persons from the  departments concerned.    During the conference Xie Guangren, director of the  provincial price bureau, delivered a speech in which he made  arrangements for the province's mass price inspection.</p>

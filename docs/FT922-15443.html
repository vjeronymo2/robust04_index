			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Hills 'still hopeful' over multilateral steel accord IMPORT restraints protecting the domestic US steel industry for most of the last decade expired yesterday with no new multilateral agreement in sight to take their place. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said she was still hopeful that a Multilateral Steel Agreement would be agreed to eliminate 'trade-distorting practices that have plagued this industry'. The import curbs - restraints agreed by US trading partners in the guise of 'voluntary restraint arrangements' under threat of anti-dumping and countervailing duty suits -were imposed in the EC in 1982 and the rest of the major exporting nations in 1984. They were renewed 2 1/2 years ago under pressure from the US steel industry, which promised to give up its protection once an MSA was in place. The Bush administration has said it would not again extend VRAs. However, it is not discouraging governments offering to keep the curbs in place until an agreement is reached. Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US trade representative, said yesterday the US could not accept an agreement 'that lacks meaningful disciplines over subsidy practices and unduly restricts our ability to use domestic trade laws to counter those practices.' The EC and the other 24 countries involved in the talks fear that failure to reach a deal will result in a rash of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits by US steel producers seeking an alternative method of protecting the domestic market. Trade officials said negotiators would continue to meet bilaterally and multilaterally to resolve outstanding issues, but no timetable had been set. The MSA would have phased out tariffs on steel, eliminated non-tariff barriers and outlawed direct state subsidies for steel production. However, Washington wants to retain unfettered rights to pursue disputes through US anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions.</p>

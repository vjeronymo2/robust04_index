			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Effective Agreements Under the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's present intentions regarding the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective agreements under the regulations proposed in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding are as follows. Upon publication of a final rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations would become effective immediately for new agreements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which thus would be required to comply with the revised Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form provisions. However, the proper application of the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to agreements already in effect could not be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately, because the market share data necessary to separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class A/B agreements into Class A and Class B will not be readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission intends to stay application of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule to effective agreements. The Commission then will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct all existing Class A/B agreements to submit reports under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 15 of the 1984 Act that would include all the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demanded of new Class A/B agreements under the Information Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, including market share data. Upon review of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, those agreements will be appropriately classified into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class A or Class B, the stay of the final rule will be lifted, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the orderly filing of the regular monitoring reports (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those applicable to Class C agreements) will begin. The initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 15 reports will provide baselines (albeit not pre-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation baselines) against which the subsequent reports will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be compared as part of the continuous monitoring of each agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those agreements already in effect that are subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements negotiated by the Commission's staff, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements will be superseded by the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Maritime Commission certifies, pursuant to section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small entities, including small businesses,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small organizational units and small government jurisdictions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ocean carriers affected by the rule are not ``small organizations''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or ``small governmental jurisdictions'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, as large and predominantly foreign-based enterprises, are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``small business concerns'' as defined by 15 U.S.C. 632 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations issued thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The collection of information requirements contained in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget for review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1980 (Public Law 96&hyph;511), as amended. The incremental public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range from an average of 46 hours to 144 hours per response,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments regarding this burden estimate, including suggestions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing this burden, to Bruce A. Dombrowski, Deputy Managing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 572  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure; maritime carriers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

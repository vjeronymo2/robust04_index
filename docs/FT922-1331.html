			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / MP to accuse Lloyd's chairman A LABOUR MP will today step up political pressure on Mr David Coleridge and other senior figures at Lloyd's of London on the eve of the insurance market's annual general meeting. Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, will use an early-day motion to charge that Mr Coleridge and other members of the Lloyd's Council are running syndicates that have benefited substantially from the reinsurance spiral - in which syndicates and London market companies re-insure each other's exposure to catastrophe losses. Several thousand outside Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market - have suffered heavy losses as a result of their membership of spiral syndicates in the 1989 year. Losses amount to Pounds 2bn, the biggest deficit ever recorded by the market. In his motion, Mr Hain will say that that underlines the need for a government inquiry into the management of Lloyd's. An inquiry by Lloyd's into earlier allegations made in parliament that market insiders were benefiting at the expense of outside Names is due to report to the council next week. Separately, Lloyd's said yesterday it would convene an extraordinary general meeting next month, after two separate requisitions from rival groups of Names. One group of Names was critical, the other supportive of the Lloyd's Council, the market's governing body. The meeting will be held on July 24 at Lloyd's. A total of 110 dissident Names are aiming to focus attention on what they call the 'disastrous state of Lloyd's regulation' and are also calling for the council to be replaced. However, 220 working Names - those who have jobs with agencies and brokers on the market - presented a separate petition, reaffirming their confidence in the market's governing council. Mr Richard Astor, a legal adviser to the dissident outside Names, said that the EGM would be the biggest since 1982. 'Hopefully the membership will tear the place apart. If it doesn't it is not a good result,' said Mr Astor. The meeting would serve as a 'creative brainstorm'. Mr Claude Gurney, an outside Name who has helped organise the EGM, alleged that Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, 'has lost track with reality and no longer represents the interests of Names'. Mr Gurney said he has been in talks to raise capital from merchant banks to bail out the losses of the most recent years by mortgaging a proportion of future earnings.

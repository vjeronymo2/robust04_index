The proposals arose out of two days of discussions between a  South African Government delegation and emissaries from King  Goodwill Zwelithini and a delegation from the IFP.    A statement issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs late on  Thursday night said "he (Mr Buthelezi) said he was in favour of  further urgent talks on the aforesaid proposals".    Ministry spokesman Niel du Bois said Mr Buthelezi's  acceptance of the proposals as a basis for further urgent  discussions on the issue was a "breakthrough" which "laid the  foundation for further urgent talks which could open the door  for the participation of the IFP in the election".    The constitutional talks ended provisionally on Thursday  afternoon at an undisclosed venue outside Cape Town to allow the  parties to report back to their principals.    Minister of Home Affairs Danie Schutte, who also headed the  government delegation at the talks, said he had spoken to Mr  Buthelezi late on Thursday night when the kwaZulu chief minister  had said he was indeed in favour of further urgent talks on the  aforesaid proposals.    The proposals which resulted from the two-day meeting  between  the government, the emmissaries and the IFP were put to King  Goodwill and Mr Buthelezi who faxed his reply to Mr Schutte late  on Thursday night.    Mr du Bois said in a statement that further talks on the  position of the king in a future dispensation as well related  matters would have to take place on Friday, February 25, "before  the finalisation of amendments to the constitution by the joint  committee of Parliament on constitutional matters which sits  today (Friday)." Mr du Bois told SAPA plans were being devised  to see "how it can be practically possible to get the  negotiators together" to further discuss the issues.    The discussions between the government, emmissaries from  King  Goodwill and the IFP delegation were the result of a meeting  between the king and State President F. W. de Klerk in Pretoria  on Tuesday.</p>

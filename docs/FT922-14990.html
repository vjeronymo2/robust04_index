			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Kasei cuts profit forecast MITSUBISHI KASEI, Japan's largest chemical company, yesterday indicated that its pre-tax profit for the year just ended could be around Y13bn (Dollars 96.8m), down from Y28.5bn a year earlier, as demand for petrochemical products has fallen in tandem with the slowing economy. The company admitted it would be 'almost impossible' to reach a previously-forecast profit of Y17bn. Mitsubishi Kasei said falling demand for chemicals and continuing high costs in the distribution sector, which is still affected by a labour shortage, had lowered profits sharply. However, it said investment in plant and equipment was likely to remain unchanged this year, while research and development spending would rise from Y41bn last year to Y42bn in the current period.</p>

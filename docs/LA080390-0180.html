			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MGM/UA CLAIMS PAY PACT WITH BUSFIELD  </P> <P> MGM/UA Television announced today that its dispute over salary with  "thirtysomething" actor Timothy Busfield has been "satisfactorily resolved."  </P> <P> Busfield, who received his third consecutive Emmy nomination for his role of  offbeat adman Elliot Weston, was expected to join the cast late today or  Monday.  </P> <P> Production on the acclaimed ABC series began today for the upcoming season.  </P> <P> Busfield's publicist said he completed his starring role in the Broadway  production of "A Few Good Men" Thursday and was returning to Los Angeles today.  </P> <P> The settlement came after a flurry of recriminations and angry debate over  Busfield's demand for a salary hike. MGM/UA took the unusual action of publicly  releasing the actor's salary, $28,750 an episode, and his money request,  $36,375 an episode. Then MGM/UA filed a lawsuit last week in Los Angeles  Superior Court seeking damages.  </P> <P> It's not known if Busfield is getting his raise. His attorney, Edward J. Burg,  was not available to comment. A spokesperson for MGM/UA said she was advised  that no further comment could be made outside the carefully worded press  release.  </P> <P> Busfield was reportedly unhappy that he was getting $10,000 less each epidosde  than Ken Olin, who plays Elliot's buddy and boss on the show.  </P></p>

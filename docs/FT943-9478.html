			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Thomson attacks agents on discounts Thomson, Britain's largest tour operator, yesterday attacked travel agents selling its holidays at lower discounts than they offer on rival operators' products. Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing director, said agents which offered larger discounts on other operators' holidays would suffer as consumers looked elsewhere. Mr Newbold said his group would not tolerate any challenge to its market dominance. 'We wish to make it clear that our position in the marketplace is not negotiable. Anybody who attempts to usurp that position we would regard as unwelcome.' The three largest travel retail chains are offering discounts of up to 15 per cent on summer 1995 holidays. Lunn Poly, which is owned by Thomson, is selling all its holidays at a 15 per cent discount. Going Places and Thomas Cook, the second and third-largest chains respectively, are offering 15 per cent discounts on holidays from Airtours and Owners Abroad, but only 5 per cent on Thomson packages. Going Places is owned by Airtours; Thomas Cook has financial links with Owners Abroad. Mr Newbold said: 'Going Places is not a retailer of holidays. It is an outlet for Airtours.' Mr Kevin Welch, Going Places' marketing director, said his chain was offering lower discounts on Thomson holidays because Thomson paid it a lower commission of only 10 per cent. Mr Welch denied Going Places acted merely as an outlet for Airtours' holidays. He said Thomson's share of Lunn Poly's business was higher than Airtours' share of Going Places' business. Thomas Cook also said its discounts reflected the level of commission it received from tour operators. Thomson said it intended to sell its summer 1995 holidays at this year's prices. The average cost of a summer 1995 holiday would be Pounds 350, the same as this year and lower than the 1993 figure of Pounds 375.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RACING AT DEL MAR;  </P> <P> PINCAY AND CHEVAL VOLANT COME BACK FOR MORE, WIN SORRENTO STAKES  </P> <P> For Laffit Pincay Jr., who could see Wednesday's $75,000-added Sorrento Stakes  slipping away from 2-year-old filly Cheval Volant, it was a time for  desperation.  </P> <P> For Kenneth Jumps, Cheval Volant's trainer, it was a time to keep the faith.  </P> <P> In the end, Cheval Volant rewarded Pincay for his desperate action -- a  left-handed-whip -- and Jumps for his confidence by coming back to win the  seven-furlong race for two-year-old fillies by 1 3/4 lengths over Breezing  Dixie at the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.  </P> <P> After taking the lead at the half-pole, Cheval Volant gave it up to Breezing  Dixie and trailed by 2 1/2 lengths entering the stretch.  </P> <P> "I thought I was a beaten horse," said Pincay, who took his fourth Sorrento  Stakes. "Luckily, she responded to the whip. She hadn't run in weeks, and she  was getting tired, but she showed a lot of courage to come back like that."  </P> <P> It was something Jumps said he knew his filly had.  </P> <P> "I knew she'd keep on running, plus I had Laffit up," Jumps said. "He's the  best in the world, and when you've got him going for you on a horse that wants  to run, that's a tough combination."  </P> <P> Pincay wasn't so sure his horse could recover from her slumber.  </P> <P> "When you see a horse go by like that, they usually don't respond again," he  said.  </P> <P> Jumps, who owns a piece of Cheval Volant along with three others, said the  Sept. 3 Del Mar Debutante is next up for the filly.  </P> <P> Will one mile at the Debutante be a problem?  </P> <P> "The way she's bred, I think the farther they go, the better," Jumps said.  </P> <P> Jumps purchased Cheval Volant, or "flying horse" in French, for $67,000 at  Calder in Florida.  </P> <P> "After this race, it sure looks like a bargain," Jumps said.  </P> <P> The only apparent negative for Cheval Volant was the blood flowing from her  nostrils after the finish.  </P> <P> One of Cheval Volant's major challengers, D. Wayne Lukas' Rue De Palm -- who  was sent to the post at 2-1 -- never made it out of the gate. She became feisty  while awaiting the start and was scratched after hitting her head.  </P> <P> Jockey Gary Stevens said the incident was not totally unexpected.  </P> <P> "She's a bad actor in the gate," Stevens said. "She just blew up. She froze and  lunged into the front of the gate and hit her head pretty good."  </P> <P> Dancing Jamie, ridden by Russell Baze, finished a neck behind Breezing Dixie to  show.  </P> <P> "She ran a big race," Baze said. "She got a little tired on me in the last  part."  </P> <P> Cheval Volant, an 8-5 favorite, paid $3.60, $3 and $2.40. Breezing Dixie paid  $11 and $4.80, and Dancing Jamie paid $4.  </P> <P> Del Mar Notes  </P> <P> Dr. Ed Giammarino's The Medic, who finished seventh in an eight-horse field in  the $275,250 Grade I Eddie Read Handicap Sunday, came out of the race with a  fractured cannon bone and will be sidelined about six months. . . . Trainer Jay  Robbins said he would skip the Del Mar Derby with Continental after an  unsatisfactory workout Monday. . . . Pendleton and Royal T Stable's Music Merci  worked a half mile in 48 1/5 under exercise rider Martin Ruiz. Music Merci, a  3-year-old millionaire and the winner of the Del Mar Futurity, will carry a  high weight of 122 pounds in the $200,000-added Grade II Del Mar Derby Sunday  at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. No horse has ever swept the Del Mar Futurity and  Derby. . . . Wednesday's Pick Six pot of $1,333,933 was a record. The 39  winning tickets paid $28,121.60 each. . . . To make better use of the grass,  the inside rail on the turf course at Del Mar was moved out 12 feet Tuesday on  both turns and the stretch. The fence will be moved back again in two weeks  after the worn grass on the inside has been refurbished.  </P></p>

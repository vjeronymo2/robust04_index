			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / French extend jobless measures The French government is planning to extend measures aimed at curbing the growth in long-term unemployment, Mr Michel Giraud, the employment minister, said. In an interview in Les Echos, the financial daily, Mr Giraud said that the government would extend from 18 to 24 months the exemption on employer contributions to social security charges for new workers recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed. According to Mr Giraud, the measure will apply to the hiring of workers who have been registered as unemployed for more than three years, who are disabled or who have been claiming welfare benefits below standard unemployment benefits for more than one year. While the overall unemployment rate has shown signs of stabilising at about 12.2 per cent of the workforce long-term unemployment has continued to rise. BSN, the French-based multi-national food company, has signed a joint declaration with an international trade union guaranteeing the rights of its workers to trade union representation. BSN, which employs more than 56,000 workers in Europe, the Americas and Asia, has signed the declaration with the Geneva-based International Union of Food. Most international companies say they comply with local labour arrangements.</p>

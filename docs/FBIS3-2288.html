GIO officials made the decision during a Monday [7 March]  meeting presided over by GIO Deputy Director-General Charles C.  L. Wu.    The GIO prohibited the import of Japanese films in 1973, one  year after diplomatic ties between the Republic of China [ROC]  and Japan were severed.    But since 1984, the GIO has allowed limited imports under a  quota system. The current quota system will expire on September  30 at which time all import restrictions are expected to be  lifted.    The elimination of restrictions on imported Japanese films  will have a favorable impact on Taiwan's bid for full GATT  membership, the GIO noted.    Participants at the Monday meeting included representatives  from the Foreign Ministry, Education Ministry, Board of Foreign  Trade, and movie industry.</p>

			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Ukraine alters nuclear clause UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday revived fears of a resurgence of nuclear tension in eastern Europe when it put the country's non-nuclear commitment into question, Oleg Mamayev writes from Kiev. In a closed session, the MPs changed a key clause in a draft on military doctrine which read that Ukraine would in future become a non-nuclear state to read that nuclear weapons would stay on its territory for a 'transitional period', according to deputies after the session last night.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Greek ex-king fights seizure Former King Constantine of Greece said yesterday he would launch a legal battle against the Greek government's decision to seize his property and strip his family of their passports. 'I will certainly claim my property with all legal means provided by the (Greek) constitution and laws,' he said in an interview with the Athens newspaper Apogevmantini. Last month the Greek parliament approved a bill giving the state control of Constantine's Mon Repos estate on the island of Corfu, a summer palace in Tatoi north of Athens, and hundreds of acres in Polydendri in central Greece. Most other property owned by the former royals before they fled Greece had been given to the state to cover unpaid taxes.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Finnish confidence vote won Finland's plans to enter the European Union on January 1 were spared disruption yesterday when the centre-right coalition government survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence despite the abstention of some of its own members. But Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, faces a further challenge on the EU issue on Saturday when his Centre party votes at a special conference on whether to back Finnish membership in a referendum on October 18. The party, which is founded on the agricultural community, is deeply split on EU policy. Mr Aho is expected to prevail but a decision not to back membership would throw the government into turmoil and delay the formal ratification of Finland's accession agreement with the Union.</p>

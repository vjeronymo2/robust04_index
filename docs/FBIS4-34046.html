			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Mexican </F> Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, by reporters Jose  Cardenas and Katia Valentina Buenol; place and date not given;  from the "Panorama Newscast" -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Cardenas] Dr. Zedillo, you  mentioned that there are 40 million Mexicans and that 17 million  of them live in poverty....    [Zedillo, interrupting] That is 14 million and an  undetermined amount of other Mexicans, I do not think I would  reach the 40 million figure, but there are many. Even if the  figure were one, it would be too many.    [Cardenas] In your economic proposal, however, which you  presented on Monday to prominent members of your party and  businessmen, you talked about a new economic position for  sustained growth. But there is no talk of fighting poverty in  specific terms. Have you planned to discuss this matter soon?    [Zedillo] It is correct.    [Cardenas] Or is it an omission?    [Zedillo] Absolutely not. In the initial part of my speech,  I said I was concentrating on purely economic matters; however,  I did say that the country needs a very specific and  well-designed strategy to fight poverty. In a few days, I  stressed, I will give a speech on social development. In this  speech, I will give details on my strategy to fight poverty in  our country. I am working on that speech, and I estimate that I  will give it in a few days. It is written in this document, and  thus, there is no room for doubt; there is no omission. I said  one of the country's most severe problems is poverty and that  this problem calls for a specific strategy, like the one I will  present in a few days.    [Cardenas] Dr. Zedillo, many listeners have been calling  since 0600. We announced in advance -- as we did with the other  candidates -- that you were to be our guest today. The people  sent us some questions which I am sure will be of interest to  you. Perhaps some of them will be answered; unfortunately, there  were many calls. But we hope to air as many as possible.    [Buenol] We put them into groups because some of them are  repetitious, and it will be easier to handle them this way. Dr.  Jose Cultierro mentioned how badly paid doctors are in Mexico.  Speaking of the economic proposal, Ruben Aguilar, Casimiro  Barajas of Puebla, Miguel Angel Lucero of Puebla, Gilberto Tapia  Salgado of Acapulto, Maria Refugio Hernandez of Mexico City,  Rafael Mazon of Mexico City, and Mrs. Garcia of the Irrigacion  neighborhood coincided in asking: Why should we believe in this  economic plan when you designed the current one and it did not  work?    [Zedillo] I think that one must check to see whether it  worked or not in the light of the magnitude of the problems  Mexico had. Let us not forget that our country inherited a big  economic crisis from the 1970's. In the early 1980's things  became further complicated. Six years ago, our inflation rate  was 200 percent, the economy was not growing, but collapsing.  Our economic structure was obsolete, and, in the face of this  problem, we had to reorganize, improve, and build new bases for  the economy. Based on these new bases, we have to begin the  stage of economic growth that we are proposing now. It would  have been impossible, simply put, like an act of magic, to have  been able to overcome, overnight, the problems we inherited for  several decades. These were very serious problems, and it would  have been impossible to switch to an economy with growth and  jobs and no inflation. That simply does not exist in the realm  of the possible. We had to reorganize the economy and the  country. We have done it, and now we have to take advantage of  the fruit of that effort through a congruent strategy. I think  the value of this strategy must be taken into consideration  because of its internal coherence. I insist that there are  evident achievements, but there are also problems that persist.  The achievements are obvious to everyone.    Six years ago, the government's total debt was 70 percent of  the country's production. Now, it is less than one fourth. Six  years ago, the inflation rate was 200 percent, and now we have a  one-digit inflation rate. Six years ago, we were experiencing a  terrible financial crisis that scared away capital from our  country and prevented us from growing. Six years ago,  unemployment was destroying the country. Now, we are creating  jobs, and, although in a very insufficient way, we do have the  opportunity to make employment grow. It is a different world,  but we are not happy with it. We have to work more to attain  more.    [Cardenas] Mr. Zedillo, you are a doctor of economics from  one of the most prestigious foreign universities: Yale. You  have a degree in economics from the National Polytechnic  Institute. You are a man whose abilities in economics is beyond  any doubt and your work is well recognized. Your devotion as an  economist is unquestionable. You have proven this through your  professional career. You are 43 years old. No, you are still  42, you will be 43 in December, that is correct. Undoubtedly,  you are an economist; it is your devotion, but are you devoted  to being a politician?    [Zedillo] I believe my many years of work with the  government can attest to the fact that my devotion is public  service. I do not like to describe myself as a technician, a  politician, this or that. But I can assure you that ever since  I was a child, I had this devotion to public service. I wanted  to serve my country. I have done that from positions that  sometimes were purely technical and financial. Sometimes, I  have had to do that from almost purely political positions, such  as being education secretary, which meant heading the largest  secretariat in the Mexican Government. I was in the midst of  political problems that were very complex. I headed an activity  that involved the federalization of education. It meant  negotiating with Latin America's largest and most powerful union  and the country's governors. I had to handle the federal  government's relations with Mexican universities. I had to deal  with many political problems, perhaps more than any other state  secretary had to deal with. I would say that all that proves  that I am very much attracted to public service.    [Cardenas] What is the biggest problem that the Salinas de  Gortari administration will bequeath to the next president,  which could be you.    [Zedillo] I do not think it is a problem of inheritance from  one six-year term to the other. These are problems that exist  in the country. The problems that seem more burdensome at a  given time are those that get solved first. Six years ago, the  most burdensome problem was the macroeconomy. It prevented the  government from tackling any other problem. If the macroeconomy  problem was not solved, we could not advance in the solution of  other problems.    In today's outlook, I have pointed out that Mexico's most  important problems are: first, insecurity and injustice  afflicting most Mexicans. It is a very grave problem. This is  why I am talking about a thorough reform of our justice system.  A reform that will include the laws, the Attorney General's  Office, and the judicial branch. Another problem is that of  unemployment. It is very grave. I have seen it. I have  witnessed it throughout the country. There is the problem of  the lack of income. This is what a doctor mentioned a few  minutes ago. Salaries are insufficient. This is why we need the  economy and productivity to grow. We need to make the economic  pie bigger so we can all get a bigger piece and thus alleviate  our situation.    The other basic problem is poverty. Poverty is enraging  because of its grave nature. These are the challenges of the  coming year: justice, growth, and poverty. [passage omitted]    [Cardenas] You mentioned a commitment that draws everyone's  attention: the creation of 1 million jobs. You made that  announcement at the National Auditorium on Monday. You talked  about productive jobs, 1 million jobs each year. How have you  planned this? How do you think this can be achieved with a  recession? How can you create 1 million jobs? This is very  costly. How can this be done without affecting the process to  control inflation? There is a contraction in foreign  investment. There are increasing pressures with regard to the  type of exchange of the peso vis-a-vis the dollar. There is  also commercial opening, globalization, NAFTA, the pressure on  micro, small, and medium industries. How can you, with all this  in mind, create 1 million jobs each year?    [Zedillo] The answer was within the question. The economy is  practically at a standstill nowadays. Thus, we must not be  surprised that there are no more jobs. Simply, the economy is  not absorbing more people to work, and, therefore, there is no  possibility of improving the situation.    What I am proposing is a strategy to achieve economic  growth.  Only with economic growth can we have more jobs. How will we  attain economic growth? Spurring investment. What does it mean  to spur investment? It means the opening of more businesses,  more sources of employment in our country or expanding growing  firms. The program that I explained to the citizens last week  is aimed at reactivating the economy. Its goal is to have  sustained growth. What for? To have the 1 million jobs you just  mentioned. It is a program that does not contradict what has  been done. Supposedly, we will be consolidating the economy's  structural changes. It means that we will not lower our guard  with regard to inflation. It means that, based on what we have  done so far, we must go from a stage where emphasis was placed  on stabilization and macroeconomy to a stage where economic  growth must be the main concern in economic policy. The key  task is the creation of jobs. If six years ago our need was to  control inflation, now the emphasis must be placed on the  creation and multiplication of jobs. This is the reason for the  ten specific points that I announced to all. [passage omitted]    [Buenol] Dr. Zedillo, one of the serious problems in our  country is excessive centralism. Mr. Francisco Torres of  Saltillo, Coahuila, wants to ask you how you are going to  conduct an effective decentralization that can contribute to the  economic reactivation of the various states if you reach the  presidency.    [Zedillo] We must do it by carefully reviewing our country's  entire federal system. There is a huge concentration of  responsibilities, resources, and authority in the federal  government. This brings about inefficiency; it limits the  capacity of the federal government itself, and it keeps the  authorities removed from the citizens. I am proposing an  effective decentralization of the country. I am not only  speaking of [word indistinct]. I had the responsibility at the  Public Education Secretariat to head the biggest  decentralization process of our country and perhaps of all  countries in the world. As public education secretary, I turned  over three-fourths of the secretariat to the state governments;  I turned over 100,000 schools, 700,000 employees, including  teachers and support personnel. I turned over a large portion of  the educational budget and 13.5 million students. If we did it  in the education sector, we can do it in other fields too. We  have to give them the authority and the resources because we  believe that the government that is closest to the citizens has  the greatest capacity to respond to the citizens.    [Cardenas] The Teachers' Union complained about the  decentralization process because the union lost the control it  used to have. We have even talked about it with the union  leader. If there is criticism to be made about your  administration as education secretary, it is precisely that one.  You obviously....    [Zedillo, interrupting] If you allow me, that is not the  case. Decentralization was done based on a national agreement,  which was signed by the Teachers' Union itself. The union  played a very special and positive role, I would say the leading  role, in drafting the agreement. Without their participation,  it would not have been possible for us to carry out the  decentralization of the education sector. The Teachers' Union  has been demanding the fulfillment of each and every single one  of the points of the national agreement, and they are right.  They accepted federalization, and they are part of  federalization. None of their union rights were adversely  affected; the union's national status was not adversely  affected. I would have never accepted to participate in a  government action in which labor unions were adversely affected.  I am a man with labor union convictions. What the labor union  has been demanding is the fulfillment of the specific points of  the agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

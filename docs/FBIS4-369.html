			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Sierra Leone has declared Mr. Karl  Prinz, ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Sierra  Leone, as persona non grata.    According to a release from the Department of Foreign  Affairs  and International Cooperation, the Sierra Leone Government took  the decision in the interest of preserving the excellent  bilateral relations between the two countries. The statement  further said the government had (?been constrained to take) this  unpleasant decision because of the behavior of Ambassador Karl  Prinz, which it considers as undiplomatic, unfriendly, and  prejudicial to the maintenance of the excellent bilateral  relations which existed between Sierra Leone and the Federal  Republic Germany prior to the arrival of Ambassador Karl Prinz.

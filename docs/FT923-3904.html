			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Markets keep sharp eye on Bundesbank: Sweden's interest rate increase draws currency dealers from D-Marks to krona DOUBTS about the durability of the Bundesbank's weekend commitment not to raise German interest rates sent further nervous ripples through the foreign exchanges yesterday. The Bank of Sweden's decision to raise its marginal interest rate to 75 per cent forced currency dealers to sell D-Marks and buy krona. The effective devaluation of the Finnish markka on Tuesday had sent hot money, or mobile capital, out of Scandinavian currencies and into the D-Mark and Swiss franc. But the Swedish authorities remain committed to the policy of pegging the krona to the Ecu- a crucial part of Sweden's preparations to join the EC later in the decade. Sweden's high short-term interest rates will help to ensure short-term currency operators get a good return for holding the Swedish currency. The move had a strong impact on foreign exchange trading inside the European Monetary System. The D-Mark, which rose strongly on Tuesday against all currencies, eased yesterday morning as the moves were announced. However, the weakening of the D-Mark proved to be temporary, and was checked by two other factors: Sweden's overnight rate of 75 per cent will attract short-term speculators, but longer-dated money rates are still at levels that dealers consider too low. The cost of borrowing krona for 6 months, for example, is 15 1/2 per cent. 'This is not enough to offset fears that Sweden will devalue,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London; There is lingering uncertainty over the German Bundesbank's policy on interest rates. At the meeting of EC finance ministers in Bath at the weekend, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said there would be no rise in Germany's Lombard rate 'in current circumstances'. This remark led Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, to claim this was the first time the Bundesbank had committed itself publicly not to increase rates, and that this was 'a significant outcome' of the talks. However, German economists said yesterday that Mr Schlesinger's comments simply repeated remarks the Bundesbank president had already made after the meeting of the central bank's policy-making council last Thursday. Mr Schlesinger this week himself played down the impression that he bowed to foreign criticism about the Bundesbank's high interest rate policies, 'There was really nothing new in what Mr Schlesinger said in Bath,' said Mr Thomas Mayer of Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt yesterday. Foreign exchange dealers were also dismayed by the Bundesbank's decision to drain a massive DM17bn (Pounds 6bn) from the German money market, a move which pushed call money rates up to 9.7 per cent, narrowly below the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent. The markets get nervous whenever German call money rates rise near to the Lombard rate level. The Bundesbank's policy is to raise the Lombard rate if call money rates rise above it - otherwise banks are tempted to borrow money through this emergency window and sell it at a premium. The Bundesbank is also under pressure to tighten liquidity in the German money market to get monetary growth back in line with its annual target of 3.5-5.5 per cent. Attempts to meet the target are being undermined by recent interventions to support sterling and the lira on the foreign currency markets, which have pushed more D-Marks into the financial system. Sweden's dramatic rate rise and the Bundesbank's unwillingness to cut rates may put even more pressure on the UK in the next few days. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London, said: 'The currency markets have been given another example of a struggling European country which is prepared to raise interest rates whatever the cost to the domestic economy. They are now asking themselves whether Britain is prepared to do the same.'</p>

The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been adopted by the Agreement States. The major changes in the proposed rule include requirements for: (1) Two qualified individuals to be present whenever radiography occurs at a temporary jobsite,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) mandatory certification of radiographers, (3) permanent radiographic installations, and (4) a radiation safety officer. The format of the radiography regulations would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments by May 31, 1994.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 34 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations was first published in 1965 (30 FR 8192) as part of the recodification of parts 30 and 31 for the purpose of simplifying and clarifying the format of the then-current requirements on radiography so that persons subject to byproduct material licensing regulations could conveniently use and understand them. Numerous modifications to the original part 34 have been made since 1965, many of which have been directed toward the safety aspects of field radiography. These modifications include performance requirements on radiography equipment and requirements for the use of alarming ratemeters published in 1990 (55 FR 843; January 10, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 200 NRC radiography licensees with an additional 500 Agreement State licensees. Radiography licensees often conduct business under both NRC and Agreement State jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC has not initiated an overall revision of part 34 in many years. However, a number of Agreement States have updated their radiography regulations. The decision to develop an overall revision to 10 CFR part 34 was made with the intent of establishing new safety requirements for radiography licensees and clarifying the regulation so that licensees will have a better understanding of what is expected in radiographic operations. The format of the radiography regulations would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories that better describe the type of requirements found in the subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC solicited recommendations on radiography issues at the 1991 Agreement States' meeting in Sacramento, CA, as well as from NRC regional offices, radiography equipment manufacturers, and radiography licensees. Public comments were solicited on the issue of radiographer certification at the May 19, 1991, annual meeting of the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD), Inc. in Wichita, Kansas, and a public workshop on radiographer certification was held May 27&hyph;28, 1992, in Mobile, Alabama. A separate workshop was held on November 18, 1992, in Dallas, Texas, to discuss recommendations received from the Agreement States and licensees on revision of the radiography regulations. The transcripts of these meetings, which are available for inspection and copying in the NRC Public Document Room, were reviewed in further developing the proposed revision. The NRC utilized part E of the ``Suggested State Regulations for Control of Radiation'' developed by the CRCPD, part 31 of the Texas Regulations for Control of Radiation, Chapter 5 of the Louisiana regulations, and the Canadian ``Atomic Energy Control Regulations,'' that apply to radiography in developing this proposed revision of part 34.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

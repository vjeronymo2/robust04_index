			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign institutions break Austrian bear market - Lower interest rates and a favourable tax reform package have brought the buyers in Austria's slump-battered bankers still cannot quite believe their eyes. But when they study their charts, it looks more and more as if the bearish sentiment that has dominated the Vienna stock market for three years has finally evaporated. Since the beginning of this year, the ATX index of the 19 continually traded shares on the Vienna Borse has gained over 25 per cent, nearly half of it in a spurt this month. At 936.90, up another 13.65 yesterday for a 6.7 per cent gain on the week, the ATX is still a long way from its all time peak above 1,700 in March 1990, but this upturn has been greater and more sustained than any of the four previous advances that turned into bull traps. Analysts say that the latest surge has been driven mainly by foreign institutional investors, a sign that the bad days are truly over. 'For the first time, we are seeing new money coming in real volume,' says Mr Lukas Stipkovich, an analyst at GiroCredit in Vienna. Also, for the first time in a long while, analysts feel there are a number of solid reasons for buying Austrian equities. The declining interest rate trend has gathered pace in recent months, enabling the yield curve to straighten out and signalling an impending turn in the economic cycle. If the timing of that turnround still seems uncertain, to say the least, an unexpectedly favourable tax reform package announced last month has given an immediate fillip to many shares. Also, some analysts are beginning to talk again about the promise of central and eastern Europe, and the process of institutional reforms to improve transparency and stamp out insider offences is progressing well. However, the Austrian market is still not for the faint hearted. Only a few shares can be traded easily, so prices tend to be volatile. The flow of price sensitive information is uneven. And, as Mr Marko Musulin, director of securities at Creditanstalt points out, even at today's prices the market as a whole, on a prospective price earnings ratio of about 30, is not cheap. Until the last few weeks, most of the action had been concentrated on only three shares, Creditanstalt preferred and the energy utilities, Verbund and EVN. Expectations that declining interest rates would enable Creditanstalt to bounce back quickly after a terrible 1992 have propelled the preferred shares from a low of Sch409 at the beginning of the year to Sch663 yesterday, a 62 per cent rise. Verbund and EVN stood out among the companies gaining most from tax reforms announced by the government last month. The reforms, which are to be implemented at the beginning of next year, will eliminate five profit-based taxes, raise the main corporate tax from 30 per cent to 34 per cent and simplify several other taxes. On average, the overall level of profit-based taxes will go down by 10 per cent, which is good news for all shares, but inevitably there are exceptional winners and losers. The elimination of a property tax is especially helpful for the banks and utilities, and the removal of the trade tax, which penalises borrowing, provides a further boost to utility stocks. Bank Austria Investment Bank has estimated that the reform will push up EVN's earnings by 15 per cent next year. EVN shares have jumped from Sch840, just before the reform was announced on June 8, to a year's high of Sch980 this week. In the wake of the tax reform announcement, the market attracted increasing attention from overseas institutional investors, many of whom have since boosted their weighting for Austrian equities. Thus, for the moment, the market is showing signs of being liquidity driven. Analysts believe there is still something to go for in the market leaders, but are now widening their range of interest. GiroCredit thinks Bank Austria, which has not performed as well as Creditanstalt, could move if interim profits, to be reported next Thursday, reflect the expected recovery. Sentiment about OMV, the big integrated oil and chemicals group, is mixed following a series of disappointments last year. The heavily traded share has moved up with the market this month, but Mr Robin Horne of ICE Securities in London suspects that its refinery margins are still being squeezed by eastern European competitors, so there is no hurry to buy. Special situations, such as the construction groups Bau Holding and Maculan with big exposure in eastern Europe, have been popular, and investors are even turning to cyclical stocks. Radex, a maker of refractory bricks, has jumped Sch40 in the past week to Sch423. Lenzing, a fibres group, has soared from Sch691 to Sch830 over the same period. The danger, as Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson in London, points out, is that all this is happening too quickly and too early. 'This liquidity-driven market may well continue, but in three months, many people may start to wonder where the economic recovery is,' Mr Thomson says. Also, the liquidity could start being soaked up by new issues. Many companies have held back from raising new equity in the past two years because of depressed prices. At that point, he suspects international investors would move into other markets. 'I am not looking for a big setback, but I think things will drift.'</p>

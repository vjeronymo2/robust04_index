			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> HEART DRUGS DO EQUALLY WELL IN STUDY  </P> <P> One of the most consuming questions in heart-attack treatment -- which of two  revolutionary clot-dissolving drugs is preferable -- has received a surprising  partial answer from one of the first studies to compare the two therapies.  </P> <P> The study, published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, found  that the two competing drugs -- one priced at $2,200 per treatment, the other  costing one-tenth as much -- are equally effective in preserving the pumping  power of the heart.  </P> <P> That unexpected conclusion emerged from an examination of 270 patients treated  with one or the other of the drugs -- a much ballyhooed biotechnology product  known as TPA and an ordinary enzyme called streptokinase extracted from  bacteria.  </P> <P> "It's very intriguing and it's an excellent study," said Dr. Eric Topol, a  University of Michigan associate professor who has done research on TPA. "It's  going to heat up the controversy one more notch."  </P> <P> The two drugs, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 for  intravenous use, have helped revolutionize the treatment of heart attack, which  strikes 1.5 million Americans annually when one or more of their coronary  arteries become blocked.  </P> <P> In the past, physicians were largely unable to intervene to stop a heart attack  while it was occurring. Instead, they attempted to reduce the patient's chest  pain and avert other problems that might be prompted by the attack.  </P> <P> The new drugs actually dissolve the clots that lodge in narrowed arteries,  cutting off blood flow to the heart. Studies suggest that these and other  clot-dissolving drugs could reduce heart-attack deaths by as much as 50% if  used within hours of initial symptoms.  </P> <P> Researchers disagree, however, on which drug is preferable. TPA appears to  clear arteries more quickly, but is much more expensive. There have been few  attempts to directly compare TPA and streptokinase.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Is Focus of Study  </P> <P> The debate over the drugs' relative merits, and concern about the rising costs  of medicine, prompted federal health-care financing officials last year to  decline for the time being to reimburse hospitals at a higher rate for TPA  treatment of Medicare patients.  </P> <P> "It's the new biology versus the old, the expensive versus the inexpensive,"  Topol said of the debate.  </P> <P> About 25% of all heart-attack patients are eligible for clot-dissolving  therapy, currently recommended for use in patients under 75 and within four to  six hours of the onset of symptoms. Researchers believe that percentage would  rise with improved public awareness of symptoms.  </P> <P> The percentage of heart-attack patients actually receiving the therapy is  believed to be much lower, however, because many small hospitals lack the  facilities to administer the treatment and because some general practitioners  are unwilling to use it.  </P> <P> In the study, by researchers in New Zealand, half the 270 patients received  streptokinase, an enzyme extracted from streptococcus bacteria. The other half  received TPA, a genetically engineered replica of a protein produced naturally  in the body.  </P> <P> All of the patients were having their first heart attack.  </P> <P> The two drugs had similar effects on the heart's pumping capacity, measured by  the percentage of blood ejected on each heartbeat. When measured three weeks  after treatment, that percentage was 58% in both groups. The norm in healthy  hearts is 71%, the researchers said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reopening Arteries  </P> <P> The drugs also were equally effective in reopening clogged arteries, which is  important in minimizing damage to the heart muscle and the organ's ability to  pump. Although 10 patients on streptokinase died within 30 days, compared to  five on TPA, the researchers said the gap was not statistically significant  because the numbers were so small.  </P> <P> The New Zealand study did not attempt to compare the drugs' effects on  long-term survival, considered the most important measure of a clot-dissolver's  effectiveness. Pumping power, however, is considered a powerful predictor of  survival, the researchers said.  </P> <P> A larger study, comparing the two drugs in thousands of patients in Western  Europe, is expected to produce preliminary results in 1990. An even more  extensive trial examining the two drugs and a third called APSAC is also in the  works.  </P></p>

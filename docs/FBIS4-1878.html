			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The United States is  looking at rescuing the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde but  would make sure that the step should contribute to the overall  peace process, the State Department said today.    State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry reiterated  Defense  Secretary William Perry's remarks on Sunday that Washington was  not prepared to recommend to the allies to rescue Gorazde for  the time being.    The enclave, one of the UN-declared "safe havens" for the  Bosnian Muslims, has been under Serb attacks in recent days and  there were calls for NATO military steps or threats to halt the  Serbs, just like the recent success in making the Serbs pulling  out heavy guns from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.    In Cleveland, President Bill Clinton said "whether we can  recreate the conditions of Sarajevo anywhere else depends in  part on the facts of each specific case."    At the White House, Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said "at this  point we don't have any specific plans around any of the safe  havens."    Meanwhile, the ASSOCIATED PRESS reported that the  administration strategy on Bosnia could change after John  Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returns  tomorrow from the former Yugoslavia.</p>

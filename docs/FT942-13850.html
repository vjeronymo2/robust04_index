			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco declines 8% to Dollars 194m Strong overseas cigarette sales helped RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, compensate for lower prices in the domestic market, writes Richard Tomkins. First-quarter net income fell by 8 per cent to Dollars 194m before extraordinary items from the comparable quarter's Dollars 210m. The latest figure, however, included a one-time tax benefit of Dollars 20m. At the pre-tax level, profits fell by 11 per cent to Dollars 329m from Dollars 370m. Sales were down to Dollars 3.57bn from Dollars 3.74bn and earnings per share, fully diluted and excluding extraordinary items, were down 25 per cent to 12 cents from 16 cents. The figures are the last that will suffer from an unfavourable comparison with quarters preceding last year's so-called 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris prompted a price war by cutting the price of its premium brands.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN INDIVIDUAL CONFRONTS CHINA'S PAST AND PRESENT  </P> <P> The San Diego Museum of Art's exhibition of the work of Chinese artist Li Huai  stands in stark contrast to the world-shaking events now going on in China. The  show, officially titled "Li Huai: An Artist in Two Cultures," has nothing to  offer in the way of grandeur to compete with the real events occurring in that  vast nation.  </P> <P> On the other hand, it offers what the news does not. It tells the story of an  individual -- a woman who, at age 34, is of the post-war generation we call  "baby boomers" -- in whose life and art all the gyrations and perturbations of  Chinese history have had a profound effect. In fact, the ultimate effect of  those experiences was that she left China in 1983 to pursue her art career  here.  </P> <P> The several stunning insights the show offers of her experiences as an artist  in China come only partly from the more than 60 paintings and drawings on view.  Much of what's most revealing comes instead from the texts in which the artist  describes, often at great length, the various works and the contexts in which  they were produced. From these emerge the record of the often wildly varying  rules by which the Chinese government has decreed what artists can and cannot  do. Throughout her life, however, there were always officially decreed rules  and restrictions of one kind or another, and this is what Li left China to  escape.  </P> <P> Among the earlier works in the exhibit is a group of ink and gouache paintings  on paper depicting the artist's interpretation of ancient frescoes in four  Taoist temples she visited in 1980 with classmates from her school, The Beijing  Film Institute. These images are remarkable to Western eyes in the way they  capture a sense of spiritual and metaphysical energy; that is, as  representations of minor gods. For Li, however, what's remarkable is that she  can actually see such a treasure of the past -- one that hasn't been destroyed  by the Cultural Revolution.  </P> <P> Similarly remarkable are several landscape paintings, in gouache on paper,  which she also produced in 1980. To our eyes, these interpretations of the  stylistic qualities of Van Gogh and Gauguin may seem unexciting, but for Li,  exposure to this 100-year-old European work was almost entirely new. And the  opportunity to work openly in the style without risk of exile to the  countryside must have seemed especially delicious.  </P> <P> Another odd and nearly amateurish group of works is a series of figures in oil  paints created from 1979 to 1982. In these, we see the artist delighting in  being able to depict individuals -- friends, even -- without fear of being  accused of glorifying individuals at the cost of the group. More importantly,  though, this was her first opportunity to receive instruction in the use of oil  paints. As an accompanying text explains, this medium was very new to China and  was closely identified with the hostile, foreign West.  </P> <P> It's against this background that Li left China for the United States,  specifically, for Southern California, where she is now a graduate student at  CalArts in Valencia.  </P> <P> The works she has produced here over the past several years suggest the  struggle she must be experiencing: coming out of the Chinese culture, but  looking toward establishing a mode of working that isn't necessarily  Chinese-inspired. A relatively early, but representative, work produced on  these shores is "The Yellow Wind" from 1985. An oil on canvas, it harks back to  the gouache on paper paintings she did in the Taoist temples, especially in the  way the flow of line, in the Taoist originals, seems driven by a combination of  wind and fire. Finally, the most recent paintings combine text and imagery to  suggest the discontinuities that prevent people from fully appreciating and  understanding one another. They're about disjunctions, disconnections and lack  of communication. In one of these works, a text describing how eating only  plain rice can be embellished is accompanied by an image of two tightly  corseted female torsos expounding their love of Mao.  </P> <P> The complexity of these latter images may make one nostalgic for some of the  simplicity of Li's early, China-born imagery. And there's certainly something  very attractive about her presentation of the ancient gods whose images she  encountered after the Cultural Revolution. But this whole situation, in art as  in the world, is a confusing one. If one likes a little confusion and some  challenge, this show is rich fare indeed. It's a case where the whole is  greater than the sum of the parts.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HOLYFIELD SET ON FOREMAN FIGHT  </P> <P> George Foreman seems headed for the seashore for his bid to make boxing  history, despite the World Boxing Council's insistence that it should be Mike  Tyson, not the 42-year-old Foreman, who should get the first crack at new  champion Evander Holyfield.  </P> <P> Promoter Dan Duva said today that he and Donald Trump "have an agreement in  principle" for the Trump Plaza to be the live-site promoter for the fight,  which would be held at the Atlantic City Convention Center in March or April.  </P> <P> The WBC Executive Committee ruled in February that the winner of the  Holyfield-Douglas match had to make a first defense against Tyson, who lost the  title on a shocking 10th-round knockout to Douglas at Tokyo on Feb. 11.  </P></p>

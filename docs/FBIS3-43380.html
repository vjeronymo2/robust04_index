			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Burkina Faso, a member country of the Air Afrique  Company, is following with interest the evolution of this  multinational company. Yves Rolland Billecart, Air Afrique's  managing director, is here in Ouagadougou to hold discussions  with Burkinabe authorities concerning the necessary change in  this indispensable tool for air transportation.    After arresting the company's financial loss a few years  ago,  and after making important investments, such as the purchase of  the Airbus which increased the transportation capacity of the  company -- after this stage of spectacular rehabilitation -- Air  Afrique is faced with new difficulties which demand increased  support from its member countries. This will be the topic of  the heads of state meeting which opens on 10 January in Dakar.  After his audience with Prime Minister Youssouf Ouedraogo this  morning, Yves Rolland Billecart talked to Gerard Sawadogo  Koudaogo this.    [Begin recording] [Billecart] This visit to Burkina Faso is  meant to examine problems specific to Burkina Faso. We have  noted with satisfaction that the exportation of agricultural  products is going on well this year, thanks to greater  discipline shown by exporters. It is also due to their  commitments that Air Afrique has been able to meet the  corresponding challenges. These were the major topics of my  discussions with the prime minister. Earlier, I held a working  session with the minister of transport, then with the minister  of employment and labor, and with the minister of culture, whose  many activities demand traveling, as well as with the minister  of tourism. So, as you can see, the purpose of my visit was to  discuss the general problems of the company for the Dakar  conference as well as to discuss (?traveling issues).    [Koudaogo] Let us then talk with Rolland Billecart about all  these problems facing Air Afrique.    [Billecart] Air Afrique is suffering from insufficient  funds.  When I took over the management of the company, there was no  more capital because it was less than 15 billion CFA francs.  Thanks to efforts made by France as well as our results for  first four years, we were able to build up capital, which was  good, but still insufficient. Presently, we have capital  totaling 15 billion CFA francs, but we have a long-term debt of  80 billion, which came purchasing aircrafts and modernizing our  installations. Therefore, we need to balance the funds. We had  drawn up a program which consisted of an assistance from the  African Development Bank [ADB]. Unfortunately, the ADB board of  governors did not accept the suggestion of its president and we  ended up suggesting a new plan which I negotiated with the  French Government. And it is this program which will be  examined in Dakar. If, as I expect, this program is accepted,  Air Afrique might be able to arrange [words indistinct] as far  its capital or a permanent fund is concerned, and have a more  balanced financial structure. Contrary to what was said, we  have not envisaged a restructuring of the company. It was  restructured in 1989. As you know, this resulted in the  retrenchment of workers and this time, there is no question of  retrenching workers. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Your choice tonight is between a fictional view of illegal activity in Nigeria with financial fraud in Downtown Lagos (9.25), BBC 2's new three-part drama about a starchy solicitor whose life goes haywire, or the real thing on Inside Story: Mules on BBC 1 at 9.30. A mule, we learn, is someone recruited to act as a drug courier - not perhaps necessarily a woman, but Nigerian women are particularly susceptible. Bid farewell to Inspector Morse tonight on C4 at 8.30, although actor John Thaw has intimated that he does, after all, intend to return. If author Colin Dexter has not yet been given the freedom of Oxford, he deserves it for having made the city better-known as Morse's patch than as Zuleika's mating-ground. A Timewatch special investigation into The Cuban Missile Crisis: Defying Uncle Sam on BBC 2 (8.10) starts by looking at the CIA's attempts to remove Fidel Castro. Among the interviewees is the venerable, bearded leader himself; also Robert MacNamara, US Secretary of Defence and Anatole Grobkov, the Soviet chief of missile operations in Cuba.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: LET EVERYBODY INTRODUCE THEIR OWN SELF  </P> <P> My conclusion that "everybody . . . their" has become standard English is not  universally embraced.  </P> <P> Almost everyone seems to object to this usage, though it is prevalent today  among literate people and can be found in cultivated written English as far  back as the 16th Century.  </P> <P> Like several others, Irving R. Tannenbaum, professor of chemistry at West Los  Angeles College, wonders why we can't simply recast our sentences, as in "All  should put their hats on," instead of "Everybody should put their hats on."  </P> <P> That certainly is the easy and grammatical way out, but speech habits die hard;  I doubt that everyone will think to say "all" instead of everyone or everybody.  We don't think that far ahead when we talk; we use old patterns.  </P> <P> David P. Lewis of Sherman Oaks suggests various solutions. "Any grammarian  worthy of the title would say, 'Will you all put on your hats?' or 'Let's all  put on our hats' or 'Put on your hats, please.' "  </P> <P> Lewis protests that my examples from 16th and 19th-Century English writers are  irrelevant today "except as footnotes to the evolution of English."  </P> <P> He says: "You may argue that when someone says that ('Will everyone put on  their hats') we know what they (!) mean, but one might also posit that when I  say 'I ain't got no money,' everybody knows what I mean. How far do we go with  this?"  </P> <P> By inserting that exclamation point after his "someone . . . they," Mr. Lewis  indicates that he is aware of his solecism, and is only kidding. But his only  acceptable alternative would have been the awkward he or she.  </P> <P> Robert M. Tappan of Cambria says he is confused by the headline over my column:  "Everybody Are Not Happy With This." He asks: "Did it mean 'Nobody are happy  with this'? or 'Not everybody are happy with this'? or don't it make any  difference?"  </P> <P> I think the headline was quite clear, but of course everybody is entitled to  their own interpretation.  </P> <P> Ward B. Lewis of Rancho Mirage protests my suggestion that everybody might be  treated as a collective, like the British team, corporation and government, and  given a plural verb and pronoun. He insists that crowd, company and corporation  are not plural nouns, but singular. "To me," he says, "the most objectionable  is the opening sentence on 'Masterpiece Theatre' on public television where  Mobil Corporation invites you to join them. This is repeated weekly year after  year."  </P> <P> On the contrary, I always think of a crowd, a company or a corporation as being  composed of many persons, and think the pronouns we, they or them quite  suitable. While we do not say that "the Bush Administration are," we usually  refer to it in the next sentence as they, not it.  </P> <P> Joan Putt notes that the feminist movement has caused some peculiar  manifestations of distorted English, though, as I said, it is not responsible  for "everybody . . . their." She writes: "Some years back we stopped for lunch  at a Howard Johnson's in Santa Maria. On the table was a folded, triangular  questionnaire, similar to the ones on your hotel dresser. One of the questions  was: 'Did your waitperson introduce themself by name?' "  </P> <P> That's truly lovely.  </P> <P> The only perhaps more enchanting example of a stillborn pronoun I have seen  lately was one that book editor Jack Miles found, incredibly, in the Talk of  the Town section of the New Yorker, a magazine long admired for its impeccable  grammar. The Talk of the Town has always affected the editorial we even when  obviously describing the adventures of one reporter. This sometimes difficult  device resulted in this astonishing concoction: "We ourself . . . "  </P> <P> Is nothing sacred anymore?  </P> <P> Everett J. Daniels challenges my citing of Ronald Reagan's use of "everybody .  . . their" as evidence that it has become standard. "When I was a kid I used to  hear about using the King's English; nobody ever mentioned the President's  English."  </P> <P> John McKiernan of Culver City says we must learn to use grammatical ways of  avoiding "everybody . . . their," such as "All of your questions will be  answered." He points out: "It is always possible to work around this supposed  'flaw' in the language without awkward forms or more awkward neologisms. You  just have to care enough to try. But as usual everybody will do as they damn  well please. They always do."  </P> <P> Ain't that the truth?  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar weak The dollar yesterday fell in late trading to its lowest level since April 1993 against the D-Mark after comments from President Clinton unnerved currency markets, writes Philip Gawith. After closing at DM1.5741 in London, the dollar slipped to DM1.5580 in US trading. Against the yen, it was trading at Y98 after closing at Y98.575. Speaking at the G7 summit in Naples, Mr Clinton caused concern with comments which were taken to show that he was soft on inflation and unconcerned about the level of the dollar. Sterling had an uneventful day, with the sterling index closing at 79.1 from 79.2. In Europe the currencies of France, Belgium, Italy and Sweden, which had recently been under pressure, recovered ground against the D-Mark. There was unconfirmed speculation in the market that European central banks might have bought the dollar to relieve pressure on their own currencies, caused by the stronger D-Mark. Until Mr Clinton's comments, the dollar had traded fairly steadily, notwithstanding a fall in Treasury prices after the release of the June non-farm payroll numbers. Traders reported a fairly lethargic atmosphere at the end of the week which had promised much action, but delivered little. The markets ignored the blizzard of comments emerging from Naples about whether a dollar support package was either necessary, or worthwhile. The large jump in the payroll number to 379,000, compared to a median forecast of 242,000, led to some speculation that the Fed might lift interest rates at Fed time. One analyst commented: 'Both the foreign exchange and the interest rate markets are crying out for them to intervene. I don't know what they are waiting for.' Interest rates, however, were left unchanged. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan in Europe, commented: 'We believe the Fed's delay does not mark a reluctance to act, but a decision to wait for further justification from the data for a stronger move in the order of 50 basis points.' He said the payroll numbers made a 50 basis point move much more likely. The Fed will now turn its attention to inflation and retail sales figures next week. The tone in the interest rate futures markets was set by the aggressive selling of PIBOR futures, on fears of higher interest rates to defend the weak French franc. The franc fell below its old ERM floor this week, closing yesterday at FFr3.434 against the D-Mark. The December PIBOR contract closed at 93.85 from 93.93. The December eurosterling contract traded 29,000 lots to close at 93.57 from 93.63. Mr Richard Phillips of brokers GNI said short sterling had been weighed down by concerns, similar to France, that higher rates would be needed to support sterling. The Bank of England injected Pounds 824m liquidity into UK money markets, after forecasting a Pounds 800m shortage. Overnight money traded between 2 and 4 3/4 per cent. In the German money market there was little change to rates, with most dealings taking place at about 4.9 per cent.</p>

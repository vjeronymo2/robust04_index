			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Torpid times look likely to continue THESE are torpid times for the US bond markets. Last week's flow of economic news left the strength of the economic recovery as debatable as ever, and the yield on 30-year long bond virtually unchanged at 8.00 per cent. It is scenario which many analysts believe will continue for a while yet. 'The weight of the evidence still points to a gradual, rather than dramatic pick-up in the pace of economic growth,' says Salomon Brothers. 'That backdrop also should keep Federal Reserve officials open to the possibility of further easing, because money growth remains weak, while the trend in overall credit is mixed at best.' 'The observation that the first quarter saw the strongest quarterly performance of the US economy since the first quarter of 1989 tells you more about the weakness of the last three years than it does about the momentum of the economy in early 1992,' suggest analysts at James Capel. Last week, support for a relatively glum assessment of the speed of economic recovery came from a steady stream of statistics. First, on Tuesday, there was the gross domestic product figure which, indeed, showed a first-quarter increase of 2 per cent. As the Capel analysts noted, this was the biggest three-month rise for three years. Nevertheless, bond markets gave a sigh of relief. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman had already projected growth of that order, and some pundits had argued that the mild winter weather had influenced first-quarter performance. Moreover, for the early stages of a recovery, this is seen as a fairly weak figure. The markets had certainly feared that the number would be higher. Had that been the case, inflationary fears could have been sparked. The housing figures then added hugely to the market's peace of mind. New home sales posted a 14.8 per cent decline in March - the steepest monthly drop in 10 years. For many pundits, this was a clear signal that the housing sector's revival had stalled. Two days later, jobs figures disseminated further calm. The initial unemployment claims report showed an unchanged figure - at just over 400,000  -for the week ended April 18. And neither the leading indicators nor the manufacturers' orders figures did anything to upset the picture. The former rose by 0.2 per cent, which represented a slowdown from the very strong trend seen earlier in the year, while manufacturers' orders increased by 1.6 per cent. Finally, the National Association of Purchasing Manufacturers' index rolled out at 51.3 per cent in April - sharply down on the February and March figures. All this presents a relatively stable background for this week's quarterly refunding operations. The government announced last week that it will sell Dollars 36bn-worth of new securities. Perhaps the only modest surprise was the Treasury's decision to reopen the 8 per cent bond issue, maturing in 2021 - the first time since 1983 the authorities have reopened a bond issue for the second time. This week, attention is likely is focus on the unemployment figures, due out on Friday. Here, it is reckoned that the unemployment rate will show little change - easing to around 7.1 per cent at most, compared with 7.3 per cent in March. And, if so, that is the sort of borderline improvement which will keep bond markets on an even keel.</p>

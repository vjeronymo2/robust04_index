			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> BENEFITS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: THE AWARENESS AND THE WARINESS  </P> <P> Genethics: The Clash Between the New Genetics and Human Values by David Suzuki  and Peter Knudtson (Harvard University Press: $25; 384 pages)  </P> <P> The theme is an old one. Science for good and science for evil. It recurs in  literature, in thought and in reality. Unfortunately, there is no solution,  only a warning: Be aware and beware.  </P> <P> Until this century, science for evil, while recognized, seemed an aberration.  Since World War II, we have known that it is more than that. The destructive  power of knowledge is at least as great as its positive applications. The two  are inseparably linked.  </P> <P> Microbiology is the latest discipline to discover that science is a two-edged  sword. The explosion of knowledge in the last several decades into the chemical  basis of life has opened vast possibilities for use and for abuse. What to do  about it is the subject of "Genethics: The Clash Between the New Genetics and  Human Values" by David Suzuki and Peter Knudtson, a book that offers more  questions than answers.  </P> <P> Biotechnology has been a controversial subject since the early 1970s, when the  techniques of genetic engineering were first developed. Mindful of the dilemma  that the atomic scientists of World War II had created, biologists feared  unleashing a new uncontrollable weapon on the world.  </P> <P> Specifically, they were concerned that a genetically engineered organism could  escape from a laboratory and wreak havoc, and, for the first time in the  history of science, they voluntarily adopted a moratorium on research until the  potential for such a catastrophe could be assessed.  </P> <P> Having assured themselves -- and many of the rest of us -- that the possibility  was remote, they resumed and expanded their work. Now the question is a  different and much more fundamental one: Regardless of the potential benefits,  is it wise to tinker with the essence of life?  </P> <P> "As we embark on this new era of applied molecular genetics, we are in some  ways incredibly shortsighted," Suzuki and Knudtson warn. "We are so intent on  rushing to exploit our newly acquired insights that we often do not have the  faintest idea of the long-term consequences of our technologies."  </P> <P> Genetic research makes possible the creation of new forms of life. The authors  concede the potential benefits of manufacturing new medicines and repairing  genetic defects. But they fear that "repairing genetic defects" sounds a lot  like "improving the race," a slogan that has already been used and could still  be used for great harm.  </P> <P> And, in an echo of the earlier concern about the escape of pathological new  organisms, the authors fear that some unknown, unforeseen consequence is still  lurking in genetic engineering.  </P> <P> "When science creates new technological tools, they often yield instant social  and financial rewards," they write. "But these successes can blind us to the  fact that science seldom has much to say about the possible future effects of  these applications on our societies and ecosystems. We need look no farther  than the long-term effects of the automobile, nuclear fission, oral  contraceptives, agricultural pesticides or television to appreciate the myopia  of science. The effects of each of these applications of science extend far  beyond the immediate uses for which they were intended."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Answers in Morality  </P> <P> Go slow, the authors urge. We don't know what we're doing. The answers to these  questions lie in morality, not in science, in wisdom, not in knowledge. They  call for new ethical principles, which, the authors say, should be drawn from  as many and wide-ranging sources as possible.  </P> <P> Who can quarrel with such a noble sentiment? On the other hand, is it moral to  refuse to cure a genetic defect today because of the fear that the knowledge  will be misused tomorrow?  </P> <P> No one has yet figured out a solution to this problem, and no one is likely to.  In some sense, it is the problem of modern society. We want -- we need -- the  benefits of science. We cannot feed ourselves without every technological trick  at hand. There are too many people on the planet.  </P> <P> By definition, no one knows what the unforeseen problems of knowledge will be  in the long run. But we cannot give up the short-term benefits. We cannot let  go of the tiger's tail.  </P> <P> Suzuki, a scientist, and Knudtson, a science writer, are right to point out the  hazards and to urge and reurge that we treat knowledge of the chemistry of life  with awe. But can we really turn our backs on this technology? Should we?  </P> <P> Should the printing press have been banned at the outset because one day Hitler  would publish "Mein Kampf"?  </P></p>

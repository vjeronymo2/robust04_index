Claes said the troops would be redeployed from Croatia where  they are currently stationed, and added that he was pleased the  Serbs had abided by the NATO ultimatum Sunday thus averting air  strikes.    "The various warring parties in Bosnia must understand that  we are ready to extend the (NATO) ultimatum if we realize that  atrocities are continuing in other regions," he said. "And it  goes without saying that we want to revive negotiations that  could lead to a peace accord."    Belgium has 1,038 UN peacekeeping troops in the former  Yugoslavia, 708 of whom are in Croatia.</p>

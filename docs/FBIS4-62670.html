			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Pavlov, chief of the Council of </F> Ministers Office for Coordinating the Activities of  Administrative Bodies, by A. Makarov; place and date not given:  "I Believe in 'The Good Hereafter' of the Belarusian Armed  Forces"]    [Text] Not long ago, the State Secretariat for Fighting  Crime and National Security was transformed into the Council of  Ministers Office for Coordinating the Activities of  Administrative Bodies. The very fact of this transformation as  well as tasks facing the newly formed structure have already  been discussed in the Belarusian press. Our correspondent has  asked Chief of the Office Valeriy Pavlov to speak on the steps  planned by the government to eliminate the difficulties that  worry the people in uniforms.    [Pavlov] A normative act is to be adopted soon stipulating  that those servicemen who served 20 or more years in the Army  receive apartments while in active service. While this used to  be a mere wish and a kind of declaration by both the Council of  Ministers and the Defense Ministry, we now believe that this  declaration should be provided with a legal footing. To achieve  this goal, housing construction will be continued at the expense  of the government and will involve foreign investments; credits  will be granted to retired officers. The 9 billion rubles  obtained from selling surplus arms will also be spent on  implementation of the housing program for servicemen in 1994.    Aside from this, as we all know, compensations for food  rations were increased as of 15 April. In May, the office will  draft a resolution on changing salaries paid for military ranks.  The government has requested that we review the issues of  medical care, improve the norms of servicemen's allowances of  food and clothing.    [Makarov] Nevertheless the planned measures will hardly  bring our living standards close to those in the neighboring  states.    [Pavlov] It is hard to compare the economic situations in  Belarus and Russia -- the comparison would definitely be to our  disadvantage. However despite this, the state is doing  everything in its might for the Army.    I do not deny that we still have certain officials who tend  to compare incomparable things. For example they suggest  replacing two or three regiment exercises with personnel work in  the economic sector. One should understand that every man and  every state structure should be engaged in their business. If  we stop holding exercises and reduce the scope of planned combat  training, the Belarusian Army will change likewise.    [Makarov] How do you treat those forces in the Republic that  promise to pour riches from "the horn of plenty" as soon as they  come to power?    [Pavlov] I would ask them to answer just one question: How  are they going to finance those promises? Unfortunately there  is no source other than the state budget. The latter,  incidentally, has its limits.    [Makarov] Speaking of the eternal sore point -- that of  money -- what should the Armed Forces expect from the  unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus?    [Pavlov] The unification of monetary systems will allow us  to maximally integrate our efforts in the spheres of military  construction, material supplies for the Army, and improvement of  our scientific research. The current artificial exchange rate  of Belarusian and Russian rubles does not permit carrying out  these strategic tasks. Moreover, defense enterprises are  overstocked and their products are not competitive because of  excessive prices.    Of course, we will receive a real chance to more easily  rearm  and re-equip the Belarusian Army; more servicemen will acquire  rare professions in Russia. A decrease in prices for power  resources will provide for full implementation of the program  for combat training of troops.    [Makarov] However the Republic's Armed Forces are comprised  of people who suffer many hardships....    [Pavlov] This is why immediately upon joining the single  ruble zone, the wages of Belarusian officers will be reviewed.  The wages of our officers will not be lower than those of  Russian ones. We will also try to correct certain drawbacks  that we have in the system of payments for the military. It is  no secret how insignificant is the difference in wages paid for  military ranks and jobs. Very often officers working with  personnel are paid the same salaries as those who do not have to  occupy themselves with test-range exercises or spend nights in  the barracks. We are going to suggest that those officers who  have commanded subunits ranging from company to division for a  long time are paid certain bonuses.    We will also review post differentials for servicemen on  combat duty, servicemen who serve far from oblast cities, under  difficult conditions, in remote units. Of course, we will not  have differentials similar to those paid in the Far East or in  polar regions simply because there are no places with similar  conditions here in Belarus, but salaries of the military will be  targeted for review.    [Makarov] When will people feel the tangible results of  all this? The transition to the ruble zone may take a long time.    [Pavlov] We have already gotten down to work and have  completed some 30 percent of it. In fact, two out of our four  departments have been "shoveling" Belarusian and Russian legal  acts dealing with officer service, comparing, and thoroughly  analyzing them. Everything that depends on us, we are doing  right now.    [Makarov] Once the monetary systems are unified, will  officers going abroad on vacation be entitled to travel  allowances, as was the case in the past?    [Pavlov] An agreement between the Belarusian and Russian  Defense Ministries is being prepared for signing, in accordance  with which Belarusian servicemen will be entitled to travel  allowances on the territories of ruble zone states. We should  keep in mind that more than 35 percent of our officers and  warrant officers have relatives in Russia. The system of  treatment in recuperation and holiday centers will also be  reviewed.    [Makarov] Speaking at the Baranovichi House of Culture on 3  May, Stanislaw Shushkevich said that retired officers had not  created material wealth, while the share of their pensions in  the total pension fund, unlike the share of civilians' pensions,  is incommensurably higher than their contribution. According to  Shushkevich, Russia should pay pensions to the retired officers  who used to serve in the Soviet Army. How would you comment on  this?    [Pavlov] I believe that those statements do not deserve any  comment. To know all the hardships of military service one  should move with his family thousands of kilometers to new  places of service every couple of years and be the only  breadwinner in his family. Army life should not be discussed at  meetings held at breweries.    Unfortunately, a majority of our politicians regard the  liquidation of the Army and revision of bonuses for the military  as the primary way to increase people's welfare.    [Makarov] But frankly, do you believe that our Army will be  strengthened and that it has a future? Officers seek  termination of service, graduates of military colleges prefer  civilian life.    [Pavlov] Not only do I believe in the good hereafter of the  Army. I am sure that the Belarusian Armed Forces will manage to  overcome the current problems. The state will spare no efforts  to support its defenders and make military service a respected  profession. There are all grounds for such optimism. The point  is that the forming of an economic union with Russia and the  signing of the CIS collective security treaty permit a cardinal  revision of the issues of the development of the Belarusian  Army. The implementation of these documents will put an end to  the Army's self-isolation, which in fact amounted to continual  degradation. The issues of developing military science,  supplying the Army with modern equipment, training of personnel,  and many others will be resolved on the basis of integration  with Russia, proceeding from the unity of defense interests. As  early as this summer, as stipulated by an appropriate agreement,  Belarusian formations and air-defense units will have a chance  to hold field firing and intensive training of gun squads at  Russian test-ranges.    I am fully confident that the fate of our Army -- just as  our  economy, our people, and all of Belarus -- depends on how fully  we are able to restore what we have thoughtlessly ruined. A  union with Russia gives us a chance to do this. It is sad that  the candidates for Belarusian president do not seem to  understand this.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Confusion surrounds EU directive The European Commission has finally agreed a revised version of the controversial Acquired Rights Directive but there is widespread disagreement about what the revision means. The directive affects the rights of workers whose services are contracted out. European employers and unions welcomed the amendment but disagreed radically about what effect it will have. Employers bodies, and several countries such as Britain and Germany, have been pushing hard for a narrowing of the directive's scope while unions have been strongly resisting any significant change. The revisions will still have to be unanimously approved by the EU social affairs council. The original directive passed in 1977 protects the jobs and working conditions of workers whose businesses are transferred. It first became a big issue when it began to interfere with the British government's attempt to contract out public services to the private sector. Contracting out has been severely impaired by the directive in Britain. The German government swung its weight behind reform of the directive after a recent ruling from the European Court of Justice decreed that a single woman cleaner whose job was transferred to a contractor should be covered by the directive. The revised directive seeks to clarify what type of operation will remain covered. It also revises the rules on insolvent companies. The key new paragraph states that the 'transfer of an economic entity which retains its identity' will still be regarded as a transfer but the transfer of 'only an activity of an undertaking ..does not in itself constitute a transfer'. Employers organisations claim this represents a significant narrowing of the scope of the directive and could rule out many of the activities  - such as cleaning and catering - which have been at the centre of the UK government's contracting out strategy. Mr John Hall, director-general of the Business Services Association, which represents private contractors in the UK, said: 'This is a vast improvement on the existing directive, and is even some improvement on the earlier revisions, but it could still mean a field day for the lawyers.' However Mr David Lea, assistant general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress, said that the revision merely codified recent judgments of the European Court and was welcomed by European trade unionists. In the judgment on the single German cleaner the judge said that the woman alone did represent an 'economic entity'. Ms Melanie Tether, a British lawyer specialising in the directive, said that it was not so much the new language but the political signal that was being sent to the European Court to narrow the scope of the directive which was likely to be crucial.

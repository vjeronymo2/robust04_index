			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The reason I'm a good news guy In the good news/bad news debate, I stand with the good guys - those who believe that newspapers and television emphasise and exaggerate bad news at the expense of the good. One of the reasons I am a good news guy is that the bad news guys - those who thrive on bleakness and sensation and maintain, often comically, that 'news', by definition, is almost always 'bad' - persistently queer my pitch. I am no sort of optimist. I am a hard-line, short-term pessimist. But even I can see there is plenty of good news about and believe it should be reported adequately in the interests of balance. It is a theory of mine that one of the reasons for the emphasis on bad news is that it is cheaper to collect and present. Bad news is a commodity. It floods in from agencies. A decent famine or crash generates a tide of words and pictures which can be shovelled into a page or bulletin at almost the speed of light. Good news, conversely, often has to be mined from a deep and expensive seam. (People who work on news desks will dub this opinion 'crap.' They can just join the queue). Some days ago, The Times carried three useful letters on good news/bad news. One correspondent claimed that 'good news is essential to foster a spirit of optimism and belief that the human race is capable of living in peace and love one with another.' No news desk would accept that part of its job was to propagandise feel-good stories in the style of Big Brother, and the objection would not be pernickety. But a second correspondent, Charles Clayton, executive director of World Vision UK, whatever that may be, scored impressively: 'Last August. British newspapers could have run the momentous headline: 'Famine defeated in southern Africa' following the UN's declaration that the threatened drought-related famine, of which we had heard so much, finally had been averted. That story, although positive, ranked as newsworthy by any standards.' Two other examples Clayton quoted were: 'Cambodian elections miraculously peaceful' and 'Life and hope return to Somali villages.' He said that all three stories were newsworthy in their own right, and concluded: 'Accuracy and balance in individual articles and stories is laudable. But an accurate overall balance - of good and bad news, of positive and negative developments over time - is equally important.' It is essential not to confuse good news with banal. Last April I made a meal, on the travel page, of a hideously irksome flight from London to Bali I had suffered at the hands of Garuda, Indonesia's state airline. The door-to-door travelling time was 28 hours. On and on I whinged. In the months since then, I have flown hither and thither without a single hitch. Should I have reported this, in the interests of balance? Absolutely not. It is the job of airlines to fly people quickly and carefully from one point to another. That is what they are for, how they make their money. The point about the Garuda flight was that thousands of holidaymakers almost certainly did not know that their flight to Bali would stop en route in Paris, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Jakarta, causing distress and jet-smack and gouging into their holidays. (Garuda reacted stoically: I received a classy letter from one of the high-ups, wishing me pleasant travels the next time I flew with them). Some media use ombudsmen to help guard readers' and viewers' interests. In future, I expect to see the appointment of good-news editors to help maintain balance. Suppose that the news editor tells the morning conference that an asteroid is heading for Manchester. Devastation is assured. He is pulling out the stops - ordering page after page of special coverage. He turns to the good-news editor: 'Anything, Rodney?' (Good-news editors are bound to be called Rodney. 'Absolutely, Mark. An asteroid that wipes out Manchester suggests various important angles from the good-news perspective. First, once it is rebuilt, Manchester will be able to launch a viable bid for the Olympic games. There will be no more sniggering. 'Second, the obliteration of Manchester is bound to cause a steep fall in the national crime figures. And so on and so forth. Take my word, Mark: the Manchester asteroid is a good-news asteroid from where I'm sitting.'</p>

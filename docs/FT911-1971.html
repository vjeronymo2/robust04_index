			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (11): The giant leap to a capitalist system  -Martin Wolf investigates the task of privatising some 8,000 substantial state enterprises IT IS a truth almost universally acknowledged that market economies need private owners. Markets without ownership are like a car without an engine: fine for a child (or its bureaucratic equivalent) to play with, but unlikely to get anyone anywhere. The question is how to privatise an economy, 80 per cent of which is at least notionally in state hands. When one recalls that Margaret Thatcher, queen of western privatisers, managed to change the ownership of some two dozen enterprises over 12 years, the scale of the task is clear. Poland has to privatise some 8,000 substantial state enterprises  - 6,000 of which are the responsibility of central government and 2,000 of local government. Worse, their number is growing as enterprises are broken up, to de-monopolise the economy. In spite of the difficulties, the government is determined to proceed rapidly. In the election campaign, Lech Walesa promised to distribute capital to every Pole, but his emphasis on more rapid privatisation clashes with his determination not to reward the old bosses, the nomenklatura. The nomenklatura includes virtually all the old managerial class and much of the new entrepreneurial class. Privatisation that includes the nomenklatura may be politically unacceptable, but privatisation that excludes it looks economically unworkable. Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, insists, however, that 'from a purely economic point of view, management buy-outs would be a good solution. You would have concentrated ownership. You would have insider ownership. This would certainly be much better than to have employee-owned and controlled enterprises.' This latter risk also concerns Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the recently appointed minister for ownership change, whose job it is to accelerate privatisation. Of privatisation of the larger enterprises, for example, he argues that 'if there is no move towards transferable property rights, the result may be an enormous historical experiment in employee shareholding. This is really dangerous, since what we need is mobility, not increased job resistance.' The danger is an almost inevitable by-product of the decision to pursue reform as rapidly as possible. Speed makes for rough and ready solutions, and in Polish circumstances the readiest, if the roughest, is to grant ownership rights to workers who already consider they own their firms. Like Caesar's Gaul, the privatisation programme is divided into three main parts: Classic privatisation, on the British model; Privatisation by liquidation; and Privatisation by voucher. To these should be added the rent of public assets, which Mr Balcerowicz calls 'invisible privatisation. It is this kind of privatisation that was most advanced last year,' he says, 'which is why we have has such a change in retail trade, in transportation and in other services.' About half of retail trade, for example, is now in private hands and, in 1990, more than 58 per cent of the new private enterprises (around 300,000 out of 516,000) were trade enterprises.* The classic route is the sale of a company by way of offer to the public or as a trade sale. Five companies have already been privatised in this way. Two more are to be sold off in May, and five more are ready for sale this year. Starting in May, procedures will be simplified, with the sale of shares on a first-come, first-served basis. The earlier ones were simply 'too sophisticated and complex for Polish circumstances', argues Mr Lewandowski. But the main hope, he feels, is for more trade sales, particularly to foreigners, citing as important examples recent the purchases by Philips of the Netherlands of Poland's largest lighting firm and by Beloit of the US of Fampa, the largest producer of pulp and paper in central and eastern Europe. The minister hopes for about 60 such sales this year. The most successful method so far is 'privatisation by liquidation'. Despite the name, this is not bankruptcy; it is a way of changing the legal status of a state enterprise, generally the smaller ones, in order to sell it. The process started only last December, but more than 100 companies have been liquidated in this way so far, and the minister expects at least 500, and perhaps as many as 900-1,000, in the year as a whole. Such privatisations are initiated by the work-forces and managers of the enterprise, the motives being two-fold: to escape paying dividends to the ministry of finance, and to evade the current strict controls upon wages in state enterprises. Ninety per cent of these privatisations end up as a form of worker-management buy-out. While there is the possibility of either outright sale or simple hire of the assets of the liquidated company, 90 per cent of these arrangements involve inflation-indexed 'lease-purchase' agreements with the treasury. However popular this form of privatisation may have become, Mr Lewandowski is deeply concerned about the economic and political dangers of 'creating capitalism without capital. These are very weak financial entities, whose owners are thinking of repaying debt, not investment; of wages, not rationalisation. There is a danger that many of the enterprises will go bankrupt, which would be a disaster for the whole image of privatisation.' The solution is to let 'our emerging entrepreneurial class have a look in', argues Mr Lewandowski. But he cannot force the workers to accept outside investors. All he can do is convince them that this is in their interest, even if the investor with the money is likely to have an unsavoury past, a questionable present and an unpopular future. Finally, there are vouchers, a scheme that Mr Lewandowski claims as his own. He thinks, however, that Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's finance minister is being unrealistic in his attempts to manage most of the Czechoslovak transformation in this way. For Mr Lewandowski, vouchers are a 'political umbrella over the more commercial methods of privatisation'. In particular, they are a way of involving workers in large enterprises, via their right to 20 per cent of the shares at a discount. The voucher alternative is immensely complex and, despite the minister's pride of ownership in this idea, still under examination. A public announcement is to be made in June. If the government goes ahead, it will be in tranches, with 100 out of 500 large companies in the first slice. In the first round, only 30 per cent of the shares in these companies are likely to be offered to the public, via vouchers. Although the government has decided that the public would own shares in 'Polish Privatisation Funds' that would, in turn, own shares in the companies, the details of how to allocate companies to the funds or vouchers to citizens have not yet been decided. The government is being advised on this by, among others, the newly founded European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. After a slow start, with the basic legislation agreed only last July, Polish privatisation is now accelerating, with the prime minister, Mr Jan Bielecki, determined to privatise half of Poland's state-owned assets within three years. With a central staff of just 150 people, the ministry of ownership change is hopelessly overburdened. Fortunately, this is a collaborative venture, with this ministry working with others on shared programmes. The ministry of finance, for example, is responsible for the commercialisation and privatisation of the banking and insurance sectors. Nevertheless, the task remains huge, and the pitfalls plentiful. The government is, for example, planning for legislation on restitution of former owners. Fearing that this could be a bottleneck, it plans to limit this process more than in other eastern European countries, although this is a matter on which there is disagreement with the president. Poland's choice is only between going full speed ahead, never mind the torpedoes, or sinking where it is. There will be more worker involvement than the economists would like, and more nomenklatura involvement than politicians would prefer. There will be scandals and suspicion. But there will also be private owners - and that is what it is all about. *Paul Hare and Irena Grosfeld, Privatisation in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, Discussion Paper No. 544 (London: Centre for Economic Policy Research, 1991).</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Go-ahead expected for ITV takeovers The Commons is expected to give the formal go-ahead tonight for a fundamental change in the rules governing independent television. Labour will try to block an order implementing the government's overhaul of the licensing regime, but there is no realistic prospect of a Conservative rebellion. The order will facilitate two takeover offers tabled since the government's plans were announced last week by Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary. Carlton Communications, the London broadcaster, has agreed a merger with Central, the Midlands company, and Granada, covering the north-west of England, has made a Pounds 600m hostile bid for London Weekend Television. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's national heritage spokesman, will call for a 12-month extension to the existing moratorium on mergers. She said the government's plans would make Britain the only European country where foreign companies would be allowed to buy 100 per cent of regional broadcasters.</p>

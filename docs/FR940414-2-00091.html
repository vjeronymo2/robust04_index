(``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is proposing to list and trade cash-settled, European-style options on the CBOE Real Estate Investment Trust Index (``REIT Index''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the CBOE, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enable the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style options on an industry index, the CBOE REIT Index, in accordance with CBOE Rule 24.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The REIT Index will reflect a segment of the U.S. equity securities market that currently is not represented in the derivatives markets and, as such, will offer investors a low-cost means to achieve diversification or to tilt a portfolio toward, or away from, real estate investments. The REIT Index will provide retail and institutional investors with a means to benefit from forecasts about the financial performance of real estate investment trusts (``REITs'') and their underlying real estate assets. Options on the index also may be used by portfolio managers and investors to provide a performance measure and evaluation guide for passively or actively managed REITs, and may serve as a means of hedging the risks of investing in real estate generally, and REIT stocks in particular. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The REIT Index is based on twenty-five REIT stocks. Twenty-three of those stocks currently trade on the New York Stock Exchange, and two currently trade on the American Stock Exchange. The REIT Index is price-weighted and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last-sale prices of the securities underlying the index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The REIT Index is composed of stocks that ranged in market capitalization from $220.2 million to $1.1 billion as of February 14, 1994. The median capitalization as of that date was $518.7 million. The stock with the largest weight in the index accounted for 6.5 percent of the total weighting, while the smallest weighted stock accounted for 1.1 percent. Four of the component stocks are currently the subject of trading in equity options, and the balance of the component stocks meet the criteria for listing as equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3. All component stocks are ``reported securities'' under Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The REIT Index will be calculated continuously by the CBOE or its designee, and the index value will be disseminated by the CBOE every 15 seconds. If a component stock currently is not being traded, the most recently traded price will be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is the case with other industry indices that have been approved for trading on the Exchange, the REIT Index is price-weighted, reflecting changes in the prices of the component stocks in relation to the base date of the index, January 3, 1994. The REIT Index is calculated by summing the prices of the component stocks and then dividing by a divisor that yielded an index value of 200.00 as of the base date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The REIT Index will be maintained by the CBOE. To assure continuity in the index following an adjustment to a component security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to, removal and replacement of one component stock, component stock splits, and financial restructuring of a component REIT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

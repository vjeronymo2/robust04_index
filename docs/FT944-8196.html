			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (4): Suppliers are flooding in - Frank Gray takes a look at Asia Western nuclear equipment suppliers, after years of non-growth in their own markets, are now flooding into Asia in search of fresh business that might arise from the region's rapidly expanding electricity supply industry. The big news coming out of the region centres on Taiwan and the People's Republic of China - each of which is close to firming up big orders for large nuclear power complexes as part of their drive to diversify their electricity policies away from near-exclusive dependence on fossil fuels. Mainland China is heading for a potential bonanza and has outlined plans to add 15 new nuclear plants between now and the first decade of the next century. They would have a combined capacity of at least 12,000MW, and most of the key components, such as reactors and turbines, would be imported. In the past two years, China has commissioned its first three reactors, which have 2,100MW of capacity. They are the 1,800MW, two-unit complex at Daya Bay, north of Hong Kong, built by Framatome of France and the Anglo-French GEC-AIsthom. A third 300MW unit, built mainly with Chinese technology, is operating at Qinshan, south of Shanghai at a site being developed for a full family of reactors. In recent weeks, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL) signed an agreement to enter into detailed negotiations for the supply of a two-unit, 1,400MW complex at Qinshan. The proposal, if firmed up, is worth CDollars 2.6bn. It follows a recent announcement by Framatome that it had won a FFrl. 4bn contract to supply equipment for a second 300MW unit at Qinshan. These units would be in addition to China's outline plan to add a series of large reactors in south-eastern China, not far from the Daya Bay complex. The units would provide long-term base-load capacity in one of the country's most rapidly industrialising regions. The potential of the China market is tempered by concerns about its ability to fund such schemes, but no such worries surround the race to win at least Dollars 2bn in contracts to supply Taiwan with 2,300MW of nuclear capacity, to be installed at a new complex inside a national park on the northern tip of the island. Mr Adrian M. T. Wang, vice-chairman of Taiwan's Atomic Energy Council, recently said that the contract to build the two-unit complex would be made before the end of January. Conspicuous bidders were Framatome and Siemens and a US-UK consortium of Westinghouse and Nuclear Electric. Mr Wang said that Taiwan had to accelerate its nuclear programme because of its huge, 93 per cent, dependence on imported energy. Development of the site had been suspended several times since the mid-1980s because of environmental protest. The units would add to Taiwan's existing nuclear capacity of 5,144MW; some 26 per cent of all installed power. The nuclear issue has brought the two Chinas together on the issue of uranium supplies and storage. Taiwan recently agreed in principle to buy uranium concentrate from China in exchange for permission to store the island's nuclear waste at a remote site on the mainland. Japan and South Korea, the number one and two countries in Asia in terms of nuclear capacity, both plan rapid expansion, and Indonesia is planning to begin its own nuclear power programme. Mr. Djali Ahimsa, director-general of Indonesia's National Atomic Energy Agency, said recently that first tenders would be called next year for the supply of Indonesia's first nuclear units, which would be built at Mount Muria in north-central Java. The target date for completion was 2004, with more pairs of units being added regularly thereafter. Indonesia's total capacity now was 10,000MW, but projections called for this to rise to 31,800MW by 2011. Nuclear plants would ease pressure arising from Indonesia's diminishing oil reserves and would free gas and coal for export. After Japan, South Korea has the the world's most ambitious nuclear plant expansion programme. At present, Korea Electric Power operates nine reactors with a capacity of 7,616MW, about 36 per cent of total capacity. By 2006, it plans to have added another 14 units, with a capacity of 12,800MW, boosting nuclear's share of all electricity to 37.7 per cent of total capacity of 45,533MW. By 2031, plans call for a further 18,900MW of nuclear capacity to be added, by which time a total of 7,617MW will have been decommissioned. Most reactors have been supplied by Westinghouse, Atomic Energy of Canada and Framatome, with Korea Heavy Industries increasingly developing its own reactor know-how. Kepco officials are excited by the diplomatic breakthrough with the North, which will mean the installation of 2,000MW of nuclear capacity under western supervision in exchange for Pyongyang's decision to scrap its obsolescent - but potentially lethal - graphite-moderated reactors. In Japan, there is more than 30,000MW of nuclear capacity in operation, but the country's private sector power utilities are falling well behind the government's proposed schedule to add a further 40,000MW by 2010. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) says the time needed to negotiate site acquisition, obtain government and local approval, and construct a nuclear plant is now beyond an acceptable level. It hopes Japan's nine power utilities will build and start operating at least 15 new reactors by 2010, but it foresees this target as difficult to achieve under present socio-political conditions. The leading utilities, led by Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco) are sourcing the most important nuclear components domestically, under licence from GE and Westinghouse. GE is also a leading constructor in its own right, and is in joint venture with Toshiba and Hitachi to install 2,600MW of capacity at Tepco's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power stations, which will open in two phases in 1996-97.

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / People: Kerridge, new Ransomes chairman John Kerridge, who left Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific instrument group, for reasons of ill-health, has found enough energy to extend his interests in gardening. Having already been deputy chairman, he is now to become chairman of Ransomes, the lawnmower group, which is based in Ipswich near his home. He succeeds Astley Whittall who will retire at the agm next April. Kerridge left Fisons, troubled by difficulties with the US Food and Drug Administration, last January. At that time, the company said his departure was due to a heart condition. Bob Dodsworth, Ransomes' chief executive, says there is considerable difference between the stress of being a chief executive and a non-executive chairman. Kerridge will have an interesting challenge helping turn Ransomes round; last year it made a loss of Pounds 4.5m. During the first half of this year it returned to the black, making pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m, but passed its interim dividend.</p>

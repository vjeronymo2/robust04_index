			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Solvency mix-up - Legal Briefs London solicitors Brecher &amp; Co are calling for clarification of a Companies Act requirement for directors of a holding company to make statutory declarations as to the company's solvency where one of its subsidiaries is proposing to give financial assistance for the acquisition of the holding company's shares. Brecher says ambiguity in the legislation has resulted in a misdirection on one of the declaration forms. The form directs holding companies to give declarations about the solvency of the subsidiary instead of the holding company. This could leave directors and auditors open to claims for breach of statutory duty, fines and even criminal sanctions.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts rise steeply on hopes of further base rate cuts UK GOVERNMENT bond prices rose by as much as a point on hopes that interest rates would be cut again soon and by the market's perception that the Bank of England would not issue more paper until the latter part of March. The market's strength enabled the Bank to sell a large part of the Pounds 550m of stock that it announced on Tuesday. Both the Pounds 100m of 2.5 per cent index-linked stock due 2001 and the Pounds 300m 8 per cent gilt due 2003 have been exhausted, and dealers expect the Pounds 150m of 2.5 per cent index-linked gilts due 2009 to be sold in the next few days. The Liffe March gilt futures contract, which opened at 101.00, rose to 102.00 as the contract broke through a chart resistance point. It ended at 101.31 in volume of 47,737 lots. GERMAN government bond prices rose in the afternoon as the slide in the Irish punt raised hopes that the Bundesbank would have to cut interest rates in order to stabilise the ERM. The market's strength, in spite of poor inflation data from the state of Hesse, surprised many dealers who were forced to cover their short positions. The Liffe March bund futures contract rose to 92.91, up 11 basis points in volume of 46,967 lots. THE yield on 10-year Dutch government bonds fell below those on German 10-year bunds by as much as four basis points during the day as good economic fundamentals encouraged demand for Dutch paper. However, some dealers reported switching from Dutch into German paper on hopes of a cut in German interest rates. The new 7 per cent 2003 bond closed at 99.51 up from 99.43 to yield 7.07 per cent. IRISH government bond prices were volatile as the high cost of funding short-term trading positions following the rise in the overnight lending rate to 100 per cent made it difficult to get firm prices from dealers. 'The market is very sensitive at the moment,' one dealer said. The benchmark 9 1/4 Capital stock due 2003 was quoted half a point down at 97.00. ECU-denominated government bond prices were depressed by the renewed tension within the ERM, in spite of the success of the French treasury's auction of Ecu680m worth of 10-year OATs earlier in the day. This marked the first sovereign issue in Ecus since Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty last June. The yield on the new 10-year OAT rose to 8.22 per cent from its average yield at auction of 8.19 per cent. US TREASURY prices firmed yesterday in spite of fresh evidence of stronger economic growth. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 105 1/16 , yielding 7.203 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 1/8 , to yield 4.168 per cent. The market opened firmer in the wake of a report from the commerce department that gross domestic product rose 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter last year. Although the increase was larger than expected, and confirmed that the economy recovery was in full swing at the end of 1992, analysts said that the market chose to focus on the news, in the GDP figures, that the implicit price deflator - an important measure of inflation - rose by just 1.7 per cent in the final three months of last year. Treasury prices were also buoyed by a rumour that Goldman Sachs, the securities house, was recommending an asset allocation switch out of stocks and medium-term Treasuries. The market came off its highs when Goldman denied the story.</p>

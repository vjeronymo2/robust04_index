			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television Given tonight's BBC1 schedule are you surprised that the BBC's audience share keeps falling? Wogan (7.00), always a limp and undemanding show, is now in its seventh year. Harry And The Hendersons (7.35) is a middling American import about a family living with a yeti; useful if you are out of valium. In Sickness And In Health (8.00) has the single strength of Warren Mitchell as Alf Garnett, a character who came to our screens 26 years ago. Caught In The Act (8.30) is a copycat clip show of home video boo-boos, the worst anywhere. The Nine O'Clock News and politics take us to 10.00 and a couple of dud American movies. If this is the best the BBC can do they can hardly expect politicians to champion the licence fee. The best unrepeated comedy is on C4 which has Cheers, (9.00), the consistently funny American series about a singles bar, and Whose Line Is It Anyway?, the improvisation game show (10.30). The best comedy repeat is Victoria Wood on BBC2 (9.00); and the best drama Fay Weldon's Growing Rich (9.00 ITV). It is not the greatest series ever, but there is not much competition.</p>

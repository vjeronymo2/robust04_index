			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Knighthood for Sony chairman BRITAIN is to bestow an honorary knighthood on Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony Corp and champion of deeper Anglo-Japanese ties, the UK embassy in Tokyo said yesterday, Reuter reports. Mr Morita, 71, who conceived the Sony Walkman, is to be made an Honorary Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE). He was involved in Sony's decision to set up a TV factory in Bridgend, Wales, in 1973, the first big manufacturing investment by a Japanese group in Britain. Last year, Sony chose Pencoed in mid-Glamorgan to build a factory making colour TV sets and computer display monitors.</p>

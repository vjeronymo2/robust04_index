			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel active Paying little attention to the better than expected interim results, British Steel put on only a penny at 159 1/2 p with a lively 15m traded as the market continued to peer anxiously ahead to the next cyclical downturn for the group. Having outperformed the market by more than 50 per cent over the past year, the shares have hit the buffers in recent weeks, lagging slightly on a one-month view as fears for a cyclical profits reversal sometime in 1996-97 have taken hold. Cable and Wireless was marginally easier at 383 1/2 p as worries about the company's Mercury unit continued to dog the shares. There was 5.8m turnover yesterday as Robert Fleming Securities reiterated its sell note. In contrast, mobile communications group Vodafone powered ahead in no less than 6.7m shares traded, rising 9 1/2 to 217 1/2 p in advance of what is universally expected to be a bumper set of results early next week. Consumer products retailer Boots attracted attention after it confirmed that it had agreed in principle to sell its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group, for Pounds 850m. The company was generally thought to have negotiated a good price for the sale, although more optimistic analysts were left slightly disappointed, having anticipated a sale price Pounds 50m higher. The move ended months of speculation over what one analyst called 'the world's worst kept secret'. After an initial retreat, Boots closed at 513p ex-dividend, up 5 1/4 , as analysts turned their attention to how the group would use the proceeds of the sale. A share buy-back operation was seen as the most likely move. High street bank Lloyds jumped 13 to 580 1/2 p as dealers said Kleinwort Benson was poised to release a positive note on the clearer. HSBC rose 7 to 728p on a James Capel recommendation and Barclays was restrained by a repetition of UBS's long term caution. Precious metals, car parts and materials technology group Johnson Matthey put on 10 at 581p as analysts reacted enthusiastically to a possible merger with metals and plastic business Cookson Group. The potential deal was described as an important strategic fit. Cookson firmed 1 to 252p. British Aerospace gained 2 1/2 at 463 1/2 p following news of a potential Dollars 1bn aircraft order. The group has won a Dollars 420m order for 25 Jetstream 41s with an option on a further 35. Talk continued that Unigate was planning to buy unlisted Dairy Crest, the UK's biggest cheese maker. Unigate shares eased a penny to 358p, although analysts warned that such a takeover could spark a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation. Wm Morrison Supermarkets saw turnover of 7.5m as the shares hardened a penny to 140p. The day's trading in the stock included a line of around 1m shares switched from J. Sainsbury, which closed at 409 1/2 p xd after trade of 3.2m. High street retailer WH Smith finished 3 lower at 453p, with Nomura said to have reduced its current-year profits estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 140m due to difficulties in trading. Negative press reports on jewellery and luxury products group Asprey saw the shares surrender 11 to 146p. Chemicals group BOC improved 6 to 710p ahead of figures expected today. However, much of the sector was restrained by concern over companies' inability to pass on the price of raw materials to customers following Wardle Storeys' figures. British Vita retreated 7 to 222p. Monument Oil &amp; Gas received support from an in-depth analysis of the sector published by Smith New Court. The shares were firm at 69p. Other statistics, Page 41</p>

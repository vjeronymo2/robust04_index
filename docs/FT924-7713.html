			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets had a very active session yesterday as professional investors strove to come to terms with the UK autumn economic statement, delivered on Thursday by the UK chancellor of the exchequer, writes Terry Byland. It was also the last day of the two week trading account in the equity market and profit-taking was reflected in arbitraging in stock index futures. Hefty turnover of around 10,000 contracts saw the FT-SE December futures contract lose the real premium held over the week to close at 12 points premium against cash; the fair value premium, allowing for impending dividend flows and financing costs, was around 14 last night but will be adjusted downwards to 9 points on Monday when the new equity account opens. In traded options, business in individual share contracts receded sharply to 27,109 contracts from 40,377 in the previous session. But activity in the FT-SE contract, at 12,208 against 10,275, reflected arbitraging between futures and the cash market.</p>

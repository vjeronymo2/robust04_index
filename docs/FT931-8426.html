			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs warn Clinton on Ulster US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was warned not to 'meddle' in the affairs of Northern Ireland by Tory backbenchers in the Commons yesterday. With varying degrees of irony Mr John Bowis (C Battersea) and Mr Nick Budgen (C Wolverhampton South West) suggested that the principle of reciprocity should apply in the event of any American interference in the province. Mr Bowis said an envoy as a 'fact finder' and a supporter of the British government's policy on Ulster would be welcome. 'But if he (Clinton) sends somebody to meddle, then it would be as offensive as this country sending somebody to look into the problems on the Mexican border.' But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, who hopes to meet new US officials in the next few months, played down their fears. He said it was his experience that people who visited Northern Ireland seeking to find out the facts of the situation went back 'wiser and happier'. He recalled that the members of one American delegation had publicly announced that it would be their purpose to correct in the media the 'wholly false impression of Northern Ireland' current in the US.</p>

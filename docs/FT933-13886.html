			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu to cut staff by 6,000 FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer company, is reducing its workforce by 6,000 in the next two years in an attempt to lower fixed costs and improve profits in the face of the continuing weak demand. The company aims to cut its payroll mainly through natural wastage, by recruiting fewer new employees and seconding employees to affiliates and subsidiaries which have or are being set up. Fujitsu has already established a group within its personnel department to assist employees interested in finding jobs outside the company. The company, which owns ICL, the UK computer group, emphasised yesterday that its plan involved moving only those employees who wished to do so and said that there was absolutely no question of forced redundancy. However, its decision reflects the growing strains on the company which has suffered a sharp downturn in business as Japanese companies have cut back on investment in information technology. For the year ended March, Fujitsu reported a loss of Y8.7bn (Dollars 81m), the group's first deficit since it was listed on the Tokyo stock market in 1949. It faces growing pressure on its mainframe computer business as well as increased competition in the PC market, where US makers have stepped up their marketing efforts and launched a price war in Japan. The company has already taken steps to try to deal with the changed market environment. It has implemented a restructuring programme and recruitment has been slashed from a peak of 3,870 in 1991 to just 300 for next year.</p>

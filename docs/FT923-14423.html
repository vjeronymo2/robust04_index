			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Management (GEC At The Crossroads): Marriages of convenience  -Part Three, Charles Leadbeater looks at the group's joint ventures Six days into the new year of 1989, the relaxed calm of a Friday afternoon at General Electric Company's headquarters was shattered by bad tidings from the City. A plot was afoot to assemble an international consortium called Metsun; its purpose to dismember GEC, the company which Lord Weinstock had spent almost 30 years building up. This was his most perilous time at the helm of GEC. The company's future hung in the balance and he knew that if the Metsun bid succeeded, GEC's dismembered parts would be carried off by a hungry pack of international competitors. He also knew that to see off the threat GEC needed to take some fateful decisions itself. In three months of hectic negotiations that winter GEC formed three vital joint ventures. The alliances were not solely a response to the threat of takeover but the combined effect was that GEC conceded shared sovereignty over large parts of its business. These alliances now generate about a third of GEC's Pounds 9.4bn turnover and 43 per cent of its operating profits. If they were to unravel GEC could be cut off from its paths to international growth. The roots of the drama lay in 1986 when GEC made its initial bid for its close rival, Plessey. GEC wanted to combine their businesses, making telecommunications equipment and defence electronics. The aim was to rationalise the British electronics industry in the way it had the electrical industry more than 20 years before. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission rejected GEC's bid because it feared competition in defence markets would be eroded. But GEC remained under pressure to expand by acquisition. The City was breathing down Lord Weinstock's neck, keen he should spend the Pounds 1bn cash mountain the group had accumulated. Lord Weinstock's way around monopolies obstacle was to bring in Siemens. The German company would help to provide GEC and Plessey's telecommunications businesses with the scale they desperately needed. Siemens would buy some of Plessey's defence activities to alleviate the Ministry of Defence's concern over GEC's growing monopoly in defence electronics. This revived interest in Plessey, however, rebounded upon GEC. Its record was subjected to unrelenting public scrutiny and Plessey came out fighting. It became a prime mover in Metsun. The consortium was orchestrated by Lazards, the merchant bank, fronted by Sir John Cuckney, then chairman of Westland, and backed by Barclays Bank. And even more menacingly this grouping tried to entice General Electric and AT&amp;T of the US to join a bid. The threat was great. But before Metsun could take shape Lord Weinstock announced his second major European joint-venture, a wide-ranging deal with Alsthom of France to create an engineering business with turnover of about Pounds 5bn. The deal was finalised at Lord Weinstock's country house in Wiltshire. A few days later, when the venture was announced, Metsun broke cover. Lord Weinstock knew he must then move swiftly to head off the threat of a bid. It took him just a week to break up the consortium. He started secret talks with Mr Jack Welch, General Electric's chairman, and lured the US group away from Metsun. He and Mr Welch agreed a joint-venture in consumer appliances, while GEC promised to pull out of the European medical electronics market to give GE a clearer run. The US group was also brought into the alliance with Alsthom, supplying gas turbine technology. That agreement sounded the death knell for Metsun, and four months later the monopolies commission cleared the joint bid for Plessey. Now the ring of joint ventures makes it extremely unlikely that GEC will ever be broken up: most of the companies which once might have launched a bid are signed up as the group's allies. GEC executives discount the risk that the partners - Siemens, Alsthom and GE  -might club together to carve up their partner. 'They dislike one another more than they dislike us,' says one. But how much might GEC eventually have to pay for the construction of this Maginot line of joint ventures? Has the group warded off a break up bid only to risk allowing the company to dissolve gently as it loses control to partners who have stronger management, international market positions or technology? These ventures have opened up avenues for GEC to expand internationally, particularly into continental Europe where it was weak and where opportunities for large acquisitions were virtually non-existent. However, they could also be a disguise for its lack of international scale and competitiveness in industries such as telecommunications. Indeed, has GEC been forced to look for partners because it lacks the resources to succeed internationally on its own? The three ventures are quite different in their aims, the way they work and what they could mean for GEC's future: Mr Bruce Enders' bright red Lotus Elan sports car sticks out like a sore thumb in the drab corporate car park at the Hotpoint refrigerator factory in Peterborough. The American managing director of GEC's consumer appliances partnership with GE explains: 'I decided to get a British sports car because I did not want to stir up any union trouble.' He is shaking up Hotpoint and Creda, GEC's consumer goods companies which make refrigerators, cookers and washing machines. Surprisingly little was done to rationalise Hotpoint and Creda's overlapping activities when they were solely-owned by GEC. Obvious opportunities to cut costs were not taken. Now change has been forced upon Hotpoint by the UK recession and the alliance with GE is also driving reform. Mr Enders, who used to work for GE in the US, has brought in total quality programmes. The legions of suppliers are being pruned and products are being redesigned to make them cheaper to manufacture. At least two of the group's five factories will be closed this year. For GEC the partnership has brought access to the US group's research on new products. For GE the UK has become a further outlet for US-made components. Hotpoint's future is clear: it fits neatly into GE's worldwide strategy for consumer appliances. This is the latest in a string of consumer appliance joint-ventures which GE has formed around the hub of its large US businesses. As yet there are very few GE components in a Hotpoint washing machine or refrigerator. But the number will grow and Hotpoint will gradually become more entwined with its US partner. GE sees no need to buy the company to secure that relationship. The alliance serves its purpose for both companies. Their ambitions are strictly limited to consumer products. Initial plans that it should be the starting point for a much larger European business have been quietly shelved. GEC-Alsthom is a different kettle of fish altogether. It is by far the most impressive venture, based upon the best Britain and France can offer in making heavy equipment such as generators and turbines for power stations, locomotives and rolling stock for railways. The venture was not a response to the threat of takeover. World demand for power stations fell precipitously in the 1980s. That created huge overcapacity, which forced all producers to cut costs. In 1988 Asea of Sweden and Brown Boveri of Switzerland led the way by merging to create an integrated pan-European business. GEC and Alsthom realised they had to respond or the ABB giant might stride ahead. This was compounded by problems GEC and Alsthom had in their own countries. In the UK electricity privatisation created demand for power stations driven by gas turbines. GEC does not make gas turbines for power stations. As Mr Mike Barrett, now in charge of GEC-Alsthom's steam turbine division puts it: 'We had to find a partner who could make gas turbines to get a share of the market. We could have been in desperate straits otherwise.' GE of the US which has the best gas turbine technology, has made it available to Alsthom through an intimate relationship forged over two decades. Alsthom's access to GE's technology made it a natural partner for GEC. Alsthom, the engineering arm of Alcatel-Alsthom, was already conducting its own search for a partner because the French nuclear programme, which had sustained it for years, was in decline. It got close to a deal with Siemens, but pulled out because the Germans wanted control. The French then found there was a very good fit with GEC, the only serious overlap being in manufacturing capacity for steam turbines, and the deal was done. The venture got off to a rocky start. A clutch of UK orders for coal-fired power stations, which had filled GEC's order book, were suddenly cancelled. The first gas turbine orders in the UK went to competitors such as Siemens. But GEC-Alsthom has overcome these teething problems. Its order book has grown to Ecu14.5bn (Pounds 10bn), compared with Ecu10bn (Pounds 7bn) three years ago. It is the leading UK supplier of power station gas turbines and has just won an important order in Holland to build one of the largest combined-cycle gas turbine station in the world. The venture's pre-tax profits have risen from Ecu346m in 1989-90 to about Ecu440m this year as its profit margins have widened from 4.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent. Managers on both sides of the channel are fired by a sense of dynamism. Red brick factories in France and Britain which have made power equipment since the 19th century are being modernised. According to Mr Kelvin Bray, chief executive of European Gas Turbines, the venture's gas turbine arm, who has worked for GEC for almost 30 years: 'It has given us momentum, size and reputation.' From GEC-Alsthom's large plant in the fortress town of Belfort in northern France, Mr Claude Descroix, the genial plant manager, a veteran of the Concorde project, offers another explanation: 'We need a counterweight against German influence in Europe, politically and industrially. That is why this must work.' British and French managers mix in a relaxed fashion. French engineers are more theoretical than the British, who tend to be more pragmatic in finding solutions to problems. The British tolerate the French managers' love of long-term strategic thinking, while the French tolerate British commercialism. GEC's financial controls were introduced six months after the merger. Alsthom's managers used to make general financial reports once every six months. Now they make much more detailed reports once a month. This financial rigour has already started to bear fruit. Mr Pierre Bilger, GEC-Alsthom's chief executive, says: 'Lord Weinstock has shown us how to use a financial system to understand a business. In France we have frequently felt it was negative and destructive to reduce the business to figures. Lord Weinstock has shown us how to put flesh on the figures.' The British managers have a spring in their step. Mr Jim Cronin, GEC-Alsthom's finance director says they have been quick to pledge their loyalty to the venture: 'GEC had no corporate identity abroad. They have that for the first time with GEC-Alsthom.' There are, however, two potential sources of tension in this close relationship. The first is the strength of French management. Some at GEC believe the French are quietly taking over by stealth. Most of the top jobs are filled by French executives. The most plausible explanation for this is the sheer quality of French management and their greater facility with language - Mr Bilger learnt English in six months, most English managers are still struggling with the basics of French. The second factor is the two companies' different characters which stem from serving very different customers. Alsthom was fed by France's commitment to nuclear power. GEC invested heavily in nuclear power for little return before electricity privatisation threw the UK nuclear programme into disarray. Alsthom's strength in railway locomotives reflects the French government's 20-year-old commitment to the TGV high-speed train. The French are bemused by the British government's equivocation over investment in rail. Last month GEC-Alsthom won orders worth Pounds 509m from European railway companies for 27 high-speed trains, beating off competition from Siemens. In contrast British Rail this spring placed a Pounds 140m order for commuter trains with Brel, an affiliate of ABB, casting a dark shadow over the future of GEC's train making operations. The strength of Alsthom's base may tip the balance of power to the French. But it seems unlikely that the merger will break up or unravel. Lord Weinstock describes it as rock solid. And Mr Bilger says: 'This merger is dictated by common interests. The factors which brought us together are not going to disappear.' GEC-Alsthom is the extension to continental Europe of GEC's main achievement in the UK, the rationalisation of traditional heavy engineering. GEC is confident on this familiar terrain. The same cannot be said of the other major joint-venture, the alliance with Siemens. The troubled history of Britain's telecommunications industry cartel still haunts this venture: GPT, which is 40 per cent owned by Siemens and 60 per cent by GEC. When Mr Karl Heinz Kaske, Siemens' chairman, and Lord Weinstock planned the Plessey takeover they envisaged it would be the foundation for an alliance encompassing telecommunications, defence electronics and research activities. Those plans came to nought because of the US Department of Defense's objections to Siemens' ownership of US defence companies. This forced the two partners to redraw their plans for defence electronics. And once the Plessey bid succeeded it did not take long for the two companies to find they had very different approaches to business. Most of Siemens' research is centralised. At GEC it is decentralised. Siemens has a hierarchical management structure. GEC is highly informal. Mr Tony Cobbe, managing director of GPT's telecommunication systems division, has no doubts about the importance of the partnership with Siemens. He says: 'Without it we could not afford to be involved in the next generation of big digital telecommunications switches. With this partnership we should be in the top five in the At the GPT factory on the outskirts of Liverpool, Mr Peter Gershon, the squat, energetic managing director brought in from the computer industry about two years ago, is unsparing in his account of the problems faced. GPT's traditional business, supplying System X, the main digital switch used by British Telecommunications, is in decline and that threatens to open a gaping hole in the company's finances, unless it can generate additional income from new products such as video conferencing and mobile telephones. Success in these markets will require a revolution in manufacturing and marketing approach. Mr Gershon is leading a ruthless clear out of the company's old management and ideas. Only one member of the GPT board is left from 18 months ago. The workforce has been cut by about 20 per cent to 16,000 and the introduction of some tighter financial disciplines this year has turned GPT into one of the main sources of the Pounds 350m growth in GEC's cash reserves to Pounds 876m. But the aim is not just to cut costs; it is also to push GPT in a new direction. This change is being forced upon it as the UK telecommunications market is opened up to competition. Thus a financial fence has been erected around GPT's traditional business of supplying BT, to prevent it consuming the resources, technology and management which GPT's new businesses need to generate growth. Before, all the businesses used to carry some of the burden of the large overheads for the System X work. As a result many of the smaller businesses could not make the kind of returns needed to survive. Now they only have to cover their own overheads and this has reduced the financial burden upon them. The new businesses come in two varieties. First, a range of new products, such as sophisticated public pay phone systems, video conferencing and mobile telephones is being developed. Second, the company is trying to turn itself into a telecommunications software house. Computer software is becoming increasingly important in telephone systems, to integrate switches, exchanges and handsets. GPT wants to provide the software for Siemens' hardware. Mr Steve Harbour, GPT's marketing director says: 'We are ahead of Siemens in this area because the liberalisation of the British telecommunications market has forced us to examine what customers want.' Back at head office, senior GEC executives believe the relationship with Siemens is stable. Lengthy negotiations over Vision One, the Dollars 2bn joint research programme to develop the next generation of large switches and mobile telephones have settled the most difficult question: how much each company would put into research. However, many within GEC harbour doubts about the alliance's prospects. A senior GEC non-executive director highlights several areas of potential weakness: 'GPT's capacity to stay with the game is not that convincing even with the link to Siemens. The German company has not put all its telecommunications resources into GPT, which means GPT's interests do not always coincide with Siemens'. The short-term nature of GEC's financial controls makes it difficult for GEC to think about the future in the way that Siemens does.' There are three main sources of tension. The relationship is technologically unequal. GPT's technological dependence upon Siemens' strength in semi-conductors is reflected in Vision One. Not only is Siemens leading more projects than GPT, it is leading the big projects on public switches and mobile telephones. GPT is fitting into Siemens' plans as a specialist sub-contractor. The shareholding structure is unequal. This is not really a joint venture. Siemens has bought a minority stake in GEC's telecommunications business, but it has kept its own telecommunications business, which is Siemens' largest single division with a turnover of DM 11.26bn, completely separate. The two parent companies' management approaches are very different. Mr Walsh remarked: 'We have to be more organised to work with Siemens, play to agreed rules. They do not like doing things by the seat of their pants, they are much more formal and a bit insular.' It seems unlikely that GPT will break up, if only because financial pressures will encourage GEC and Siemens to stay together. It is almost certain that eventually Siemens will want to translate its technical predominance into management control by buying GEC's stake. But that is not on the cards at the moment. Lord Weinstock explains: 'There is no reason to think about selling to Siemens at the moment because we do not need the money. We have got cash building up again and we have just gone through tortuous negotiations to settle the business down.' Siemens has some much bigger problems of its own to sort out - the losses at Siemens-Nixdorf, the computer maker, the financial drain of its semi-conductor business and its ailing nuclear power activities. For the foreseeable future the two partners will rub along together, trapped in a rather loveless marriage. As a senior Stanhope Gate executive describes it: 'With the French there is a friendliness, there may be arguments but there is a lot of bonhomie. Siemens has to have big meetings and they have to do things very laboriously.' But for GEC the success or failure of these ventures needs to be judged against the purposes they serve. Financially they make sound sense. GEC-Alsthom should generate good profits, as Alsthom's technology pulls in the orders and GEC's financial controls drive down costs. Similarly, savings at GPT contributed to GEC's cash gains last year. Also, by demerging the group through joint-ventures, GEC's sprawling activities have become more manageable. This is reflected in the impetus the ventures have delivered to GEC managers. Long-standing weaknesses which were not adequately addressed when these businesses were run by GEC are now being addressed: GE is helping to rationalise consumer appliances; a revolution is under way at GPT; and at GEC-Alsthom the British managers are revelling in a new found sense of identity and purpose. The vital telecommunications and engineering ventures are the route GEC needs to take if businesses oriented to Britain and the Commonwealth are to gain a European base. In the past three years GEC's profits from continental Europe have risen by 42 per cent to Pounds 199m, offsetting a sharp decline in the UK. The GEC-Alsthom merger has created a business which should become one of the best companies in Europe. It is in excellent shape to take on the likes of Siemens or ABB, and GEC has found a European home for much of the UK's heavy engineering inheritance which is the envy of many of its competitors. The alliance with Siemens does not have the same momentum. GEC's achievements in forming the venture with Siemens look feeble compared to the giant strides Alcatel of France made by buying ITT's European business - a move that made it one of the largest telecommunications groups in the world. However the venture has given GPT much needed breathing space. Each of the ventures has a good rationale. But what of their consequences? GEC's consumer appliances business is being remodelled by a manager from GE who will take it ever closer to its US partner. French managers dominate the senior ranks of GEC-Alsthom. And Siemens' technology means it will dominate and probably eventually control the telecommunications venture. GEC is increasingly at one remove from the management of the assets which generate a rising share of its profits. The joint ventures are unlikely to lead to GEC being broken up by stealth. But it may become a semi-detached industrial group.</p>

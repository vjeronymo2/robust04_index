			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: TI/Cray TI's sale of Dowty's information technology business to Cray Electronics was executed with a speed and at a price which suggests total lack of sentiment. That was more or less what was promised at the time of the bid and still looks the right strategy. Dowty's dithering did little to enhance the value of the business. It has at least now been sold at a price some Pounds 5m higher than its Pounds 45m book value. Given its operating profits of just Pounds 1.5m last year, the disposal is hardly dilutive. By contrast, there was never much chance of finding a buyer for the Cognito mobile paging business, which has been haemorrhaging cash at a rate of Pounds 1m a month. The closure will involve writing off the Pounds 21m at which Cognito was valued in Dowty's books as well as a modest cash outlay on redundancies. Even if Dowty had been less attached to Cognito, that would have meant a provision it could ill afford. TI will doubtless be able to absorb the impact in the general balance sheet adjustments which follow an acquisition. It certainly will not be charged above the line, though that may lay the company open to fresh criticism of its accounting policies. As for Cray, the purchase is a large morsel. But it makes much more strategic sense than last year's abortive attempt to buy SD-Scicon. Cray has every chance of improving on the Dowty division's margins without the need for heavy additional investment. The acquisition is being financed through a rights issue. After banking the proceeds from its recent sale of Malvern Instruments, it should moreover be in the happy position of seeing its gearing fall to zero from 142 per cent at the start of its last financial year.</p>

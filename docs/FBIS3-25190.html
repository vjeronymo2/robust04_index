[Arouca] My visit to Europe began in Rome, where I was  received by his holiness the pope in a joint audience and with  the treatment accorded to heads of state. I was very impressed  with the treatment that the Vatican accorded to my wife and me.  We had a brief exchange of views. I sent photographs of the  meeting to the Mozambican press, but they were not published.  That was true sabotage. In instances where the photographs  were published, they were so small one could hardly see them.  It is regrettable that local journalists should act like this.    The audience at the Vatican had been arranged two weeks in  advance through the regular channels. Everything went according  to legal procedures. In Rome, I also met a number of  politicians with whom I exchanged views. I saw to it that  protocols of cooperation were signed between Fumo [Mozambique  United Front-Democratic Convergence Party] and those parties.  Fumo succeeded in doing that. Right now we are in contact with  those parties, and the indications are that such contacts will  continue.    In Bonn, I visited the Konrad Adenauer and Friedrich Ebert  Foundations. We have succeeded in establishing positive  relations with those foundations.    In Lisbon, I met with the Christian Democratic Party. I  think this is the only party that is in contact with UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. The  other Portuguese parties have adopted a leftist stance and enjoy  very strong relations with Angola's MPLA [Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola] and Mozambique's Frelimo [Mozambique  Liberation Front]. I did not try to establish contacts with  those parties. I have tried to do so in the past, but to no  avail. In fact, the only party that has maintained relations  with non-Marxist parties from the former colonies is the  Christian Democratic Party.    By the way, some time ago, in an article signed by J.M.,  DOMINGO said I had been a CDS [Social Democratic Center]  militant. I must point out that I have never been a militant in  any Portuguese party. Actually, the Portuguese know that I have  been the Fumo leader since 1976. After all, no citizen may  belong to two parties at the same time. It would be wrong for  me to be the leader of one party and a militant in another. The  insinuation appeared in that newspaper, and I think it was  shrouded in a certain degree of malice. In any event,  ill-intentioned deeds stay with those who practice them and not  with those at whom they are leveled.    Going back to the visit, I must tell you that I do not wish  to go into further details to prevent sabotage and a blockade by  certain adversaries.    [Manuel] You have often been referred to as the Catholic  Church's ticket in the upcoming elections. This has to do with  your meeting with the pope and your frequent contacts with  [Mozambican Cardinal] Dom Alexandre. What are your comments?    [Arouca] This was my first contact with the pope, and I do  not know if there will be others. As for Dom Alexandre, my  contacts with him date back more than 30 years, when he was a  mere village priest in Jangamo, in the outlaying areas of  Inhambane. Afterward, he served as a priest in Homoine, where I  think he was born.... When I was studying in Portugal, I used to  come to Mozambique on vacation, and usually I met with him and  talked to him. He is rather close to my family and knows my  parents and all my relatives. That cemented our friendship at a  time when none of us dreamed that he would become a cardinal.    I did not see him while I was in exile in Portugal, but we  resumed our contacts after I returned. My contacts with him are  not political at all--far from it. I do not expect to be backed  by the church as a candidate for the simple reason that, as a  jurist, I am supposed to know that canonical law prohibits the  involvement of the church in political schemes. Aware of that  reality, I have nurtured neither the will, desire, ambition, nor  whim of becoming a candidate backed by the church. The church  cannot meddle in politics, and I uphold that centuries-old  principle, which is part and parcel of the basic laws of that  institution.    I maintain relations with many bishops in Mozambique, but  these are purely relations of friendship. I am a believer and  was brought up to following the austere principles of religion.  My entire family is Christian. The claim that I might become  the church's candidate is not true.    [Manuel] Elections are scheduled to take place in about nine  months. How does Fumo envisage its electoral strategy?    [Arouca] Right now, we are formulating our strategy. For  obvious reasons, I cannot give you the details. We have,  however, made a great deal of progress in this regard, more than  in other areas. We regret that the process is marred by so many  disturbances, discrepancies, and setbacks. Yet, I think that  this is the price we ought to pay for the establishment of  democracy in Mozambique.    Will the process evolve normally? I think that it will,  although there are signs looming on the political horizon that  there could be serious political disturbances. In any event,  there is a great deal of goodwill for the process to move  forward quickly and clearly. I think the Mozambican people will  do their best so that the process is neither halted nor  disrupted.    We are following it with attention and will do our best to  see that what has happened and is happening in Angola does not  take place in Mozambique. I am optimistic.    [Manuel] There seems to be a great deal of polarization  about  Frelimo and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance], with each  claiming to be the champions of democracy. What role will the  unarmed opposition parties play?    [Arouca] Frelimo and Renamo have not started democracy in  Mozambique, unless one thinks that those who ruined the country,  carried out destruction, and caused 1 million deaths and 4  million refugees have established democracy.... It is the  people who started democracy.    I have read in several newspapers that Dhlakama and Chissano  are natural candidates. This implies that all the others are  unnatural candidates. How this can be natural is something that  is beyond my comprehension. Are natural candidates those who  waged war, ordered massacres, and ruined the country's  infrastructures and unnatural candidates the ones who stood for  democracy through dialogue? I do not quite understand that.    The unarmed parties have a very important role to play in  this political process. What needs to be known is whether we  will be able to play that role efficiently in these  circumstances. If there are no major splits among the unarmed  parties and if there is a balanced understanding between the  opposition and the powers that be, I think the unarmed parties  could play a decisive role.    Right now, I am in touch with some of the political leaders,  specifically to encourage them to understand that unity is  fundamental for the opposition to win. One must always bear the  following in mind: If, for some reason, Frelimo wins the next  elections, it would be very difficult to remove it from power.  The opposition's main opportunity to achieve this is during the  first elections, not during succeeding elections.    [Manuel] Are you suggesting that the opposition should form  a  coalition?    [Arouca] I do not know whether it will be a coalition, a  unity, or a front. As I see it, the opposition ought to have a  strategy that is as unified as possible if it wants to win the  elections. If the opposition remains divided, none of the  parties will go very far.    [Manuel] And have your calls been welcomed by those leaders?    [Arouca] Well, the parties that I have spoken to have been  receptive and understanding. In fact, I expect my contacts will  result in the establishment of a force capable of winning the  elections, and that is very important for this country.    [Manuel] As far as I know, your political career is quite a  long one. How do you see yourself as a candidate for the  Presidency of the Republic in the upcoming elections?    [Arouca] In January 1993, Fumo held its first national  congress. During this congress, it was decided that I would be  the natural candidate to run in the first democratic elections.  I accepted that decision with a degree of satisfaction, and I  have made arrangements to play that role in a positive manner.  Yet, contrary to what some people may think, I have no ambition  or personal interest in becoming president of the Republic.  Throughout my life, I have been invited to play senior roles,  both by the Portuguese Government during the colonial era and by  Frelimo after independence.    I refused to collaborate with Portugal because I did not  want  to side with colonialism. I refused to work with Frelimo  because I did not want to throw in my lot with the establishment  of communism in my fatherland.    In view of this, I could ask: So, why am I running for the  post now? I have accepted it for a number of reasons. I can  explain some of them. First, I have been in politics for some  40 years and a lawyer for about 30 years. That has given me  some political, administrative, and juridical experience. I  clearly understand that it is my duty to serve the country. All  of us are not enough to tackle the task of reconstruction.    Moreover, it is my view that people may only conscientiously  exercise their right to vote if there are at least three or four  candidates for the presidency. At least one of them should be a  civilian who was not involved in the war or responsible for the  situation the country faces today. Only this will permit the  people to choose their candidate. To say that the candidates  are Chissano and Dhlakama is to force one to choose a soldier.  I reject that. It is not democracy. The people have the right  to choose between soldiers and civilians, but not between two  soldiers.    This is one of the reasons why my candidacy will be  announced. It does not matter whether I am elected. What  matters is that the people may clearly and conscientiously make  a choice.    Another reason for my decision is that I think this country  is like a train that has derailed into a swamp of corruption and  stagnation. If I am elected, my priority will be to put the  train back on track, to head it in the right direction, and to  put it into motion. Later, power will be handed over to the  younger generation because I feel that it is the country's young  people who should lead the nation.    Another reason is that after I saw the direction in which  Frelimo's reforms were heading and the manner in which the  Frelimo government operated, I realized that no significant  change can take place in this country as long as Frelimo remains  in power.    The priority for the opposition is to remove Frelimo from  power. These are some of the reasons. Personally, I think that  being president of the Republic is a sacrifice, although one  that every citizen ought to endure for the sake of his  fatherland. Only people without occupations or professions  yearn to be president.    [Manuel] It has become quite clear that the ability of  governments to rule in a country like ours is declining in favor  of international financial institutions like the IMF and the  World Bank. How do you think you would fulfill your program  under such conditions?    [Arouca] These institutions have not parachuted into the  country. They entered the country because the Frelimo  government created so much poverty and misery that it became  necessary for the IMF and the World Bank to come here. If the  Frelimo government had worked differently, it would not be in  such a tight situation today.    The way out of this? I am not the one to tell you. Frelimo  has its own experts, and it should solve its own problems.    [Manuel] It seems that Fumo has not been able to escape the  tradition of crisis that is the hallmark of opposition parties.  Recently, the removal of its vice president was announced. How  do you assess the situation in your party?    [Arouca] Dr. Carlos Jeque has not been removed. He resigned  for personal reasons, and these need to be resolved. I think he  felt he could not give his best to the party because of those  reasons. He has not been removed from the party, and there is no  crisis whatsoever. He merely ceased to be the vice president, a  very demanding post.    [Manuel] Your name has been cited as being linked to a  project for the creation of a democratic institute in  Mozambique. What are your comments?    [Arouca] I have such a plan. I embarked on it because, nine  months before the elections, there are areas in the country  where people do not even know that a multiparty system is in  place. They still think that we live in a single-party system.    As a government, Frelimo should shoulder the responsibility  of effectively educating the people. Frelimo does not do it  because it is not interested. What matters for Frelimo is that  people continue to think that only Frelimo exists and that it  might even be dangerous to vote for another party.    I think there should be a nonpartisan body so that parties  may join hands, organize teams, meet the rural population, and  tell them that the situation has changed, how it has changed,  and what their rights are. I think this is fundamental and  urgent.    [Manuel] In recent statements to MEDIAFAX, the Renamo leader  accused you of serious violations, embezzling his movement's  funds, and so on. You have never commented on this publicly.  Why?    [Arouca] I have never commented on it because these  accusations are not worth commenting on. These accusations  should not only be made; they should be proved, as well. When  the Renamo leader produces evidence of what he is saying, you  may rest assured that I will then refute it because what he said  has never taken place. He has probably ignored what has  happened. He ignored the fact that I was invited to lead Renamo  when it was still called MNR [Mozambique National Resistance]  and before he was around. I turned down the invitation. First  of all, I am against war, and Renamo always had a militaristic  outlook. I think that problems between Mozambicans should be  resolved through frank and loyal dialogue, not through arms. We  all know how to start wars, but no one knows how they will end.    Second, Renamo was created a year after I established Fumo,  a  party more in line with my political philosophy. General  Dhlakama probably ignores that. He ignores the history of his  own party. He should be better informed. Dhlakama has the bad  habit of making wild statements against everybody without  proving what he says. That is not suitable for a candidate for  the presidency of the Republic. This strange attitude is  gradually disqualifying him.    He is well aware of the accident that claimed the life of  former Ambassador Ataide--who was accompanied by Mateus--who was  known as Dhlakama's personal representative in Europe. He  knows, like I do, how they died and where they died, although  their bodies have never been found. It would be better if  Dhlakama abstains from talking about things about which he does  not seem to be well informed.    In one of his interviews, Dhlakama said I was rather old.  That is true, and I am only honored by that statement. It  gives greater legitimacy to my candidacy. I think candidates  ought to be somewhat old to be perceived as honest. I would  like to remind him that Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC  [African National Congress], is 72; UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali is 72; and, if I am not mistaken, Dr. Mario Soares,  president of the Portuguese Republic, today regarded as one of  Europe's most brilliant statesmen and already mentioned as the  successor to Butrus-Ghali, is also about 72. They are all much  older than I. Nobody has said that Mandela, Butrus-Ghali, or  Mario Soares are too old to perform their duties efficiently.    This only shows that the older people are, the more mature,  experienced, and useful they become. In fact, power should be  exercised by experienced people with suitable academic  qualifications and not by adventurers.</p>

Business Economics Department deputy  director-general Khanitson Nawanukok said the conclusion was  reached after an evaluation of the Indonesian tariff reduction  program that was implemented on January 8.    He said the department found that Thailand is theoretically  qualified to enjoy the preferential AFTA rates for 69 percent of  the 1,941 items because it has already cut its tariffs on those  items to 20 percent or lower, the condition required for AFTA  members to be eligible to utilise the benefits of other  countries' tariff cuts. But Thailand would benefit from cuts to  only 8 percent of the products because most of the cuts were  granted to items which Indonesia does not import from Thailand,  he said. Indonesian imports from Thailand accounted for only 1.3  percent of total Indonesian imports in 1992.    Mr Khanitson said the items on which Thailand would  immediately receive benefits were rice milling machinery and  liquid measuring equipment of which Indonesia imported 33  million baht from Thailand in 1992. He said there were some  items which Indonesia imported of significant value from  Thailand but Thailand did not receive benefits from the tariff  cuts because the Thai tariff rate was still high, such as  cardboard and mineral water for which Thailand has tariffs of 40  percent and 45 percent respectively. Indonesia imported  cardboard from Thailand worth 57 million baht and mineral water  worth 25 million baht in 1992.    Other Thai products which Indonesia imports huge amounts of,  such as nylon synthetic yarn and machinery, did not receive  tariff cuts. Indonesia plans to reduce the tariff on these  products in 1995-96.    Mr. Khanitson said Singapore and Brunei benefitted from 100  percent of the Indonesian tariff cuts, compared to 70 percent  for Malaysia and 58 percent for the Philippines.</p>

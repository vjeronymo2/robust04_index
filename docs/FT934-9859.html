			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Loans rise lifts hopes of recovery: Consumer borrowing at highest for 3 1/2 years HOPES THAT the economy is on course for recovery were boosted yesterday by government figures showing a sharp rise in consumer loans. Net borrowing by consumers from building societies, finance houses and on credit cards operated by the Visa and Mastercard systems rose to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 489m in September, the highest figure for more than 3 1/2 years and the second successive monthly rise. It came after consumers took out Pounds 225m in new loans in August. Lending on credit cards and for cars and consumer durables such as carpets was particularly high in September. The result underlines how consumers appear to be spending more after a long period of muted activity during the recession. In the third quarter of this year new consumer loans, which do not include mortgage debt but are a good indicator of demand for borrowing, came to a net Pounds 918m after Pounds 525m in the second quarter and Pounds 400m in the first three months. The third quarter figure - which takes into account repayments of past loans - was the highest since mid-1990. Net borrowing on Visa and Mastercard came to Pounds 106m in September, after a net repayment of Pounds 89m in August. Loans taken out through specialist finance houses, mainly for cars and other high-price items such as house furnishings, totalled Pounds 336m in September. In August the comparable number was Pounds 298m. Signs that consumers are increasing their interest in new loans were supported by another, broader, series of figures from the Central Statistical Office. These figures include borrowing taken on bank cards outside the Visa and Mastercard systems and extra debt from bank loans. The series, available only on a quarterly basis, showed total net loans in the third quarter at Pounds 737m, after Pounds 393m in the second quarter.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares surge after German rate cuts ALL THE major UK equity market indices powered ahead to new records yesterday as the big international institutions responded to the move by Germany's Bundesbank in cutting its key interest rates. The German move was seen by London brokers as ensuring a reduction in UK rates in the near future. London trading desks were buzzing with rumours during the late afternoon that a meeting had been called at the Bank of England to consider an immediate reduction of  1/2 percentage point this morning, with a further half-point cut at the time of the November 30 Budget. At the close of an extremely tense and volatile session in the City, the FT-SE 100 Index had reached a new intraday and closing high of 3,188.3, up 32 points. The index has risen almost 100 points over the past five trading days as the market began to scent a move to lower interest rates across Europe, starting with Germany. Moves to lower rates by other European countries, notably France and the UK, are expected shortly, according to dealers. The burst of strength in the London equity market was not confined to the top 100 stocks, although much of the initial flurry of buying interest was carried out in these highly liquid shares. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed at a peak 3,526.2, up 19.1. Turnover in UK equities erupted during an afternoon of increasingly frantic trading, eventually reaching a heavy 745.6m shares, the highest since October 6, with activ-ity in the leaders accounting for almost half the market business. Dealers said customer, or retail, business increased sharply yesterday and they expect the value of customer trading to top the Pounds 1.5bn figure achieved on Wednesday. Customer business has remained well above usual levels all this week, having reached Pounds 1.8bn last Friday, itself the heaviest figure since late August. Market sentiment at the close of business was a far cry from the initial tone in the City yesterday morning. Dealers remained wary of the chances of a German rate cut and continued to fret over the possibility of a sharp correction on Wall Street in the near future. Share prices opened marginally higher but began to slip back as the Footsie future moved lower, dragging the underlying 100-share index to the day's low of 3,149.3 in mid-morning. Thereafter, very little actual business transpired, with marketmakers trying to smooth out any awkward book positions ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting while all the time expecting the German bank to hold rates and the market to move lower. The market's immediate reaction to the twin rate cut was to hold steady for a matter of minutes before embarking on a strong upward push to its eventual closing record. Some of the leading marketmaking firms in the City are believed to have been wrong-footed by the steep rise in share prices over the past two weeks, with short positions said to have been increasingly exposed in the past couple of sessions. Late yesterday it was said that some of the big UK institutions had pushed some panicky buying orders into a sharply rising market. 'The market exploded yesterday, which means there was a small panic; we are in for a vol-atile few days,' said one top marketmaker.</p>

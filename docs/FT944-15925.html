			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Nature of Things: Catching scientists for life - Using technology to inspire children is the aim of two initiatives Ask a scientist approaching the end of his career how he first became interested in science, and he is likely to reminisce about some wonderful teacher who gripped his imagination during physics, chemistry or biology lessons. Mixed with the nostalgia will be a lament for the alleged decline in science teaching, which means that few of today's schoolchildren are inspired in the same way. Many people involved in science education share the idea that enthusing a child at the right age will produce a scientist for life - and some concede that fewer inspiring teachers are at work today than 50 years ago. Hence the current wave of programmes to use resources outside the classroom, such as museums and the media, to put across the excitement of science. Two good examples of this sort of child-grabbing initiative have just been announced. One comes from London's venerable Science Museum, the first in the world to open a children's gallery in the 1930s. The museum is to invest Pounds 4m (half from its own funds and half from sponsors) in new facilities for youngsters from toddlers to teenagers, known collectively as Project 95. The other is Voyage VI in the international Jason Project, which will use 'interactive television' to take about 400,000 schoolchildren on a scientific expedition to the mid-Pacific island of Hawaii next year. Their experiences will range from guiding a remotely operated vehicle into the mouth of a live volcano, to viewing the other planets through Hawaii's mountaintop observatories. Jason is funded by corporate sponsors and organised by Bob Ballard, the famous American oceanographer whose accomplishments include finding the wreck of the Titanic. Barclays Life is spending Pounds 600,000 over three years bringing Jason to Britain under the management of National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside. What the two projects have in common is lavish use of high-tech communications equipment. Jason will connect pupils, parents and teachers at 30 'interactive network sites' in the US, UK and Canada with the scientists in Hawaii, via live satellite links. Sixty different programmes will be broadcast during the two-week project, so that as many participants as possible can take a turn at talking to the scientists or operating the cameras by remote control. Network 95, the communications system at the heart of the Science Museum's project, will not operate across continents but just within the museum in South Kensington. It will, however, offer young visitors what Roger Bridgman, curator of communications, says is the world's first multimedia video-conferencing system designed for casual public use. Children coming into the museum will be given a supermarket-style barcode sticker on the back of the hand, to identify them as they log on at one of the eight terminals. The system will then issue an identifying nickname, such as Nimpy or Monkey, Ziggy or Bounce (real names will not be used, to protect young users' privacy from prying adults). Once logged on, children can communicate by video and sound with friends or strangers on other terminals. Or they can play games. The system will offer collaborative activities - for example everyone joining to create a combined work of computer art - and competitive games such as racing through a maze. Simulated violence is banned. Indeed the whole network is designed to appeal more to girls than to boys reared on violent computer games. For example, the graphics welcoming new users will feature a series of soft girl-friendly rooms. Even so, Bridgman fears that some boys will become 'terminal hogs' whom museum staff will have to ease off the system. In addition to Network 95 (sponsored by Mercury Communications) the museum is building six new areas dedicated to involving young people in science. Gillian Thomas, director of Project 95, is known for her innovative children's spaces at La Villette Science City outside Paris; she is bringing in some unexpected young designers, including Ben Kelly who made his name with the Hacienda night-club in Manchester. The Science Museum's teen-oriented Communications Cafe, with its multiscreen displays, video and computer links, could become one of the hippest pick-up joints - if that's not too old-fashioned a phrase - in late 1990s London. That would be a wonderful antidote to what Ballard says is 'the common image of the scientist as a 'nerd', a socially undeveloped individual'. If Jason and the Science Museum succeed in turning children on to science, whether through the excitement of steering a buggy into a volcanic cauldron or making friends at Communications Cafe, that will just be the beginning of the story. The schools then have to build on the converts' new enthusiasm and feed them through a poorly-designed educational pipeline without turning them off science once again. To help link Jason with school work, the project provides study materials which teachers can use in class to relate the Hawaiian expedition to subjects such as geology and astronomy. (Although these materials originate in the US, they are being anglicised to fit into the UK national curriculum.) In the end, successful science education still depends on direct personal contact with good teachers. High-tech projects such as Jason and Network 95 provide a welcome spark of interest but they are no substitute for government action to bring more talented science graduates into the teaching profession.</p>

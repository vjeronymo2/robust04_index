			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Charm offensive with some value: UK manufacturers have had a cool response to the Budget but welcome efforts to boost morale One of the most striking features of this week's Budget was the chancellor's evident desire to flatter and cajole the nation's manufacturers. The government's alarm about the state of UK industry is not new, nor is its desire to spur manufacturers into an investment-led recovery. But Mr Lamont's efforts went beyond persuasion. On company tax, export aid and small company legislation, he appeared to be offering cash on the nail. If early reactions are a guide, he has largely failed to convince. Most manufacturers see the Budget as having at best a neutral effect on their business. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive of English China Clays, goes further: 'What happened this week heightened the attraction of investing overseas.' It might be argued that managers are not always at their best when wrestling with macro-economic concepts. As one of Britain's most senior industrialists caustically remarks: 'When all these businessmen react to the Budget the next day, they don't know what the hell they're talking about.' But in a sense this is irrelevant. The government is seeking to instil in manufacturers the confidence to spend money. When it comes to confidence, perception is everything. Most industrialists agree that there is a scent of recovery in the air, though they disagree on how far they trust it. But Mr Chris Masters, chief executive of the distribution and industrial services group Christian Salvesen, speaks for many when he says: 'The government has been elected for another four years, but it appears policy can change by the hour. We'd like some faith that policy is being adhered to, almost whether it's right or wrong. What is our interest rate policy? What's our long-term policy on exchange rates? Are we raising taxes or lowering them?' Mr Teare has a more specific worry: the Budget's proposals for future increases in personal tax. 'There's some pretty tough medicine there for the man in the street. People's costs are going to go up now for three years. They know that. That's going to build up pressure on the wage front again, and that isn't good news for companies like ours which are big exporters.' For the government, such reactions are doubtless unsurprising. But when it comes to specific measures to help industry, it could with justice argue that it has acted on a number of issues which industry has pressed on it for years: in particular, export credits, advance corporation tax and infrastructure projects. Even here, the response is grudging. Trafalgar House, for example, is a company for which the Budget might have been tailor-made. It relies heavily on export finance for big overseas engineering projects: it has a large bill for surplus ACT: and it is heavily involved in infrastructure projects in the UK. Mr Alan Gormley, Trafalgar's chief executive, gives the government some credit for trying. 'The Budget moved the tax structure in favour of industry and against the financial sector, and I think that's for the UK's long-term well-being. But it's a move which needs to be sustained on a consistent policy basis. We've been a long time getting the economy into this state, and we'll be a long time rebalancing it.' On the specifics, Mr Gormley is less generous. Take export credits. 'The previous regime was ridiculous. It clearly penalised UK exporters against the competition. What we've seen in the past two years is the UK moving back closer to the middle ground. They're not there yet.' Or take ACT. 'The most positive thing I can say is that it's on the agenda. The government is recognising it's a real issue. I'm not sure the solutions proposed are the right ones.' Or take infrastructure projects. 'At least they didn't announce the Jubilee Line yet again. There is still more talk than action. I think industry's view is that the jury is still out until we see some of these things actually happening.' To be fair, Mr Gormley - a Scottish accountant by training - has a reputation among his colleagues for being downbeat by nature. But in his reservations on the ACT changes, he is not alone. Rentokil, the highly successful service company, raised its final dividend on Thursday by an extra amount to ensure that its shareholders would not lose under the new rules. Mr Chris Pearce, Rentokil's finance director, says: 'The change in ACT was announced as a positive step for British industry. But the chancellor did it to raise money. We had to put the dividend up by Pounds 1.1m, and we will get Pounds 400,000 back in tax. So there was a net cost to us of Pounds 700,000 to put our shareholders back where they would have been before.' Mr Teare of English China Clays takes the argument further. If companies do not increase their dividends, he points out, the pension funds which they finance will have to carry the burden. 'Who's going to pay the bill? Or are pension benefits going to have to come down? The benign period we've been through of pension surpluses and improved benefits would come to a staggering halt. All of that isn't the greatest background to consider more investment in manufacturing industry in the UK.' Despite the carping, few businessman will deny that taken all round, the government's charm offensive has its value. Mr Juergen Gerhrels, UK head of the German electronics giant Siemens, says he feels no different after the Budget than he did before. 'But it is very important that the government has identified itself with manufacturing. People working in manufacturing in the UK have a lower standing than in Germany. This conviction that manufacturing has an important role to play is definitely good for morale.' A senior executive with one of the UK's biggest manufacturers agrees. 'We do believe there has been a fundamental shift in thinking. There's more being done now about manufacturing through the Department of Trade and Industry than for 20 years or more, and that's making manufacturers much happier.' And after all, it is possible that the chancellor is in luck. Recovery may be taking place anyway, whatever the government does. Most industrialists this week described it as patchy and fragile, but not all of them. Mr Gehrels of Siemens runs a UK business with annual sales approaching Pounds 1bn. 'I'm much more optimistic than I was a year ago. Most of our business lags the economy, since it is in infrastructure projects. But we also also make components for consumer electronics manufacturers, and there has been a definite upturn there since the start of the year. We're 30 per cent ahead of what we expected, and for me this is an economic indicator. I think we see light at the end of the tunnel.'</p>

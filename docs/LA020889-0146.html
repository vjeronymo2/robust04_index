			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SEBASTIAN COE QUITS COMEBACK BID  </P> <P> Sebastian Coe abandoned his comeback bid today by withdrawing from the 800  meters at next week's European indoor championships, apparently because of an  injury.  </P> <P> A British track official said Coe, who holds the world indoor and outdoor  record for the distance, still was concerned about a calf injury that caused  him to pull out of a recent meeting in Genoa, Italy.  </P> <P> Coe has not competed since the national Olympic trials last August when he  flopped and was left off the British roster for Seoul.  </P> <P> He was selected for the European indoor championships at The Hague,  Netherlands, on Feb. 18 because selectors believed that there was no one else  of his caliber challenging for a place in the team at that distance.  </P></p>

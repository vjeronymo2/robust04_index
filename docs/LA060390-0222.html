			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DO YOU NEED A REALTY AGENT TO SELL YOUR HOME?;  </P> <P> HOME SELLERS: IF YOU WORK WITHOUT AN AGENT, YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO HANDLE A  WIDE RANGE OF LEGAL AND FINANCIAL MATTERS YOURSELF, OR HIRE A LAWYER TO HELP  YOU.  </P> <P> Most home sellers are confronted with the dilemma of whether or not to hire a  real estate agent to market their home. The primary reason for not using an  agent, of course, is to save the sales commission. For example, on a typical  home sale of $100,000 with a 6% sales commission, the saving is $6,000. Or is  it?  </P> <P> Home mortgage lenders report an average of 11 mortgage loans made on sales  handled by realty agents for every "for sale by owner" (FSBO) sale. There must  be solid reasons why 11 out of 12 home sellers hire realty agents. But consider  the pros and cons.  </P> <P> Setting the right sales price. After your home is all fixed up and ready to  sell, the first step is to determine its market value. You may want to hire a  professional appraiser to prepare a written appraisal. But a double-check with  local realty agents may be wise, especially in appreciating or declining  markets.  </P> <P> Even if you are thinking of selling without a realty agent, it pays to invite  at least three local realty agents to evaluate your home's market value, using  a written "comparable market analysis" form.  </P> <P> Select agents to interview from recommendations by friends and relatives,  agents who "farm" your neighborhood, and agents whose "sold" signs or newspaper  ads in your area attracted your attention. Be sure to interview agents with  both local independent firms and nationally franchised brokerages. What is  important is each agent's success record, not the name on the door.  </P> <P> Ask lots of questions of each agent about their fees, services, list of client  references and anything else you want to know. Inform them you are undecided  about listing your home with an agent and want to know why you should list with  that agent.  </P> <P> Make each agent persuade you. However, beware of any agent who estimates an  abnormally high sales price for your home without justifying it.  </P> <P> After each agent has left, phone their references -- the previous sellers -- to  ask, "Were you in any way unhappy with this agent and would you list your home  for sale with the same agent again?"  </P> <P> Don't be afraid of young or new agents. They are often eager to succeed and may  work twice as hard as a longtime salesperson who now may be taking life easy.  </P> <P> Before deciding if you should list your home with an agent and with which  agent, here are the factors to consider:  </P> <P> Advertising. Can you write newspaper ads about your home? How much will  advertising cost? Who will answer the phone? What information will you give to  callers? Will inspections be allowed only during limited hours or will you  leave work to accommodate an interested caller?  </P> <P> Will you hold and advertise weekend open houses? Do you understand Regulation Z  Truth in Lending limits on advertising finance terms, such as down payment,  interest rate and other finance conditions? Are you going to put up a lawn FSBO  sign? Since you have only one home to sell, how can you compete with the  hundreds of homes realty agents have available in the multiple listing service?  </P> <P> Financing. Are you familiar with and can you explain mortgage finance terms to  buyers? Which local lenders offer the best terms and are the easiest to deal  with? What programs are offered by FHA, VA and state mortgage plans?  </P> <P> Are you aware of land contract benefits and pitfalls? Can your existing  mortgage be assumed? Does it have a prepayment penalty? How much of an earnest  money deposit should you require? Who will hold the buyer's deposit money?  </P> <P> Legally binding contract. Are you able to negotiate the sales price and terms  in face-to-face negotiations with the buyer? Do you know how to handle the  bargain-hunters who prey on inexperienced FSBO sellers?  </P> <P> Do you have an attorney who has advised you on essential terms to include in  the contract? Can you qualify a prospective buyer to be sure he can really  afford to buy your home and is not wasting your time tying up the property?  </P> <P> Sales terms. Can you negotiate with the buyer about the sales terms and  financing? Who will pay the closing costs, such as title insurance, transfer  fees, escrow charge, attorney fees and other negotiable expenses?  </P> <P> How will you handle tax pro-rations, move-in date, rental for hold-over  occupancy, personal property to be included and excluded, disclosure of hidden  defects (to prevent future liability to your buyer), and compliance with state  laws?  </P> <P> Urgency and security. Do you need a fast sale to avoid making loan payments on  two homes at the same time?  </P> <P> Can you screen out potential troublemakers and even thieves from the serious  buyers who will phone you? Can the home be shown at any time or only when you  are not at work?  </P> <P> Closing the sale. Are you acquainted with local title settlement closing  procedures? Do you have an attorney who will handle the details?  </P> <P> How will the loan papers be processed, old loans paid off, liens cleared and  documents recorded?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Times Design Critic Sam Hall Kaplan, whose column has appeared in this space  for the past several years, has taken a leave of absence to pursue his interest  in design.  </P></p>

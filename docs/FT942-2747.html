			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: VNU shows interest in elements of Ziff VNU, the Dutch publisher, yesterday expressed interest in buying parts of Ziff Communications, the US-based publishing group put up for sale last week. However, it ruled out an outright bid. The Dutch publisher emphasised it was not actively looking at Ziff. 'We have had no contact with them whatsoever, and they haven't had any with us,' a spokesman said. Ziff, which is expected to be sold for between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn, was too big an acquisition for VNU to contemplate, he said. Reed-Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group with the resources to make takeovers on this scale, refused to make any comment on whether it was considering a bid. Ziff, the world's largest publisher of computer magazines, was put up for sale by the Ziff family last week. There has been speculation on possible bidders among the world's publishing groups, but no company has yet publicly expressed an interest in buying the privately-held group. Like Ziff, VNU is active in computer magazines, particularly in the UK and continental Europe. It is also active in consumer and trade magazines, regional newspapers and commercial television. VNU carried out a share issue earlier this year to finance the acquisition of BPI Communications of the US, whose titles include the newspaper Hollywood Reporter and Billboard magazine. See Lex</p>

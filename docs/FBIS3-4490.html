In a talk with visiting Foreign Minister of the Republic of  Angola Venacio da Silva Moura, Qian said that the peoples of  China and Angola have enjoyed traditional friendship, adding  that China is willing to further enhance cooperative relations  with Angola.    Qian said that China has been paying close attention to  Angola's peace process and sincerely hopes that the talks in  Angola will reach final agreement at an early date and realize  domestic peace and stability.    He noted that China has never interfered in the internal  affairs of African countries and has dedicated itself to  contributing to the development of Africa as much as possible.  China hopes that African countries enjoy peace and stability  and develop good-neighborly ties of friendship, Qian said.    Qian pointed out that big countries, instead of interfering  in the internal affairs of African countries, should let African  nations build their countries according to their own situations.    If big powers really care about Africa, they should not  write  out a prescription and force Africa to accept it, Qian said.  They should offer aid to Africa to promote the development of  African economies.    Moura briefed Qian on the current situation in Angola. He  expressed thanks for China's long-term political and economic  support of his country.    He noted that in Angola's struggle for national  independence,  the peoples of Angola and China stood on one side. After  drastic changes in the international situation, the two peoples  still stood together.    The Angolan foreign minister reaffirmed that his country  firmly insists on a "one-China" policy and will not develop any  official ties with Taiwan.    He expressed the belief that economic and trade relations  between the two countries will be further enhanced after Angola  realizes internal peace.</p>

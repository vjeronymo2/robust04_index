			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental cuts payout on profit dip CONTINENTAL, the German tyre manufacturer, proposes to halve its dividend to DM4 for 1990 following a sharp drop in earnings occasioned by the dismal state of the world tyre market. Net profits fell to DM93.4m (Dollars 56m) last year, after DM227.8m in 1989. The earnings setback had been accurately foreshadowed in the defence document Continental drew up at the end of last year in the course of its attempts to ward off advances from Pirelli of Italy. Arguing for its independence and against Pirelli's merger proposals Continental pointed out that it was still making money - even if largely in the non-tyre activities gathered into ContiTech. The Pirelli group, which accounts in guilders, suffered a loss of Fl 9.3m (Dollars 4.94m) loss for 1990, with no dividend being paid for the per-iod. Group turnover edged up 2 per cent to DM8.55bn, while other details of the 1990 performance await the annual press conference on May 14. In February, Mr Ignolf Knaup, the finance director, forecast an improvement in the current year, with turnover rising to around DM9.5bn, helped both by acquisitions and by internal growth. Net profits should reach around DM100m for 1991, according to Mr Knaup.</p>

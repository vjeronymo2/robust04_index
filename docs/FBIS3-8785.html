			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Autonomy for Pirin Macedonia"] </F>   [Text] The leader of the Macedonian organization OMO  Ilenden in Bulgaria Jordan Kostadinov stated during the press  conference for the agency BALKAN his organization's demand for a  status of an autonomous region of Pirin Macedonia. He claims  Bulgaria is forcibly assimilating the Macedonians by not  acknowledging their language and by physical and moral violence  by the authorities, which is a kind of a genocide. He added  claims that Macedonians are in fact Bulgarians is a war  propaganda, since 75 percent of the population in Pirin  Macedonia have a sense of belonging to the Macedonian nation.    Kostadinov demanded introducing the Macedonian language in  the schools and Macedonian nation as a category in the passport  and diplomas. In addition, he insists on separation of the  Nevrokop diocese of a metropolitan from the Bulgarian Church and  appointing a Macedonian metropolitan. He also demands the  Macedonian autonomous region to have a crowned lion in its  symbol and a sun on its flag.</p>

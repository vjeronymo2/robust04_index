			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Marcos body returns to sparse crowds A LOW turn-out of mourners attended the homecoming yesterday of the body of Mr Ferdinand Marcos, the former Philippine strongman who seven years ago fled to Hawaii after being ousted in a popular revolt against his regime. The body was in a sealed metal casket that has remained unopened. It will be seen only as it is laid to rest this weekend in a glass case at the newly constructed mausoleum at the Marcos residence in Laoag City. About 3,000 people were at the airport in Laoag City, the capital of Mr Marcos's home province of Ilocor Norte in the northern Philippines, when the chartered jet carrying his body landed. About 5,000 attended an hour-long mass at St William's Cathedral where the casket was brought from the airport.  It was later placed in front of the provincial capital building. There were no state honours. A group of 21 retired generals acted as pall-bearers. They executed a simultaneous salute in lieu of the official 21-gun salute. Mr Marcos's widow Imelda and his two daughters, Imee and Irene, led the welcoming party at the airport. His son Ferdinand Jr had fetched the body from Hawaii. It was the first time since their 1986 escape from Manila that the Marcos family was together. After their flight, the Marcos children went their separate ways in other countries while the parents stayed in Hawaii. Even when Mr Marcos was dying some of the Marcos children avoided travelling to Hawaii for fear of being arrested in connection with criminal suits filed against the family in US courts. Mr Marcos died in September 1989 of cardiac arrest following complications from kidney, lung and heart ailments. Mrs Marcos returned to the Philippines in November 1991 and was among the seven candidates in the May 1992 presidential election that was won by Mr Fidel Ramos, former army chief and defence secretary. Mrs Marcos finished fifth.</p>

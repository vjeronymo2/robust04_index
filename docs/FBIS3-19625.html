The British cargo plane arrived at 1600 yesterday and was  refueled immediately. The transfer of the arms and ammunition,  which according to some reports included surface-to-air and  air-to-air missiles, began two hours later. The Nigerian plane  was then to depart for Tel Aviv to repair one of its four  engines, which was the reason it had been stranded at Larnaca  Airport. [passage omitted]</p>

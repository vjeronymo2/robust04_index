Bonita Vista is 12-14, 6-6.  </P> <P> Montgomery 6, Marian 1 -- Luis Arroyo pitched the Aztecs to only their third  conference victory. Last-place Montgomery is 8-14, 3-9.  </P> <P> Coronado 1, Hilltop 0 -- Coronado (11-10, 6-6) scored one run in the fourth,  but that was enough at Hilltop (8-14, 5-7). Andy Strasser picked up the  victory, allowing just three hits.  </P> <P> Sweetwater 4, Southwest 3 -- Southwest scored twice in the seventh inning but  stranded the winning run on base when Larry Meza struck out a Raider batter to  end the inning.

But that wasn't the only big inning for No. 9  Escondido (17-5, 10-2), which scored seven more in the sixth. Sam Spade (0-3),  who left in the second, was the loser for El Camino (4-20, 0-12).  </P> <P> Carlsbad 3, San Marcos 0 -- Scott Karl (4-0) threw just 65 pitches for host  Carlsbad (18-8, 11-1), going the distance and allowing just four hits.

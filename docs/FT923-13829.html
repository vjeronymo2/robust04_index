			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Bond 'bridge' delayed THE launch of the link between Euroclear and Cedel, the two international bond settlement houses, has been delayed for at least two months due to technical problems. The so-called 'bridge', which was finally agreed in March after prolonged and at times acrimonious discussions between the two sides, was scheduled to have been launched on October 9. In a joint statement, the two said yesterday that problems in early tests of the system had forced them to delay full tests. The launch is now planned for early December, though no exact date has been set. 'We're getting into areas of multiple processing we haven't done before,' said Euroclear. 'We thought it was best to let the market know as early as possible.' Cemex, the Mexican cement company which is bidding Dollars 1.25bn for its Spanish competitor Valencia de Cementos Portland, will have its Ba2 senior credit rating reviewed for possible downgrade by Moody's Investor Service, the US credit rating agency, Simon London writes.</p>

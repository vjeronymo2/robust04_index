			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Life policy agents say disclosure rules will cut business Telling potential customers the commission they will pay when they buy life insurance will make them shop around and reduce life and pensions business overall, says a survey of sales agents. About one-third of tied agents - life company appointed representatives - in the survey said they would leave the industry if commission disclosure reduced their income. The survey also included independent financial advisers and members of direct sales forces. About three in 10 of the direct sales agents said they would leave the industry if their income fell because of commission disclosure. However, just over half of all those questioned said that if disclosure reduced their income, they would fund their activities by increasing their business and number of clients. The poll was carried out in November and has been published by the Life Insurance Association. It comes as the Treasury considers the draft rules put forward by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, for requiring sales agents to disclose commission on life products. The new rules are expected to come into effect late this year. The association said the responses to a questionnaire from 1,006 of its members underlined the industry's concern that the proposals for disclosing commission would not reflect a fair balance of the charges and expenses of the different distribution channels for life products. About two-thirds of respondents said they thought commission disclosure would make clients shop around, mainly on the basis of cost, though this view was less widely held among IFAs than among other categories of sales agents. Of those responding, 64 per cent thought the change would mean a reduction in life and pensions business. A clear majority thought it would increase the pressure for the client and sales agent to split the commission, a practice known as 'rebating'. Mr Lawrence Hawthorn, association president, said the survey reinforced the industry's impression that disclosure could dilute people's commitment to taking out cover.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Reconciliation of warlords postponed again Somalia's rival warlords yesterday postponed a ceremony of national reconciliation for the second time this week, writes Leslie Crawford in Nairobi The postponement is an embarrassment to the UN, which has been sponsoring the negotiations in Nairobi in the hope of reaching a political settlement before US troops complete their withdrawal on Friday. The departure of US and European peacekeepers has been triggered in part by the unwillingness of rival Somali clans to make peace. At issue is how 15 different clans and numerous sub-clans are to share power in a future Somali government. The struggle for hegemony has destroyed Somalia's civil institutions and placed the country in the hands of gunmen. The year-old UN Operation in Somalia (Unosom) has been unable to enforce peace. Western diplomats say the country has exhausted patience and willingness to help. Mr George Bennett, Unosom spokesman, said the reconciliation ceremony had been cancelled because the 15 participating Somali factions could not agree on who should be a signatory to the agreement, which includes a power-sharing arrangement for a national government. The reconciliation ceremony has been rescheduled for today.</p>

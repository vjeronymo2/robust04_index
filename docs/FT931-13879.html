			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Arts: Ennio Marchetto The Lyric, Hammersmith, programme for Ennio Marchetto makes no mention of guest artist Paul Morocco, who is responsible for the juggling in Part One, writes Alastair Macaulay. Like many in the audience I assumed, in my review on this page yesterday that this was yet another of Marchetto's personae. My apologies to both artists.</p>

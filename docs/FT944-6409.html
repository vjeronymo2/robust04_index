			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Clarke pledges curbs on spending: Budget offers boost for long-term jobless and help for small businesses Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, promised sharp cuts in future government spending and borrowing in a workmanlike Budget yesterday designed to put the long-term jobless back to work and help small businesses. Delivering his second Budget as chancellor, Mr Clarke announced measures, eventually costing Pounds 680m a year, to encourage the long-term unemployed to seek jobs and make it cheaper for companies to hire staff. Mr Clarke also set out to make his Budget appeal to financial markets, which fear government profligacy as the election, which must be fought by the spring of 1997, draws nearer. Mixed reviews followed his promises to take a total of Pounds 28bn off general government expenditure over the three financial years starting next April and reduce the public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96 from the previous target of Pounds 30bn. The markets gave the Budget a lukewarm response, with UK government bonds ending the day  1/2 a point lower and the FTSE-100 index up only 14 points at 3,061.1. Sterling showed little response, rising  1/2 pfennig to DM2.4550 after Mr Clarke's speech. The chancellor said the government remained on course 'to eliminate government borrowing entirely by the end of the decade'. The Treasury Red Book, issued after he sat down in the Commons, included illustrative projections of the future path of the PSBR leading to budget surpluses of Pounds 1bn in 1998-99 and Pounds 9bn in 1999-2000. But other Treasury figures showed that the government, rather than cutting its 'control total' of departmental expenditure in real terms in this financial year, now envisaged a real, inflation adjusted, increase. This fuelled City suspicions that Mr Clarke was not as rigorous on public spending as he professed. The chancellor insisted that his aim was to avoid new boom-and-bust cycles in the UK economy. But his observation that the Tories 'are tax-cutters by instinct' served only to remind City analysts of past pre-election give-aways. Yesterday's Budget lacked such fireworks. As expected, income tax rates stayed unchanged at 20 per cent, 25 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. Mr Clarke left unchanged the government's controversial plans to increase value added tax on domestic fuel and power to 17.5 per cent from 8 per cent next April. However, reaping a first harvest from the improvement in the government finances, he announced the first indexation of personal income tax allowances since 1992 and a widening of the 20 per cent income tax band to Pounds 3,200 instead of the Pounds 3,100 required by indexation. In a Budget that focused on micro-economic measures, the chancellor also sought to address many sources of discontent with the government in the Tory party, among businesses and the electorate. He outlined measures to help small businesses and promote investment in growing companies. In a move to allay discontent among Tories in parliament, he targeted pensioners for special treatment, adding to the compensation announced last year to offset the effects of the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and power, and easing their income tax burden. While announcing large cuts in overall government expenditure targets, Mr Clarke said the government would boost health spending in real terms, in this financial year and next, and provide more money for the police. In a speech that seemed often to steal Labour's clothes, he promised a crackdown on tax avoidance, to yield Pounds 1.5bn in three years. The purpose of the Budget, Mr Clarke said, was to build sustained growth with low inflation on unexpectedly strong growth this year of 4 per cent and the low, 2 per cent, annual rate of underlying inflation. For next year, he forecast growth of 3 1/4 per cent. However, he said underlying retail price inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, was set to rise slightly next year. After reaching a plateau of 2 1/2 per cent, it should resume its downward trend. Mr Clarke reaffirmed the government's goal of underlying inflation in the lower half of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target band by the end of this parliament. The chancellor and Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, used this year's low inflation to push down future public expenditure. The control total for 1995-96, which covers departmental expenditure but excludes most cyclical social security outlays and debt interest, was cut by Pounds 6.9bn to Pounds 255.7bn from the Pounds 262.6bn announced last year. Control totals for 1996-97 and 1997-98 were pared by Pounds 8.3bn and Pounds 8.9bn respectively to Pounds 263.5bn and Pounds 272.1bn. However, the control total for 1994-95 was trimmed by only Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 249.6bn, disappointing analysts who expected a cut of about Pounds 3bn. The Budget plans should bring down general government expenditure, excluding privatisation proceeds, to 40 per cent of gross domestic product in 1998-99 from a recent peak of 44.5 per cent in 1992-93. Spending cuts and faster growth will sharply reduce the PSBR - the most closely watched indicator from the financial markets' viewpoint. That is now expected to be Pounds 34.5bn in the current financial year, whereas a year ago, before Mr Clarke's first Budget, there were fears that it would balloon to Pounds 50bn. At Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96, the projected PSBR will meet the Maastricht criterion of 3 per cent for government deficits. The Treasury expects the PSBR to fall to Pounds 13bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 5bn in 1997-98. Mr Clarke said the government had saved on most spending programmes. To reduce waste, he said cash running costs in civil service departments would be the same in 1997-98 as in the past financial year. As part of attempts to control social security costs, he announced changes to housing benefit to curb councils' payment of excessive rents. The government will also limit its support for mortgage interest payments when people are unemployed. The most innovative part of the Budget was the large package of measures to help the long-term unemployed back to work. The package, which will involve Pounds 375m in enhanced benefits and Pounds 305m in lower employers' national insurance contributions in 1996-97, is intended to avoid the emergence of an underclass - 'a class of people who are excluded from economic activity', the chancellor said. Besides reforms of training and housing benefit, employer national insurance contributions will be cut by 0.6 per cent for employees earning less than Pounds 205 a week. Any employer taking on someone who has been unemployed for two years will have a one year 'holiday' from national insurance contributions. The support for businesses built on last year's similar measures. The government will spend Pounds 605m in 1995-96 to ease the cost of new business rates. The Budget will also implement a venture capital trust scheme, that was foreshadowed last year. This will offer big income tax and capital gains tax concessions on investments up to Pounds 100,000 in trusts that will invest mainly in unquoted companies.

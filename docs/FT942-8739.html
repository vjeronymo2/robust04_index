			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Publishers agree code of practice More than three years after the publication of the Sadler inquiry into cross-media promotion, newspaper and magazine publishers have finally agreed a code of practice. Mr Neil Hamilton, the Department of Trade and Industry corporate affairs minister, announced yesterday publication of a code which has been endorsed by the main publishing organisations. One of the recommendations of the report by Mr John Sadler, former deputy chairman of the John Lewis group and the new chairman of Pearl, the life insurer, was that newspapers should establish a code covering both editorial and advertising content. The code refers to such areas as conditions of supply, non-discriminatory rates for competitors' advertising and the publication of relevant ownership links in editorial and advertising. The Cross-Media Promotion Code was drawn up by the Newspaper Publishers' Association on behalf of national newspapers, the Newspaper Society representing local and regional newspapers, and the Periodical Publishers' Association and their Scottish counterparts. Publications are being encouraged to publish their own in-house guidelines on the coverage of competitors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgian troops will not take part in any more UN  peacekeeping forces for several months at least. This was  announced by Leo Delcroix, the Belgian defense minister, who met  his French counterpart Francois Leotard in Paris today.    "If we are called upon for new missions, I think we will  abstain for a certain period of time. We need several months to  recover from the events." The minister was certainly referring  to the death of ten Belgian UN peacekeepers in Rwanda.    Leo Delcroix said he would reexamine the situation in the  autumn, but, he said, Belgium will not withdraw from missions  currently underway, in particular in ex-Yugoslavia.</p>

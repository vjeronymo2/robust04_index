			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Turkey rejects Syrian call for water agreement TURKEY has rejected Syrian attempts to renegotiate a six-year-old protocol allocating water from the Euphrates, but sought to reassure Damascus about continued supplies across the common border. At the end of two days of talks in the Syrian capital with Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, Syrian officials again urged Ankara to increase the 500 cubic metres a second it currently guarantees. Syria claimed Turkey had made an undertaking when the then prime minister Turgut Ozal signed the water protocol in 1987 to seek a more permanent water agreement once Turkey's Ataturk dam is filled. Syria relies on the river for up to 60 per cent of power generation and much of its farm production. The issue has come to a head as the Ataturk dam has neared completion and Turkey has outlined plans to start irrigating the Harran plain close to the Syrian border in May, diverting more water from the river. Under Turkey's Gap project, 1.6m hectares is to be irrigated in the Euphrates and Tigris river valleys, a project which has been the major bone of contention between Turkey and its downstream neighbours, Syria and Iraq. According to one Turkish newspaper, Mr Demirel promised to convene a foreign ministers meeting to settle the issue. However, diplomats say Turkey is unlikely to concede Syrian demands and instead has offered a variety of joint development projects.</p>

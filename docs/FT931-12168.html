			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Derivatives and other wheezes - Serious Riches / The latest venture in Oliver Gillie's varied career sees him demonstrating his faith in those reputedly risky hedging instruments, futures and options 'There are a lot of sensible things that can be done with them,' he explains 'I really feel I'm a confused child of the nineties who made some money in the eighties and hasn't done much right in the last year or two, and isn't quite sure where to go next.' THE WORDS come from Oliver Gillie, a man whose varied career has stretched from metal-bashing to estate agency to the more complicated world of derivatives dealing. Some of his moves in the 1980s were spectacularly well-timed, but now he is trying to think of something new to do. His latest business venture was Derivatives Securities Ltd. The idea was simple - he thought he could see a hole in the market for a 'respectable' brokerage specialising in futures and options aimed at the 'retail', or individual, customer. He also felt that demand for derivatives would increase in the changed economic climate of the 1990s. Trading in these instruments is dominated by big international securities houses, which work mainly for pension funds and other large institutional investors; and at the other end of the spectrum by small, allegedly scandal-prone brokers. This side of the industry developed a bad reputation for 'churning' - needlessly trading clients' funds to amass more commission. Although much of this has been stamped out by regulators, the reputation seems to stick. Apart from these shenanigans, derivatives have a reputation as an ultra-risky way to speculate. But they were originally developed as instruments to manage and limit risk, rather than increase it. Mr Gillie himself is a strong believer in derivatives, and trades in them on his own account regularly. 'There are a lot of sensible things which can be done with derivatives,' he said. 'The classic situation would have been in 1987. Two fund managers both bought company X at Pounds 16. But one bought shares at Pounds 16 per share, and the other bought options at Pounds 1 a throw. Then the market crashed, and the share price fell to Pounds 11. Which was the speculator? It's a very low-risk strategy, and it only becomes high-risk if you gear up. 'Another example is to buy shares and then sell options on the shares. What you are in essence doing is giving yourself a larger chance of profit in return for less chance of a large profit. I think that's a conservative thing to do, and I suspect, in the difficult world of the 1990s, it may be an essential thing to do.' DSL started promisingly, but profitability has proved elusive, and in the past few weeks Mr Gillie has sold all but 5 per cent of his investment to new investors, for a loss. He is now confident of the company's future with their backing. It is not as if he has not had his fair share of luck in the past. A varied career started with a degree in mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, in the early 1960s. From there he went into operational research with first Esso and then RTZ. His RTZ career left him as manager of a tin smelter in Yorkshire, a job from which he was made redundant in 1975. Looking around for something new to do, he encountered 'by pure coincidence', Amalgamated Metals, which traded in tin from an office in Zug, Switzerland. Mr Gillie says candidly that his sole qualification for the job was the ability to spell the word 'tin', but this was enough to earn him a posting to Switzerland. He was to stay there until 1982, trading in tin, nickel and tin concentrates, and in the metals trading industry generally until 1985. At this time, the metals market was livelier than it is now, and the middleman was king. Mr Gillie had a great time. But by 1985, when he had been trading in metals back in London for three years, he had had enough. The role of the middleman was changing, and he felt it was time for a change. The route to rather more serious riches was offered by his wife, who had been working in an estate agent's office in Stockwell, South London. The firm was small, but she could see potential, and when the owner indicated that he wanted to get out of the business, she expressed an interest. The couple bought the estate agency, which they renamed Morgan Gillie, for what with hindsight was an incredibly cheap price. As it turned out, 1985 was a good time to buy an estate agency in London. They soon expanded, opening branches in Clapham, Peckham and Dulwich, just in time for the vast influx of young professionals seeking accommodation close to the City. Prices in previously unfashionable areas of South London soared. The Black Monday stock market crash in October 1987 sounded a warning, and at this point they started negotiations to sell Morgan Gillie. But the negotiations dragged on, and meanwhile the housing market started to boom as it had never boomed before. Then chancellor Nigel Lawson's announcement, in the March budget of 1988, that double Miras relief for co-habiting couples would be stopped at the end of July was an estate agents' dream. On the last day of July, Morgan Gillie exchanged contracts on 25 houses. The smartest move of all was to sell at the top. On August 8, Morgan Gillie was sold to Cornerstone, Abbey National's chain of estate agents, for a handsome profit. Mr and Mrs Gillie continued to work there for a year, and then he moved on to derivatives broking. If the estate agency was an example of being in the right place at the right time, then Mr Gillie's membership of the troubled Gooda Walker catastrophe reinsurance syndicate at Lloyd's might balance it. He had been introduced to them by the Lime Street Names' Agency, which is now in receivership, and they have proved to be one of the worst affected syndicates at Lloyd's. Mr Gillie needed to write out a substantial cheque to Lloyd's last year. But it could have been worse. In the run-up to the 1989 underwriting year, the bills for which arrived last year, Lime Street recommended him to join the new Feltrim syndicates, which also specialised in catastrophe stop-loss insurance. These have done almost as badly as Gooda Walker. However, Mr Gillie met an agent from Sedgwick and was persuaded out of this. He stayed out of Feltrim, cut his exposure to Gooda Walker, and continues to be a Name at Lloyd's, using Sedgwick, and not Lime Street, as his agent. In the 1990 underwriting year, for which the bills arrive this year, he has no exposure to the hard-hit reinsurance syndicates. He has taken the troubles of the market with rather more equanimity than other stricken Names. 'Names are very fully warned,' he says. 'I do think that Lloyd's themselves were terrible sloppy and that some underwriters and agents may have been negligent, maybe even criminally so. But just where that gets us I'm not terribly sure.' He is rather less relaxed about the UK's powerful fund-management industry, to which he is offering an alternative with Derivatives Securities. He says: 'With a unit trust, you are paying 5 per cent up front for second-rate management. In general it's underperformed the index, but it's been operating at a time when everything's gone up. In a non-inflationary world, I think they may turn out to be a real trap.' He also eschewed the use of life assurance savings schemes for the school fees of his two sons, saying that life offices by and large did an even worse job of managing money than the unit trust industry. As for pensions: 'I've got a few bits and bobs for pensions tucked away, but I don't really want my money run for me by life companies, and I would like to think the assets we've built up would provide us with a pension.' For the time being, Mr and Mrs Gillie are devoting their energies to charitable work, via a charity called Ashoka which sponsors 'social entrepreneurs', or remarkable individuals in a range of 13 Third World countries. Those helped include street children in Bombay and child prostitutes in Brazil, but the aim is always to foster 'self help'. One or two other plans are in the offing. Mr Gillie is not sure whether he has another 'wheeze' in him, but the enthusiasm certainly seems to be there. His investment philosophy makes it clear that the world will be a changed place: 'If we have neither inflation nor growth, it's possible property may continue to drop, and shares may be disappointing. It is clear that the old rules no longer apply, so the future is a challenge.'</p>

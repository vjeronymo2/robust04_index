			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the </F> National Executive Committee of the Mexican Institutional  Revolutionary Party, at the party headquarters in Mexico City --  live]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: Today, Tuesday, 29 March 1994,  I have summoned the CEN [National Executive Committee] of the  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] in order to appoint our  party's candidate for the Presidency of the republic. We do this  by virtue of the powers granted to the CEN in Article 159 of our  statutes and by the powers granted to political parties in  Article 41 of the Political Constitution of the United States of  Mexico.    We are gathered here today, united in the purpose of giving  continuity and validity to the postulates of the Mexican  Revolution. We are gathered here today, deeply moved and aware  of our responsibility to Mexico.    At this time, we are strengthened by Luis Donaldo Colosio's  undying course of action. Attentive to the Mexico he saw, deeply  convinced of the reason as well as the political and human  validity of the ideals he offered the nation, PRI members must  continue along the path he outlined for us with his thoughts and  example.    All of Mexico is in mourning and PRI members are offended.  This ideological and political legacy, however, is also a  commitment for undertaking new tasks. In the PRI, we must  continue with his campaign for the sake of democracy and social  justice, our party's slogans which Luis Donaldo gave new meaning  and deep projections.    The National Executive Committee unanimously appoints our  companion and friend, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, as the PRI  candidate for the presidency of the republic. [applause]    Ernesto Zedillo is a great member of our party. He is well  acquainted with Luis Donaldo Colosio's thinking, a politician  committed to the theories and principles of our party and to  this campaign's political platform.    Ernesto Zedillo is the best man we have to lead the PRI's  efforts to win the elections on 21 August. This appointment is  also fully supported by our governors and by members of our  party in the country's many states. They joined the CEN in  signing this appointment. We are convinced that Ernesto Zedillo  is the best member of the PRI; he is the person to whom Luis  Donaldo Colosio entrusted the coordination of his campaign.    We, the members of the CEN, are certain that Ernesto Zedillo  has the boldness and conviction to continue on the path that  Luis Donaldo Colosio initiated. As I stand before the general  public and our party members, I wish to reaffirm the ideals and  positions [banderas] the party is raising in this campaign. The  profound injustice that has caused Luis Donaldo Colosio to  disappear from our midst cannot be tolerated, nor,  unfortunately, can it be repaired. The proposal he set forth to  the Mexican people, however, remains alive.    Today, PRI members entrust to Ernesto Zedillo the leadership  of the PRI's efforts in the electoral race. If the Mexican  people freely and sovereignly so decide, the PRI's national  ideals, Colosio's pledges, his plans, and the services he  rendered to the Mexican people will become law and a way of  government. We know that the future of the fatherland demands  unity, devotion, and loyalty.    The PRI is hereby resuming its campaign to win the people's  vote of conviction. It is resuming its campaign for change with  responsibility and direction. The PRI is resuming its campaign  for democracy and social justice. We are going for victory and  the progress the Mexican people are demanding; we are going for  the democracy that all Mexicans hope for; we are going for  victory with Ernesto Zedillo. A united PRI will confirm that it  has the strength to conquer, to win by convincing society, to  fulfill the national plan the Mexican people want. Let us  achieve victory, united and strong with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de  Leon. [applause]</p>

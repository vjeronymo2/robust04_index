			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Frydrychowicz: "Polish Generals </F> Issue a Denial"]    [Text] A scandal has arisen following the publication by  THE WASHINGTON POST of an article alleging that, in the 1980's,  Poland sold Soviet supersecret missile systems to the United  States, whence they reached the hands of Afghan partisans and  were later used to knock down USSR aircraft. The author of the  article is Benjamin Weiser, who has written controversial  material based on interviews with Ryszard Kuklinski [Polish Army  colonel who defected to the United States]. We decided to  obtain information straight from the sources. This is what  generals, without whose knowledge such a deal would not have  been possible, told us.    General Florian Siwicki, former minister of national  defense:  "The Ministry of National Defense did not indulge in weapons  deals. This kind of activity was the domain of the Central  Engineering Administration, which was governed by the Ministry  of Industry. The Ministry of National Defense okayed any  contracts prepared by the Central Engineering Administration. I  do not remember our selling weapons to the Americans. I  probably would not forget such a thing.    "I rule out the existence of any deals involving the sale of  arms to the United States. Such deals could not possibly have  been legally implemented without my knowledge. I know of no  cases involving weapons sales to the United States at all. We  sold weapons to Syria, Libya, Iraq, Hungary, Bulgaria, and  India. At that time, it was implausible to supply NATO member  countries. Perhaps there was some kind of smuggling going on.  But without concrete details, we cannot express any stance. It  is mainly our own Polish-produced weapons that we sold."    General Zbigniew Nowicki, former Polish Army chief technical  inspector: "When I heard this news, I wondered why we should  have sold these missile systems to the Americans if the  Americans themselves obtained them straight from Israel  following the helicopter sortie into Iraq.    "Yes, we did sell Soviet weapons, but these were old tanks,  helicopters, and airplanes, and only single units. This took  place via the Central Engineering Administration.    "It was impossible to sell modern weaponry from one camp to  another. We in the Ministry of National Defense might not have  known about every single deal. We would certainly have known  about the big ones, but I cannot rule out the possibility of  some petty smuggling. But it cannot have involved tanks,  missiles, or radar equipment.    "Perhaps one or two pieces of equipment might have been sold  on a trial basis without my knowledge to countries to which we  later sent larger quantities of weapons following a government  decision. After all, just like today, there were lists of  countries to which exports of our defense systems were  prohibited. As our main enemy, the United States was on this  embargo.    "Such a deal could not have escaped the attention of Soviet  intelligence, and no government would have risked cutting itself  off from new licenses and new USSR weapon systems."    General Czeslaw Kiszczak, former minister of internal  affairs: "This is the first time I have heard of sales of Soviet  weapons to the United States, and I exclude the possibility of  such a deal having ever taken place. Of course, anything is  possible in this world, but I do not think I could have been  ignorant of such an issue. I was too close to General  Jaruzelski, General Siwicki, and many generals on the General  Staff. It would have been simply impossible for me not to know  about it.    "Another story is possible, however. We sold many weapons  and systems to various countries, and one cannot rule out the  possibility that the Americans grabbed part of a consignment  somewhere along the way. But I rule out the allegation that we  sold the Americans several hundred or several thousand  antiaircraft missiles that ended up in Afghanistan."</p>

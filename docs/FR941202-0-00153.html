			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RSPA Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. DOT's alcohol testing regulations are based on the concept that evidential breath testing is the preferred method of testing for the presence of alcohol. The reasons underlying the decision to select breath testing were discussed at some length in the Common Preamble (59 FR 7315). Evidential breath testing devices are reliable and highly accurate at detecting even low alcohol concentrations, and their use is possible in all transportation settings because they are portable. The devices have been in use a long time, and all States accept EBT results as reliable evidence of an individual's violation of a law establishing a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  prohibited blood alcohol concentration, as long as the devices are properly calibrated and operated by trained personnel. As important, EBTs provide an immediate confirmed result, which enables the immediate removal of an employee who has misused alcohol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, blood alcohol testing is invasive, does not provide an immediate result, and requires extensive sample collection, shipping, and laboratory analysis procedures to implement. The NPRM on blood testing proposed to allow blood testing only in a limited set of circumstances where an EBT is not readily available. As stated in the preamble to the NPRM, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [B]ecause of its greater invasiveness and because it does not produce an immediate result, the use of blood alcohol testing is intended to be used only in those reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing circumstances where it is not practicable to use breath testing. Blood alcohol testing is not intended, under the proposal, to be an equal alternative method that an employer can choose as a matter of preference. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 7367. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regardless of whether the blood testing proposal is adopted, we believe that the pipeline industry must make reasonable efforts to arrange for the use of a sufficient number of EBTs to conduct reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing. Pipeline operators may arrange for the use of EBTs through purchase, lease, or contract with a consortium or other third-party provider. An operator need not purchase EBTs, but can make arrangements with a third party provider for those relatively few reasonable suspicion or post-accident tests that may need to be conducted. RSPA's experience with drug testing is that fewer than 3% of the total tests conducted have been in post-accident and reasonable suspicion situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not expect an operator to arrange for an EBT at every possible testing location, but an operator can certainly arrange for EBTs in locations where substantial numbers of employees are concentrated, and at any locations where accident or leak history suggests the need for an EBT. Large operators (those with more than 50 covered employees) should not encounter difficulty in arranging for the use of EBTs by the January 1, 1995 compliance date. EBTs are readily available for purchase from several manufacturers, and the inventory of EBTs is sufficient to enable most manufacturers to ship EBTs in five to ten days. In addition to inventory, there is sufficient production capacity to manufacture approximately 7,500 new units each month. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued final Model Specifications for the performance and testing of alcohol screening devices (August 2, 1994; 59 FR 39382), and will soon publish a Conforming Products List (CPL) identifying devices that meet the Model Specifications. The CPL is expected to include several preliminary breath testing devices (PBTs) and at least one saliva device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pipeline operators were advised of the final alcohol rule on February 15, 1994, allowing them almost one year (for large operators) and almost two years (for small operators) to make preparations for compliance with their respective January 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996 dates. Issuance of this decision on the petition for reconsideration should resolve any remaining uncertainty and provide sufficient time for operators to achieve compliance by the respective compliance dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

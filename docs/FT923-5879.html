			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Cautious trading A CAUTIOUS calm returned to both the sterling cash and futures markets yesterday as the pound continued to hold above its floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bank of England's large intervention to support sterling appeared to have been initially successful, although dealers feel that the pound will next come under renewed pressure in the run-up to the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. A late fall in the pound against the D-Mark also triggered new depression in futures. In the morning, short sterling futures rose sharply as confidence about the currency spread, although they continue to price in a base rate rise of at least  1/2 percentage point. In late trading they fell back, as the pound took new losses on the foreign exchanges. The September short sterling contract closed 1 basis point up from its previous finish, at 89.18. The December contract closed up 1 basis point to finish at 89.18. Volumes traded were again high, at more than 45,000 lots. Period rates in the sterling cash market softened. Three-month money was down by a  1/4 of a per cent on the offered side to 10 5/8 per cent, while the 1-year rate was down to 10 13/16 per cent from a previous close of 11 per cent. One-month money was back on what dealers called 'the right side of 10 base rate': it closed at 10 1/4 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 10 9/16 per cent. The Bank of England's operations in the sterling money market reflected the easier tone. For the first three days of this week, dealers had rushed to offer paper to the Bank, fearing an imminent rise in base rates. Yesterday, the market took the whole day to remove the shortage of Pounds 1.1bn. In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 20m of Band 3 Treasury bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 60m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 82m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent, and Pounds 30m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 1m of Band 4 bank bills. In the afternoon, it purchased Pounds 62m of Band 1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 139m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 48m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 2m in Band 4 bank bills. There was Pounds 405m of late assistance.</p>

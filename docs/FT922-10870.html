			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: US economy While the 2 per cent rise in US output in the first quarter was the sharpest in three years, it is also a warning against high expectations. Past US recoveries have kicked off with growth of 6 per cent and more. But in past recoveries, the US consumer enjoyed lower or even negative rates of real interest, had higher savings and lower debt in relation to income and was less worried about job security. US consumer confidence is higher now than in previous months. But it is still lower than a year ago. The US economy may not be burdened by Germany's explosion of public spending or Japan's memory of frantic asset inflation. But until its legacy of debt is worked off, growth at much more than 2 per cent may be slow in coming. So why is Wall Street so obstinately cheerful? The optimist would reply that the restructuring of US industry and the huge extraordinary write-offs of last year leave room for a rebound in corporate earnings this year of maybe 40 per cent. But that is largely a matter of swings and roundabouts. On a longer view, it is not quite clear why the Dow should be 10 per cent higher than at its pre-recession peak in 1990. These earnings expectations had better not be disappointed.</p>

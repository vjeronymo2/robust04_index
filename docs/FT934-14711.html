			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Rate cut 'could re-ignite inflation' MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, is warned today that a cut in interest rates in the near future 'may be difficult to justify' on the grounds that it could re-ignite strong inflationary pressures. According to Professor David Currie, a member of Mr Clarke's panel of economic advisers and head of economic forecasting at the London Business School, anything other than a modest cut in interest rates around the time of the Budget could increase the chances of inflation pushing through the Treasury's ceiling. Writing in the school's latest Economic Outlook, Prof Currie says the chancellor should tighten fiscal policy by up to Pounds 4bn in the Budget. This would reassure financial markets that Britain is tackling the large public sector deficit and would help interest rates to remain relatively low in the long term. In spite of Prof Currie's worries about inflation, he believes Mr Clarke will cut interest rates by 0.5 of a percentage point to 5.5 per cent near the Budget, to compensate for the demand-sapping effects of the expected fiscal tightening. Prof Currie says the UK recovery is well established though it will be 'relatively sluggish', partly because of weak demand for exports. He thinks gross domestic product this year will grow by a fairly healthy 1.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Colourful recovery in the nation's capital: George Graham finds Marion Barry running hard to win back the Washington mayoralty The orange clamp on the rear wheel of Mr Marion Barry's Chrysler New Yorker car, as he parked outside the offices of the Washington Post last week, seemed almost the last, desperate effort of the city establishment to stop his resurrection from drug addiction and prison to become, once again, mayor of Washington, DC. With only a week to go before the Democratic party's primary ballot that - in all likelihood, in this solidly Democratic city - will determine the winner of the election in November, it will take more than a clamp to stop Mr Barry. He was last seen by the world outside Washington in 1990, smoking crack cocaine on a videotape made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He served six months in prison for cocaine possession, but returned to win a seat on the Washington city council and now holds a wafer-thin lead in the running for the mayoral primary. A Washington Post poll last week showed him on 34 per cent, against 33 per cent for Mr John Ray, a dull safe council member, and only 14 per cent for the incumbent mayor, Mrs Sharon Pratt Kelly, who won the office in 1990, just after Mr Barry's arrest, with a promise to 'clean house'. Even six months ago, Mr Barry's comeback seemed unthinkable. But his devoted supporters have led an unprecedented drive to register new voters in the city's poorest districts, where the reservoir of sympathy for him is deepest. During the last four months, more than 19,000 new voters have registered for the Democratic primary, half of them east of the Anacostia River in the most depressed area of Washington. The national Democratic party is bracing itself for a Barry victory that seems certain to cause embarrassment. Six months ago, Mr Tony Coelho, a former congressman who has been drafted as the party's top strategist, said that, if Mr Barry were to win, 'the implications are that the comics go wild and the press goes wild.' Today, Mr Coelho calls the candidate a good role model because of what seems to be his successful recovery from dependence on drugs and alcohol. For Mr Barry, a consummate politician, his struggle with addiction is one more element to be turned to account in his election campaign. His speeches even echo the 12-step recovery programme of Alcoholics Anonymous. 'I'm in recovery and so is my city,' he said when he announced his candidacy. Throughout his long political career, Mr Barry has been adaptable. The son of a sharecropper in the Mississippi Delta of the far south, he became, in the 1960s, chairman of the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee, one of the most potent organisations of the civil rights movement, over the head of more messianic leaders such as Mr Bob Moses. In Washington, Mr Barry put on a suit to win a seat on the city school board. In 1978, he won his first term as mayor with a lot of white votes from the US capital's opulent north-west. But, on his return from prison, running in an almost entirely black ward, Mr Barry adopted the brightly coloured kente cloth and kufi caps which have become, for many black Americans, an emblem of their African heritage. Now that he needs votes citywide in his quest for a fourth term as mayor, the business suits have returned, though flashes of kente still appear. 'I'm a situationist. I do what is necessary for the situation,' he once said. Support for Mr Barry in many of the poorer black areas of Washington is fervent and unquestioning. Many saw his pursuit and eventual arrest by the FBI as a conspiracy by the white power structure against a powerful black man. Many others appear to accept his message of personal redemption, and to be willing to give him a second chance to recreate the boom years of the 1980s when he helped to recycle some of the benefits of a thriving local economy through government jobs and summer work programmes. Conspiracy theories are not strange in Washington, a 70 per cent black city which, until it won a limited degree of self-rule 20 years ago, was run by a congressional committee chaired by such luminaries as Senator Theodore Bilbo, also from Mississippi but he was a Ku Klux Klansman. Besides, in a city where, on any given day, sociologists have estimated, four out of every 10 black men are in prison, on parole, on probation or wanted by the police, Mr Barry's cocaine conviction may not seem much of a blemish. Even so, white voters and many of the wealthier blacks in north-west Washington are less forgiving. They remember not only the FBI videotape, but also a Barry administration in which a dozen or more senior officials, including two of Mr Barry's deputy mayors, were convicted of various degrees of corruption. They remember, too, a city government which became an all-purpose jobs programme, and which, even today, after substantial cuts by Mrs Kelly, has more people on its payroll than Chicago, a city four times its size. Whether Mr Barry can win the primary on September 13 depends to a great extent on the size of the anyone-but-Barry vote. Mrs Kelly is unlikely to benefit greatly. She spent most of her first two years as mayor running for some higher national office and started running the city too late to make much difference. With the city facing a budget crisis and the corruption-plagued housing department now in the hands of the courts, anyone-but-Kelly outpolls even anyone-but-Barry. That leaves Mr Ray - and 58 per cent of his supporters, in the Washington Post poll, wishing somebody else were running.</p>

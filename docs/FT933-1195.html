			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (29): Algeria is being left behind - The Maghreb / Economic reform is being tackled energetically in Morocco and Tunisia. But their neighbour has a long way to go to catch up THE contrast between the economies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia is now more marked than at any time since these three North African states became independent more than 30 years ago. Since the mid-1980s Morocco and Tunisia have made considerable progress in restructuring and liberalising the management of their economies. But Algeria, by far the largest, is stuck in a spiral of economic decline and political strife from which its military and civilian leaders appear unable to escape. Algeria's economic reforms, launched during the prime ministership of Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, aimed at freeing foreign trade, at reinstating the private owners of lands nationalised in the early 1970s, and liberalising the management of a tightly run command economy. But these policies foundered when the prime minister was dismissed in June 1991. His successor, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, scuppered the agreement with the International Monetary Fund signed in June that year. A year later, the fate of the reforms was sealed by the resignation of Mr Abderrahmane Hadj Nacer, whom Mr Hamrouche had made governor of the central bank. Mr Belaid Abdesselam, who succeeded Mr Ghozali as premier in the wake of the assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf in June 1992, was unwilling to usher in the essential economic reforms needed to reach a new agreement with the IMF. Mr Abdesselam, who was sacked last August, was too much a prisoner of his past - he was economic overlord from 1965 to 1978 when Algeria launched a huge but abortive programme of industrialisation and socialisation of agriculture. His belief in strict state control of the economy, his highly publicised war on corruption, and his largescale subsidies for bankrupt state companies fed a spiral of economic decline. His successor, Mr Redha Malek, is Algeria's fifth prime minister in five years. Mr Malek seems to have greater prospects of success. But he faces a daunting challenge. In contrast with Algeria, her western and eastern neighbours, Morocco and Tunisia, are making rapid strides. For Morocco, the past 18 months have been difficult. GDP fell in 1992 by 3.5 per cent, largely because of drought. But Morocco has now reached the stage at which the IMF would like other countries, such as Egypt, to be. Since being forced to reschedule its foreign debt 10 years ago, the Moroccan government has cut taxes, tariffs and subsidies. Its budget deficit, as a percentage of GDP, has declined from 12 per cent a decade ago to below 3 per cent. Inflation has been kept below 10 per cent. Morocco has also avoided the kind of financial dislocation that, in Latin American countries, kept risk premiums on interest rates and currency at high levels long after the original financial problem had been resolved. More recently, foreign investment in Morocco has risen fourfold to Dollars 500m since 1988 and a privatisation programme has been formulated and launched. The sale of a 51 per cent stake in the Scior cement company to Holderbank of Switzerland earlier this summer was a watershed. So far this year, two thirds of the government's Dirham 2bn (Dollars 214m) target for income from privatisations in 1993 has been met. The next companies to be privatised are expected to be the 40 subsidiaries of the sprawling Societe Nationale d'Investissement. For the first time last year, receipts from foreign investment into Morocco were equivalent to the deficit on the current account. This is a far cry from the situation in September 1983, when Morocco it was forced to reschedule its foreign debt. At Dollars 21.5bn, the present foreign debt remains asignificant burden - total external debt represents 80 per cent of gdp. However, the debt service ratio has been halved to about 34 per cent of exports of goods and services. This was helped by Saudi Arabia's forgiveness of nearly Dollars 3bn worth of loans as a mark of gratitude to King Hassan for his support during the Gulf war. However, Morocco still has much more to change in order *something in here (HP) * to consolidate its gains of recent years. A confidential World Bank report earlier this year pointed out a number of weaknesses: The manufacturing base remains at a low 18 per cent of GDP, a level unchanged for the past decade and much smaller than in most fast growing industrialising economies; Foreign investment remains limited, accounting for a 10th of total equity; Exports are too narrowly based - mostly garments - and have too few markets, notably France. The report sees two other constraints on business expansion - finance and information. Better business financing means more foreign direct investment, more investment and term lending by foreign and domestic banks, stronger institutional saving to increase the supply of long term deposits. There is also a lack of skilled labour reflecting the fact that the rate of illiteracy among men is only 55 per cent. Tunisia's path to reform has been smiled on by the gods. In 1987, the elderly and senile President Habib Bourguiba was ushered out of power by his interior minister, Mr Zine el Abidine Ban Ali. In the previous year, Tunisian leaders had been forced by severe balance of payments crisis to grasp the urgency of economic reform. Mr Ben Ali's steady hand has since given senior ministers the political stability essential to successful economic reform. Four seasons of good rains and bountiful crops have helped Tunisia raise GDP by an average of 6.6 per cent a year over the past three years. That is more than three times the annual population increase and gives the authorities reasonable room for manoeuvre. Buoyant tourist receipts have also helped. A 6 per cent annual average growth to 1996 will be needed to create the 313,000 new jobs required by the labour market. This is an ambitious target. It must be achieved by rising exports to recession-hit Europe, which takes 77 per cent of Tunisian exports. It also coincides with the economic restructuring which is cutting deeply into the soft underbelly of Tunisian industry. Tunisians also have a higher standard of education than their neighbours and a better average standard of living. Critics are concerned, however, at the lack of economic information available to the Tunisian public, the snail like pace of privatisation and the dispersion of economic management among too many different ministries.</p>

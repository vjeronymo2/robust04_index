			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATTACKS PROMPT CITY'S HOUSING CHIEF TO RESIGN  </P> <P> Telling associates that she "could not cope" with mounting criticism, Leila  Gonzalez-Correa has resigned unexpectedly as the executive director of the Los  Angeles City Housing Authority.  </P> <P> "She had it," said Housing Commissioner Dori Pye, one of a few officials the  embattled Gonzalez-Correa told of her decision over the weekend. "She is a  fighter . . . (but) it was just a pyramid of critique that no human being could  possibly endure."  </P> <P> After learning late last week that her controversial plan to sell the Jordan  Downs housing project in Watts was falling apart, Gonzalez-Correa submitted her  resignation to the housing commissioners Friday before traveling to Florida on  Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under Investigation  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa, 58, is under investigation by city officials for disregarding  federal procurement regulations while awarding contracts to her acquaintances  and to Mayor Tom Bradley's political supporters.  </P> <P> She did not notify Bradley that she had resigned her $100,000-a-year position,  the mayor said Sunday. While Bradley -- campaigning for reelection at a march  against drugs and gang violence in South-Central Los Angeles -- said he would  have no comment on Gonzalez-Correa's resignation, Deputy Mayor Mike Gage  offered the following:  </P> <P> "The mayor's reaction was that he appreciated her efforts in a very difficult  job and respected her decision."  </P> <P> The Times has learned that Gonzalez-Correa misled housing officials and tenants  when she said the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had set  aside 700 federally subsidized housing certificates to allow a private  developer to purchase and refurbish the dilapidated Jordan Downs and continue  to provide shelter indefinitely for low-income tenants. HUD officials confirmed  that there is no commitment to Los Angeles for 700 subsidies, and none is  available now.  </P> <P> "Again, here comes the misleading promises and false representations," said  Claudia Moore, head of the Housing Authority's Residents Advisory Committee.  "It was about time she got out. I don't see how the lady could have stayed."  </P> <P> Gage on Sunday blamed a bureaucratic mix-up in Washington -- not  Gonzalez-Correa -- for the lack of the 700 subsidies. He said the Bradley  Administration would work to persuade new HUD Secretary Jack Kemp to restore  the federal funds.  </P> <P> Reaction to Gonzalez-Correa's surprise resignation ranged from relief among  some city officials and tenants to dismay on the part of her supporters.  </P> <P> "It's probably just as well that she resigned," said Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky. "But I don't think it solves the Housing Authority problem. The  Housing Authority is bigger than Leila Gonzalez-Correa. It is an agency that is  not only run amok, but has turned its back on the low-income tenants they  house."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'a Disgrace'  </P> <P> A shaken Pye said she is "very unhappy and very disgusted" over  Gonzalez-Correa's decision.  </P> <P> "I think it is a disgrace. I think it is a great tragedy. I think it is the  biggest loss the Housing Authority has had in over 20 years," Pye said. "I felt  she would manage to overcome the tremendous avalanche of unwarranted criticism  because she is a strong person."  </P> <P> Pye faulted the commissioners, who are appointed by Bradley to oversee the  agency, for not giving Gonzalez-Correa any support since she was hired in  October, 1986, to run the agency's 750 employees, $135-million budget and 21  public housing projects.  </P> <P> On Friday, Gonzalez-Correa kept her resignation a secret, sharing the news with  only two managers, sources said. After failing to reach Chairman Carl D. Covitz  by telephone, she told Vice Chairman Louis Janicich and Pye on Saturday of her  plans, Pye said. "She simply said she could not cope with the criticism, the  overwhelming opposition and lack of support she received from all of the board  members," Pye said.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa wrote her resignation letter to Covitz, the former HUD  undersecretary whom Bradley appointed chairman of the commission Feb. 7.  Contacted Sunday, Covitz said, "I don't have a reaction."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Travel Plans  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa told colleagues she would spend the next couple of weeks  attending a wedding in Florida, visiting her family in Puerto Rico and then  vacationing in Spain, housing sources said.  </P> <P> Since she had been under fire for her management practices over the last  several weeks, Gonzalez-Correa had gone into virtual hiding and refused  interviews by reporters. Last week, Gonzalez-Correa lashed out at a Times  reporter in a brief telephone interview and complained that she had been  unfairly attacked in the press.  </P> <P> "It is really sad you are giving the Housing Authority really such a bad name,"  Gonzalez-Correa told the reporter. "People like you have to be dealt with."  </P> <P> According to housing sources, Bradley's strong public rebuke of Gonzalez-Correa  last week persuaded her that she no longer enjoyed the support of the mayor's  office.  </P> <P> Reacting to a Times report that a Housing Authority manager had grilled a  tenant leaderfor criticizing the agency in an interview with two Spanish  language television stations, Bradley on Thursday issued a memo urging  Gonzalez-Correa to stop any efforts to silence activist tenants.  </P> <P> In a letter made public by the mayor, Bradley wrote to Gonzalez-Correa: "It is  imperative that, from your office on down, the Housing Authority does  everything it can to encourage, not discourage, tenant participation in the  management of their communities."  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa told associates that she knew the mayor's memo was intended to  chastise her publicly when she did not hear from Bradley or his housing  liaison, Gary Squires, after it was released to reporters, said sources who  asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa also has been under fire for  </P> <P> numerous other practices:  </P> <P> * When she introduced her plans to sell Jordan Downs in February,  Gonzalez-Correa failed to disclose that HUD had withheld $5 million in  improvement funds for the project last fall. As part of the privatization plan,  Gonzalez-Correa said she had a commitment from HUD for 700 subsidized  certificates to keep the tenants on public housing assistance under a private  landlord.  </P> <P> "Although there certainly had been discussion and the subject had been explored  in a preliminary way, there was never a firm, final commitment," said Dirk  Murphy, special assistant to HUD's regional administrator in San Francisco. "To  our knowledge, there is no other commitment that exists."  </P> <P> With the loss of the federal subsidies, tenants at Jordan Downs now face the  likelihood of losing the $13 million in physical improvements that were planned  by a private developer, in addition to the $5 million taken away by HUD because  of the privatization plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Residents Are Victims'  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate that the residents are the victims," Commissioner Ozie B.  Gonzaque said Sunday. "This is another example of what happens when someone is  determined to have a one-man show in an organization that requires teamwork.  This is not an organization set up to be run and dictated by one person," added  Gonzaque.  </P> <P> * The Times reported in February that Gonzalez-Correa ignored federal  contracting regulations on at least six occasions while awarding more than  $200,000 of Housing Authority business to her acquaintances and to Bradley's  political supporters without seeking competitive bids.  </P> <P> The contracting practices are currently being investigated by Chief Legislative  Analyst William McCarley, City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie and City  Controller Rick Tuttle. HUD auditors are expected today to begin their  comprehensive review of the Housing Authority's contracting practices under  Gonzalez-Correa, said HUD spokesman Scott Reed. The audit is expected to last  two weeks. Her resignation will not affect the audit, HUD officials said.  </P> <P> * Gonzalez-Correa recently introduced a "written and oral communications"  policy that would make it a violation of the Housing Authority personnel manual  for employees to write or speak to commissioners, City Council members,  government workers and reporters without the permission of the executive  director.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky introduced a motion last week that would have forced  Gonzalez-Correa to appear before the full City Council to explain her proposed  policy. The council was scheduled to vote on the motion this week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search for Replacement  </P> <P> Pye said the Housing Authority will have difficulty recruiting an administrator  with Gonzalez-Correa's knowledge and resourcefulness.  </P> <P> "She was a person who was going to cut corners and was not going to go through  bureaucratic red tape," Pye said. "We'll get a lot of people who will go by the  book and won't be anything other than puppets of the board. That's not what I'm  hoping."  </P> <P> But tenant leaders said they do not believe the search for a replacement will  be so difficult.  </P> <P> "I feel that now is the time for the mayor to take a good look at someone else  who has sensitivity as far as the residents are concerned, will not come in and  mislead the residents and will follow the rules and regulations of the Housing  Authority," Moore said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOUSING AGENCY CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P> Chronology of events at Los Angeles City Housing Authority:  </P> <P> November, 1985: Executive Director Homer Smith -- under fire for five years for  bad contracting practices, wasteful spending and dictatorial personnel moves --  resigns.  </P> <P> June, 1986: The Los Angeles City Council votes to relinquish control of the  Housing Authority to a board of commissioners after implementing a series of  management reforms.  </P> <P> October, 1986: Ending a nationwide search, Leila Gonzalez-Correa is named  executive director and awarded a three-year contract that pays $100,000 in the  third year. The appointment is her third top post at a housing authority in a  year.  </P> <P> May, 1987: The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development designates the  Housing Authority "operationally troubled." Los Angeles is the only agency  among 66 housing authorities in the Southern California region given such a  designation in a decade.  </P> <P> December, 1987: Tenant leaders from more than half of the city's 21 public  housing projects accuse Gonzalez-Correa of not following through on promises to  improve conditions for the 40,000 low-income people who live in city-run  housing. They describe her first year at the agency as a "disappointment."  </P> <P> March, 1988: Gonzalez-Correa acknowledges that, despite promising the City  Council to "turn things around" in the housing projects, she has quietly been  looking to become housing director in another city.  </P> <P> April, 1988: Tenant leaders demand in a letter that Mayor Tom Bradley seek  Gonzalez-Correa's resignation. More than 100 chanting residents and  placard-carrying children from the projects march on City Hall demanding an end  to slum-like conditions, lack of police protection and long-promised physical  improvements in the projects.  </P> <P> December, 1988: Bradley demands the resignation of Alvin Greene as chairman of  the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners after it is disclosed that he  failed to attend a board meeting for six months. Although Bradley reprimands  two top aides for failing to inform him of Greene's attendance record,  Gonzalez-Correa and Commissioner Dori Pye say the mayor was personally warned  in advance about the absences.  </P> <P> February, 1989: An investigation by The Times discloses that Gonzalez-Correa  has disregarded federal contracting regulations while awarding more than  $200,000 in Housing Authority business to her acquaintances and to the mayor's  political supporters.  </P> <P> February, 1989: Gonzalez-Correa announces her plan to sell the dilapidated  Jordan Downs public housing project in Watts to a private developer. The plan  is cautiously endorsed by Bradley and widely opposed by tenants, who fear they  will lose their subsidized housing. The plan begins to fall apart and is  criticized by several City Council members.  </P> <P> March, 1989: City and federal officials agree to investigate contracting  practices by the Housing Authority.  </P> <P> March 31, 1989: Gonzalez-Correa quietly resigns.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWLY FOUND FAULT LINE BLAMED FOR RECENT JOLTS  </P> <P> The 4.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Monday near Montebello was but the  latest in an unusual rash of temblors in the region over the last three years,  and bolstered a growing sense among scientists that a newly discovered fault  running from Whittier to Malibu could be an active supplier of moderate or even  strong quakes.  </P> <P> Earthquakes have occurred in Los Angeles and surrounding cities more frequently  in the last three years than during any other period since roughly 1930, when  detailed recording of earthquake activity began, seismologists and scientists  said Monday.  </P> <P> Several of the most significant of these temblors -- including the quake  Monday, which was followed by an almost equally sharp aftershock -- have  occurred on a deeply buried thrust fault that was unknown to the experts until  after the Whittier earthquake of Oct. 1, 1987.  </P> <P> Named the Elysian Park Fault, it follows hill lines extending from Whittier  through Montebello, Elysian Park and the Cahuenga and Sepulveda passes to  Malibu and Point Dume, but it never breaks the surface.  </P> <P> Experts from Caltech, USC and the U.S. Geological Survey agreed at a briefing  Monday afternoon at Caltech that at some time in the future, the Elysian Park  Fault could generate a quake in the magnitude 7 range. Since the fault passes  underneath downtown Los Angeles and other highly populated parts of the Los  Angeles Basin, this constitutes a sobering prognosis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accelerated Rate  </P> <P> The experts said the accelerated rate of quakes does not say anything -- at  least, that they now can understand -- about the probability of a really big  quake hitting soon. The major quakes that struck Long Beach in 1933 and the San  Fernando Valley in 1971 were isolated events.  </P> <P> One seismologist, Lucile Jones of the Geological Survey's Pasadena office, said  that the succession of moderate quakes in recent months increases chances that  those in the near future will be of similarly moderate power.  </P> <P> Before the spring of 1986, Jones said, there was usually about one  4.5-magnitude earthquake in the Los Angeles area every three years.  </P> <P> But since then, there have been six quakes of equal or stronger strength,  ranging up to the 5.9 Whittier temblor. This does not count two of the  significant aftershocks to the Whittier quake.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the number of small earthquakes, in the 2-magnitude range, has just  about doubled, Jones said.  </P> <P> Jones said that during the period 1938 through 1942, Los Angeles experienced a  similar increase in the frequency of moderate quakes, and USC geologist Egill  Hauksson recalled that in the late 1940s, there were several 5.5- to  6.5-magnitude earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault near Banning.  </P> <P> Neither episode of high-quake frequency was followed by a giant quake, they  said.  </P> <P> "Nothing that happened today makes us fear a larger earthquake more than we did  yesterday," Jones said.  </P> <P> But, she added, the quake on a segment of the Elysian Park Fault several miles  west of the segment that caused the Whittier quake "confirms that we have an  active fault structure west of where we've had it in the past."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Considerable Distance  </P> <P> Other scientists said that quakes off Malibu in January and near Point Dume in  1973 now appear to have been on the Elysian Park Fault system, indicating that  it is active over a considerable distance.  </P> <P> Kerry Sieh, a Caltech geologist, said: "Not any of us would be surprised to  have a flurry of 5s and 6s on this fault in the next 30 years. I would not be  surprised by a 7.5."  </P> <P> "There's no way we could rule out a 6.5- or 7-magnitude quake," Jones agreed.  </P> <P> A 7.5 quake would be 1,000 times stronger than the Monday quake, which  incidentally was only about one-twentieth as strong as the 5.9-magnitude  Whittier earthquake.  </P> <P> Sieh said that certain studies indicate that over the last 2 million years  there has been an average movement of several millimeters a year along the  Elysian Park Fault system. Over the last 100 years, there has apparently been  very little movement -- "so we may see more," he said, a prediction based  strictly on the law of averages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Study of Earthquakes  </P> <P> Unlike the San Andreas and the state's other well-known fault systems, in which  earth on opposite sides scrapes sideways, the Elysian Park Fault thrusts the  earth on one side upward, while the other side slips lower. This process  creates great folds on the surface that can be seen in the form of the  Whittier, Montebello and Hollywood hills.  </P> <P> After the San Francisco quake disaster of 1906, the study of earthquakes in  California focused for decades on the state's great surface faults, its  so-called strike-slip faults. For the most part, experts concentrated on the  San Andreas.  </P> <P> After the Whittier earthquake, however, considerable attention began to be paid  to the thrust, or dip-slip, faults. After recognition of the Elysian Park  Fault, scientists said the destructive Coalinga quake of 1983 and the  Sylmar-San Fernando quake of 1971 could have been caused by other dip-slip  faults.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hills Pushed Higher  </P> <P> The earthquake Monday, as did the Whittier one, had its epicenter deep beneath  the surface, in this case eight or nine miles, the scientists said.  </P> <P> The Whittier quake, USC's Hauksson said, thrust the Whittier Hills up about two  inches higher than they had been before. Monday's smaller quake probably made  the Montebello Hills about 0.2 inches of an inch higher than before, he added.  </P> <P> The shaking of the latest quake was very similar to the kind felt in the  Whittier quake, only less, Hauksson said.  </P> <P> Since scientists became aware of the Elysian Park and possibly other thrust  faults in the greater Los Angeles region, there has been some attempt to map  the subsurface cleavages, but this undertaking has not yet been anywhere near  as extensive as the charting of surface faults.  </P> <P> Hauksson said Monday that while such mapping could delineate potential hazard  zones, it would "not say anything about probabilities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE ELYSIAN PARK FAULT -- The Elysian Park fault was unknown to scientists  until after the 5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake of Oct. 1, 1987. But since  then, this deeply buried, fold-and-thrust fault has come to be appreciated as  perhaps one of the most dangerous in the Los Angeles area. Extending along hill  lines northwestward from the Whittier Hills through the Montebello Hills, East  Los Angeles, Elysian Park, the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains  to the coast off Malibu and Point Dume, the fault, which never comes to the  surface, may be capable of generating a quake as strong as magnitude 7,  scientists believe.  </P></p>

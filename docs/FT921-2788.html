			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Operable letter of credit completes North Sea oil rig transfer DAVY OFFSHORE LTD v EMERALD FIELD CONTRACTING LTD Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Fox, Lord Justice Staughton and Lord Justice Beldam): March 6 1992 TITLE TO North Sea oil equipment under a supply contract which provides for completion on payment by letter of credit presented with proper documents by the supplier to the bank, passes when the buyer provides the supplier with the documents required to operate the letter of credit. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the defendant, Emerald Field Contracting Ltd, from Mr Justice Hobhouse's decision (FT, January 28 1992) giving judgment for the plaintiff supplier, Davy Offshore Ltd, on a claim under a sub-contract for the supply of oil field equipment. LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON said that by a contract dated November 30 1992 between Emerald and Davy, Davy was to supply a platform called a floating production facility (FPF) and other works. All items were to be installed and commissioned by Davy. The price was to be Pounds 127.8m. Davy was concerned that title to the goods and works might pass to Emerald before it had been paid the greater part of the contract price, and without its receiving some of the documents necessary to operate a letter of credit opened in its favour. It asked the court to determine when and in what circumstances title would pass. The bank was obliged to pay within five business days of presentation of proper documents. Mr Justice Hobhouse concluded that the property was to pass upon acceptance by the bank of the documents. He did not mean on receipt of the documents, but rather at the time when the bank decided that they complied with the requirements of the credit. By clause 18.1(a) of the contract, title to the work and facilities were to be transferred to Emerald 'immediately upon completion and payment of the amount due from (Emerald) at completion as referred to in clause 17.2'. Clause 17.2 provided that on completion Emerald should pay Davy 95 per cent of the contract price. The 5 per cent balance was to be paid three months and five banking days after completion. Clause 17.5 provided that Emerald's obligation to pay under clause 17.2 was to be satisfied by Davy drawing under a letter of credit. By clause 18.1(b) Davy warranted that at time of transfer and vesting of title, the work and facilities would be free of all mortgages, liens or other encumbrances. By clause 18.1(c) it agreed that at time of transfer it would deliver to Emerald a duly executed bill of sale in British form in respect of the FPF, reflecting the warranty. Clause 36.3.1 provided that, subject to satisfactory completion of work and receipt of specified documents including the bill of sale, 'completion shall occur', and Emerald would issue a completion certificate and procure the provision of a certificate from the secretary of state for trade and industry confirming that conditions under section 10 of the Industry Act 1972 had been satisfied. Emerald was then to return all the documents to Davy, which would then present them to the bank under the terms of the letter of credit. Emerald's principal argument was that the first instalment payable by the bank under the letter of credit, was not due from Emerald at completion under clause 18.1(a). It was due from the bank, and it was due after completion. Clause 18.1(a) provided for payment of the amount due from Emerald at completion 'as referred to in clause 17.2'. Clause 17.2 expressly required Emerald to pay 95 per cent of the contract price on completion. Emerald's obligation to pay Davy on completion 'pursuant to clause 17.2' was repeated in clause 17.3. Clause 17.5 provided that that obligation should be satisfied by Davy's drawing under all letters of credit. Those provisions made it clear that 'payment of the amount due' from Emerald in clause 18.1(a) did include Davy's drawing under the letter of credit, or at least being placed by Emerald in a position to do so. Business sense supported that construction. One would not expect the parties to provide that passing of title should be deferred until trivial amounts were paid, but not until Davy was in a position to draw the largest proportion under a letter of credit. There were other arguments. First, Emerald said the contract required Davy to hand over a duly executed bill of sale when work was complete, and since a bill of sale was an instrument which transferred property in a ship, title must then pass. The basic rule was that property passed under a contract when it was intended to pass (section 17(1), Sale of Goods Act 1979). Since the bill of sale was to be handed back by Emerald under 36.3.1, and Davy was to use it for presentation under the letter of credit, it could not have been intended that property should pass when it was first handed to Emerald,so as to override 18.1(a). There was a second argument on clause 18.1(c) which provided that 'at the time of transfer to and vesting of title pursuant to sub-clause (a) above' Davy should deliver to Emerald a duly executed legal bill of sale. That suggested that when the bill of sale was delivered to Emerald, title did pass. The provision made no sense in the light of the other terms of the contract. Provisions of a contract might be rejected if they could not be reconciled with the remainder (Glyn v Margetson &amp; Co (1893) AC 351,357). An alternative solution, which was very plausible, was that the parties contemplated terms as to payment, delivery of documents and completion, operating at the same or substantially the same time. A third argument was based on a 'first qualifying certificate' required to be presented by Davy to the bank, stating that it waived all possessory liens in respect of the work and the facilities. How, it was asked, could Davy have any liens to waive if title did not pass until the bank had examined the documents? The first answer was that title passed either when Davy was equipped to operate the letter of credit, or when it presented the documents to the bank. But if that was wrong, there was no reason why a property-owner should not waive possessory liens for the future, against the time when he ceased to be owner. The property did not pass until Davy was provided by Emerald with the documents required to operate the letter of credit. The appeal would therefore be dismissed on that issue. By a settlement agreement, dated June 27 1991 between Emerald and Davy, clause 17(a) provided that 'subject to the provisions of sub-clause (b) hereof' Davy agreed that payment of outstanding sums under the prime contract should be deferred. Clause 17(b) provided that 'the provisions of sub-clause (a) above shall not apply to any letter of credit' issued to Davy in relation to the prime contract. By clause 19(a) Davy and Emerald confirmed that, save as agreed in the settlement agreement, 'the prime contract shall continue in full force and effect'. It was argued for Emerald that clause 17(a) provided for 'any sum outstanding at completion' to be deferred. Therefore, it was said, clause 18.1(a) of the prime contract, where it referred to 'payment of the amount due from (Emerald)at completion' no longer had any content - no sum was due from Emerald at completion. That argument was defeated by clause 17(b) of the settlement agreement, to which clause 17(a) was expressly made subject. Clause 17(a) was not to apply to any letter of credit. The originating summons asked the court to declare, among other things, that (c) the obligation under clause 36.3.1 to provide a section 10 certificate was a condition of the prime contract and arose at completion. The judge made a declaration that the obligation to provide a section 10 certificate arose at completion, and was a condition of Davy's obligation to pass title. He did not decide it was a condition breach of which would amount to a repudiation. He merely held that title did not pass until the certificate was delivered. That conclusion was correct. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed For Davy: Lord Irvine QC, Edwin Glasgow QC, Richard Wilmot-Smith, and Stuart Catchpole (Ashurst Morris Crisp). For Emerald: John Dyson QC and Mark Templeman (Watson, Farley &amp; Williams).</p>

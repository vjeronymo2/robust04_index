			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SALKELD RECORDS WIN IN PROFESSIONAL DEBUT  </P> <P> Roger Salkeld, making his professional debut Friday night, threw 36 pitches --  25 for strikes -- and picked up his first win as the Class-A Bellingham (Wash.)  Mariners defeated the Spokane Indians, 7-3, in a Northwest League baseball game  at Bellingham.  </P> <P> Salkeld, a Saugus High graduate who was the third selection overall in the  amateur baseball draft by the Seattle Mariners, did not walk a batter and  struck out four. He allowed only an infield single.  </P> <P> "That's pretty close to as sharp as I've been all year," Salkeld told The  Bellingham Herald. "I was around the strike zone. I felt real good about it."  </P></p>

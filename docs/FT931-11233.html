			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Mercedes Benz invests DM800m on research MERCEDES-BENZ, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, is to invest DM800m (Dollars 490m) to build a new technical centre in Germany for the development of future car models. The research and development centre will play a crucial role in the German carmaker's plans, announced last week, to transform its strategic product policy. During the 1990s, it wants to change from being a traditional maker of exclusive luxury cars into an 'exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market'. Mr Dieter Zetsche, Mercedes-Benz director for car development, said that the company planned to concentrate all new vehicle design, development and engineering operations at only two locations, instead of the present 18 sites in south-west Germany. The new technical centre will be built at Sindelfingen in south-west Germany, near Mercedes-Benz's main domestic car assembly plant. It is planned to begin operations in 1996 and will have a workforce of around 4,500. The design and development of engines and transmissions will be concentrated at the group's Unterturkheim plant in Stuttgart. The carmaker's plans for the new technical centre are a belated recognition that it has fallen behind its rivals in the efficiency of its development and engineering operations. BMW, its rival German luxury car maker, opened an integrated DM1.1bn research and engineering centre in Munich at the end of 1989.</p>

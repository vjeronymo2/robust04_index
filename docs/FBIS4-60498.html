			<p>BFN     [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Dear listeners, honorable citizens: Our unified Kurdistan  Democratic Party [KDP] urges a quick normalization of the  situation in the city of Irbil and all over Irbil Governorate as  a basic step toward detente. Decisions in this regard were made  with the participation of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front [IKF] and  the political bureaus of both parties and under the sponsor of  the unified Iraqi National Congress [INC]:    1. On 14 May 1994, it was agreed that both side's troops be  removed from the roofs of houses and buildings inside Irbil,  including the buildings of the parliament and the ministries.    2. It was agreed that forces be withdrawn from inside Irbil  on 23 May.    3. At a meeting held in the operation room at the INC's  headquarters on 22 May, conferees stressed the need to implement  the previous agreements by starting withdrawal of both sides'  forces from Irbil.    4. But the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] is still  procrastinating and has not carried out any part of the  agreements. On the contrary, it continues to deploy its forces  in other areas of Irbil and is still concentrating its forces in  areas near Irbil like (?Banislau). The fighters of the PUK are  still in control of the buildings of the parliament, the  ministries, and the Council of Ministers that are adjacent to  the parliament building. Thus, the Irbil residents are  continuing to appeal to both sides to withdraw their forces to  keep the fire of fighting away from the city.    O citizens, this stalemate poses danger to Irbil's security,  particularly since the presence of such a large number of  fighters leads to regrettable daily clashes. We in the KDP add  our voices to those of the honorable residents of Irbil and call  for the implementation of agreements by totally withdrawing from  the city of Irbil and from all over Irbil Governorate as a basic  step in this stage. We have announced our readiness to withdraw  our forces from the Shaqlawah axis. However, the PUK is still  regrettably procrastinating.    Once again, we place the Irbil residents before these  realities, and we assert that the interests of both sides  require withdrawal from Irbil [words indistinct]. The brothers  in the PUK sometimes raise objections to what they call  violations in other areas of Kurdistan. Whatever these  objections may be, they do not absolve us all from the duty of  preserving the city of Irbil's security and its residents'  safety, particularly since international organizations and UN  personnel are present in the capital.    The Irbil masses have demanded in several ways steps to keep  the fire of fighting away from inside the city and to stop  fighting everywhere, just as the IKF, the INC, and our people's  friends have demanded. We in the KDP call warmly and honestly  for responding to the popular calls from Irbil, from all over  Kurdistan, from national and social figures, from ulemas, from  various popular sectors, and from the Iraqi and Kurdistan  national forces and parties and for quickly putting an end to  this deteriorating situation inside Irbil.    In addition to this, the domination of the city by the two  sides' forces has paralyzed the parliament and the Kurdistan  Region's Government. It is well known that the fighters of the  PUK have not yet withdrawn from the buildings of the parliament  and the ministries. They have also erected barricades and  checkpoints in the streets leading to the buildings of the  parliament and the Council of Ministers.    We beseech Almighty God to help us. God supports honest  people. God's peace, mercy, and blesses be upon you.</p>

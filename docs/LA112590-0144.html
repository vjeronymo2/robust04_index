			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO BUENA VISTA EXTENDS PLAYOFF STREAK  </P> <P> It's a difficult thing, bucking history. Point Loma discovered that.  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista continued to remain unbeaten in section playoff games,  winning its ninth consecutive with a 27-12 victory Saturday night over Point  Loma in front of 4,200 at Vista High School.  </P> <P> RBV will play Palomar League rival Orange Glen in the semifinals Saturday at a  site to be determined.  </P> <P> Each of the Longhorns' menagerie of backs shone at one time or another. But it  was the defense which ultimately provided the difference in the game.  </P> <P> "Defense is where I thought we played exceptionally well," RBV Coach Craig Bell  said. "The key to our defense is controlling the run and to get them throwing  late in the game."  </P> <P> The Longhorns (10-2) limited Point Loma to 213 total yards and intercepted two  fourth-quarter passes -- one by Mark Pallotto and the other by Eric Borgeson.  </P> <P> Pallotto's interception with 5:48 left in the game came with RBV clinging to a  13-6 lead. But on the first play after the interception, Markeith Ross dashed  64 yards and David Leese's PAT made it 20-6.  </P> <P> Point Loma (9-2) came back, driving 77 yards in the following two minutes and  scoring on a 16-yard pass from Toby Gault to Shaunta Baker with 3:43 remaining.  The two-point conversion failed when Gary Griffie applied pressure to Gault,  and Fune Moi deflected the pass.  </P> <P> RBV recovered the ensuing onside kick at the Point Loma 46. Six plays later,  Ross scored from the eight with 1:32 left.  </P> <P> Borgeson then picked off Gault's first pass of the ensuing drive and the  Longhorns ran out the clock. RBV's offense dominated the game with 385 yards on  the ground.  </P></p>

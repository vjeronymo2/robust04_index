			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAVING LANDED NBA RIGHTS, NBC SAYS IT WILL PASS ON '94 WORLD CUP  </P> <P> NBC said Monday that it will not bid for U.S. television rights for the 1994  World Cup, the first world soccer championship to be played in the United  States.  </P> <P> Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, also predicted that ABC and CBS would  decline to bid for rights to the monthlong tournament.  </P> <P> "Given the ratings, I don't think anyone will go for it," Ebersol said while at  Wimbledon to watch the tennis championships.  </P> <P> Turner Broadcasting's TNT cable network is showing this year's World Cup in the  United States. Fewer than 2% of U.S. viewers who receive the network watched  the three games involving the United States, which played in the World Cup for  the first time in 40 years.  </P> <P> Turner, televising the World Cup for the first time, paid about $7.5 million  for U.S. broadcast rights and said it will evaluate the final ratings before  deciding whether to bid for the 1994 tournament.  </P> <P> NBC and the U.S. Soccer Federation last year agreed to a contract for the 1994  tournament, but the contract was rejected by FIFA because it was tied to a deal  for rights to exhibition games involving the U.S. team. FIFA has said it will  entertain bids for U.S. rights later this year. Since then, NBC agreed to a  four-year deal with the NBA that begins this fall.  </P> <P> "Once we signed the NBA, we no longer were interested in the World Cup,"  Ebersol said.

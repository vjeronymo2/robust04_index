			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Cash shortage closes Zaire banks All commercial banks in Zaire will close next week because of a cash shortage, the Zaire Banking Association said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Kinshasa. The Banking Association said that the Central African country's 12 commercial banks needed 10 trillion (million million) zaires a month for their clients but were only getting 480bn a month from the Central Bank. For months, the banks have been closed most of the time, dealing with selected customers through the back door. However, most withdrawals are limited to the equivalent of Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 and the zaire currency has become almost worthless. The largest denomination bill of 100,000 zaire is worth less than Dollars 1.</p>

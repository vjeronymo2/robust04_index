			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / People: Green takes new top post at CWS Co-operative Wholesale Society, whose retail turnover has grown from Pounds 800m to Pounds 2bn in three years, has created a new post of chief general manager, to be filled by Allan Green, currently general manager, national buying and marketing. CWS has expanded its retailing activities beyond its traditional areas of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the south-east through a series of mergers with regional societies - including the large Nottingham and North-Eastern societies - and has overtaken the Co-operative Retail Society as the UK's largest co-operative retailer. Green, 48, joined the CWS in 1990 as food trade manager of the south-eastern retail business. He had previously held positions with Hillards, the supermarket chain later taken over by Tesco, and with Booker, the wholesale and cash-and-carry group. He moved to CWS head office in Manchester last year to take on the job of centralising the buying and marketing activities across the society in the wake of its regional mergers. Green also played a significant role in creating the Co-operative Retail Trading Group, a buying partnership which harnesses nearly 60 per cent of national Co-op buying power through CWS Retail. Green joins Bruce McDougall, existing chief general manager of CWS's specialist retail functions - which include its travel business, opticians and funeral business. He will be succeeded as general manager of national buying and retail marketing by his deputy David Chambers.</p>

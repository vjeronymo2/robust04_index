			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises on strong figures THE DOLLAR recovered strongly after subdued trading as unexpectedly robust economic data helped revive market optimism over the US economy. The closely-followed National Association of Purchasing Management index showed a surprising increase to 52.4 for February, its highest since October 1991, and well above both market expectations and the January figure of 47.4. This coincided with a 1.3 per cent rise in construction spending for January, compared with the 0.6 per cent predicted. 'The markets had been positioning themselves for a number below 50 on the NAPM index,' said Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. 'Today's figure is seen as an important indicator and could point towards a recovery in the second quarter.' The dollar had earlier tested downside support towards DM1.63, as the market anticipated some mixed data ahead of Friday's crucial employment report. It had, however, gained some strength from the disclosure by US treasury under-secretary Mr David Mulford that the yen had been discussed at the meeting of G7 deputy finance ministers at the end of last week, but that no decision had been taken on correcting its weakness. The dollar rose to close at DM1.6450/60 from DM1.6443/50 before the data were released and a DM1.6400/10 start. In Tokyo, it had closed at DM1.6427 after quiet trading within very narrow bands. Gains on the yen were, however, restricted as speculation continued about heavy sell orders around the Y130.00 mark. The dollar closed up slightly at Y129.70/75, after a Y129.50/60 start. It had ended in Tokyo at Y129.58/62. The D-mark lost ground against most main currencies after the rise in the dollar, but made small gains against the Swiss franc despite statements from the Swiss National Bank that it was still concerned about the currency's recent losses. The peseta remained well below its EMS ceiling, although it recovered slightly to 5.88 per cent above its pivot against sterling, compared with 5.77 per cent on Friday. Its softness against the D-mark dropped sterling's floor in the EMS below DM2.87, from above DM2.88 last week, and the market has taken the opportunity to push sterling gradually lower, although it has remained above the very bottom. Most traders, however, have discounted the idea that this could provide room for an imminent UK rate cut. Sterling moved little, drawing no encouragement from weekend opinion polls putting the opposition Labour party slightly ahead, or the still gloomy economic outlook. It finished slightly up at DM2.8799, having opened at DM2.8778, although it dropped as far as DM2.8734 at one stage. It closed down against the dollar at Dollars 1.7507, from an opening of Dollars 1.7580, although it briefly topped Dollars 1.76 just before the US economic data were released.</p>

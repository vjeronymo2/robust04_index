			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Germany's banks may face strike THE THREAT of a strike in the German banking sector loomed closer yesterday after negotiations between employers and the two leading bank trade unions collapsed. The unions walked out of the talks saying there was no point in further negotiations because the employers refused to improve their offer above 5 per cent. Both the HBV (commerce, banking and insurance) union and the DAG white-collar workers' union are demanding a pay rise of 10.5 per cent and shorter hours. The employers' organisation immediately responded by declaring their 5 per cent offer in effect from February 1, regardless of any new wage settlement. They accused the unions of insisting on a settlement of at least 6 per cent 'against all the demands of economic reason'. Warning strikes have already been held in banks in several areas and both unions are now committed to holding a strike ballot. It is the second time in a month that German industrial relations have been brought to the brink of open conflict, after a steel strike was narrowly averted two weeks ago. See Lex</p>

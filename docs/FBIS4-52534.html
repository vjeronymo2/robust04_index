			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam has  reiterated that there will be no amendments to the constitution  during his term in office, Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik  said Wednesday.    "There is not the slightest change in my thinking that the  constitution will not be amended during my term of office," Chu  quoted the president as saying.    The president's statement came after a press report that the  21st Century Commission, a presidential advisory body, on  Wednesday broached the issue of a constitutional amendment.    "Prof. Yi Sang-u, chairman of the 21st Century Commission,  apparently made no mention of the alleged need for a  constitutional amendment when he verbally reported on the  results of the commission's study to the president on Tuesday,"  said Chu.    Reference to a constitutional amendment could have been made  in a five-volume written report to the president, Chu said.    "(But) If a sensitive problem like a constitutional  amendment  was verbally reported (by Yi), the president would have reacted  right there," Chu said.    "The president would have said there will be no  constitutional amendment," Chu added.</p>

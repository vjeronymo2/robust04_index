			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press release dated 18-4-94"] </F>   [Text] The Government of India views the recent escalation  of tension in Bosnia and Herzegovina and specifically around  Gorazde with deep concern. The lives of innocent citizens and  UN peace-keepers have once again come under unwarranted threat.  A ceasefire must be put in place and respected and the peace  process resumed without delay so that there can be movement  towards a political settlement which is irreversible and  acceptable to all parties. The Government of India calls upon  all parties to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to eschew  the futile pursuit of a military solution as this only results  in endless bloodshed which is abhorrent to the international  community. We call for the immediate resumption of the process  of negotiations.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Deal may defuse rebellion MINISTERS were last night confident of heading off a backbench revolt over British Rail privatisation as they neared agreement with rebel Tory MPs over protection for concessionary fare schemes. A compromise plan that may require franchise operators to provide discount fares for the elderly, families and young people, is likely to be announced by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, when the Commons resumes debate on the Railways Bill today. Mr MacGregor, whose conciliatory approach appeared to have calmed many of the potential rebels' concerns, held a series of individual meetings with MPs yesterday and will hold more today. He is trying to balance Tory rebels' demands for discount fare schemes to be mandatory with his determination to ensure maximum flexibility for franchise operators. Sir Keith Speed, Tory MP for Ashford - who is leading the revolt - said after his meeting with Mr MacGregor there had been a 'meeting of minds'. But if a deal was not reached, he reckoned at least 12 MPs could rebel - enough to wipe out the government's majority. Protection for discount fares for the disabled is already in the Railways Bill. Ministers argue other discount schemes make commercial sense but the rebels want assurances written into the bill. Under pressure from MPs from London and the south-east Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, told the Commons last night 'we mean to control fare increases where it is appropriate'. He promised that detailed proposals would be outlined later today when MPs resume debate on the bill. Sir John Stanley (C Tonbridge and Malling), won support from other prominent Tory backbenchers when he complained about the lack of any provision in the bill to moderate fare increases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] A Turkish-Kazakh oil agreement has been signed in  Ankara which is expected to significantly meet Turkey's energy  deficit and which will generate a revenue of $2 billion  annually. Under the agreement, the Kazakh-Turkish MU NAY company  jointly established by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation and the  Kazakh oil company will begin production in August.    The agreement was signed by Veysel Atasoy, minister of  energy  and natural resources, and by Syzdyk Abishev, Kazakhstan deputy  prime minister.    In a speech at the signing ceremony, Atasoy said that oil  exploration has ended in Kazakhstan and no obstacles remain  before production. Abishev said, in turn, that his country  wants to share its riches with Turkey. He pointed out that with  the agreement, Turkey is no longer an oil-consumer but an  oil-producer.    In a statement to Turkish Radio and Television after the  signing ceremony, Atasoy said that the agreement covers a period  of 36 years: 11 for exploration and 25 for production. The  Turkish Petroleum Corporation will invest for exploration, while  the two sides will share the investment for production in  proportion to their shares.    Of the oil to be produced as of August 1994, 206,000 tonnes  will be brought to Turkey. The total oil reserves in the area  are estimated to be $4 billion barrels. At the end of 1995,  130,000 barrels of oil and 13.5 million cubic meters of gas will  be produced daily. The agreement envisages daily productions of  481,000 barrels of oil in 2001 and 68.5 million cubic meters of  gas in 2002.    [Begin Atasoy recording] The oil reserves in our shared area  with Kazakhstan is estimated to be 4 billion barrels and the gas  reserves to be 387 billion cubic meters. Of this, 2.16 billion  barrels of oil and 208.9 billion cubic meters of gas belong to  the Turkish Petroleum Corporation. In dollar terms, this means  we will save $32.4 billion from the oil and $16.7 billion from  the gas. In other words, a total of $49.1 billion will be saved  in a period of 25 to 26 years. Turkey will close its energy  deficit. Of course, natural gas is as important for us as oil.  Environmental issues are very important in our day. Natural  gas is the cleanest source of energy. In the future, we are  thinking of building natural gas power stations. [end recording]    Before the signing ceremony, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  received Kazakhstan Deputy Prime Minister Syzdyk Abishev.    [Begin Ciller recording] Our share of the production there  will be almost as much as our production in Turkey. Our  revenues will be about $1 billion yearly as of next year. We  aim at expanding this further in the future. This is a very  happy occasion for us. [end recording]</p>

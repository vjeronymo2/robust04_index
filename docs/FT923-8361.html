			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi back in the black with Pounds 11m SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI, the advertising company, yesterday reported a return to profit with a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 11.1m for the first half of 1992. That compared with a loss of Pounds 32m for the corresponding period of 1991. Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, said it was the first time the company had made a profit since he joined at the start of 1990. 'It is nice to be in the black,' he said. The group's shares rose 5p to 136p on the news although that was still well below the 175 1/2 p equivalent price at which Mr Louis-Dreyfus invested Dollars 3m of his own money on joining the group. He said it was 'the worst financial investment I have made in my life'. He has already announced plans to leave in June next year. The chief executive said the group, which completed a recapitalisation including a Pounds 60m share issue in March last year, was now on a stable financial footing. He added that it was not planning to raise any new funds. Net debt was Pounds 185m at the period end, and there were Pounds 26m of earnouts to be met. Mr Louis-Dreyfus said he expected it would be 1995 before the group could pay a dividend. He pointed out that revenues were showing no underlying growth, and he expected them to be similar to last year, excluding currency movements. Revenues in the half year were Pounds 354.7m (Pounds 352.8m). That was despite the loss of some large clients in 1991 such as the Northwest Airlines account. Mr Louis-Dreyfus said that the second half of the year would suffer from the loss in the UK of Rover, the motor group. However, in the Far East, accounts worth nearly Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m) had been won recently. Trading profits were Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 10.6m) showing an improvement in margins from 3 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Mr Louis-Dreyfus revealed that group margins were targeted to reach 10 per cent by the end of 1994. 'There is no reason today we will not get there with flat revenues'. Staff numbers had fallen from 13,000 in 1991 to 12,300 currently, and a further 100 jobs could go in the second half through natural wastage. First half severance costs amounted to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 6.3m). Interest charges were Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 14.6m) and there was an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.9m (loss Pounds 28m after restatement in line with the 1991 accounts). Earnings per share were 0.7p (losses 55.6p). There were extraordinary charges of Pounds 9.4m relating to goodwill written off on the sale of YCS.</p>

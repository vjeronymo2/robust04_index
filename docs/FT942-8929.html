			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Banks hold out on loan to Eurotunnel A dozen international banks with substantial exposures to Eurotunnel were last night refusing to provide new senior debt for the Channel tunnel operator's refinancing. Yesterday evening, 24 hours after the formal deadline for raising the funds, members of Eurotunnel's 200-bank syndicate had made commitments to provide just over Pounds 500m of the new debt, still well short of the Pounds 700m target. The company has also not yet received formal approval from banks for its refinancing, including changes in its loan agreements, to avoid it being in breach of covenants. Votes have been received from 80 per cent of banks, compared with the 90 per cent majority required. About half of the recalcitrant banks are Japanese. However, a principal lender to the group said that some European banks had also not yet made any commitments to provide the new funds. 'It is all moving in the right direction, albeit slowly,' a European banker said. He was hopeful that those big banks holding out would eventually provide the funds and vote in favour. He said it would be harder to achieve the target if the banks holding out were the ones with small exposures to the company's commercial debt of Pounds 6.8bn. Until the banks have guaranteed to provide the senior debt and purge the breaches in loan covenants, Eurotunnel cannot launch its rights issue to raise a further Pounds 850m in equity, around 20 per cent more than the stock market had originally been expecting. Yesterday Eurotunnel gained permission from its shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting to issue an additional 150m units - which twin a Eurotunnel plc share with a Eurotunnel SA share - in the rights issue. The company has permission to issue 342m units, worth Pounds 1.38bn at yesterday's closing price of 405p per unit. But Eurotunnel emphasised that the size of the authority did not indicate the size or price of the rights issue. Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel chairman, said after the meeting that it would probably try to raise total debt and equity of about Pounds 1.6bn if it opted for an equal mix of loan and share capital in the refinancing.</p>

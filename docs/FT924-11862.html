The US Department of Commerce has ruled that several Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics and Goldstar Electron, are selling dynamic random access memory (Dram) chips at far below fair market rates in the US. The Korean semiconductor industry fears that if the preliminary dumping ruling stands it could cripple exports to the US, its biggest market. The US accounts for 44 per cent of Korean Dram exports.</p>

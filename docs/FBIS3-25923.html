By the end of last year, foreign funds used by the forestry  sector in Zhejiang amounted to about 60 million U.S. dollars and  there are now 45 foreign-funded enterprises in this sphere in  the province.    Foreign investors turned their attention to the raising of  fruit trees, bamboo processing and tourist projects in forest  areas.    The largest foreign-funded project in Zhejiang's forestry  sector is an afforestation project funded by the World Bank,  whose loans to the project amounted to about 2.8 million U.S.  dollars.    The first three-year phase of the project has been carried  out and Zhejiang has planted trees on an area of 46,200 hectares.    The second phase of the project will start in 1995.    The foreign funds have promoted the export of forest  products  in Zhejiang. Last year, the export value of forest products in  Zhejiang was 250 million U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sales growth lifts Coca-Cola Strong sales growth helped Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, increase earnings per share by 20 per cent for the fourth quarter and 17 per cent for the year, excluding accounting changes. Part of that growth was due to share repurchases, which reduced the number of shares in issue by 14m, or 1 per cent, during the year. Since 1984, Coca-Cola has repurchased 429m shares - 26 per cent of those outstanding. Unit case volume rose by 5 per cent in the US for the quarter and the year, while international volume grew by 7 per cent for the quarter and 9 per cent for the year. (A unit case contains 24 8oz servings.) Fourth-quarter turnover increased to Dollars 3.37bn from Dollars 3.24bn. Net income rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 466m from Dollars 392m and earnings per share rose to 36 cents from 30 cents For the year, turnover advanced to Dollars 13.96bn from Dollars 13.07bn. Excluding unusual items, net income rose by 16 per cent to Dollars 2.19bn from Dollars 1.88bn and earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.68 from Dollars 1.43 - though if a Dollars 219m charge for accounting changes to 1992 earnings were included, the increase in net income would have been 31 per cent. Coca-Cola said if unusual items were stripped out, full-year net income would have been up 19 per cent at Dollars 2.23bn and earnings per share 20 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.71.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Eruption of Resentment" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on the vigorous fighting of South Korean students and  people against rice market opening by the Kim Yong-sam traitor  clique which is warming up along with their anti-U.S., anti-war  and anti-nuke struggle. Assessing this as an eruption of their  pent-up grudge and resentment against the Kim Yong-sam group  which has bartered away their vital rights to outside forces,  after selling the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, the  news analyst says:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam during his U.S. trip last November  begged for an "international cooperation system" to hurt fellow  countrymen and, in return for that, secretly promised a total  opening of South Korea's rice market to the United States. This  folly could be committed only by such heinous traitor as Kim  Yong-sam who schemes to maintain and prolong his power with the  backing of his master even if the lifeline of the six million  farmers of South Korea must be cut off, the economy as a whole  be driven into a fatal crisis and the entire nation fall a  victim to a nuclear war of outside forces.    In an attempt to lull the angry public sentiments, the  traitor staged the drama of dismissing the puppet minister of  agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Behind the scene, he  worked out a criminal document to widen the scope of farm market  opening and is making haste with its "National Assembly  approval."    With no bayonet-brandishing and deception can the fascist  group block the righteous action of the South Korean people to  defend the dignity of the nation and their vital rights.    Inevitable is the miserable doom of the treacherous regime  of  Kim Yong-sam.</p>

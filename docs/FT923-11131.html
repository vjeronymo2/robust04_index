			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Commitment to information centre needed Sir, I find it confusing, to say the least, that with the extensive publicity surrounding the UK presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, the future of the Centre for European Business Information in London should still be a matter of debate and discussion. Surely it would be embarrassing that such a centre, part of a network of more than 200 European information centres operated in partnership with the European Commission throughout the Community and one of only a small number funded directly by a government agency in the EC, should be threatened with closure at such a time, with the single market close at hand. Perhaps continued financial support for such organisations would better convince people of the government's commitment to the development of closer business links between UK companies and their counterparts in the rest of the Community, than press statements and glossy leaflets by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Department of Trade and Industry. Martyn Riley, 8 Queen Elizabeth Square, Maidstone, Kent</p>

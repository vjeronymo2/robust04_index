			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK hunts for working week deal BRITAIN and France were yesterday attempting to broker a last-minute compromise over the 48-hour working week directive due to be put to a vote at today's meeting of labour and social affairs ministers in Luxembourg. The UK is vehemently opposed to the directive but its 11 EC partners appear determined to achieve it. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK employment minister, was due to meet Ms Martine Aubry, the French labour minister, in Paris yesterday to discuss the issue. The Portuguese presidency, at the behest of France and Germany, has offered Britain concessions which would allow the UK to delay introducing the 48-hour limit for up to 10 years, when the situation would be reviewed. This would be seven years more than the three years allowed to all member states for the introduction of new directives. It would also give workers willing to work more than 48 hours the right to do so, while those unwilling to exceed the prescribed limit would get the full protection of the law. Employers would be obliged to keep records of both groups of workers, under the surveillance of national health and safety authorities. The British government indicated on Monday it was resolved to vote against any measure which would oblige it to limit the working week, even in the future. It was not clear yesterday that Britain's partners would press the issue and risk a new breach in Community unity ahead of Friday's Lisbon summit where EC heads of government will discuss the future of the Maastricht treaty for the first time since its rejection by Denmark on June 2. Britain's EC partners were also considering issuing a declaration that they would not use the concessions granted to the UK. Such a declaration, sharply delineating the labour market aspirations of the 11 from those of the UK, would replicate the division of social policy agreed at Maastricht - if only for a limited period. But this first practical instance of Maastricht's agreement to disagree would depend on 'the UK at least abstaining' on the working time directive, according to a senior EC official.</p>

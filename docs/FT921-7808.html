			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Tax help for Names expected MPs BACKING a campaign for more favourable tax treatment for Lloyd's Names are confident that changes may happen in next year's Budget. Names face losses of Pounds 1.3bn when the insurance market reports its annual results in June. Lloyd's, with the Association of British Insurers, which represents insurance companies, has been lobbying for changes to rules governing the amount of profit Names can set aside in tax-free reserves. It argues that the stringency of regulations puts the UK industry at a disadvantage compared with competitors overseas. Rules governing special reserves - which allow Names to pay the lower rate of tax on annual provisions up to Pounds 7,000 - have remained unchanged for 35 years. Mr Ian Taylor, Tory MP for Esher, said yesterday that the Inland Revenue had agreed to 'look more sympathetically at the need to provide adequate reserves'. A report by Davies Arnold Cooper, the solicitors, to be published later this week, criticises the Revenue for a lack of sympathy over the need to build up reserves for claims from liability policies, which sometimes emerge many years after the policies are written. Pressure on Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, increased yesterday when Mr Max Madden, Labour MP for Bradford West, put down an early-day motion questioning whether he was 'the right person to lead Lloyd's'. The motion links Mr Coleridge with Mr Ian Posgate. 'In 1982,' it states, Mr Coleridge 'was a member of Baby Syndicate No 973 which had only six members' including 'four legendary Lloyd's fraudsters, Mr Raven, Mr Gratton-Bellen, Mr Parry and Mr Ian 'Goldfinger' Posgate, all of whom were repelled (sic) from Lloyd's'</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENSION HEADACHES  </P> <P> Question: I know from my own experience that psychological factors, such as  anxiety, can cause tension headaches. Is this possible?  </P> <P> Answer: Poor posture can trigger tension headaches.  </P> <P> Slouching, for example, may force the body out of alignment so the head and  neck muscles contract. When you are sitting, try to keep your shoulders back  with your head erect and your feet flat on the floor. If you have to remain  seated for an extended period of time, try changing your position. Stretch your  arms above your head or rotate your shoulders in a circular fashion. Also,  lower your head slowly to one side, then do the same to the other side.  Rotating your head slowly, both clockwise and then counterclockwise, may also  be helpful.  </P> <P> Even sleeping in an unusual position can trigger a headache by stiffening the  head and neck muscles, causing them to contract. Whether you sleep on your back  or on your side, your head, neck and spine should be aligned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184,  Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will answer  as many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

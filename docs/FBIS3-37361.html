			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1645 GMT on 15 February carries an  untitled recorded program in which Sergey Filatov, presidential  chief of staff, reviews last week's political events with an  unidentified interviewer.    An introductory comment says: "Last week did not abound in  vivid domestic policy events." What actually happened was that  the State Duma, "which has not yet adopted a single important  law," discussed the question of moving out of the old mayor's  office and into the White House. It also set up a commission to  look into the events of 3-4 October. Members of the old and new  economic schools continued to argue about future government  policy. "The president reduced his activities owing to illness.  That may be why the latest package of decrees signed by him did  not look as impressive as during the previous week."    After briefly surveying the various decrees on personnel  changes, Filatov says: "In accordance with a directive from the  president, the signing took place of a protocol on political  consultations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Azerbaijan. In general, I must say that it is a very good  document, since it does place on a permanent footing the  dialogue between the leadership of these republics at various  levels and on all matters, and that is precisely what is said in  the document, which is to be signed by the Foreign Ministry on  the instructions of the president."    Asked about moves to bring the president into conflict with  parliament, Filatov looks at the three possible sites that  parliament could occupy, according to a suggestion from Lukyanov  -- the Kremlin, Old Square, and the White House -- and dismissed  each one as a practical impossibility.    The interviewer then asks about the state of the president's  health, since there is considerable speculation about it.  Filatov replies: "There is a lot of flu about in Moscow at the  moment, as you all know. There have been many cases. As far as  I remember, we expected Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin on Monday.  He really did want to come, but later he felt unwell. You know  the way it goes: Sometimes you get up and it passes off once you  are on your feet, and, at other times, the illness knocks you  out. I don't think that he managed to avoid that insidious  illness. It seems quite normal to me."</p>

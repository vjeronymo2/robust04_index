			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Observer: Heavy at Trevi Sifis Valyrakis, Greece's new undersecretary for public order, is causing quite a stir in Brussels. He is terribly popular on his native island of Crete, where he has been elected to parliament at every election since 1977. But he does have a rather unusual pedigree. He was arrested twice in the mid-1970s, first for smuggling a boat load of weapons through the Aegean, then for organising armed groups in Greece who were reportedly trained by Palestinian guerrillas. Unkind mutterings within the government suggest he was given a junior minister's job in order to make up the numbers of Cretan deputies - the island being more solidly socialist than anywhere else in the land. Which does nothing to quiet some in Brussels who wonder whether Valyrakis should be allowed to participate in meetings of the Trevi group. Composed of EU interior and public order ministers, it deals with immigration, border security and counter-terrorism matters. At least Valyrakis would know what he was talking about.</p>

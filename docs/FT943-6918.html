			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Directors told to reveal financial control systems Companies are to be strongly urged to produce a statement describing their internal financial controls from the start of next year. Under draft guidelines issued yesterday directors will have to provide a statement in the annual report and accounts stressing that they are responsible for internal controls. They will also be asked to provide a description of the key procedures used by their company and how directors review the system of internal financial control. The guidelines were released by the working group on internal control convened at the request of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, comprising individuals from business and the accountancy profession. The Cadbury committee, which issued its report at the end of 1992, advised companies to provide a statement of internal controls in their accounts, which led to the creation of the working party. Companies are not forced to comply, but any quoted business that does not provide such a statement must note in its accounts that it fails to meet this requirement of the Cadbury code on pain of reprimand from the Stock Exchange. The revised internal control guidance is significantly less detailed than an earlier draft issued last year, which came under a barrage of criticism from industry. It no longer includes the suggestion that directors comment on non-financial internal controls, or that they should provide an opinion on the effectiveness of these controls. The directors' statement should include the steps taken to ensure an appropriate control environment in the company, the process used to identify significant risks, the main information and control systems in place, and the monitoring system used. Mr Gerry Acher, head of audit at KPMG Peat Marwick, welcomed the simplified new draft. He said: 'The subject of internal controls is best dealt with between the auditor and the audit committee, not in a report. But the report puts the onus on the audit committee to do its job.' Comments on the draft proposals are invited before the end of October.</p>

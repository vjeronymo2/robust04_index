			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Imad al-Karaki: "Conclusion of Several </F> Contracts and Joint Ventures with British Businessmen"]    [Excerpts] An economic delegation from the London Chamber  of Commerce and Industry visited Syria last week to increase  trade between the two countries and to get acquainted with the  investment climate following the issuance of Investment Law No.  10 of 1991. The delegation met with businessmen in Damascus and  Aleppo and held meetings with the Syrian Chambers of Commerce  and Industry and several government officials. The meetings  with the businessmen resulted in the signing of several  contracts with owners of industrial firms. The delegation  examined economic feasibility studies on several projects,  foremost the "plastic insulation" project, at the Damascus  Chamber of Commerce. It was decided that the British will  provide expertise while Syria will provide local raw materials  and manpower for this project.    The other important point raised was that the British side  will study Investment Law No. 10, since not many British  businessmen and investors are fully aware of it. The Aleppo  Chamber of Commerce requested the British delegation to dispatch  a legal mission from Britain to read this law and to explain it  to British businessmen at the chamber's expense. The British  delegation proposed dispatching a woman lawyer who is also a  board member in the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry to  compile a study on the law. [passage omitted]    The British delegation expressed its satisfaction with the  Syrian laws regulating foreign trade and also with the  Investment Law. Several contracts were signed between Syrian and  British businessmen. The members of the delegation affirmed  that they will return to Syria to conclude other projects which  they are studying and that businessmen outside the London  Chamber of Commerce and industry might also visit Syria.

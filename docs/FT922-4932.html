			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Inquiry takes toll on Eurocopy EUROCOPY, the photocopier distributor, yesterday blamed the effects of a government inquiry into the selling practices of some of its subsidiaries for an 80 per cent decline in interim profits. The company - which was allowed to retain its consumer credit licences in January following a six-month investigation by the OFT - suffered a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.66m to Pounds 720,000 for the six months to March 31. Sales fell by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 19.3m). Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, said Eurocopy's competition had had 'a field day' during the inquiry, exploiting doubts prompted by the investigation. However, such practices had stopped since the OFT's announcement. The difficulty now was recession, he said. Eurocopy had seen no sign of a sustained upturn in the second half. Nevertheless, the uncovered dividend is held at 1.1p on the premise that the first half - disrupted by the inquiry and the election - had not been representative of normal trading patterns. The final pay-out, however, depended on a 'sustained recovery coming through'. The greatest decline came in machine sales, where gross margins plunged from 50 to 12 per cent, and the operating loss almost doubled to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.3m). Profits from servicing fell from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 3.6m. The furniture business - acquired with Equipu in 1989 - incurred a Pounds 500,000 loss (breakeven). Earnings per share fell from 5.01p to 1p. Mr Armitage said the company was about to issue a writ claiming Pounds 9.2m from Sketchley over the Equipu purchase. Companies acquired in the transaction were at the root of claims about misleading practices which led to the OFT inquiry. Mr Cyril Gay, the chairman, said that overhead costs had been kept under constant review and savings had been made which would reduce annual service department and administrative costs by Pounds 1m. He said those savings would start to come through in the second half.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ON 'RODEO WEEKENDS'  </P> <P> Laurie Schenden's article, "Cowboys Saddle Up for 2 Rodeo Weekends" (Feb. 17),  amounted to an advertisement that glorified the cruel "sport" of rodeo. The  article never told your readers that bucking broncos buck because they are made  to wear bucking straps that contain sharp metal studs that cause the animals  enormous pain; nor that animals are moved about behind the scene by use of  cattle prods that torture them with strong electrical shocks; nor that no  veterinarians are on hand to help injured animals, such as calves who suffer  painful neck injuries in the calf roping contests.  </P> <P> PETER L.

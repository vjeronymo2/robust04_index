			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Output benefits seen from hours cuts MORE THAN half the cost of the recent cuts in the working week for manual workers in engineering was absorbed by productivity improvements linked to the hours reductions, says a study published today, Michael Smith writes. Wage settlements also tended to be lower to help pay for the cut in hours. Overall, the reductions of two hours, conceded by employers of at least 500,000 manual workers, added less than 1 per cent to the manual labour costs of the companies which took part in the survey. That figure shows that employers fell considerably short in their target of incurring no cost by conceding shorter weeks. The study, by Mr Ray Richardson and Mr Marcus Rubin of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, found that about 10 per cent of companies did not negotiate productivity concessions linked to the hours deals. However, the study found that, for some companies, the two-hour reduction in the working week led to a fall, or at least no increase, in labour costs. This was because bargaining for the reductions became the occasion for management to press hard for changes which improved efficiency. This tactic was particularly successful where unions were becoming less resistant to change. Nearly 80 per cent of managers replying to the survey said the shorter week had resulted in earlier agreement on changes, or agreement on changes which would otherwise not have been considered at the time.</p>

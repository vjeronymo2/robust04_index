			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Premier Consolidated Oilfields drops 12% PREMIER CONSOLIDATED Oilfields yesterday reported a 12 per cent fall in net profits for the first half of 1993, from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.6m, with last year's figure restated to allow for accounting policy changes. But the UK independent exploration and production company predicted that output would jump from 14,200 barrels a day at present to 20,000 b/d by 1996. Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said a planned maintenance shutdown last April at the Wytch Farm field in the UK and declining production at the offshore Angus field accounted for much of the fall in net profits. The shutdown caused average first half production to fall to 11,000 b/d, which was reflected in lower turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 26.3m) and operating profit of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 9.7m). Earnings per share were 12 per cent down at 0.84p (0.95p). The company said three areas - Wytch Farm, the Fife oil field in the North Sea and the Qadirpur gas project in Pakistan - would help boost production to a peak of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 1996. Mr Jamieson said the first successful horizontal well at Wytch Farm extending under Poole Bay would ensure that the company's higher production level would be maintained this year, with Fife and Qadirpur coming fully on stream in coming years. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the company was also well placed to carry on with its 'aggressive exploration programme' despite current low oil prices. But the option of 'purchasing reserves is still there,' according to Mr Gerry Orbell, exploration director. He said that although there would be no fall in Premier's overall exploration spending, in the short-term the emphasis would be on lower-risk exploitation and appraisal of existing discoveries. In the past five years one in eight of Premier's wildcat wells drilled outside the UK had proved to be commercial. The record in the UK was one in 10.</p>

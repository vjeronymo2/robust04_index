			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Whisky company acts against Portuguese WILLIAM GRANT &amp; SONS, distillers of the internationally-known Glenfiddich and Grant's whisky, has taken legal action against the Portuguese distributor of a rival Scottish company to prevent it marketing gin and vodka under the brand name Grant's. Several crates of spirits were seized on Monday from warehouses and retail outlets in Lisbon after William Grant &amp; Sons had been granted an injunction against the Portuguese company Scorbebe which had been distributing on behalf of Glen Cardine Bonded Warehouse. The move follows similar legal action taken in May in a Scottish court against Glen Cardine and two associated companies, A. Bullock and Company (international) and William Morton. A spokesman for William Grant &amp; Sons said it had gone ahead with the latest litigation because the other companies had refused to stop producing and selling products under the Grant's name, and were threatening to expand their market penetration in Southern Europe. Aire-based Glen Catrine is one of the three leading Scottish low-strength whisky producers. It was recently embroiled in a public controversy claiming that an EC directive discriminated unfairly against low-strength whisky. The company has a bottling plant and bonded warehouse at Catrine, a distillery in Loch Lomond, and a warehouse division in Glasgow.</p>

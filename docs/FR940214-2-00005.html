			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners also claim that since Rotem acquired Negev's production facilities, Rotem's total production facilities are much more extensive than Negev's were. As a result of the merger, Rotem is a larger full-service phosphate and related products producer and is not the same company that Negev was before the merger.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners further maintain that supplier relationships have also changed as a result of the merger. The former Negev obtained important raw material inputs from Rotem, which was then a separate company. Since the merger, raw material input for the production of the subject merchandise is now supplied by captive internal production, which petitioners argue constitutes a significant change in supplier relationships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the merger, petitioners also argue that Rotem now has a much larger and more diverse customer base than Negev had. Furthermore, prior to the merger, Rotem, as a fertilizer producer, had no customers in the United States and made no sales to the United States. Therefore, the merger opened up an entirely new market for Rotem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, the respondent maintains that the petitioners have presented no arguments that had not already been taken into account in the preliminary results. Therefore, the Department has no grounds for reversing the preliminary determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to changes in management, the respondent maintains that personnel changes as the result of the merger are minimal. Furthermore, respondent argues that sales staff for the subject merchandise remained the same and most of management, including top management in the company, retained their positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent claims that when addressing changes in production facilities, petitioners focus, as when addressing other factors to determine successorship, on the production of non-subject merchandise. Prior to the merger, Negev and Rotem formed a part of the same parent company. These two companies were both located at the same plant site and shared some infrastructure. Moreover, products that were transferred from one company to another were transferred on special intra-company terms. According to the respondent, these elements demonstrate that there was no change in production facilities with regard to the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent argues that petitioners' premise regarding supplier relationships is completely erroneous. Respondent maintains that the raw material inputs obtained by Negev from Rotem are not essential or even necessary in the production of the subject merchandise. Furthermore, when these raw materials were obtained from Rotem prior to the merger, they were purchased under an intra-company pricing formula determined by the parent company. Therefore, there has been no change in suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to customer base, respondent claims that the customer base for the subject merchandise did not change. Respondent argues that petitioners are focusing on sales of non-subject merchandise, as illustrated by their example of sales to new customer groups such as the farming community. According to the respondents, the farming community does not have a need for the subject merchandise, industrial phosphoric acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Chase and CSFB win roles in Turkish sale TURKEY has invited two foreign banks into final negotiations on the sale of the government-owned refineries and oil products distribution businesses, in what will be the country's largest privatisation. Bankers confirmed that Credit Suisse First Boston and Chase Manhattan have been asked to present final proposals for the sale of Tupras, the state refineries company, and Petrol Ofisi, the government-owned oil distribution and retail concern. Preparatory work could be completed within three months and a sale may take place by mid-1994. The sale is expected to raise more than Dollars 1bn. The Public Participation Administration, the government agency which handles state sales to the public, earlier invited proposals from some 22 foreign banks. Only 19 banks responded to the offer, and a final group of eight were asked to make verbal presentations in Ankara last month. Chase is linked with its local subsidiary and Turkish brokers Global Securities. If it is decided to use an international public offering, Chase is expected to bring in bankers Kleinwort Benson of the UK and Salomon Bros of the US. CSFB has joined with Garanti Bankasi, a local family-owned bank, and Garanti Securities, its broking arm. The contract is to advise as well as implement the sale of both companies, either separately or as integrated units. The sale would involve finding a strategic buyer from within the industry or a local or global public offering, or a combination of all three.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pressure at core reins in L Wise Leslie Wise yesterday blamed a flat year-end performance on volatile trading conditions in the retail sector. Pre-tax profits at the the textile and garment group, which supplies chains such as Burton and Etam, dipped from Pounds 2.52m to Pounds 2.47m in the year to November 30. Mr John Gowers, chief executive, said profits had been undermined by an Pounds 89,000 exceptional charge to cover legal costs of an aborted takeover bid. Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 49.5m (Pounds 48.7m). Nevertheless, sales in the textile division increased by 6 per cent and operating profits rose by 22 per cent. The improvement was offset, however, by pressure on margins in the core garment business, due to lower volumes and rising raw material costs. Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.76m (Pounds 2.84m). Earnings per share declined to 4.74p (4.96p). Mr Gowers said that in the current year 'we propose to continue to aggressively seek profit growth through increased sales, internal rationalisation and by acquisition or organic growth when appropriate'. The final dividend is held at 2.25p for the second year, to give an unchanged total of 4p. The shares closed up 3p at 87p.</p>

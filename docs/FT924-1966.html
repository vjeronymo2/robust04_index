			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London Metal Exchange base metals ended mixed in mostly routine trading. The sharpest movements were a Dollars 70-a-tonne rise in cash NICKEL, which traders said was capitalising on the presence of downside support, increased physical interest in the US and short covering, and a Dollars 13-a-tonne fall in cash ZINC, influenced by technical liquidation following Chinese sales. ALUMINIUM met overhead resistance above Dollars 1,230 a tonne for three months delivery and the price closed at Dollars 1,219.50 a tonne, down Dollars 9 on the day. COPPER prices remained below their early highs, with resistance above Dollars 2,220 a tonne for three months metal proving a stiff barrier to upside moves once short covering and Chinese buying was absorbed. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA futures continued on their recent downtrend and closed with losses of up to Pounds 11 a tonne. 'Nobody is really prepared to invest heavily on the short side,' one dealer commented. Robusta COFFEE prices ended higher but below earlier 13-month peaks. Compiled from Reuters</p>

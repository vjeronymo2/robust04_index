			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Letter: Direct insurance ignores principle of the many paying for the few Sir, Missing from Richard Lapper's examination of direct insurers ('Fire-eaters and contortionists', January 6) was any acknowledgement of the vital role still played by independent insurance intermediaries. Mr Lapper suggests that by no longer paying commission to intermediaries, the direct writers are able to offer cheaper insurance to the public. He fails to point out that it is the public who is paying the substantial bonus paid to insurers' staff, including the Pounds 1.5m bonus to Mr Peter Wood of Direct Line. Commission or bonus, it comes out of the same pockets. The direct insurers offer cheaper insurance because they shy away from anything other than 'standard' risks. In Mr Lapper's words, Direct Line 'rejects risks it thinks certain to produce claims'. How could an insurance company operating on this basis fail to make money? The issue glossed over in the article is how the difficult risks are to obtain cover. If the direct writers force high street intermediaries out of business while continuing to bet only on racing certainties, where will the young, the elderly, those with convictions, those driving fast cars and any other unusual cases turn? Insurance is grounded on the principle that the many pay for the misfortunes of the few. Independent intermediaries distribute the varied motor insurance risk among a wide constituency of insurers. As a result, 'standard' risks pay marginally more if they go through a broker in order to subsidise higher risks drivers - and keep the entire market on an even keel. The savings from going direct are often only a few pounds. One wonders whether the ultimate disruption to the market as a whole is worth the cost. After all, a standard risk can become a higher risk at any time, because of an unavoidable claim or because of the underwriting caprice of a 'flexible' direct insurer. It is in the interests of all drivers to maintain a market in which all drivers can obtain insurance at reasonable cost. Kevin Pratt, editor, Insurance Age, 33-35 Bowling Green Lane, London EC1</p>

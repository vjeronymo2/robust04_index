			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Working women who lose out - A simple adjustment to NI contributions can make the difference JUST under 500,000 working women face a reduced income in retirement because they have no right to a basic state pension in their own name. Instead, they will join the ranks of the 1.5m women who are forced to rely on their husbands' National Insurance record to claim a proportion of the pension. Even this can be lost if the woman changes her marital status. Yet, these women could improve their pension prospects by making a simple adjustment to their NI contribution arrangements. In some cases, the adjustment could even boost take-home pay. NI is a form of tax on earnings and is levied by the government to fund a range of benefits including pensions and sickness and disability payments. Most employees pay full-rate contributions but about 460,000 working women pay a reduced rate known commonly as 'the married woman's stamp.' This is an anachronism left over from a more paternalistic era when it was assumed automatically that women would be provided-for in retirement by their husbands' company and state pensions. Under the old rules, women who were married or widowed before April 5 1977 could elect to pay the reduced rate but all who started work after that date have had to pay the full rate. The married woman's stamp was popular originally because it meant a much lower deduction from the weekly or monthly pay cheque. But, in return, these women forfeited the right to a basic and earnings-related state pension in their own names. Instead, they claim what the department of social security (DSS) calls a 'category B' pension, which is worth 60 per cent of the spouse's basic state pension. Before October 1989, there were still significant savings for most women who paid reduced-rate contributions. That year, however, the DSS restructured the NI rate bands. Since then, many women could have switched to the full rate for little or no extra cost and, at the same time, they would have started to build up a claim to the state pensions. In fact, as the table shows, women who earn less than Pounds 76 a week will actually pay less under the full rate than they do at present under the 'reduced' rate. Those earning more than Pounds 76 a week should seek advice from the DSS to find out if the benefits they will earn under the full rate before retirement will more than compensate for the higher contribution costs involved. The decision for higher earners is less clear because of the complicated way in which an individual's entitlement to a state pension is calculated. The DSS is reluctant to give an estimate of pension rights without full details of age, sex, employment history and other factors but, generally, it takes about 40-44 years to earn the full basic state pension (which is worth Pounds 56.10 a week for the 1993/94 tax year). If you pay contributions for a shorter period, your pension is reduced accordingly. As a rule of thumb, you need at least 10 years' full-rate contributions to qualify for the smallest proportion of the state pension, at present worth Pounds 14 a week. Under present proposals, it is almost certain that the government will raise the female state pension age from 60 to the male age of 65. But the change will be phased in, and will not affect woman over 50. This means that they will not be able to achieve the minimum contribution period for the lowest proportion of the basic state pension. They will, however, earn a right to a state earnings-related pension (Serps), since credits for this build up from day one. Serps is worth between 20-25 per cent of 'band' earnings - that is, earnings between the lower and upper threshold for NI. For the present tax year, this means earnings between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420. Depending on when a person retires, the Serps pension will be based either on their best 20 years of earnings or on average earnings over their entire career. If a woman takes no action to build up a basic state pension in her own right (a category A pension), she will qualify for a category B or spouse's pension under her husband's NI record. Assuming he has a full track record, the category B pension will be worth 60 per cent of the full basic state pension - that is, Pounds 33.66 a week for the present tax year. The category B pension does not become payable until the husband reaches 65, whereas a state pension earned in a woman's own name would be payable from age 60. When the husband reaches age 65 the woman will receive the higher of the category A or B pensions but, unfortunately, not both. Married women and widows who pay NI contributions at the reduced rate will have a valid certificate, in most cases held by their employer. This will bear a reference: either CF383, which is a certificate of election to pay the reduced rate, or CF380A, which is a certificate of reduced liability. To make the switch to the full rate, they should contact their local DSS, ask for form CF9, and return it together with their CF383 or CF380A certificate. But they should check their facts carefully to make sure they will benefit from the switch since, once they have made it, they cannot revert back to the reduced rate. Those who wish to continue paying the reduced stamp should bear in mind that this right is lost if they spend more than two consecutive years out of employment. Moreover, the right is withdrawn if their marriage ends in divorce or annulment, although widows who remarry can continue to pay the married woman's stamp. Since 1978, women who have had a career break to raise a family or look after an elderly relative have been able to claim Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP). This provides credits towards the basic state pension but does not build up a right to Serps. For a full explanation of your state pension prospects, ask for pension form BR19 at your local DSS.  -------------------------------------------------------- National insurance contributions for 1993/94 tax year  -------------------------------------------------------- Weekly earnings       Full rate NIC    Reduced rate NIC  -------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 54                        Nil        Pounds 2.08 Pounds 56                Pounds 1.12        Pounds 2.16 Pounds 70                Pounds 2.38        Pounds 2.69 Pounds 76                Pounds 2.92        Pounds 2.92 Pounds 90                Pounds 4.18        Pounds 3.46 Pounds 140               Pounds 8.68        Pounds 5.39 Pounds 190              Pounds 13.18        Pounds 7.51 Pounds 250              Pounds 18.58        Pounds 9.62 Pounds 420              Pounds 33.88       Pounds 16.17  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

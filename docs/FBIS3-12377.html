The meeting addressed developments on the local scene in  light of the final endorsement of the accord document on 10  Ramadan [20 February] in Amman, capital of fraternal Jordan.    The General Committee praised the role played by His Majesty  King Husayn Bin-Talal in bolstering Yemeni unity and ending the  political crisis suffered by our people over the past months.  The General Committee asserted that all efforts should be made  to immediately begin practical implementation of the accord  document. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee said that  once the document is finally endorsed, it becomes binding and  ends the crisis.    The GPC General Committee further stressed the need for the  state's legislative and executive agencies to reassume their  duties. This step is a must to begin the implementation of the  accord document. Any attempt to prevent Constitutional bodies  from reassuming their duties means circumventing the document  and weaseling out of its implementation, despite signatures  witnessed by local and foreign public opinion.    Reviewing developments in the local arena, the General  Committee took note of the military escalation that started on  the eve of the signing of the document and the subsequent  actions in the Abyan Governorate in particular. The citizens of  the Abyan Governorate are facing unwarranted attacks and  provocations by the military units that were moved from the  Hadhramaut and Aden governorates in the direction of Abyan.  This was done in violation of the accord document, which  stipulates freezing any military moves, and in violation of the  responsibilities of national duty, which require creating a  suitable climate to immediately move to the practical  implementation of the accord document.    The GPC General Committee asserted that all efforts should  be  made to avoid any new escalation in this regard and work to  return all military units to their previous positions and take  to task all those who are behind the military escalation. The  purpose of this is to protect citizens and maintain the noble  national missions of our Armed Forces, which we deem a bulwark  that protects the homeland and its sovereignty and ensures the  citizens' safety and security.    The General Committee urged the people, their valiant Armed  Forces, all political parties and organizations, mass and other  organizations, and ulema and social figures to stand united  against those who advocate disunity and those who sow sedition  and against all attempts to return to the situation that  prevailed before 22 May 1990. All should stand united in  defense of unity and democracy and in defense of social peace  and the homeland's national interests and to prevent bloodshed  and safeguard citizens' rights, security, and stability.    Reviewing the general situation in light of the aftereffects  of the crisis, the General Committee also urged all state bodies  and central and local institutions to exert more efforts in  order to alleviate the citizens' living hardships. It also  urged these bodies and institutions to make their first priority  the lifting of all forms of suffering and putting an end to all  manifestations of corruption and security violations. This is  meant to ensure a strict enforcement of the law, without any  hesitation or going easy on violators.    Concluding its meeting, the General Committee urged all  members of the GPC and all its leadership and base cadres to  promote their relations with the masses, adhere to the accord  document, and promote awareness of the content of this document  between the citizens. The document is a national program for  the coming stage. It bolsters the unity of the people and the  homeland and protects their democratic march that is based on  political and party pluralism, peaceful transfer of power, and  respect for the bodies of constitutional legitimacy that  expresses the people's free will.    The General Committee highly appreciated the efforts of the  GPC representatives in the Political Forces Dialogue Committee,  stressing the need to support the committee's efforts in the  present stage. Now that the document is signed, the committee  will follow up on the implementation of the document.    During the meeting, the General Committee made several  organizational decisions. It also issued a press statement.</p>

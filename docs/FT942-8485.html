			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Lobbyists deliver first-class service For a nationalised company it was without precedent. The Post Office embarked on a lobbying campaign that was impressive by the standards of any professional private consultancy. In one year it persuaded enough Conservative backbenchers of the merits of commercial freedom for the government yesterday to issue a green paper widely expected to lead to the corporation's privatisation. There are still about 12 Tory MPs opposed to the government's preferred option of selling 51 per cent of Royal Mail and Parcelforce. But compared with last year - when ministers estimated that about 50 of its MPs were opposed to privatisation - it is quite a coup for the part-time lobbyists. Mr Alan Williams, Post Office public relations director, spearheaded the campaign. As the former head of the Department of Trade and Industry's newsroom he knew his way around Westminster's corridors. He made a list of MPs of all parties he wanted exposed to Mr Bill Cockburn, the corporation's chief executive. 'We needed to mount an open lobbying campaign,' he said. 'There was always a feeling that we should not do it because we were a nationalised industry. But we felt the issue of commercial freedom was so important we had to do it.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was informed of the campaign, although his permission was not required. Mr Cockburn always made clear to MPs that all he wanted from the government was more commercial freedom. But as the campaign continued it was clear that the 'only government show in town' was partial privatisation. The Post Office chief then turned his attention to Tory backbenchers who feared that rural post offices would close in the event of a sell-off. He assured them that he was committed to the rural service. Sir Donald Thompson, MP for Calder Valley, said he was 'greatly cheered' to receive a letter from Mr Cockburn guaranteeing the rural network. Mr Sebastian Coe, Falmouth and Camborne, said that after originally opposing full-scale privatisation he was won over to the 51 per cent plan. Mr Cockburn lunched and dined his way through meetings with more than 150 MPs, but was always careful not to be extravagant. 'We had to play it by the book,' said Mr Williams. 'As a nationalised industry there is no point in us asking for commercial freedom if we present people with a picture of free living.' It was never champagne, but usually beer and sandwiches. Where possible MPs were asked to meet Mr Cockburn at the Post Office's headquarters in Old Street, London. But if they wanted to be taken to a particular restaurant, Mr Cockburn obliged. 'We were customer-friendly to the MPs,' said Mr Williams. 'We offered them whatever was most convenient. Some of them had a particular favourite place to meet for lunch while others just wanted to talk the issues through over a cup of tea.'</p>

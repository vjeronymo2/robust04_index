THE ULTIMATE  SUCCESS WILL NOT BE KNOWN FOR YEARS.  </P> <P> The dramatic mother-to-daughter lung transplant at Stanford University Medical  Center last week illustrates the risks surgeons and family members are prepared  to take with potentially life-saving experimental operations.  </P> <P> The complex procedure, planned by doctors for the last year and a half, also  demonstrates that transplant surgeons are no longer satisfied with simply  prolonging a person's life -- particularly a child's -- for a year or two.  </P> <P> "A child that receives a transplant is going to need to grow and develop  normally if you can ever consider that transplant successful," said Dr. Vaughn  A. Starnes, the chief surgeon for the operation.  </P> <P> Both mother and daughter, who have requested anonymity, were reported making  good progress on Sunday as they continued their recovery from Thursday's  operations, which are believed to have been the first of their kind in the  world.  </P> <P> The child suffers from a rare, invariably fatal, lung disease known as  bronchopulmonary dysplasia. She also had a heart defect, which was corrected  during the surgery.  </P> <P> But it now appears that the ultimate success of this and future living donor  lung transplants will not be known for three to four years, when the girl's  health and development can be assessed.  </P> <P> The surgery is considered highly experimental because fewer than 20 lung  transplants using cadaver donors have been performed in children worldwide and  because of the potential risk to the mother.  </P> <P> In adults, several hundred lung transplants have been done, with a one-year  survival rate of about 70% and a three-year survival rate of 50% or less,  Starnes said. By comparison, heart, kidney and liver transplants are far more  common and the overall results far better. Physicians suspect that one reason  is that the lung may trigger stronger immunologic reactions in the body than do  other organs.  </P> <P> Starnes, the director of Stanford's heart-lung transplant program, has been  planning living donor lung transplants since 1989. While Stanford's results  with dead unrelated donors compared favorably with many other programs, he had  become frustrated by several factors.  </P> <P> * About a quarter of the children awaiting lung transplants were dying while  they waited, because of the shortage of suitable organs. A typical child waited  six to 12 months for a donor.  </P> <P> * Other children were surviving the operation, only to have their bodies  ravaged by chronic rejection episodes -- during which the breathing passages of  the lungs are destroyed -- and by the side effects of the powerful drugs needed  to fight rejection. This was particularly true for children between the age of  3 and puberty.  </P> <P> "Patients are coming back to us and saying this is not such a great  experience," Starnes said. "I have had several rejection episodes. I am on  chronic steroids. I am fat. I have hair everywhere. I feel like I'd rather  die," are some of the comments he has heard.  </P> <P> Starnes reasoned that partial lung transplants from living related donors, like  the partial liver transplants from living donors that were pioneered at the  University of Chicago last year, might solve some of of these problems.  </P> <P> Not only would there be a ready source of organs, but better tissue matching  might lessen or eliminate rejection episodes. While surgeons who transplant  livers or kidneys have a day or two to match the tissues of cadaver donors and  recipients, this is not possible with hearts and lungs, which can only be  stored for a few hours.  </P> <P> Armed with bits and pieces of data from research in pigs and lung transplants  in adults, Starnes persuaded Stanford's Institutional Review Board, which is  charged with monitoring the safety and medical soundness of human experiments,  that the time was right to proceed.  </P> <P> But, in an interview, Starnes acknowledged that their were many unknowns.  </P> <P> For example, Starnes' experiments in pigs, which have yet to be published,  demonstrated that a segment of lung transplanted from an adult pig can take  over immediate lung function in a small offspring. But because the transplant  lasted only 24 hours (all the animals were killed so the lung tissue could be  examined), researchers do not know the long-term effectiveness of the  procedure.  </P> <P> Starnes said he plans -- but has yet to do -- experiments in which segments of  lungs from adult pigs are transplanted into piglets, who are then followed to  see if they grow normally to maturity.  </P> <P> Starnes also does not know if a segment of an adult's lung can handle the blood  flow from the entire body as the child grows and how the lung tissue itself  will grow. Only the girl's right lung was removed, but little blood or oxygen  will flow through her deceased left lung.  </P> <P> The transplanted right upper lobe of the mother's lung is expected to expand to  fill her daughter's right chest cavity. As a result, the existing surfaces for  gas exchange, known as alveoli, should become larger. But it is unlikely that  new alveoli will develop, Starnes said.  </P> <P> Additionally, the tissues of the mother and daughter are not a perfect match.  This means that the daughter is still at significant risk for rejection  episodes.  </P> <P> Another significant issue is the potential surgical risk to lung donors. For a  person with healthy lungs, the loss of one-third of one lung is unlikely to  cause problems. But the surgery to obtain the lung segment is not entirely  safe.  </P> <P> The risk is not hypothetical, said Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center  for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota. "People definitely die  from removing parts of solid organs."  </P> <P> Stanford surgeons first discussed last week's surgery with the family four  months ago. Before final approval was given, members of the university's review  board "interviewed the mother and child separately to make sure the  investigators had not unduly biased them," Starnes said.  </P> <P> Review board members will conduct similar interviews before authorizing each of  the additional five to 10 surgeries that are planned.  </P> <P> But despite this independent review, some experts in medical ethics doubt that  meaningful informed consent for such surgery can truly be obtained from a  parent with a dying child.  </P> <P> "It is a pretty coercive environment," Caplan said. It is "hard to feel you can  say no when you are talking about your own family and others will know if you  say no."  </P> <P> Starnes said he was sensitive to this issue, and believes that lung transplants  using cadaver donors should remain the procedure of choice until his results  are in.  </P> <P> The use of cadaver donors "only puts one person at risk. That is the bottom  line," Starnes said. If the results with living related donors "are very good  three or four years out, then that will lend support to expanding the  operation."  </P></p>

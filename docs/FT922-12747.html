			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: L'Oreal announces 19.7 per cent increase L'OREAL yesterday announced a 19.7 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.02bn (Dollars 363m) in 1991, from FFr1.69bn in 1990. The result was achieved despite 'a rather gloomy economic climate' which was 'undeniably affected by the Gulf war' and a 'significant slowdown in consumer spending in some major countries", the company said. L'Oreal, which operates worldwide with a number of well-known cosmetics and haircare brands including Lancome skin products, Giorgio Armani fragrances and Helena Rubinstein make-up, experienced sales growth of 10.2 per cent to FFr33.44bn from FFr30.36bn . Earnings per share rose by 19.7 per cent to FFr34.7 from FFr29. The board proposed raising the dividend by 20 per cent to FFr8.4, from FFr7 a share. The cosmetics division, which invested heavily last year in the relaunch of the Helena Rubinstein business acquired three years ago, saw sales rise by 11.6 per cent to FFr29.51bn from FFr26.45bn. Mr Owen-Jones said the response to the Rubinstein relaunch had been 'extremely thrilling'. The weakest area was perfume and beauty, where L'Oreal, like its competitors, was affected by the problems of the luxury goods market, which has suffered from the recession in the US and the slowdown in Japan. L'Oreal also lost FFr60m on its investment in Lanvin, the Paris fashion house now being relaunched in a joint venture with the Recamier family. L'Oreal plans to launch a new Armani women's scent this year and a male version of its Paloma fragrance. Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical division, recently expanded with the acquisition of two laboratories in France.  ------------------------------------------------              TOP 10 COSMETICS GROUPS*  ------------------------------------------------                        1991   1990 L'Oreal                 6.8    6.2 Unilever                4.1    3.8 Procter &amp; Gamble!       4.1    3.9 Shiseido                3.3    2.8 Avon                    2.5    2.3 E Lauder                2.0    1.9 Revlon??                1.8    1.8 Wella                   1.6    1.5 Kao                     1.6    1.4 Sanofi                  1.5    1.4  ------------------------------------------------ *Sales dollars bn. !

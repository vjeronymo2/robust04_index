			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Rau" commentary: "The Ultimatum"] </F>   [Text] Aggressors only understand the language of  violence. As soon as it became clear that NATO was heading for  an ultimatum to the murderous Serbian gunners around Sarajevo,  the Bosnian Serbs speedily prepared to withdraw their heavy  weapons before the adoption of a resolution. Here only the  threat with the ultimatum worked. For the time being. If the  pressure on the Serbs decreases again, they will again strike  like birds of prey that have been driven away. On the other  hand, the Muslims want more than only not to be massacred any  longer. This is Clinton's hour. He worked toward the  ultimatum. At full risk: His presidency can be destroyed if he  gets dragged into a Balkan war. This will surely be the case if  the threat with the ultimatum is not implemented. Aggressors  only understand the language of violence -- if the preparedness  for action is behind it.</p>

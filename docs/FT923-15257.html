			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Mexico and US settle kidnapping dispute MEXICO and the US have resolved their diplomatic rift over the US Supreme Court ruling that the kidnapping of a Mexican murder suspect was legal, with President George Bush promising in a letter that his administration will not engage in such practices again. However the promise falls far short of what the Mexicans had sought. The US refused to return the suspect, Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain, to Mexico. It will neither revise the wording of the two countries' extradition treaty nor exchange diplomatic notes that would in effect outlaw kidnapping beyond the life of the Bush administration. Instead the US and Mexico will exchange diplomatic notes that makes kidnapping by private US citizens an extraditable offence. This would allow US federal, state and other government employees to kidnap foreign nationals without fear of sanction. This will have the effect of reinterpreting the treaty. President Carlos Salinas was earlier this week still fuming at the court's decision, describing the kidnapping as a 'criminal act. . . unacceptable and inoperable in Mexico, and totally outside international law'. The Mexicans will take the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, whose final decision, however, will not be binding on the US. The Mexican government almost certainly decided to settle differences with the US over the kidnapping of Dr Alvarez Machain so as not to jeopardise negotiations over a free trade agreement which is now being negotiated between the two nations and Canada, and to avoid further downward pressure on the Mexican stock market. The market fell sharply in June, partly because of the popularity of Mr Ross Perot, the independent US presidential challenger - which has put the re-election of Mr Bush, and therefore the future of Mexico-US relations, in some doubt - but has recovered a little this week. Mr Salinas will visit the UK, France, Spain and Hungary this month, and explained his European trip in this context. 'When you decide to have a more intense relationship with a neighbour so powerful, you need to become closer with distant friends. . . I want more European investment with Mexico, precisely because we are going to have a more intense relationship with the US.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Transkei leader General Bantu Holomisa said he is  waiting for a report from the Goldstone Commission on the supply  of weapons to the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and alleged drug  trafficking by high-ranking South African security officers.  The report, which was to have been tabled with the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council], has apparently been withheld  by the commission pending further investigations. [Begin  recoding]    Correspondent Ami Nanackchand: The disclosures  were made at a Natal University forum in Durban where General  Holomisa said information implicating six generals of the  security establishment had been supplied to the commission  towards the end of last year. The classified information was  obtained from General Holomisa's tested intelligence and  sources. He said that Judge Goldstone had briefed President  F.W. de Klerk at the end of February of the commission's  findings confirming the allegations. Mr. de Klerk allegedly  refused to release the information. General Holomisa said he  was told on Tuesday [15 March] that Judge Goldstone would  release the report to the TEC within 48 hours. However, the  next day the judge apparently said he was making further  inquiries.    Holomisa: According to the latest information, or  intelligence information, a classified one, he has briefed  President de Klerk towards end of February and they have  confirmed to him that indeed, your number two in one of your  security forces and other generals are involved in drug  trafficking as well as supplying weapons to Natal, to the IFP.    Nanackchand: General Holomisa also denied claims  by the National Party that he was hindering free political  activity in the Transkei. [end recording]</p>

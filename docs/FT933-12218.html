			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Pressure on Brazil over killings BRAZIL is coming under international pressure to act against the country's urban death squads, after the murder of seven homeless boys and young men in the centre of Rio de Janeiro. Those who died, aged 11 to 22, were among a group of 40 youngsters sleeping outside the Candelaria church who were sprayed with gunfire by men in cars at dawn on Friday. The gunmen are widely believed to be police, though initial witness reports identifying two policemen have been withdrawn. Yesterday, a member of the task force set up to investigate the crime said that it believed the massacre to be the work of 'professional exterminators', adding that inquiries are now focusing on security guards of banks and shops in the Candelaria area. Even so, police involvement has not been ruled out. According to official figures, 320 street children were killed in Rio during the first six months of this year by death squads. These are said to receive pay from hoteliers and shopkeepers for so-called 'clean-up operations'. Their members often include police. Organisations such as Amnesty International have offered much criticism but the Brazilian government has done nothing to lessen the poverty forcing children into the streets, to halt the killings or to undo Brazil's reputation as a country of impunity. However, the latest attack was especially shocking in its blatancy and the government may be forced to act. A European Community communique on Saturday condemned the attack, expressing 'profound indignation by member states'. President Itamar Franco spent the weekend in Rio conferring with Mr Mauricio Correia, justice minister, and Governor Leonel Brizola of Rio. Mr Franco's spokesman says the president was 'horrified'.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Time to get tough on steel THE EUROPEAN Commission's decision yesterday to crack down on state aid to the Italian steel industry is a welcome sign that Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, can take as robust an approach to market distortions as his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan. The Italian government yesterday appeared to be softening its position, but it has still not come into line. The confrontation has been caused by Italy's unwillingness to accept that a plan by IRI, the state-owned holding company, to write off Ecu4bn in aid to Ilva, its wholly owned subsidiary, amounts to state aid. Italy's position is based upon the argument that IRI ceased to be a government agency last year and that the plan is being driven by commercial considerations. This argument is specious. Merely converting IRI from a government agency to a state-owned company does not put it beyond the reach of political considerations. It is inconceivable that a rational private owner would write off Ilva's debts without also demanding cuts to stem losses of Ecu84m a month. One consequence of Italy's resistance is that a Europe-wide scheme to turn the steel industry from a bloated sector of the economy into a globally competitive one could unravel. A meeting of the Council of Ministers scheduled for the end of this month which was to hammer out such a plan has had to be postponed. If Italy refuses to play by the rules, it may well be impossible for the Commission to insist that Spain and the Treuhand, east Germany's privatisation agency, cut hand-outs to their stricken companies. The fall-out could be a subsidies war in which more efficient private-sector steel-makers are driven out of the market. Potential damage But the potential damage does not stop with the steel industry. If the Commission fails to rein in steel subsidies, there will be nothing to stop governments handing out aid to companies in other sectors. That would endanger the single market, as Mr Van Miert said in a speech earlier this week. The idea of the single market programme was to encourage dynamism and efficiency by bringing down barriers to trade. But if governments are allowed to skew this process by giving unfair advantages to inefficient domestic competitors at the expense of efficient foreign rivals, the legitimacy of the programme will suffer. Closing steel plants will, of course, never be popular. Plants are typically located in communities where unemployment is already high, while steel's prominence in a dwindling manufacturing sector gives it a hold on public affections, with the result that the industry has tremendous lobbying clout. Enfeebled industry But delaying the restructuring of the European industry will in the end do nobody any favours. The industry has already been enfeebled through dependence on subsidies, estimated to have totalled DM121bn between 1975 and 1990. Such aid not only wastes taxpayers' money, but keeps steel-workers in jobs which are not sustainable in the long run. Instead help should focus on creating durable jobs for redundant steel-makers, an approach which has met with some success in the UK. By this standard, the Commission's plan is far from ideal. In response to political pressure, it has made clear it will allow aid to the Italian, Spanish and German state-owned companies in return for capacity cuts. It has also imposed anti-dumping duties on cheap imports from eastern Europe. As a result, competition within the Community will be distorted and eastern European countries will face an unwelcome barrier to their attempts to develop their economies. But the Commission plan is clearly preferable to untrammelled subsidies and full-blooded protectionism. Yesterday it backed up its plan with the threat of sanctions if the Italians do not come into line. These could include cutting off Community aid to Italy to finance steel redundancies or, in the extreme, erecting barriers against the export of Italian steel to other Community countries. It is to be hoped that none of this will be necessary. But if Italy refuses to toe the line, sanctions will be in order.</p>

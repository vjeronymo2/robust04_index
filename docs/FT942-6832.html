			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (19): Two regions with plenty to offer - Wales and the South-West Seven cranes tower over a huge construction site near the motorway to the north of Bristol, a highly visible sign that relocations to the region have not ceased in spite of the recession. At Bristol, the Ministry of Defence is to consolidate its procurement executive, at present scattered on sites in London and southern England. The new headquarters, costing Pounds 255m, will see the first of 5,500 staff move there in the autumn of next year. The scale of the MoD relocation dwarfs other recent activity in south-west England and Wales. Before the recession, both regions benefited from considerable relocation and inward investment. In particular, Wales has attracted it from overseas - it has more than 400 foreign-owned manufacturing companies - and the south-west especially from London and the south-east. The pace has slowed but not stopped. During 1993-94 in Wales, there were 169 projects from other parts of the UK and overseas, compared with 201 schemes the previous year. One big investment announced last year was by Asat of Hong Kong, which is building a Pounds 42m integrated circuit plant in Gwent that is expected to create 1,000 jobs. But, as in the south-west, there are fewer large greenfield investments; instead, projects are tending to be small-scale or expansions of existing operations. In both regions, there are recent signs of an upturn. Mr Ken Poole, senior manager with Price Waterhouse in Cardiff specialising in inward investment services, says: 'In the last few months the level of inquiries has picked up in the financial services sector and on the manufacturing side.' In Avon, on the other side of the Severn bridge, it is a similar story. 'We're much more optimistic than for a long time,' says Mr Mike West, of the Western Development Partnership, an economic strategy forum. 'We're on the move.' Particular interest is being shown in joint ventures with locally-based companies. The WDP, set up by the public and private sectors, is a recent product of a changed attitude in the south-west, which in the past has been complacent about the need to attract new businesses. During the 1980s, counties such as Avon, Gloucestershire and Dorset had not needed to woo inward investors because they came anyway. Ironically - in view of the MoD's investment in Bristol - it is the contraction of the defence and aerospace industries, a mainstay of the regional economy, which is a leading motivator in stimulating the south-west to be more pro-active. The region was also hit hard by the recession in the financial services sector, which in the 1980s had seen much relocation to Bristol, Cheltenham-Gloucester and Bournemouth-Poole. A plethora of partnerships to encourage diversification and inward investment is now in place. In addition to the WDP, there is an economic strategy forum in Gloucestershire and a similar body in Dorset called Partners for Prosperity. The South Dorset Economic Partnership is seeking businesses to counter the defence rundown at Weymouth and Portland, which last year gained assisted area status. Somerset has formed an economic partnership, and Devon and Cornwall is being promoted by the Westcountry Development Corporation. Behind these initiatives lies a common concern at the lack of a regional development organisation. A 'partnership of partnerships', the West of England Partnership, is about to bid for Department of Trade &amp; Industry funding as an RDO for attracting international investment. The only existing such agency in the south-west is the Devon and Cornwall Development Board. Envious eyes are cast in the direction of Wales with its government-funded Welsh Development Agency and Development Board for Rural Wales. These can adopt a co-ordinated approach to marketing, land acquisition and property provision and, in conjunction with the Welsh Office and local authorities, offer a range of grants and incentives. Both regions share similar advantages for companies which relocate: a wide variety of sites, a flexible and often skilled labour force, relatively low pay levels, and networks of professional and business services, especially in Bristol and Cardiff. While there are weaknesses in the transport infrastructure - for example, air services - perhaps the biggest selling point is the countryside. Staff, and their families, are easily persuaded to make the move. In consequence, the south-west in the past decade has had the highest net migration of any UK region. Half of these immigrants are people of working age. In Wales, the favoured area for inward investment has been near the M4 which runs close to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways which in 1993 opened Pounds 100m maintenance and components facilities in south Wales, last month described himself as 'a satisfied inward investment customer'. BA had first shopped around, Sir Colin said, but had 'chosen to acquire the currency of Welsh skills and efficiencies'. Energetic efforts are being made to attract companies to the south Wales valleys and to mid and north Wales. Design Sculptures, a company set up in the Rhondda by its Guildford-based parent, says that what tipped the balance 'was the availability of a labour force which is open to new ideas and not averse to retraining'. It acknowledges, though, that it would not have relocated to Wales without regional selective assistance. Most attention in the principality now focuses on Cardiff Bay, where a barrage replacing mudflats with a lake will help to regenerate 2,700 dockland acres. Mr Peter Connor, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation's director of business development, reports 'very strong interest' now that construction of the barrage is about to start. 'There is an awareness that Cardiff Bay is a special place,' he says. 'The bay can offer a very competitive grants package as an intermediate assisted area, with additional incentives as a development corporation.' Both Wales and south-west England offer many other sites with potential. These range from the Snowdonia Business Park, virtually surrounded by the national park, to the Atomic Energy Authority site at Winfrith, Dorset, where it is intended to establish a technology park, and to the old naval docklands at Plymouth, now the responsibility of a development corporation. Another development corporation is at Bristol, where its prime site at Quay Point, near the city centre, is being marketed. Around Bristol, large industrial sites are becoming available north of the city, and to the west at Severnside, near the expanding Bristol port and the second Severn crossing due to open in 1996. Avon has a strong image within the UK as a good location for industries such as telecommunications, and for research, development and innovation with its three universities. Further east, along the M4 corridor, Swindon remains a leading town for inward investment. In the 1980s, more than 100 companies employing at least 20 people moved there, drawn by its proximity to the motorway and Heathrow airport. The new arrivals, many of them specialising in high technology, account for over 12,000 jobs. The best-known newcomer to Swindon has been Honda with its Pounds 350m plant. While no one in the south-west or Wales expects inward investment on that scale in the foreseeable future, and competition to win business has become much tougher, it is felt that the two regions can compare favourably with other UK regions in what they have to offer.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'TIME' SURVEYS RESEARCH ON NATURAL RHYTHMS  </P> <P> There are many manifestations of the ancient conflict between humans and  nature, but one that may not come immediately to mind is the human tinkering  with time. It's a conflict that has a direct physical cost, as any late-summer  traveler suffering from jet lag can tell you. "The Time of Our Lives," an  unexpectedly incisive look at time and the biological clock (at 8 tonight on  KCET Channel 28), tells us this, and more.  </P> <P> For example, jet lag normally takes a full week's recovery time. The disastrous  accidents at Bhopal, Chernobyl and Valdez all occurred in the pre-dawn hours,  when body rhythms and alertness are at their lowest ebb. One week after  daylight saving time always marks an increase in car accidents. There is a  group of people, diagnosed as victims of seasonal affective disorder, who react  to changes of seasons with food and sleep binges and general depression.  </P> <P> A recent wing of biological science has even emerged to study these phenomena  and the causes and cures of time-related disorders: chronobiology. "The Time of  Our Lives" ultimately emerges as a survey of chronobiology.  </P> <P> With producer-writer Roger Bingham as a breezy, intelligent guide, this KCET  production also becomes a parable on how a problem caused by the technological  revolution can be itself solved by technology. Our natural body clock,  organically calibrated on a circadian cycle (roughly 25 hours), was an  unexplored area until jet planes arrived and electricity permitted the  graveyard shift. The body can adapt to much, but not, it was found, to radical  shifts in time.  </P> <P> A guest claims that when labor reaches a sufficient point of automation, thus  eliminating the need for graveyard shifts, society may return to the natural  rhythms of a bygone day. Such hyper-mechanization -- if it happens at all --  will surely, though, unleash its own problems. Bingham doesn't address this  here; perhaps next time.  </P></p>

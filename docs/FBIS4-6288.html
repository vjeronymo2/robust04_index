			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The United States has  hinted that if North Korea refuses to allow additional nuclear  checks before the end of April, it will go its own way to impose  sanctions on the Stalinist state even before the United Nations  adopts any resolution and seek Japanese cooperation in that  case, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday.    Quoting both Japanese and American diplomatic sources, the  newspaper said the idea had been put to Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata by U.S. Vice President Al Gore during last week's meeting  in Marrakech, Morocco, to sign the Uruguay Round trade accord.    Gore, noting that North Korea's nuclear program has a  greater  impact on Japan's security than his own country's, suggested  that the United States might impose sanctions on its own if  North Korea failed to permit additional IAEA (International  Atomic Energy Agency) inspections of its suspected nuclear sites  by the end of April, the report said.    Foreign Minister Hata told the vice president that Japan  would examine the plan but did not give him an immediate answer  in view of the need for the ruling coalition to first coordinate  policy differences among its member parties in naming a new  prime minister to replace the outgoing Morihiro Hosokawa.    Entering the equation is a demand made by Shinseito, a major  party in the coalition, which called for strong measures Monday  to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue, it added. But a  basic strategy proposed by the Nihon Shinto, another party of  the coalition, urges "responsible Japanese action according to  U.N. policy" in handling the issue: This would preclude  Japanese cooperation in any U.S. sanctions imposed before U.N.  action.    Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa, a behind-the-scenes strongman in  the coalition, met Foreign Minister Hata -- a likely bet to  succeed Hosokawa as prime minister -- at the latter's office on  Tuesday, raising speculation that they discussed dealing with  North Korea when Hata becomes prime minister.</p>

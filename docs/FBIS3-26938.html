Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, presided over the report meeting. Members of the  theoretical study central group of the provincial party  committee and responsible comrade of provincial organs attended  the report meeting. He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial  party committee, delivered a speech on studying the concept of  development of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and on upgrading the leadership work concerning  the construction of a developed border province near the sea to  a first-rate level.    Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: In essence, Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as  the Marxism of the contemporary China, is the theory of  development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In  studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping or even all the works of Comrade Xiaoping, we  should pay close attention to the issue of development and  regard it as a basic task to study and uphold the concept of  development of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Judging from the current practice, this has  very important and urgent immediate significance on studying and  upholding the concept of developing the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. With the deepening of  reform and acceleration of development, the inherent  contradictions in development, especially the problems in  coordination between the three major factors of economy,  politics, and culture, have become more and more conspicuous in  front of leading persons at all levels. Only when we master the  scientific concept of development, can we become qualified and  capable of leading development, can we easily resolve the  numerous contradictions in development, and can we ensure that  development continues smoothly along the right track.    He Zhukang said: The purpose for us to study and uphold the  concept of developing the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is to enhance our understanding and to  improve our ability for organization, for coping with changes,  and for implementing policies in our effort to lead reform and  development in line with the reality in leadership work so that  our socialist cause can develop in a faster and better manner.    Based on the reality in the endeavor of building a developed  border province near the sea, He Zhukang gave four profound  expositions on the theory and practice of accelerating  development.    First -- to understand development as a socialist historical  task in order to enhance the sense of leadership toward  accelerating development. He Zhukang said: In the final  analysis, leadership work is designed to take the lead in  development. Whether we can firmly embrace the concept of  accelerating development is a key factor determining whether  leadership activities are correct and whether work is effective.  The most important point in the concept of development in  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is to emphasize the important  significance in development and regard development as the  essential criterion for guiding all our work. In studying and  upholding the concept of developing the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should, above all,  achieve a good command of this essential criterion, continuously  enhance our sense of strategy toward the leadership over  development, and strive to study and promote development with  utmost efforts. In the process of building a developed border  province near the sea, we should firmly grasp development, the  lifeline determining the future of China's socialism, attach  importance to the development of our own province, cities, and  counties from the perspective of the overall situation, include  localities under our own leadership in the systems engineering  project for the overall development with a strong sense of  historical responsibility and mission, strengthen and improve  leadership over development, and attain our respective  development targets so as to contribute to overall development.    Second -- with the guidance of the concept of development  of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, to establish and form new ideas and mechanisms  for development. He Zhukang pointed out: Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has not only clearly  pointed out the strategic position and strategic significance of  the issue of development, but it has also provided systematic  answers to the several questions concerning the theory and  practice of development under the conditions of contemporary  China, thus forming a fairly complete development concept in the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This  concept of development is a scientific summary of experiences in  China's socialist construction, especially the experiences in  development achieved since reform and opening up started. It  profoundly promulgates basic changes in the pattern of  development in socialism and indicates an orientation for us to  establish new ideas and mechanisms for development. With the  guidance of this Marxist and scientific concept of development,  we should make the pattern of development compatible with the  transformation from the planned economy into the market economy  and change the reliance on the arrangements by higher levels  into pursuit of development geared to market demand. In  accordance with new situations in agriculture, rural areas, and  peasants under a market economy, we should shift the focus of  rural work to increasing the income of peasants; meeting the  challenges presented by the new scientific and technological  revolution and enterprise revolution, change the structure of  the essential elements of production from one dominated by  natural resources into one dominated by science and technology;  suiting the needs for continuously raising the level in  systematic and overall economic and social development, we  should change unbalanced development of just one sector into  coordinated development of all sectors; and in accordance with  the new tendency to institutionalize economic and social  development, we should put development on a legal footing.    Third is to resolve the conspicuous contradictions in  economic development and channel the implementation of the  strategic target of building a developed border province near  the sea onto a track characterized by high speed and high  efficiency. He Zhukang said: The new ideas for development have  set new and still higher demands on the leadership work of party  committees and governments at all levels. On the one hand, we  should accelerate reform and cultivate new mechanisms for  development and, on the other, lose no time in strengthening  leadership over development. At present, we should make earnest  efforts to do practical work, achieve success in implementing  the strategic target in a creative manner, deepen reform,  strengthen management, create momentum for development, adjust  the structure, better organize industries, further improve the  distribution of resources, step up efforts to standardize and  supervise economic activities, and protect development with  effective measures.    Fourth is to have the ability to observe and handle issues  from a political viewpoint and firmly hold the initiative in  leading development. He Zhukang said: To better unify the  thinking and action of the vast number of party members, cadres,  and ordinary people in line with Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and its concept  of development and with the grand practice in building a  developed border province near the sea and to promote Jilin's  development in a down-to-earth manner, we should also have the  ability to observe and handle the issues on development from a  political viewpoint, comprehensively consider the numerous  political, economic, and social issues from the political angle  of view, and note their relations. We should correctly analyze  and handle the contradiction among the people in the new  historical period, trust and rely on the masses, and fully boost  their enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity. In particular, we  should solve the problems for the workers of enterprises who  have suspended production and of rural areas who are having a  difficult time. We should strengthen army-government unity,  army-civilian unity, and national unity. We should educate the  masses with patriotism, collectivism, and socialist ideas and  enhance the unity of party organizations. During the Spring  Festival period, leaders at all levels should go deep into the  grass-roots level to visit the poor and people who are having  difficulty making ends meet.    In conclusion, Comrade He Zhukang said: Promoting reform,  opening up, and the socialist modernization drive is a sacred  mission entrusted to us by our era, our nation, and our people.  With the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the correct  leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core, let us unite as one to brave the way forward,  pioneer new causes through hard work, work in a down-to-earth  manner, accelerate development, and strive to fulfill the grand  target of building a developed border province near the sea.    After the report meeting, the provincial party committee  held  at its party school a forum of the city and autonomous  prefectural party committee secretaries who had attended the  study and discussion session. Comrade He Zhukang chaired the  forum, and Comrades Zhang Dejiang, Wang Jinshan, Liu Xilin, and  Feng Ximing attended. Comrade Wang Jinshan gave a report on the  guidelines of the recent standing committee meeting of the  provincial party committee. The participants discussed their  experiences in the study and discussed and offered ways to  succeed in the current work.</p>

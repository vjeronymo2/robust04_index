			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov: "Financial Dispute"] </F>   [Text] The reorganization of the Social Insurance  Fund in connection with the transfer of control over the fund to  the state was hotly debated by representatives of trade unions  and the government at the last meeting of the FNPR [Federation  of Independent Trade Unions of Russia--FITUR] General Council.  Oddly enough, both sides used the same argument: both insisted  that their only aim was the protection of the interests of the  laboring public, but for some reason they could not reach an  agreement. Something else was also odd: the laboring public  itself probably does not even know that such heated battles are  being fought on its behalf and in its defense.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA decided to rectify this incongruity.  The editors are not only informing their readers of the plans  for the Social Insurance Fund, but also wish to hear their  thoughts on the matter. Let us discuss this vitally important  topic ourselves.  <H3>  One Person Will Hold the Reins--What Could Be Wrong with  That?... (Opinion of Yuriy Shatyrenko, chairman of Social  Insurance Fund) </H3>   It is a fait accompli: the management of social insurance  has  been taken out of the hands of the trade unions and turned over  to the government by presidential edict. Some people feel that  this was done in retaliation for the position the FITUR took  during the October events. I think it is only a coincidence,  although it is possible to see a natural sequence here. All of  this, however, is already history.    Now we have to decide what state management will entail.  Above all, it will entail some kind of hierarchical structure  with a clearly defined, vertical chain of command. The edict  said that the government would manage social insurance in  conjunction with the all-Russian associations of trade unions.  This means that they will be represented in the collegial bodies  included in this precise state structure.    Therefore, the fund is now managed by a single  individual--the chairman, who will have jurisdiction over all  other administrators: the chairmen or managers of regional,  sectorial, and other divisions and branches. The chairmen and  managers on each level will have boards or coordinating  councils, made up of representatives of various requisite state  institutions (such as, for example, the tax service, labor  agencies, financial institutions, and employers) and also, of  course, the trade unions.    Now we have to decide the degree of trade-union  participation. There are now 90 of them in Russia, and all of  them want to have a say in the management of social insurance.  As the saying goes, the number of opinions is equal to the  number of individuals. Just try to coordinate all of these views!    The board will have fairly broad powers. It will discuss the  draft budget, hear reports on the budget execution and, in  general, discuss all of the most important aspects of the work  of the Social Insurance Fund on the appropriate levels. The  board will not be able, however, to make any decisions  independently, because all directives will be based on the  orders and instructions of the chairman. If the board and the  chairman should disagree, the administrator will have the usual  five days to report the disagreement to a superior organization,  and this organization's decision will then be final. At the  highest level, the federal one, if I, as the present chairman of  the fund, disagree with its board, I will have five days to  report this to the government, and then it will have the final  say. There is no question that these incidents will be rare,  because common sense will prevail in most cases.    Unfortunately, it was impossible to reach an agreement on  this point with the trade unions. They are insisting that the  fund should be under group management and that all decisions  should be made by the board. This is the most fundamental  difference of opinion.    The government was the "arbiter" in this case. Members of  the  government reviewed the matter and decided that a single manager  would be preferable.    After all, just think what would happen if the heads of the  coal workers' and petroleum workers' unions--V. Budko and A.  Sergeyev--were both on the board. They never agree on anything,  and simply because they do not like each other. They do not even  place much importance on the public interest. Therefore, we  should agree that today, because there is no unity in the labor  movement, we need what might be described as the  commanding-officer method of decisionmaking. It is possible that  a move to more democratic principles of management might be  considered in the future, when things are calmer and when large  associations of trade unions have been established.    As far as the numerical representation of the trade unions  on  the board is concerned, it is possible that it should be  increased, but exactly what good would this do? The whole  purpose is to let all of the unions participate in the  management of the fund, so that they can see where the money is  being spent and how the interests of the laboring public or a  particular branch or occupation are being protected. For this  reason, let the trade unions take turns on the board.    This would work on the federal level. On the sectorial  level,  however, things can be much simpler: if there is a sectorial  division of, for instance, railroad workers, a representative of  the railroad workers will always serve on the board, without any  kind of rotation. On the regional level, proportional  representation will depend on the leading branches in the region.    We have agreed not to get rid of anything that exists and  works today. All of it will remain in place until a law on  social insurance has been passed. The other possibilities of  social insurance will be used in the sphere of public health. We  are not excluding the possibility of supplemental systems and  are prepared to promote this with the offer of procedural  assistance, money, buildings, etc. The present system of social  insurance, based on the deduction of 5.4 percent of total wages,  provides all employed individuals with only minimum guarantees:  for the person who loses his salary because of disability, for  the woman who loses her salary because of pregnancy or  maternity.... If trade unions wish to become more active and  offer some kind of additional support, we will help them do this  and we certainly will not interfere in their affairs.    There was another point on which we disagreed with the trade  unions. They insist on written confirmation that the money in  the Social Insurance Fund is their property. I do not agree:  this is state money. This is an ordinary tax, just like the  income tax or value-added tax. If the state wished, it could  liquidate our fund and combine it with, for instance, the  pension fund. If it wished, it could raise or lower the rate of  deduction. The fund is a purely financial organization which  collected money according to a specific rate of deduction and is  distributing the money for specific purposes. It should not do  anything else with the money.  <H3>  But What About the Trade Unions--Will They Only Get a Seat  at the Corner of the Table? (Opinion of Vyacheslav Goncharov,  deputy chairman of FITUR) </H3>   The future of the Social Insurance Fund is still arousing  great anxiety in our trade-union organizations and labor  collectives, and not because something is being taken away from  us, as people in the government have implied. We are aware of  all of the responsibility required for the performance of the  only services that could have kept the system working flawlessly  for many years. The trade unions will continue to be responsible  for them by presidential edict.    I want to say right away that we are willing to work with  state agencies and share the responsibility with them in matters  pertaining to the improvement of social insurance. Questions and  objections arise, in my opinion, because the trade unions were  not consulted before the management of the fund was turned over  to the state.    I want to stress that the FITUR is ready and willing for  dialogue and for the planning and execution of joint actions  with the government and employers on the basis of a social  partnership.    I do not want to overdramatize the situation, but  reciprocity  is clearly lacking in this process. We do have certain proposals  which the new management of the fund did not accept, and we  intend to take them straight to the government and defend their  validity.    I will discuss them in greater detail. First of all, there  is  the whole structure of fund management. Regrettably, there is no  group management in this structure. The new board will play a  strictly advisory role, and the representation of trade unions  on the board will be confined to the bare minimum. What is the  point of discussing the presence or absence of agreement among  trade unions now that the FITUR unites almost 92 percent of all  workers? Obviously, the representation of the FNPR should be  commensurate with this, and the present number of seats for  trade unions (7 of the 25) is clearly inadequate.    We cannot arrive at a common denominator with the  "statesmen"  in the argument over the ownership of the money controlled by  the fund. They tell us that it is theirs--the state's, but we  feel that this is the people's money and that it should belong  to the Social Insurance Fund. After all, we know that the budget  on the federal level, and especially on the regional level, is  bursting at the seams. If we do not defend our position, there  could be all kinds of fights over these resources--representing  5.4 percent of total wages.    How can the money be used prudently? In addition to the  funds  used for the designated purpose, a small portion should be  allocated for the maintenance of athletic training schools for  children and young adults. Otherwise, we might forfeit the  money, along with the healthy childhood of the little Russians  for whose sake our people are willing to endure all of their  difficulties.    Medical services also require financial support--perhaps not  all services, but prosthetics, post-traumatic care, and rare and  complex treatments and operations certainly require some money  from the Social Insurance Fund.    Besides this, we are naturally concerned about the financing  of technical and legal inspections instituted by trade unions  and the salaries of our physicians: not so much because they are  working under the union banner, but because we have a system--a  system that works!--and it would be wrong to demolish it. After  all, demolition is not a necessary stage of the construction  process.    At this time of transition, the trade unions suggest a  constructive compromise: the fund budget could be divided into  two parts. The first could be used for payments for social  guarantees, and it could be managed by directly related agencies  of the executive branch of government and by economic  structures. The influence of trade unions could be confined to a  minimum in this sphere. The other part of the budget, however,  could be used for public health (the 19.4 percent allocated for  the network of health resorts and 1 percent for the athletic  schools for children and young adults), and this portion should  be managed by trade unions on all levels and various Russian  associations because we own the material base of this health  network.    We can guarantee that the new board of the Social Insurance  Fund can expect nothing but the gratitude of the public if it  agrees to this compromise.  <H5>  After the Presses Started Rolling </H5>   A few days ago the leaders of trade-union associations  belonging to the FITUR and the so-called "parallel" associations  gathered in the Palace of Labor in Moscow, as if in response to  an alarm. There was good reason to sound the alarm: the new  board of the Social Insurance Fund (now a state fund) forgot  about President B.N. Yeltsin's instructions to work with the  trade unions, ordered the liquidation of some central sectorial  divisions, tried to seize their assets, and is even taking aim  at the trade-union health and vacation resorts.    These steps aroused understandable indignation, but  will it produce any tangible results?    In this context, we are reminded of the old Russian  saying about the masters of insincere rhetoric: "Their tongues  are coated with honey...."</p>

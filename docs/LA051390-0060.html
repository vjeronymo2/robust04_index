			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STOP THE DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Why should I have my leaky faucet fixed or put a brick in my toilet tank to  save water? Around us, all over the hills, thousands of houses are being built.  </P> <P> Think of the dishwashers, toilets, baths and sinks that will require gallons of  water and they will have tons of garbage, and each home will have one or more  cars to clog up the roads and pollute the air.  </P> <P> All the beautiful grassy hills will be a thing of the past, and all the wild  animals will die out. Development should be stopped now if it is not too late.  In light of this, I have no incentive to save water.  </P> <P> MYRA HUFFMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: CURRYING FLAVOR THE BRITISH WAY  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I've always enjoyed the curry at the Rangoon Racquet Club. Do you  think they would part with the recipe?  </P> <P>  -- CHARLES  </P> <P> DEAR CHARLES: This British-type curry (unlike any Indian curry you'll ever  taste) is loaded with coconut, pineapple, banana and apple. You can add any  meat, fish or poultry and serve it with colorful condiments that echo the  ingredients in the sauce. It makes a terrific buffet party dish for a holiday  season open house.  </P> <P> RANGOON RACQUET CLUB ORIGINAL CURRY SAUCE  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons peanut oil  </P> <P> 1 medium yellow onion, minced  </P> <P> 5 stalks celery, minced  </P> <P> 3 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 1/2 ounces curry powder  </P> <P> 3 cups dry white wine  </P> <P> 4 cups chicken stock or canned broth  </P> <P> 1 cup shredded coconut  </P> <P> 1 cup pineapple puree  </P> <P> 1 apple, cored, seeded and pureed (or use applesauce)  </P> <P> 1/2 pound raisins  </P> <P> 3 ounces ginger root, freshly grated  </P> <P> 1 banana, minced  </P> <P> Arrowroot or cornstarch  </P> <P> Heat peanut oil in saucepan and add onion, celery and garlic. Saute few  minutes, then add curry powder. Continue cooking and stirring 5 minutes longer.  Add wine and bring to simmer. Add chicken stock and bring to simmer, 15 to 20  minutes, stirring occasionally.  </P> <P> Spread shredded coconut on baking sheet and toast in 400-degree oven until  lightly browned. Add pineapple, apple, raisins and coconut to sauce. Cook 10  minutes longer. Stir in grated ginger root. Add banana, stirring constantly.  Heat until sauce is thickened. If necessary thicken sauce with arrowroot or  cornstarch paste. Cool thoroughly and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks, using as  needed. Do not freeze, as texture and taste will alter. Makes 2 quarts sauce.  </P> <P> Note: When ready to serve add any cooked chicken, beef, pork or shrimp,  allowing 1/2 cup cubed meat or shrimp per serving. Heat through and serve with  condiments, such as shredded coconut, raisins, chutney, banana slices, peanuts.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I would appreciate a copy of the See's Fudge recipe that you printed  in your Culinary SOS column some time ago. It was the best fudge I ever made  and regret losing my recipe.  </P> <P>  -- CONNIE  </P> <P> DEAR CONNIE: No need to regret. The recipe is yours once again.  </P> <P> SEE'S FUDGE  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter  </P> <P> 1 (6-ounce) package semisweet chocolate pieces  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1 (5 3/4-ounce) can evaporated milk  </P> <P> 10 large marshmallows  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped nuts  </P> <P> Combine butter, chocolate pieces and vanilla in medium bowl.

Stir in nuts.  </P> <P> Pour into 8-inch-square baking pan. Refrigerate several hours to firm.

It can be served with any grilled  meat, fish or poultry.  </P> <P> GINGER SAUCE BENIHANA  </P> <P> 3 (1/2-inch) cubes peeled ginger root, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 cup vinegar  </P> <P> 1 large onion, sliced  </P> <P> Place ginger, soy sauce, vinegar and onion in blender container.

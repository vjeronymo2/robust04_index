			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- With the State  Council's approval, the Civil Aviation Administration of China  [CAAC] and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation [MOFTEC] recently jointly issued the "Circular on  the Policy on Foreign Investment in the Civil Aviation  Industry." The circular said: To accelerate the development of  the civil aviation industry and to improve the operations and  management of the industry, with the State Council's approval,  foreign companies are conditionally allowed to invest in China's  civil aviation industrial projects with the state as the major  investor.    The circular said: Foreign companies are allowed to invest  in the construction of the flight zones (including runways,  taxiways, and parking aprons) of civil airports (not including  airports for military and civil purposes; same in the following)  in the PRC in the form of joint ventures or contractual joint  ventures. Investment of the Chinese side should be more than 51  percent of a company's registered capital, and the company's  chairman of the board and president are to be Chinese. Priority  will be given to considering investment by foreign companies  investing in constructing flight zones of civil airports in the  construction of airport terminal buildings (excluding  construction and management of VIP rooms) cargo warehouses,  ground service centers, aircraft maintenance centers, in-flight  food service centers, guesthouses, restaurants, air fuel supply  facilities, and other airport-support projects. Chinese  investment in the construction of airport terminal buildings  should be more than 51 percent, and chairmen of the boards and  presidents should be Chinese. With approval, foreign companies  investing in the construction of civil airport flight zones may  appropriately expand their business areas to include the  management of airport terminal buildings, cargo warehouses,  ground service centers, aircraft maintenance centers, in-flight  food service centers, guesthouses, restaurants, air fuel supply  facilities, and other airport-support projects. Air traffic  control systems are to be invested in and managed by the state;  foreign companies are not to invest in these projects or take  part in their management.    The circular pointed out: Foreign companies, particularly  foreign air transportation companies, are allowed to jointly  invest in Chinese air transportation companies in establishing  air transportation enterprises in the form of joint ventures or  contractual joint ventures. Foreign companies, particularly  foreign air transportation companies, are allowed to purchase  shares of Chinese air transportation companies, or to exchange  shares with them to establish air transportation enterprises.  At the beginning, one or two foreign air transportation  companies will be selected by the CAAC and other concerned  departments to invest in establishing air transportation  enterprises in China on a trial basis. More foreign companies  will be allowed to do so if the trial operations are successful.  Foreign companies' shares must not be more than 35 percent of  co-invested air transportation enterprises' registered or  paid-up capital, and their voting rights at the co-invested  companies' boards of directors must not be more than 25 percent.  Chairmen of the boards and the presidents of co-invested  companies are to be Chinese. Air transportation enterprises  with foreign investment enjoy the same taxation treatment as  similar Chinese enterprises. Foreign airport authorities and  aircraft manufacturing enterprises are not allowed to invest in  establishing air transportation enterprises in China.    The circular said: Foreign companies are allowed to invest  in aviation enterprises in the form of joint ventures or  contractual joint ventures for agricultural and forestry  purposes. The percentage of foreign investment shall be decided  by the Chinese and foreign investors. Approval should be gained  from the CAAC for the establishment of civil aviation  enterprises with foreign investment. For projects of which the  authority of approval is beyond that of the CAAC, the State  Planning Commission is to examine the reports on the projects  and the feasibility reports, and the MOFTEC is to examine  relevant contracts and regulations. For projects of which the  authority of approval lies with the CAAC, the CAAC is to examine  the reports on the projects and the feasibility reports.  Contracts and regulations related to the projects are to be  submitted to the MOFTEC for approval.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL GAME WILL START AT 7 TONIGHT  </P> <P> It does not say so on your tickets, or even in the Angel media guide, but  today's third game of a four-game series at Anaheim Stadium between the Angels  and the Chicago White Sox will start at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> The game was originally scheduled to be nationally televised by NBC at 1 p.m.,  the time indicated on the tickets. But when the Angels were told by network  officials on July 20 that the game would not be televised, they changed the  starting time, informing season-ticket holders by mail and publicly announcing  the change.  </P> <P> The Angels always prefer night games to day games on Saturdays because they  draw bigger crowds, a club spokesman said.  </P> <P> "It's easier for people to get here and it's more comfortable at night," said  Tom Seeberg, the Angels' vice president of public relations.  </P> <P> NBC will televise two games in the Southland today -- the New York Mets against  the Chicago Cubs at 10:15 a.m. and the San Francisco Giants against the Houston  Astros at 1 p.m.  </P></p>

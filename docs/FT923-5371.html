			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Bovespa index finishes 6.7 per cent down THE Bovespa index finished 6.7 per cent down at 32,671 yesterday, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo, following President Fernando Collor's promise on Sunday night to resist pressure to resign. Last week a congressional committee charged the president with malfeasance in a corruption scandal. The drop followed steady gains last week, both in the index and in trading volumes. Moving inversely to Mr Collor's standing, weakened by the loss of political support and mass demonstrations, the index rose by 27.4 per cent. Turnover grew steadily from a level of Dollars 18.5m on Monday, when the parliamentary inquiry presented its findings, to last Friday's Dollars 107.5m.</p>

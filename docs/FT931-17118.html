			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Rotodyne failed despite political support: Macmillan lost fight for revolutionary aviation project BRITAIN abandoned a project to build a hybrid helicopter/fixed-wing aircraft to revolutionise intercity travel in spite of strong backing from Mr Harold Macmillan, the prime minister. The Fairey Rotodyne project was ultimately cancelled by the government 30 years ago but cabinet papers released yesterday show Mr Macmillan had insisted four years earlier that the project 'must not be allowed to die'. The aim was to produce an aircraft which would take off vertically and carry 48 passengers at 180mph over a 200-mile range. The Rotodyne, which had two small wings and was powered by two turbo-propeller engines and a rotor blade, was aimed at intercity air travel. A prototype first flew in 1957 after the government funded Pounds 13m of development costs. Commercial airlines showed little interest and the project was dropped on February 12 1962 after armed forces chiefs said they were not prepared to support it. A similar aircraft, the Boeing-Bell tilt rotor, is being developed in the US supported by the US government. The aircraft takes off vertically like a helicopter and then flies like a fixed-wing aircraft. The US aircraft, of a roughly similar capacity to the UK project but with much longer range, has been earmarked for military and civil applications. The Cabinet papers also disclosed that the Anglo-French Concorde could have been called 'Europa' or 'Alliance' if the British government had had its way. Although the British and French governments formally agreed to build the supersonic airliner on November 29 1962 the two countries continued to disagree on the name of the jet, according to the cabinet papers. The aviation minister at the time, Mr Peter Thorneycroft (now Lord Thorneycroft), suggested 'Alliance' and 'Europa' to the cabinet. He said France had agreed to a name that underlined co-operation and meant the same in the two languages. The two manufacturers of the aircraft, British Aircraft Corporation (now absorbed into British Aerospace) and Sud Aviation (now part of Aerospatiale of France), preferred Concorde. The consortium had planned up to 40 aircraft, but in fact only 16 were produced. Aerospace manufacturers are now studying the development of a second-generation supersonic airliner with a capacity of 300 against Concorde's 100.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> STATE TO BEGIN TESTING SOIL, AIR FOR OIL WASTE  </P> <P> State health officials will begin testing soil and air in a Westminster  neighborhood next week to determine the hazard posed by a petroleum sludge that  began oozing into back yards several years ago.  </P> <P> Investigators from the state Department of Health Services will take soil  samples from 12 homes built on an abandoned oil industry waste pit, said John  Scandura, a supervising hazardous materials specialist in the department's  toxics division.  </P> <P> Results of the monthlong sampling are expected to be used to determine how long  the cleanup will take, Scandura said. A cleanup plan is to be completed late  this year, then circulated for public comment, he said.  </P> <P> About 20 Westminster residents attended a Thursday night meeting with state  health officials to discuss the soil and air tests in the neighborhood located  east of the San Diego Freeway, near the Golden West Street off-ramp.  </P> <P> Since the state first began looking into the pollution in 1987, the  investigation has cost nearly $1 million, Scandura said. The site is on the  state's Superfund cleanup list, and Scandura said the contamination may be  serious enough to qualify the site for the federal Superfund program.  </P> <P> In 1987, state officials removed 25 drums, each containing 55 gallons of  petroleum sludge, from beneath the site and conducted soil tests that showed  the presence of low levels of benzene, a carcinogenic chemical.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NATIONAL CITY  </P> <P> A 25-year-old man who was shot Monday after reportedly confronting police with  a hammer outside a grocery store remained in critical condition Tuesday.  </P> <P> Michael Carter, address unknown, was being treated at Mercy Hospital for  multiple gunshot wounds.  </P> <P> According to police, Carter was "acting agitated and hostile" as he waited  outside the Ralphs store on South Euclid Avenue with a large claw hammer tucked  into the back of his pants at about 5:50 p.m.  </P> <P> Police had received a call of a man with a gun in the store's parking lot, a  police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Carter told police he was waiting to confront a customer with whom he had  argued earlier in the store when Officer Mike King approached at 5:55 p.m., the  spokesman said.  </P> <P> King saw the hammer's handle sticking from Carter's pants and thinking it was  the butt of a gun, King told him twice to freeze. Police said that Carter  reached for the hammer and that King fired several shots, hitting him in the  torso and legs.  </P> <P> Carter later told police that he had heared King's warnings to freeze but  reached for the hammer anyway, the Police Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> King has been put on routine paid administrative leave pending completion of  the investigation, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The store was crowded, but no other injuries occurred. No charges have been  filed against Carter pending the investigation's outcome.  </P></p>

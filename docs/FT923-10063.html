			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Setback to Pakistani gas privatisation THE PAKISTANI government's privatisation effort has suffered a setback, with the poor response to this week's public offering of about a third of Pakistan's largest gas company, SNGPL. Brokers believe no more than 20 per cent of the 52m shares, offered at Rs40.15 (Dollars 1.62) each, have been subscribed for. Brokers had expected the price to rise to Rs60, but on Thursday it closed at Rs42. Muslim Commercial Bank, the underwriter, has, however, not announced the level of subscriptions. 'The government would need to carefully re-evaluate their plans in the light of SNGPL's experience,' said one leading broker.</p>

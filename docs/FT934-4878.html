			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Japan paying prices of recession: The gloom in Tokyo's consumer electronics shops The lights are going dim in Akihabara, the neon-festooned electronics district of Tokyo, consumer test-bed for world-beating gizmos like the Walkman and the compact disc player. Akihabara, where the Japanese splash out 5 per cent of their Y6,000bn (Pounds 38bn) a year spending on consumer electronics, is a sensitive indicator of consumer sentiment. In some places, the recession has hit so hard that the lights have gone out. One is Hirose Musen, one of the four small chains to have closed there in the past four months. A picket line of former employees shivered outside one of Hirose Musen's shuttered shops last week, with their backs to a lifeless neon sign, politely requesting their jobs back. A stroll through some of the other 500 stores in the area makes it is easy to see why Hirose Musen's owners closed their three Akihabara shops. Noodle bars tucked under railway arches nearby appear to be attracting more custom than the gaudy arcades of Akihabara's main outlets. Many report that sales this year are down at least 10 per cent and some, like Nakaura, are so desperate they have sent out salesmen to make house-to-house calls. Prices are at the bottom. In good times, Akihabara sales tickets show two figures; the manufacturer's price, which has a line through it, plus the sale price, the point from which one is expected to open bargaining. These discounts were not as generous as they looked, since they were strictly controlled by suppliers. But last week, sale prices too were scored through with thick black lines. Discounts on a given brand name varied between shops, indicating that suppliers' grip on margins has weakened. Discounts include 40 per cent off miniature televisions at Y11,800 and 25 per cent off digital audio tape machines, down to Y55,800. The range of gadgets is as dazzling as ever, as suppliers and shops try in vain to revive consumers' jaded tastes. But general consumer spending in the year to the end of September was down 0.4 per cent, compared with a rise of 2.8 per cent in the same month last year, according to the Economic Planning Agency. The problem is that people are earning less as their companies slash costs, and are at the same time saving more to rebuild wealth eroded by the fall in land prices. Real incomes only rose by 1.2 per cent in the year to September, while savings as a proportion of disposable income rose to 18.2 per cent last year, from 17.9 per cent in 1991, says the EPA. On top of this, Akihabara has its own problems. What remains of diminished demand is shifting away from traditional consumer electronics, white goods and components - and stabilising or growing slightly in computer games, computers, compact discs and tapes. Even worse, Akihabara has lost its already questionable reputation for the lowest prices, thanks to the arrival of aggressive discount stores in suburbs such as Shinjuku and Ikebukuro. They are winning market share. Discount stores generally are expecting double-digit sales growth this year, according to a survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper. Akihabara's stores have responded in varying ways. One of the larger ones, Shintoku, threw out its old stock and filled one of its four shops with Sega computer games last November. It turned another into a CD and video cassette store, called Shintoku Soft Terminal. The strategy was not enough to erode Shintoku's mounting debts and the store filed for bankruptcy last month with liabilities of Y6.96bn, Akihabara's biggest collapse. Laox, the biggest store, has been more successful. It had expanded out of Akihabara before the recession hit and has become rich enough to use the downturn to expand market share, by taking over one of its struggling neighbours. Laox has also led an Akihabara trend, to devote more space to selling computers, from which the district now derives about 30 per cent of sales and to concentrate more on supplying a service than giving discounts. As part of the same trend, a shop closed by Asia Musen, another recent Akihabara casualty, was taken over by Sofmap, a retailer of used personal computers. This is, however, a risky strategy. The profit margin on computers is even smaller than that on consumer goods, points out Mr Harrison Bates, retail analyst at James Capel Pacific. Akihabara is heading for a tough Christmas.</p>

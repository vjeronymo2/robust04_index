			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISTA MAN, 82, FOUND SLAIN AT CAMP PENDLETON  </P> <P> An 82-year-old Vista man who was reported missing by his wife a week ago was  found shot to death Sunday afternoon in a remote northern region of Camp  Pendleton, the FBI reported.  </P> <P> Swan Otto Bloomquist was found at 2:30 p.m. by two brothers, both civilians,  who were out target practicing, said Ronald Orrantia, spokesman for the FBI's  San Diego office.  </P> <P> "The brothers' dog picked up on the scent of the dead man," who was found  northwest of Fallbrook, Orrantia said. "It appears to be a homicide."  </P> <P> Bloomquist died of multiple gunshot wounds, Deputy Coroner George Dickason  said.  </P> <P> Bloomquist was reported missing last Tuesday after he dropped his wife off at a  Carlsbad mall. He said he would wait in the car while she shopped. She returned  about an hour later but could not find him or the car.  </P> <P> The car, a 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass with California license plates 2HMF549, has  not been found.  </P> <P> "The car was stolen when he was abducted," said Orrantia.  </P> <P> The FBI has no suspects in the slaying. It is investigating because the body  was found on federal property.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ho Chi Minh City Fatherland Front Committee held  a get-together yesterday morning with Catholic fathers and  clergymen and Catholic representatives to brief them on some new  developments in the city in connection with current religious  issues. Over 100 delegates attended, including Catholic  fathers; heads of various religious orders; clergymen; and  representatives of the city Catholic Unity Committee, Papal  Nuncio office, various seminaries, and district and precinct  Catholic committees.    Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh, chairman of the city front committee,  gave a briefing on the results of the midterm national party  conference as well as past achievements by our party and people  in the economic, political, cultural, and social domains.    On the current religious situation, Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh  said:  It is the policy of our party and state to respect our Catholic  compatriots' freedom of religion and encourage them to lead a  life useful to both the region and the people so as to help  build the country. Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh is a clergyman  with a high sense of nationalism. He leads an ethical life and  is highly popular. He has made positive contributions for the  betterment of Catholic activities in Ho Chi Minh City.  Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh's ecclesiastical and nationalist  lines have been followed by a large number of Catholics.    Mr. Nguyen Van Hanh also informed the audience of the  positive results obtained in a meeting between the government  Religious Affairs Committee and a representative of the Vatican  Holy See during the Vatican delegation's recent visit to  Vietnam. This is a welcome sign for the Catholic compatriots in  the city to feel peace of mind so they can lead a  Gospel-directed life within national bounds.</p>

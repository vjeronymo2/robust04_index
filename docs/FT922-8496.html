			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Vaux declines 19% to Pounds 15m as recession hits hotel operation THE IMPACT of 'continuing deep recession' in the hotel industry reduced interim pre-tax profits at Vaux Group, the Sunderland-based brewer, by 19 per cent, from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 15.1m. Trading profits of the group's Swallow hotels declined from Pounds 5.41m to Pounds 4.87m during the 24 weeks ended March 14. Occupancies dipped from 56 per cent to 53 per cent and room rates were nearly 4 per cent lower. Additional financing costs for two new hotels at Bristol and Bexleyheath raised interest charges from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 5.07m; and the group incurred a loss of Pounds 203,000 on its 50 per cent stake in a Bournemouth hotel. However, current trading offered a 'glimmer of recovery,' said Mr Paul Nicholson, chairman. 'Although rates remain under severe competitive pressure, our forward bookings are up 5.2 per cent on last year, giving us hope that the worst may be behind us.' Pre-tax profits were boosted by an exceptional item of Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 7.3m). Trading profits were ahead 7.5 per cent at Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 14.2m) with turnover on continuing businesses up from Pounds 93.2m to Pounds 99.1m. Brewing profits rose 20 per cent, from Pounds 6.06m to Pounds 7.3m, as the breweries, helped by a contract to supply Labatt, the Canadian brewer, with 40,000 barrels of low-alcohol lager, operated at 90 per cent capacity. Total beer sales were marginally lower against a fall of about 4.2 per cent for the industry in general. Draught sales, with 104 additional pubs trading during the period, were 2.4 per cent up; but packaged sales in the home market were 5.1 per cent down, mainly in low profit commodity beers. The care homes achieved an overall occupancy of 89 per cent and lifted trading profits from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.67m. Earnings per share fell 11 per cent to 9.35p (10.51p) but the interim dividend is raised to 3.25p (3.1p).</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Judge OKs Greyhound Expenses: A federal bankruptcy court judge authorized  Greyhound Lines Inc. to pay salaries and operating expenses after union  attorneys made sure the strike-bound bus company's executives would not receive  "golden parachute" bonuses. At the hearing in Brownsville, Tex., U.S.  Bankruptcy Court Judge Richard S. Schmidt ordered the U.S. Trustee's Office to  start setting up a single committee of unsecured creditors. Greyhound filed  Monday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  </P></p>

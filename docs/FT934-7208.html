			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (4): From hippy to head man - Alice Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in the high-profile world of luxury goods / Jean-Louis Dumas THESE DAYS Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman of Hermes, looks like one of his company's own best advertisements with his hand-made Hermes ties tucked neatly into immaculately-tailored suits. Things were very different back in the 1960s when Dumas, then a young law graduate, set off with Rena, his wife, in their battered old Citroen 2CV to follow the hippy trail to Kathmandu. He paid for the trip with the pittance he earned by writing articles for the Pakistan Times. Dumas, 55, bears few traces of his hippy youth. He might have inherited his position at Hermes - as one of the 17 great-grandchildren of Emile Hermes, the Parisian tanner who founded the company in 1837 - but he learnt the luxury trade the hard way. He began with a two year apprenticeship as an assistant buyer at Bloomingdales, one of the biggest and brashest of the New York stores. He left Manhattan for the more rarefied atmosphere of Hermes in 1964 and by 1978 had become chairman and chief executive. His timing could scarcely have been better. He took over the family company on the eve of the 1980s boom. He masterminded its transformation from its original base, as a Paris leather goods maker, into one of the world's most successful luxury goods groups. Dumas expanded Hermes without compromising its reputation for quality. He might have made more money in the short term had he licensed its name to other manufacturers. But he realised that the key to Hermes' long term success was its exclusive air. He was right. Hermes has weathered the recession better than most of its competitors. It has also emerged unscathed from the swing in consumer taste away from the excesses of the 1980s, back to the idealistic ethos of Dumas' youth.</p>

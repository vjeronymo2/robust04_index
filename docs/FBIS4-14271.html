			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 27 Apr (INA)--On behalf of Tunisian President  Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisian Prime Minister Hamed Karoui  today received Barzan al-Tikriti, President Saddam Husayn's  personal envoy.    During the meeting, Barzan al-Tikriti delivered a message  from President Saddam Husayn to his brother Tunisian President  Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The message deals with the latest  developments at the UN Security Council, Iraq's implementation  of UN Security Council resolutions, the UN Security Council's  obligations toward lifting the blockade, and the required  inter-Arab coordination and consultation to achieve this  objective.    The message also relays Iraq's stand on the current Arab  situation, which requires that the leaf of the past be turned  and Arab solidarity revived.

He stressed that  Tunisia will spare no effort in the move to put an end to the  suffering of the Iraqi people, especially since Iraq has  implemented the relevant resolutions.

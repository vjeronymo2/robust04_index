			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / China warns Patten of HK turmoil The war of words between China and Britain over Hong Kong escalated at the weekend, with a senior Chinese official suggesting for the first time that Governor Chris Patten's democracy plans for the colony could provide a pretext for an early Chinese takeover there. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, described Mr Patten's plans for greater democracy as a kind of 'man-made turmoil'. The first stage of Mr Patten's democracy legislation will be tabled in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Wednesday - an event which China has said would end bilateral talks about Hong Kong's political development. Use of the word 'turmoil' is particularly significant. In 1982 Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, told then British prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher that China would take control of Hong Kong before 1997 if turmoil erupted in the colony. Mr Patten yesterday said there was 'no turmoil or chaos in Hong Kong'. Chinese officials could put their 'hearts and minds at rest on that particular issue', he added. The governor was supported by Mr Ronald Arculli, deputy leader of LegCo's Liberal (conservative) party. 'Hong Kong is not in turmoil now, and I can't conceive of any situation where Hong Kong would be in turmoil,' he said. Mr Qian was speaking at a meeting of Beijing's 'preliminary working committee' (PWC) - a group of mainland officials and Hong Kong plutocrats charged with advising China on its takeover of Hong Kong. At the meeting the foreign minister said China hoped to control 'disorder' in the colony through agreement with the British. 'But if co-operation breaks down, we cannot sit back and watch disorder in Hong Kong.' It is clear, however, from the PWC's deliberations that China is planning for a breakdown in bilateral co-operation. The group has been charged with drawing up arrangements, by July next year, for fresh elections after 1997.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel Otero, from Cartagena </F> de Indias, Colombia; from the "First Thing" program]    [Text] Colombian President Cesar Gaviria will host 20 of  his Ibero-American counterparts in Cartagena de Indias on 14  June. He will conclude his term in August, after almost five  years as head of the Colombian Government. This man has carried  out social security plans, enforced efficient strategies in the  struggle against the drug cartels, and sponsored an active  foreign policy that put the country in a leading position at the  continental level. Colombia comprises -- along with Venezuela  and Mexico -- the active Group of Three.    Gaviria's role undoubtedly resulted in his appointment as  OAS  secretary general, replacing Joao Baena Soares at the end of his  term. Colombian citizens breathed easier with Gaviria because  he virtually dismantled the dangerous Medellin Cartel and  carried out other actions to improve public safety. His  government also adopted important decisions in the foreign  policy sector, including the decision to restore diplomatic  relations with Cuba in October 1993.    Bilateral relations have increased since then. Four  Colombian ministers have travelled to the island and a similar  number of Cuban officials have visited Santa Fe de Bogota in  less than eight months. The exchange in the trade and technical  sectors and the search for investments in Havana have played a  prominent role. Innumerable Colombian foreign trade delegations  and businessmen have visited socialist Cuba. The two countries  have participated in scientific and technological projects and  carried out important negotiations in the pharmaceutical and  metalworks industries and in the agricultural and perishable  consumer goods sectors.    Colombia received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on  12 December, meeting President Gaviria, Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin, and numerous businessmen during his three-day official  visit. He also established the groundwork for creating a  binational commission. Carlos Lage, Council of Ministers vice  president, and Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez arrived in  Santa Fe de Bogota after that first official Cuban visit to  Colombia. Colombian Health Minister Juan Carlos Londono and  Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule also visited Havana.    An unpleasant incident occurred in the interim: A newspaper  in Santa Fe de Bogota tried to present Cuba as a sponsor of a  guerrilla summit in Havana. The anti-Cuban campaign coincided  with the announcement that Colombia would sell Cuba  15,000-20,000 barrels of oil. The incident was finally cleared  up, the newspaper apologized to Cuba, the case was closed, and  the rhythm of relations resumed.    Ernesto Melendez, minister for foreign relations and  economic  cooperation, arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota, while the Colombian  agriculture minister arrived in Havana. Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin also visited the Cuban capital, meeting President Fidel  Castro and other high-ranking leaders.    Incidentally, Fidel Castro's upcoming visit to Cartagena de  Indias to attend the fourth Ibero-American summit will be the  second time that Castro has visited Colombia as head of state,  the first being in August 1993 after he attended President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's inauguration in Bolivia.</p>

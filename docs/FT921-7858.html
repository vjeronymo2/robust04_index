			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (10): Reward for safety - Ways to cut claim rates SOME company car fleets have seen their accident claim rates drop by 39 per cent compared with the previous year. They have seen their accident claim costs fall by 29 per cent at a time when average claims costs have been rising much faster than the rate of inflation. Consequently, insurance premiums for those fleets have been reduced by about Pounds 100 a vehicle. The fleets experiencing these startling improvements are taking advantage of the FIRMS (or Fleet Insurance and Risk Management Services) scheme, introduced by the General Accident insurance group in 1988. The FIRMS concept is very simple: if a company's management shows determined commitment to a genuine safety culture and if drivers are educated to think about safety, then the company's vehicle accident rate should improve. And when it does, GA will reduce its insurance premiums. Not only that, to show its faith in the idea, GA is paying towards the cost of training - the insurance group's contribution (paid via a reduction in the premium collected) was recently increased from Pounds 25 to Pounds 45 a driver. GA's initiative sprang from the appalling fact that more than one company car in three will be involved in an accident this year and motor insurers will deal with 4m claims. In 1989 there was on average one death or injury per 41 company cars. The claims frequency (expressed as the number of claims per 100 vehicles a year) rose substantially during the 1980s and by 1988 stood at 43.5 per cent for fleet vehicles compared with 33.5 per cent in 1985. Yet fleet operators usually ignore this problem. When GA surveyed 1,000 fleets and asked whether they kept in-house records of car accidents, 92.2 per cent said they did. And 83.6 per cent said they analysed the records to establish common factors. But, when asked whether they took any action as a result, more than 75 per cent said 'no'. The average cost of a damage-only accident in 1989 was Pounds 850 if social costs such as police time are included. Mr David Crichton, GA's commercial motor manager for the UK, says this is probably what an accident costs a fleet operator if management time and inconvenience are taken into account. 'If a company's accountant found that more than Pounds 800 was being stolen from the company on a regular basis, he would clamp down immediately. Why is it the same approach is rarely taken on vehicle accidents?' Mr Crichton asks. He points out that there are now more than 3m company cars on British roads travelling a total of 63bn miles a year. That is 40 per cent of the total car mileage in Britain. 'Fleet managers could, therefore, collectively have a tremendous influence on the national casualty figures,' he says. 'Most car fleet managers could do a great deal to reduce their fleets' accidents. Perhaps the most important single measure would be to introduce good quality driving training. It is not unusual for a fleet to find that such driver training reduces its rate of accidents by more than 30 per cent, provided it is backed up by a firm management commitment to an overall coherent strategy to reduce accidents.' Mr Crichton is backed by Mr Wayne Gardner, a director of BSM Health &amp; Safety, one of about a dozen driver training organisations recommended by GA. He points to a BP Oil division with 70 company cars and where the accident rate has dropped to only 1.5 per cent since driver training was started in 1988 and where management is taking road safety issues seriously. (That 1.5 per cent compares with the previously-mentioned national accident claims average of 43.5 per cent). BSMHS offers a three-tiered scheme to fleets and clients can take their pick from what is on offer. This includes 'workshops' for managers explaining how they can take a pro-active approach to road safety; in-classroom training for drivers covering behaviour and attitude; and a one-on-one accident prevention course, using the client's vehicle, where the risks an individual takes and how he or she deals with the risks caused by others are analysed. A company taking the complete package would pay about Pounds 150 per driver. Mr Gardner warns, however: 'You can't wave a magic wand. A bit of driver training will not make all the problems go away.' But he insists attitudes can be changed. BSMHS stresses that 'people have accidents because they take risks with the company's asset.' Drivers are also reminded that the most common cause of death of people between four years of age and 44 is road accidents. 'For many people, being out in the company car is the most dangerous part of any job, Mr Gardner points out. Apart from giving grants towards driver training schemes, such as the BSMHS one, the General Accident FIRMS package includes a free safety audit; free 'risk improvement' materials (handbooks on risk management, driver training, and a video and booklet for lorry drivers); a free recovery help line as well as a 'retro rebate scheme' for fleet operators sending more than half their drivers on a GA-approved training course. They can have a proportion of their premiums refunded retrospectively if their claims experience improves. Mr Crichton says: 'Most fleet operators in this country have an abysmal record when it comes to taking measures to reduce accidents. We are often asked to quote for fleets which have claim frequencies of 100 or 200 per cent or more - just imagine, an average of two claims per car a year.' He admits, however, that the biggest problem with car fleet risk management is that people are usually recruited because they can do a particular job, not because of their driving ability. 'This often means recruiting people who are young, ambitious, confident and energetic - precisely the type of person who tends to have a high threshold of risk (the amount of risk they are prepared to accept in their lives.)' The fact that more than half of Britain's company car drivers are now 'user-choosers' and can have the motor of their choice within certain budget limitations, adds to the risk management difficulties. Younger drivers tend to choose 'hot hatchbacks' which 'can be lethal in the hands of a youngster who wants to show off'. Older, more senior, managers may want to go for genuine high-performance cars without necessarily having the quick reactions needed to control them safely. Mr Crichton asks: 'Would it not be more sensible if the driver's abilities were tested and then the driver was provided with a car which matched those abilities?' Then how do you discipline a good salesman with a poor accident record? Mr Crichton suggests this situation is best tackled by offering a 'reward' for safe driving so that the salesman 'wins' a better company car if he drives for, say, two years without an avoidable accident. Drivers with particularly bad accident records could be allocated pool cars which they would not be allowed to take home.</p>

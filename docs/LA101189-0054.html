			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS OFFER THEIR DREAM LIST;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA: ADVOCATES AND POLITICIANS PROPOSE A SWEEPING INITIATIVE ENFORCED BY  A CONSERVATION COP.  </P> <P> In one of the most audacious ballot initiatives ever offered to California  voters, the state's major environmental groups and Democratic candidate for  governor John K. Van de Kamp teamed up Tuesday with a proposal to turn  California greener, to try and make its food, air and water cleaner, and to put  a new conservationist cop on the beat in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Months in the drafting, the 39-page ballot proposition amounts to an  environmentalist dream list for the 1990s. Its sponsors, among them some of the  more prominent lawyers of the environmental movement and a few of its key  politicians, promised that the proposition would:  </P> <P> Phase out cancer-causing agricultural pesticides, tighten safeguards against  oil spills, restrict chemicals that pollute the atmosphere, limit waste  discharges, plant more trees, preserve tracts of old-growth virgin redwoods and  expand health protection for farm workers.  </P> <P> A huge pot of $840 million in environmental financing is called for -- $500  million in a trust fund for coastal oil spills, $300 million for reforestation  projects and for acquisition of redwoods, and $40 million a year in grants for  environmental research projects.  </P> <P> And to enforce it all, and every other similar law on the books, the initiative  establishes a new elected office of state environmental advocate with the power  to sue anyone in government who gets in the way. The new office would come with  a guaranteed annual budget of $40 million.  </P> <P> The November, 1990, ballot proposition is an integral plank in a unique  campaign strategy of Van de Kamp, the incumbent attorney general. His idea is  to put his promises in writing so voters do not have to take his word for it  but can "vote for me, vote for my platform." This initiative is one of three he  is pursuing.  </P> <P> For environmentalists, the proposition represents an effort to join behind a  consensus package and ride what they believe is a rising tide of public anxiety  about the deteriorating quality of life in California.  </P> <P> For one other politician in the mix, Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica),  the proposition represents the potential for a future in statewide politics.  Hayden was chairman of the committee that pulled the environmentalists and Van  de Kamp together and drafted the proposition. He is expected to chair the  campaign on its behalf. And on Tuesday, he suggested that the proposed  environmental advocate to be elected in 1992 would be "a great office."  </P> <P> "Today we are putting before the people of California a document that holds the  promise of cleaner water, purer food and a healthier atmosphere," Van de Kamp  said at press conferences in Los Angeles and San Francisco. He went on to  describe it as an "environmental bill of rights."  </P> <P> Hayden proclaimed the measure "the most significant proposal for protecting the  environment ever placed before the voters in this country."  </P> <P> Six environmental groups have a hand in the proposal, and most of them were on  hand for Tuesday's unveiling.  </P> <P> "It puts California back in the lead, where California belongs," said Bob  Hattoy of the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> "A home run!" said Al Meyerhoff of the National Resources Defense Council.  </P> <P> "A first bold step into what we hope will be the decade of the environment,"  said Lucy Blake of the California League of Conservation Voters.  </P> <P> Other groups behind the proposal include the National Toxics Campaign, Campaign  California, and Citizens for Better Environment.  </P> <P> Sponsors must obtain at least 500,000 signatures in the next five months to  assure the proposition a place on the November ballot. Other questions about  the dimensions of the campaign, its budget and composition, remain undecided  pending the reaction of potential opponents.  </P> <P> Sponsors said that vociferous resistance is possible, particularly from  agribusiness, once the measure is distributed widely and studied. The final  version of the proposal was not complete and available to outsiders until late  Monday night.  </P> <P> On the other hand, environmentalists said they did not want to presume that  this campaign will polarize the state along old battle lines -- consumers and  environmentalists vs. growers and pesticide producers. In particular, sponsors  of the initiative said they hope that some growers would find sufficient cause  to support the proposal, or some of its provisions, or at least not engage in  an hugely expensive campaign to defeat it.  </P> <P> "After all, it was the apple growers who lost $100 million in the Alar scare,"  noted Meyerhoff of the National Resources Defense Council. That was the  disclosure that the chemical Alar was left on apples, which sent sales  plunging.  </P> <P> However, early and tentative grower response was not favorable.  </P> <P> "Chances are we're going to find that it's overreacting to the situation. And  it's going to make it tougher for farmers to make a living," said Clark Biggs,  spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation. "We know it's part of the  attorney general's campaign for governor and we don't like that."  </P> <P> Republican candidate for governor and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson was equivocal in  reacting.  </P> <P> In a long letter, Wilson, who wants to project himself as a  environmental-leaning Republican, lauded many of goals of the proposition.  </P> <P> In particular, Wilson said he supported the idea of eliminating poisons from  food. But he questioned other areas of the measure -- whether California should  embark unilaterally on its own campaign to eliminate CFCs, or  chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed for ozone depletion. Or, whether it is  fiscally prudent to require secondary treatment of all sewage flowing into the  ocean. Both are provisions of the initiative.  </P> <P> Wilson flatly opposed the establishing an elected office for an environmental  advocate. "In my judgment, it is the responsibility of the governor to be the  chief environmental advocate. I do not intend to delegate such a primary  responsibility."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's chief Democratic rival, Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San  Francisco, said she had not read the entire measure but shared a concern for  the environment. "It's well-intended; we'll see if its well-drafted," her  campaign said.  </P> <P> Under terms of the proposal, agricultural chemicals that are known to cause  cancer or reproductive injury would be phased out of use by 1996. State  officials could extend the deadline three years in the event that no safe  replacement chemicals are available or in the event of provable agricultural  hardship.  </P> <P> Sponsors said that if applied today, about 15 specific chemicals would fall  under the phase-out, including important fungicides, pesticides and fumigants.  Initiative sponsors acknowledged that safe replacements are not now available.  </P> <P> To counter would-be critics who might say that farmers are being driven into an  impossible situation, the measure provides $40 million a year in research  grants for such things as research for safer chemicals.  </P> <P> Of larger geographical importance, the initiative would impose the same  limitations on residual pesticides in food imported from other states and  countries as established for California grown. Because of the huge consumer  market here, sponsors said this provision would have the effect of changing  pesticide use and formulas around the world.  </P> <P> The proposal does not directly attack smog. Sponsors said they did not want to  duplicate the work of agencies such as the South Coast Air Quality Management  District.  </P> <P> But it does address two types of airborne chemicals -- carbon dioxide and CFCs.  </P> <P> Without saying how the goals are to be accomplished, the initiative declares  that California must reduce carbon dioxide emissions 20% by the year 2000 and  40% by 2010. Scientists say carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will contribute to  global warming, commonly called the "greenhouse" effect. The measure takes a  strong hand on CFCs -- ordering them phased out by 1997 except in cases of  medical need or economic hardship.  </P> <P> One of the last elements that drafters agreed to put in the measure is also one  that wanders furthest from the "air, water and food" theme. This is a ban on  logging virgin redwoods for one year. The idea is to give the government time  to survey remaining stands and buy up the choicest, using $200 million of the  proceeds of a $300-million bond issue that is contained in the proposition.  </P> <P> The remaining $100 million would be used for assorted other reforestation  projects, urban and rural. Additionally, developers in the future would be  required to plant one tree for every 500 square feet of new construction.  </P> <P> California law requires that an initiative cover only a single subject. Because  this one is so broad, early questions arose over whether it would fit under  that requirement. Sponsors said they felt they met the test because, in the  words of one drafter, "everything fits under the subject of environmental  protection."  </P> <P> Anthony Miller, chief deputy secretary of state, agreed that the single-subject  rule can have a broad interpretation, although the courts have not ruled  recently on any significant test case. "As long as you can come up with one  concept to include all the parts, it's probably OK," he said.  </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Sponsors must now obtain 372,178 valid signatures of registered voters during  the next 150 days to qualify the proposition for a spot on the ballot on Nov.  8, 1990. By rule of thumb, 500,000 to 600,000 signatures actually will have to  be collected to assure that enough of those who sign are actually registered to  vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE  </P> <P> FOOD  </P> <P> Calls for the phase-out of all agricultural chemicals known to cause cancer or  reproductive harm by 1996. State officials can add a three-year extension in  the event of agricultural hardship.  </P> <P> Food imported to California must meet the same standards as that grown locally.  </P> <P> Responsibility for the health of farm workers to be transferred from the state  Department of Agriculture to the Health Department.  </P> <P> AIR  </P> <P> Calls for phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, linked to destruction of  atmospheric ozone, by 1997.  </P> <P> Establishes a goal for reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide, suspected of  contributing to global greenhouse effect, of 20% by 2000 and 40% by 2010.  Methods for achieving goals are unspecified.  </P> <P> Requires developers to plant a tree for every 500 square feet of future  development. A $300-million bond issue is proposed for reforestation efforts  and to buy virgin stands of redwoods.  </P> <P> WATER  </P> <P> By taxing oil passing through California at 25 cents a barrel, a $500-million  fund is proposed to respond to oil spills.  </P> <P> Vastly expands contingency planning and financial responsibility for spills.  </P> <P> Reaffirms that all California public sewage plants meet federal discharge  standards by 2000. Industries that discharge into state waters will have to  establish a toxics monitoring program.  </P> <P> OTHER  </P> <P> Prohibits cutting of old-growth redwoods for one year while the state takes  inventory and makes public purchase arrangements. Afterward, clear-cutting of  such stands is prohibited.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENFORCEMENT  </P> <P> Starting in 1992, a new Office of Environmental Advocate is established. The  office will be elective. The advocate is allowed an annual budget of $40  million to award grants for environmental research.  </P></p>

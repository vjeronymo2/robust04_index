			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WARN OF NEW INFLATIONARY PRESSURES  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve district banks warned today that strong economic growth is  creating inflationary pressures and that dry weather in the Central Plains may  send food prices spiraling again later this year.  </P> <P> In its March survey Current Economic Conditions, the Fed's 12 district banks  reported that economic activity appeared to be expanding "at a moderately  strong pace" through March 8.  </P> <P> "Consumer spending, except for autos, has apparently gained momentum while  manufacturing, especially for export, continues to show strength almost  everywhere," the report said.  </P> <P> "In this environment," the report warned, "there is evidence of pressures on  costs and prices."  </P> <P> The Fed's concern about inflation has led it to raise interest rates gradually  since last spring.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Reflection of Human Rights"] </F>   [Excerpt] The U.S. State Department indicated in its  report on human rights that the situation in Thailand is still  bad. In 1993 in particular, more than 60 suspects died during  detention. The report also said suspects were quite often  victims of extra-judicial execution by policemen.    The U.S. State Department indicated in its 1 February record  on human rights in 193 nations that many countries in Asia are  found to violate human rights. They include Thailand, India,  Indonesia, Vietnam, and Pakistan.    According to the report, criminal suspects under detention  often complained that they were victims of several kinds of  torture by police authorities, including electric shock to force  confessions.    The report also noted that human rights violations in  Thailand included the abuse of women and children -- the  procurement of women for prostitution and forced child labor are  widespread.    Not a single leader in the government either acknowledged or  rejected the State Department report on human rights violations  in Thailand. Undoubtedly, Thailand in the eyes of the world is a  country whose people still lack due rights and freedoms enjoyed  by those under democratic governments. The prevailing human  rights violations are a reflection that Thai people do not fully  enjoy rights and freedoms prescribed in the Constitution which  is the highest law of the nation.    The government therefore must review administrative policy  and follow up implementation by authorities, especially when it  concerns the justice system at all levels which directly  involves people's rights and freedoms, and basic human rights in  general.

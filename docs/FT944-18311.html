			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kopper urges broad provisions Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank's managing board, yesterday backed the suggestion that banks should smooth out peaks and troughs in their earnings by making precautionary provisions against corporate loans. Speaking at a briefing in Madrid to coincide with the annual meetings of the IMF/World Bank, Mr Kopper said Deutsche was 'quite ready to participate in a discussion' on the broader use of general provisions, an idea raised by Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England's executive director for financial stability. Mr Kopper argued that Deutsche's loan provisioning policy was already closer to Mr Quinn's suggestion than other financial institutions, and that there was 'wider scope' for the use of general provisions from other banks. 'A lot of analysts in the market do not understand what a bank like our's does when it talks about far-reaching provisions,' said Mr Kopper. Mr Quinn suggested in a speech last week that banks could counter swings in earnings over economic cycles by making general provisions against corporate loans when they are made rather than waiting for defaults. The idea would face some accounting difficulties because auditors might argue that a bank was artificially undervaluing its assets, although banks currently use the approach for consumer loan portfolios. Mr Kopper disclosed that Deutsche had decided to use its own name for its Italian subsidiary Banca d'America e d'Italia.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DISPOSABLE-DIAPER GUILT FEELING RECYCLED  </P> <P> Environmentally conscious parents who reluctantly use non-biodegradable  disposable diapers can now take advantage of a service that will pick up soiled  paper and plastic diapers and recycle their components.  </P> <P> Babyland Diaper Service of San Diego has started California's first disposable  diaper recycling program, born out of growing concerns that the convenient  diapers are adding to the crisis of overflowing landfills.  </P> <P> The service is the result of an unlikely marriage between Babyland, a cloth  diaper supplier, and one of its competitors, Weyerhaeuser Co., the nation's  third largest disposable diaper manufacturer.  </P> <P> "We're pioneers in what I believe is an environmental revolution," said James  Houlihan, president of Babyland. "The desire to provide concrete solutions, not  talk, has brought us together."  </P> <P> Babyland has 300 clients using the recycling alternative compared to 3,000  using its cloth diaper service.  </P> <P> Under the service, which started in February, Babyland vans deliver and  retrieve Weyerhaeuser's Loving Touch disposable diapers weekly in the San Diego  area.  </P> <P> The soiled diapers are processed at the Babyland plant, where patented  equipment cleans, shreds and separates the diapers into their two major  components.  </P> <P> The fluffy absorbent pulp interiors are sent to San Diego-based Fiber Resources  Unlimited, where they are compressed, baled and sold to companies manufacturing  grocery bags, cardboard boxes, stationary and magazines.  </P> <P> The plastic exteriors are condensed and mixed with other plastics at Western  Gold Thermoplastics in Los Angeles. The plastics are typically used to  manufacture cassette tapes and nursery flats for carrying plants.  </P> <P> More than 80,000 San Diego babies contribute 4 million disposables a year to  landfills. Experts say disposable diapers will remain in landfills for at least  500 years.  </P> <P> County officials have warned that several of the county's six landfills are  rapidly approaching capacity, and state Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) has led  a drive to ban the use of disposable diapers.  </P> <P> The cost of the new service, which varies according to volume, is slightly more  expensive than traditional cloth diaper delivery or supermarket disposable  diaper brands.  </P> <P> "On average, your general price may run about $2 more to use this service. But,  when you factor in the amount Californians are using to pay for solid-waste  disposal, it evens out," said Babyland vice president Diane Kudo.  </P> <P> "Many people are fascinated the first time they hear they can use a disposable  diaper that doesn't have to be used just one time. Parents want to do the right  thing," she said.  </P></p>

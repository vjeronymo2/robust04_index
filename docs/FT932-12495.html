			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Leading Article: Pension nerves THE BRITISH government appears to be losing its nerve over equalising the state pension age. Originally it planned to announce this month that the female pension age would be gradually increased from 60 to 65 to bring women into line with men. Now it looks like the announcement will be delayed until the autumn with legislation postponed until 1994-95. The reason is that a government anxious to avoid controversy believes a common age of 65 would be unpopular with women. But, unlike other measures being postponed, such as Post Office privatisation, this is not an issue on which there is fundamental uncertainty inside government. The pension age needs to be equalised to remove discrimination between the sexes. The reason for raising the women's age to 65 rather than cutting the men's to 60 is to put some limits on the expansion of the state's pension expenditure - at Pounds 30bn a year already the largest part of the social security budget. Given that the population over 65 will grow by about a half in the next 40 years, there are already strong upward pressures on pensions spending. Picking a common age of 60 would make this problem even worse, costing taxpayers about Pounds 4bn a year. Choosing one of 65, by contrast, would save Pounds 4bn. There are those who accept the need to control costs but would like older people to have greater choice about when they retire. They propose a flexible pension age, under which those who retire early would receive a smaller pension than those retiring later. Though attractive in theory, this idea is impractical given that the pension is already below the state poverty line. Anyone trying to live on a reduced pension would find it even harder to make ends meet. Moreover, since flexible retirement is not identical to a flexible state pension age, there are other ways the government could promote choice even while keeping a fixed pension age. These might include encouraging the private sector to offer more flexible pensions and working arrangements to make it easier for older people to phase in retirement. There is no good case for delay. Given the government's known views on the matter, the sooner the change is announced, the sooner those affected would be able to plan their retirements. Nor should the change be too unpopular if arranged so that no woman currently over 50 would be affected. In fact, delaying an announcement to avoid controversy would almost certainly be counterproductive. A government that ran away from such a decision this early in the electoral cycle would hardly find it easier to take it when there were only two years or so left before an election. This is a case when prolonging the agony can only make it worse.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 25 YEARS TO LIFE GIVEN IN DEATH OF UNBORN  CHILD  </P> <P> A 35-year-old San Pedro woman convicted of deliberately running over a pregnant  acquaintance and killing her unborn child has been sentenced in Long Beach  Superior Court to 25 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Charles Sheldon ordered the prison term for Brenda Sue  Franklin, 35, on a Sept. 22 conviction of first-degree murder and attempted  murder.  </P> <P> Jurors found Franklin guilty of driving over Barbara Ochoa, who was in her  early 40s, and dragging the victim six blocks, inflicting massive road burns  and fracturing her pelvis. Ochoa delivered a stillborn child the next day.  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Cynthia Zuzga, said the two women had  engaged in a angry, drug-related argument on June 10, when Franklin jumped into  her car, gunned the engine and drove at Ochoa, who was standing near the front  of the auto.  </P> <P> Ochoa, who is still in the hospital, was not called to testify because of her  injuries and post-birth depression, Zuzga said.  </P></p>

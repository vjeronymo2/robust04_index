			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Volex seeks Pounds 17.5m to fund expansion VOLEX GROUP, the electrical interconnection products company, has launched a Pounds 17.5m rights issue to fund a further acquisition in the US, the group's capital expenditure requirements and to pay off its Pounds 8.2m borrowings. Furthermore, Mr Howard Poulson, chief executive, forecast that group pre-tax profits would double from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 7.25m in the year to March 31 1993. Volex shares rose 24p to 440p on the day. The group has acquired Component Manufacturing Services (CMS), along with an option - for a nominal Dollars 1 - to buy a 40.3 per cent stake in Signmax, CMS's Irish affiliate, for a total Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3.1m). Within the next two years Volex will also acquire a North Carolina site, currently leased by CMS, for Dollars 720,000. CMS makes moulded cable assemblies in North Carolina and Massachusetts. It made operating losses of Dollars 2.1m on sales of Dollars 15.8m in the year to September 26. It will be merged with Volex Interconnect Systems, itself a merger between Cable Products and Icontec, acquired in January and July 1992 for Pounds 14.6m and Pounds 4.31m respectively. Some 60 per cent of CMS's output is in the instrumentation and medical electronics market and will complement the west coast medical business of Mayor, the 60 per cent-owned and Singapore-based data and power cord manufacturer bought in October for Pounds 6.5m. The balance - in computers - will bring two or three new OEM accounts, including IBM, to which VIS already supplies data cables. Mr Poulson said CMS would be the last buy in the US for some time, and that the group's focus had now shifted to Europe, in particular eastern Europe and especially cable assemblies. In the year to March 1993, capital expenditure will reach Pounds 7.5m, mainly at the power cable assemblies operations at Pencon in Lancashire and Mayor in Wales. Some Pounds 7m has been pencilled in for the following year. In the cash call, 5.27m new shares will be issued on a 1-for-4 basis at 345p per share. The issue is underwritten by SG Warburg.</p>

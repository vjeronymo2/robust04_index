The recipient will retain the documents and records to support these financial transactions and documentation of work performed, for possible use in a cost recovery case, for a minimum of ten (10) years after submission of a final Financial Status Report (FSR), unless there is litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the specific site, then the records will be maintained until resolution of all issues on the specific site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A former U.S. Navy bomb handler, recalling the horror of losing a nuclear bomb  at sea in 1965, said the accident may have been caused by improper preparation  for a nuclear weapons loading drill, the San Diego Tribune reported. William  Lane, who witnessed an A-4E Skyhawk jet equipped with a hydrogen bomb roll off  the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga 24 years ago, said the jet's pilot apparently  could not reach the pre-set controls with his feet to stop the plane from  plunging into the Pacific Ocean off Japan. Lane said suspicions also focused on  a possible failure of the plane's hydraulic brakes. Lane, of Santee east of San  Diego, said the crew was unofficially asked to forget the incident.  </P></p>

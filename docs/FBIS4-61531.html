			<p>BFN     [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas expressed his great  concern with the fact that prosecutors' offices very often delay  preliminary investigations into criminal cases, while courts are  overly slow in examining the latter. The president stated in  his interview with Lithuanian radio that the operativeness of  their work is beneath criticism.    Many prosecutors' offices and courts do not observe legal  norms under which preliminary investigations must be completed  within two months and cases investigated within 25 days.  Everything is delayed for months and even years. This causes  the justified indignation of society and government  institutions. Algirdas Brazauskas said that he was also upset  by this.    During the entire period of investigation, the accused are  kept in overcrowded cells with unsanitary conditions. People  are simply neglected there. The president stressed that it  would be very difficult to administer justice in this way.    "I am not speaking about the investigation of cases, which  is  an exceptional prerogative of the court, and no one has the  right to interfere with its work. However, the observance of  deadlines and the quality of preliminary investigations is the  common concern of us all," said Algirdas Brazauskas.    The president particularly focused on those cases, which are  being investigated by the Prosecutor General's Office and the  Supreme Court. The criminal case in which Makutinovich and  Sklyar, members of the Vilnius OMON [special Soviet militia  units], are accused of crimes against the state, has been  sitting in the Supreme Court since September 1993, while they  had to be sued within 10 days. It has been already a year and  the criminal case of violations in printing the litas has not  received any legal assessment. This notorious case, which puts  high-ranking government officials on trial, was suspended by the  Supreme Court on 1 February. The latter authorized the  Prosecutor General's Office to provide new evidence within a  month. However, no additional material was obtained. The  president said that he would demand an explanation from both  institutions.</p>

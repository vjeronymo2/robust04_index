			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IT'S A TOUGH SAIL, AND ONLY A FEW PEOPLE BUY THE IDEA  </P> <P> At the Southeast 17th Street causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway, many  worlds meet. To the southwest, cruise ships dock, chock-a-block with  multinational clienteles. From the northwest, charter fishing boats rumble away  from hotel marinas and private piers toward Port Everglades Channel and the  fishing grounds offshore.  </P> <P> To the northeast stands Pier 66 Resort and Marina, all spit and polish, fern  bars and waterside cafes, and primary layover facility for the fleet in the  Whitbread Round the World Race.  </P> <P> To the southeast stands a lesser hotel and a flamingo-pink shopping center. At  the lesser hotel, the Best Western Marina Inn, part of the Whitbread overflow  will dock this week. At a small, smelly bar tucked away in the pink shopping  center, an ersatz treasure hunter named Dick Vogel was holding court late one  night last week.  </P> <P> Vogel's tales of treasure were nonsensical; his admiration for the Nazi  infantry in World War II was vocal and comparable in zeal only to his distaste  for the Whitbread race.  </P> <P> "Whitebread, who cares about the Whitebread?" Herr Vogel said. "Bunch of slimy  limeys and (assorted other racial epithets) chasing each other around the  world. Who cares? What's the point?"  </P> <P> In the bar that night while Vogel presided was a knot of journalists in town to  cover the Whitbread. The correspondent from Britain's The Independent sat  quietly while Vogel railed about gold coins and emeralds ("an Englishman is  never unintentionally rude," he said several times), but Vogel's assessment of  the Whitbread set him off.  </P> <P> "But that is -- quite exactly, really -- the point," the correspondent from The  Independent said. "Slimy limeys, Italians, Swedes, Dutch, Finns, Americans,  Kiwis, Australians and Germans racing around the whole bloody world. Not for  money -- for a chance to win a few silly, plated trophies and the privilege to  be able to say they have done it."  </P> <P> The point seemed quite exactly lost on Vogel. Treasure, after all, to many is  something you can pick up, rub between your fingers and admire or sell. Perhaps  the point is lost on many other Americans as well.  </P> <P> There will be some who notice that Steinlager 2 and Fisher &amp; Paykel, each a  multimillion-dollar campaign with major corporate sponsors, are neck and neck  over the last four legs of the race. Others may have taken note that there is  no American entry and there is one all-woman crew. But few will be able to tick  off the ports of call, the large or small tragedies and triumphs in 33,000  miles of racing.  </P> <P> To many of the crew, being there at all is treasure in itself.  </P></p>

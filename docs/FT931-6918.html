			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold jewellery demand riding high WIDESPREAD RECESSION has failed to dent world demand for gold jewellery, according to the World Gold Council, the promotional organisation supported by producers. The industry soaked up a record 2,400 tonnes last year, 14 per cent up on 1991. The council estimates that total identified worldwide demand for gold in jewellery, investments and industrial uses rose by 9 per cent to 3,057 tonnes - 'a striking increase in a year where 600 tonnes of official gold was sold by Belgium and Dutch central banks'. The driving forces behind the increase in jewellery demand have been the Middle and Far Eastern markets. Demand in the Far East rose by 33 per cent to 654 tonnes. Chinese demand for pure gold jewellery, known as Chuk Kam, rose by 47 per cent to 250 tonnes. However, Far Eastern demand for bar and coins was 41 per cent down at 51 tonnes. In the developed world, trade purchases of jewellery eased by 1 per cent, with Japan showing a fall of 17 per cent to 104.5 tonnes and the US registering a rise of 5 per cent to 230.6 tonnes. Mr Roger Murphy, of the council's economics service, emphasised that the council's figures were based on identified demand, adding that there was probably substantial un-identified demand. He expects to see 'a continued movement of gold from West to East and with it a steady rise in demand through 1993'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Piotr Adamowicz: "Changes Needed in the Budget"] </F>   [Text] The authorities of "Solidarity" ["S"] have requested  the government to make changes in the budget bill. They believe  that the projected price increases will result in higher  inflation and higher maintenance costs, as well as lower real  incomes of employees. On 9 February, they will stage an  all-national demonstration in Warsaw.    According to the National Committee [KK], the increases in  the prices of energy and other goods of the so-called basic  consumer basket scheduled for this year will bring about an  increase in maintenance costs and a drop in employees' real  incomes. Another factor that will limit these incomes will be  higher tax rates. "S" fears that the policy of the present  government will make it impossible to carry out the fundamental  provision of the "Pact on Enterprise," which pertains to an  increase in real wages in the production sphere in a situation  of a projected increase in the GDP. "I always knew that the  present governing group does not meet our political  expectations; the budget bill proved that it does not meet our  social expectations, either," stated "S" Chairman Marian  Krzaklewski.    Most of the KK members support the idea of organizing  protests. The differences were only over the timing and the form  of the protests. The proposal to stage an all-national  demonstration in Warsaw was backed, as one KK member put it, on  such a scale as to "make all of the windowpanes in the Office of  the Council of Ministers fall out." More than a dozen persons  wanted to organize strikes; a few discussed the possibility of a  general strike. According to observers, the union is not  prepared for a major strike action. The appeals for strikes  should be looked upon as a kind of stick. "S" authorities hope  that the major price increases projected in the budget law will  cause an increase in social impatience and spontaneous protests.  Then the union will be able to try to organize a more serious  strike action.    The unionists were very surprised that the government would  like to obtain credit from the World Bank for the Mass  Privatization Program and for the National Investment Funds.  "The bill on the privatization of state-run enterprises no  longer has the provisions in line with which all citizens are  able to purchase the shares of privatized companies, in a  situation of the insufficiency of domestic capital and savings.  Thus, finally, there will be no chance of including the citizens  in the processes of privatization," stated KK Presidium member  Jerzy Ostrouch.    "S" has invited experts of the extraparliamentary  center-right groupings to take part in the work of the team that  is supposed to draft a constitution bill. The invitations will  be extended by Chairman Krzaklewski. The team for the new  constitution will set up a Senate Club of the Independent  Self-Governing Trade Union "S."    According to the KK, the refusal to admit the states to NATO  affronts the aspirations of societies that for half a year  strove to regain their identity.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Few Germans to escape package of spending cuts VIRTUALLY every part of the German population will be hit by the package of spending cuts, future tax increases and immediate abolition of tax allowances proposed yesterday by the ruling German coalition. The package represents the government's response to the soaring cost of German unification. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, maintains that it is intended to be socially fair, with 70 per cent of the cost falling on the top 50 per cent of income earners. Key elements include: reintroduction of the 'solidarity surcharge' on income and corporation tax from 1995; road tax and petrol tax increase from 1994 (to pay for rail reform and debt); extension of 30 per cent tax on investment income to include interest payments from foreign investment funds; halving the tax allowance on mortgages for purchase of existing dwellings (no change for new buildings); increased tax on insurance policies (excluding fire and life insurance) to 12 per cent in July, 1993 and 15 per cent in January, 1995; central government payroll to be reduced by 1 per cent per annum in 1994 and 1995; there will be a reduction in unemployment benefits by 1 per cent for families, and 3 per cent for childless workers; further cuts in defence spending of DM300m (Pounds 123.4m) in 1993, and DM700m per year from 1994-96; progressive reduction in income support to farmers, from 2.5 per cent in 1993 to zero by 1996; reduction in subsidies to coke and coal industries of DM855m by 1996; cuts in shipbuilding subsidies by DM160m 1993-95; means tests for childrens' allowances and education grants for infants; reduction in social assistance for asylum seekers by DM2bn per year; there will be a postponement of enforcing higher environmental and social standards for local services, such as sewage treatment and swimming pools.</p>

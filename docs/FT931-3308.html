			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News in Brief: Fokker FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker, said it was deferring publication of its 1992 results until April 2, pending official confirmation that the takeover by Deutsche Aerospace is going ahead, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. Fokker had originally slated results for March 18. The company, hard hit by the slump in orders for new airliners, is expected to announce in the next week or so a big cutback in production and jobs.</p>

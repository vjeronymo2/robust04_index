			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Travel: Nicaragua: waiting for the boom-time - Lizards, spiders and the owner's daughter joined Mike Bartram in his hotel bedroom In rage and terror, the bull tore free of its captors, flew past me and rampaged out of control down the main street. The creature had been right to struggle, yet his heroic and violent resistance could not alter the fact that the last wooden building in the street, the slaughterhouse, was getting nearer. He was not really out of control. The three young local farmers had simply loosened their grip on the ropes as their constant goading of the wretched animal finally became too much for him. It had taken them 40 minutes to drag him as many yards, slithering through the mud and letting out groans of anguish. He knew where he was going, and yet by charging at his tormentors he was playing into their hands. Such violence and cruelty seemed incongruous amid the tranquil surroundings of El Castillo. The river bends at this point, and the jungle yields briefly to the pressures of 20th century agriculture. This minor event in the stately passage of the Rio San Juan is marked by a modest hill, crowned by the remains of a 16th century fort, a reminder that this part of southern Nicaragua was once a prize to be fought over by the world's foremost economic powers, Spain and England. For centuries this wide, navigable river, which flows into the huge Lake Nicaragua, seemed the most likely place to build a waterway linking the Atlantic to the Pacific, although it lost out to Panama. There is only one real street in El Castillo, the village the Spaniards built. It runs all the way along the river and round the base of the hill, and is lined with little wooden houses. There are no cars. The nearest road is in San Carlos, three hours away by motorboat. And San Carlos is hardly a transport hub - if you miss the bus you have to wait four days for the next one. People do not go there much these days. Why should they? It is not on the way to anywhere, except the even more remote and apparently charmless Caribbean port of San Juan Del Norte. So I felt privileged to be there for its biggest day of the year - the day when the minister arrived from Managua to hand over formally the land titles to 400 families. As the focal point of the village, the ruined fort was the natural choice for the ceremony. Much of its ancient stone had disappeared, for the time being, beneath swathes of blue-and-white ribbons and flags. Most of the grass had disappeared, too, beneath the feet of hundreds of flag-waving, placard-bearing peasant farmers, though enough of it remained to provide a brilliant contrast with the searing blue sweep of the river below. The excitement had been mounting since the previous evening, with dozens of villagers of all ages making banners with upbeat messages of peace and reconciliation, or little flags in the colours of the UNO government. The sound system started blasting out uninhibited dance music from the top of the hill from 5am the following morning. The crowds gathering on the hill were augmented by the arrival of a number of overladen river launches. A convoy of three helicopters, one containing the minister for agricultural development, added a final touch of drama. Anyone who reads the national papers in Nicaragua will know how common these events are becoming. The authorities are not doing anything as dramatic as transferring ownership of the land to the peasant farmers; rather, they are legitimising their existing holdings. And that is important in itself. I enjoyed many long conversations with the locals; everyone wanted to talk. None of the people had great expectations of riches, or of changes in their lives. They believed in God, and in the importance of the family. They had limited ambitions - more and healthier food; better clothes - but they were not, generally, dissatisfied. Some people did want more, I was told, and had gone to work in Costa Rica, where wages are double those in Nicaragua. But not them. I was intrigued to find that about half the households owned a television, although a set costs about the same as it does in the west - a king's ransom when you are on a Nico wage. But as an old man said: 'It helps to pass the time.' I spent many hours watching the world go by: a man heaving load after back-breaking load of plantains down the street; dogs and chickens scavenging; children trying to play baseball with anything that came to hand, such as a crushed tin can; people sprinting for cover as drizzle turned quickly to downpour; communal singing in the two basic wooden sheds over the road, which they refer to as churches; the flirting of teenage boys from the hospedaje (cheap guest house) with the girls in the house opposite. There are two places to stay in El Castillo - the hospedaje and a new tourist hotel. I spent most of my three days at the cheaper place. It started very promisingly: I was greeted by the friendly owner and shown to a lovely large, clean room with three beds, plenty of room for my things, and a window on to the veranda. After a couple of hours, the owner asked if I would mind moving to another room. I watched in amazement as one of his daughters gathered up a handful of clothes from her cluttered bedroom, into which I was ushered. I sat on the bed of this airless broom-cupboard of a room, and waited for her to return and remove the rest of her things; but no. Towels and dresses filled shelves and hung on hooks. Pop pin-ups adorned the walls. Perfume, piles of clothes and all manner of personal possessions littered the room. All that was missing was the daughter. I pushed aside a sheet to reveal a 4in spider, which darted around for a while in an agitated state before making for the ceiling to join the lizards. There was no window; the room was about a third of the size of the other; the door did not shut if you were inside; and you could not switch the light on or off. Such was the respect for my privacy that the first morning I opened my eyes to find the daughter, no more than a couple of feet away, rummaging through a pile of her clothes. When I asked the owner where I should put my things he said simply: 'Put them on top of hers.' The Albergue Turistica, built with the help of the Germans, is the new face of tourism in Nicaragua. No need to pile your clothes on top of someone else's here. But there is a catch: it costs Dollars 15 against Dollars 2.50 at the hospedaje, and there is no atmosphere. When I arrived at the Albergue, I was reminded of the huge, empty castle in Citizen Kane. A bearded Spanish gentleman finally emerged from the veranda overlooking the village and shook me warmly by the hand. He had obviously been caught off-guard by someone actually wanting to use the hotel. 'What have you got to drink?' I asked. He scratched his head and we went to the kitchen to have a look in the 'fridge. Same routine for lunch. He spent the afternoon in a business meeting, discussing ways of cashing in on the tourist explosion which, he felt confident, was just around the corner. All of the local farmers I spoke to were on his side, seeing tourism as the route to a better life. But they were not holding their breath.</p>

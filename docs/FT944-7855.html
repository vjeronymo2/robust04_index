			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Cost of hospital failure lowered The net contribution by taxpayers to Health Care International, the private hospital near Glasgow which is in receivership, is likely to be less than Pounds 15m rather than the total Pounds 30m of public-sector support committed to it, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, indicated yesterday. He told Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, that Pounds 4.4m of the Pounds 22m in regional selective assistance offered to HCI was unpaid or was secured. The company believed it had generated Pounds 12m in income tax, National Insurance contributions and value added tax.</p>

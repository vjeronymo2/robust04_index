			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at Masallatah on 2 </F> May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] In continuation of the defiance  festivities, and in affirmation of preparedness for  confrontation and for standing up to the schemes of the  crusading enemies who are hostile to the Arab nation and the  Great Jamahriyah, the citadel of pan-Arabism and freedom in the  world, and in entrenchment of the historic cohesiveness between  the leader and the masses, the masses of Masallatah yesterday  welcomed the brother leader of the revolution. They chanted  loud slogans expressing the eternal ties between the masses and  the leader of their revolution, the symbol of their pride and  dignity, the builder of their civilization and the fulfiller of  their dreams to live freely on earth.    Amid the masses rubbing shoulders with him, the brother  leader of the revolution made the following address:    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Brothers, we let them hear our voice once  again from Masallatah, the beacon of knowledge and land of  jihad. We let them hear our voice from this place which was the  bridge through which the Italian occupation forces in 1911 tried  to cross to Tarhunah and to the east, as they used to call the  region. But the invading forces, brothers, could cross only  over the bodies of your fathers and grandfathers in well-known  battles. [passage omitted]    Brothers, we are proud of and cherish these eternal battles  from our history. They give us inspiration to confront the new  enemies, neo-fascism, the new crusade, the new Western colonial  campaign.    We confront them today at a time when we are stronger than  before, more numerous, with more equipment, and with more  preparedness to face up to our enemies. [passage omitted]  Brothers, we are stronger than before, and therefore our  resistance will be more fierce, more violent than that of our  fathers and grandfathers.    Their banners will never again be raised on this land. The  banners of freedom will always float over this land. We are  prepared to offer more sacrifices to impose our will on the  greedy and the covetous. [passage omitted]    The free Libyan people are now defying those who are even  stronger than Italy; it is challenging U.S. imperialism and its  unjust allies. We here challenge the three isolated states  which are swimming against the tide: the United States, Britain,  and France. We challenge them here with, on our side, the  peoples, the regional organizations, the international  organizations, the strugglers for freedom in all the continents  of the world. The United States, Britain, and France are  internationally condemned states, internationally isolated  states. They have no means other that the stick and carrot  method, and using the Security Council by force, with falsehood  and lies.    Thanks to your stand, O courageous Libyans, the three states  America, Britain, and France are isolated and condemned. They  are acting against the international community, against the  United Nations, and they have nothing left before them except  tearing up the UN Charter, trampling on international law, and  making the Security Council vote by force in favor of their  unjust resolutions.    The steadfast stand of the Libyan people has made the entire  world support the wronged Libyan people, the Libyan people that  have right on their side, the Libyan people that ask only for  freedom on the land of their fathers and grandfathers.    We are facing big states, however they are isolated states;  they are condemned by the international community; all the  world's peoples are today cursing the United States, Britain,  and France.    We are supported by the peoples of the Arab nation, even if  their leaders have submitted, even if their leaders betray us,  even if the leaders become weak. We are supported by masses  that stretch from the Atlantic to the Gulf; you are supported by  the peoples of the Arab nations; these people who own the veto  right which has more power than the veto of the UN Security  Council; the veto that the Somali people had used represents  full evidence of what I am saying, brothers.    Let us raise our voices even higher; we are the people of  the  land, and right is on our side [words indistinct], we have a  right to liberty, we have the right to live free on our land.  We fight, brothers, we will do so with honor; we will fight  with force because we will never relinquish the land of our  ancestors.    As for the others, they will fight with dishonor, they will  base their fight on experience; they will weigh up their losses  and gains because they will be fighting on a land that is not  theirs; they are the aggressors. Whereas we, when the time of  confrontation comes, will be stronger than they; because we own  this land; this land on which we walk is the land of our fathers  and ancestors.    What is important, brothers, is that their feet will tremble  on this land because they are aggressors and greedy people; we  are not greedy, we only defend our right to live; whereas they  defend the right to reap profits from uncalculated adventures.  Let them try the confrontation with the Libyan people who are  ready for this.    Brothers, I urge you to be ready to embark on the battle of  confrontation and the confrontation of defiance using any type  of weapons. Victory will be ours regardless.</p>

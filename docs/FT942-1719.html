			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World beyond the US judged to have little to fear from new high-nicotine tobacco Anti-smoking campaigners, health officials and industry experts in the UK were yesterday in broad agreement that the world beyond the US had little to fear from the Y-1 high-nicotine tobacco, the commercial use of which was revealed this week by Mr David Kessler, head of the US Food and Drug Administration, reports Jimmy Burns. Mr Stephen Woodward, deputy director of ASH, the anti-smoking lobby said: 'Our experience of tobacco companies is that any new product that is judged to give a competitive advantage, very quickly spreads throughout the industry'. However, ASH said that it had no evidence to contradict the assertion by BAT Industries, parent of Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco of the US which developed cigarettes containing the Y-1 strain, that these had been largely withdrawn after proving unpopular with consumers. Mr Woodward said he did not believe that Y-1 has been widely used on unsuspecting guinea pigs in the Third World. Tobacco companies, he pointed out, have no problems in the Third World marketing high-nicotine high-tar cigarettes without having to resort to new technologies. His views were echoed by Mr Nicholas Wall, a professor in environmental protective medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. 'I can't see who would want to go through all the trouble and expense (in the Third World where) there is less reason to use high-nicotine strains of tobacco because there has been less public pressure to reduce tar yields,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- An influential business  leader appealed to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa Wednesday [6  April] to give top priority to early passage by the Diet of the  1994 fiscal budget.    Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of  Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), told a news conference  Hosokawa should take tough action to get the bill through the  Diet. His remark indicated he considers it unavoidable for the  ruling coalition government to vote on the bill, even in the  absence of opposition parties, observers said.    Parliamentary debate on the budget has been stalled over  demands by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party that Hosokawa  disclose details of a 100 million yen loan he accepted from the  scandal-tainted trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin Co. and purchases  of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. made by the  premier in the name of his late father-in-law.    Nagano said the budget committee should resume debate on the  budget quickly and transfer discussions on the scandal to other  panels.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of </F> Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by unidentified Czech  television reporter in Moscow on 8 February, including recording  of comments by Zhirinovskiy, in Russian with superimposed Czech  translation]    [Text] [Reporter] This is the headquarters of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  confirmed to us today that he has indeed been invited to visit  the Czech Republic by the Republican Party of the Czech  Republic. According to Zhirinovskiy, so far they have received  only a fax of the Republicans' invitation, and the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia is waiting for the original of the  invitation to arrive. Answering a question about what he thinks  about negative reactions to the possibility that he would visit  the Czech Republic, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said:    [Zhirinovskiy] If Vaclav Havel feels unhappy about my visit,  then I am also unhappy about the fact that playwrights can  become presidents of some countries. This is not right. I am  not going to write stage plays, I am not going to write the  Cherry Orchard if I am not Chekhov. Why, then, is a playwright  a president? Your country is dying. I can assure you that in  10 years there will be no Moravia, no Sudeten. In 10 years the  entire Czech nation will curse Havel as the Russian people are  cursing Gorbachev. All, including me, used to applaude him --  after Chernenko we saw Gorbachev as a good option. Nowadays we  curse that villain.    The same situation will exist in your country. Vaclav Havel  will die and in 10 years young Czechs will curse him. They will  be forced to speak German, they will be forced to forget their  mother tongue, they will be forced to attend Holy Mass in German  churches and to clean the boots of German officers. This will  be the Czechs' fate in a few years.    We do not want this. We intend to call a congress of  Slavonic nations on 2 and 3 April. We are 300 million, we will  live in our East European community and will not serve Western  Europe.    [Reporter] Answering a question about his views on the  possibility of an air strike against the troops shelling  Sarajevo, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said:    [Zhirinovskiy] We oppose violence. To bomb Serbian towns is  the same as bombing Russian towns. If this terrible thing takes  place we will lodge our protest with the countries whose pilots  get involved in the bombing. The same thing will consequently  happen to their towns -- bombs will fall on towns of the  countries which attack Bosnia.</p>

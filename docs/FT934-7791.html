			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: EDS in multimedia joint venture EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday announced a joint venture with France Telecom and US West, the US regional Bell operator, to provide inter-active financial transaction services to the home and business markets. The joint venture, called Interactive Transaction Partners, marks a further advance in the multimedia ambitions of EDS and the telecoms groups. EDS, which will provide the processing, has taken a 50 per cent stake in the joint venture. France Telecom and US West, which have developed the applications software, each have a 25 per cent stake. The investment plans of ITP are undisclosed. ITP will offer integrated home banking, bill payment and bill presentation services. It will be accessed by phone or personal computer with modem, with the potential for interactive television and screen phones as they enter the market. Mr Neil Marcous, manager of EDS's Electronic Commerce Division, said the joint venture was a further step on the 'information superhighway, integrating more kinds of consumer-oriented relationships'. Services will be available in the US from next April, and may be extended to Europe. The three partners are leaders in the drive to produce multimedia services. Earlier this year British Telecommunications engaged in unsuccessful negotiations to buy EDS, which has operations in more than 30 countries. US West, which serves the Rocky Mountain states and Pacific Northwest, earlier this year made a Dollars 2.5bn investment in the cable entertainment operations of Time Warner, the second largest cable operator in the US and a leading producer of filmed entertainment. With its Minitel project, France Telecom is one of the most pioneering of Europe's public telecommunications operators in the provision of inter-active services. Mr Francois Olibet, president of France Telecom Intelmatique, said that 'seamless multimedia services' like home banking would be the key to future success in the telecoms market.</p>

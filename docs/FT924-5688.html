			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Olympus Optical equity warrants issue well received SUPPLY and demand are coming back into line in the Japanese equity warrants sector of the international bond markets. Yesterday's new issues confirm that the downward trend in coupons in this niche of the market, which had been lagging upward movements in short-term US interest rates and affecting demand, seems to have been reversed. Coupons are now being set at around 2 3/4 per cent, compared with the levels of 1.5 per cent seen a month or so ago. Olympus Optical's Dollars 400m issue, the biggest dollar equity warrants deal for almost two years, went well according to lead-manager Yamaichi International. Traders said that while the name and the price were right, the issue size might hit trading performance. The pick up in equity warrants activity in November looks like continuing, according to bankers, who say the market has the capacity to absorb more issues. Yamaichi International is expected to launch two other dollar equity warrants issues today, for Matsushita Denko which will be looking for Dollars 400m, and Nishimatsu Construction, which wants Dollars 100m. Nippon Express is also expected to tap the market, for Dollars 400m, possibly through Nomura International. The Swiss franc sector of the market is also about to see some more big deals, following those by Daiwa House Industry and Mitsubishi Oil which were launched in mid-November. Sumitomo Rubber is expected to raise SFr200m today, while Sharp is lined up for a SFr500m issue at the start of December. This will equal the biggest previous equity warrants issue by a Japanese company, which was by Kanebo in March 1989. Among the day's other new issues, LTCB International leapt to defend the Inter-American Development Bank's Y50bn five-year bond against widespread allegations of mispricing. LTCB argued that while the terms looked aggressive in Europe, this was because the Eurobond market lagged behind a rally in the domestic yen market after pricing took place. LTCB said it was keeping the syndicate closed to allow co-lead managers the opportunity to sell into the far east where it had found demand. The Nomura International-led Y50bn issue was a done deal targetted at domestic Japanese institutions. From the issuer's point of view, Euroyen borrowing is cheaper and the issuing process simpler than for domestic borrowing. Half of the FFr2.5bn domestic issue from Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer will be syndicated internationally, said Societe Generale, one of the book runners. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reopened an existing Dollars 100m 10-year collared floater for Rabobank Nederland, adding a further Dollars 50m to meet investor demand.</p>

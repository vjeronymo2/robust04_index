			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (22): Privatisation spurs equities market - The improvement in the country's position in the FT500 this year is explained by a combination of a substantial rise in share prices and some large capital increases / Country Analyses - Italy One of the FT500's second division countries, Italy did better in 1993. The list shows a net gain of two Italian companies to a total of 25, with six arrivals against four departures. And of the 19 listed in 1992, 16 moved upwards in the new table. Indeed, three leapt more than 100 places. The improvement in the Italian position is explained by a combination of a substantial rise in share prices and some large capital increases. These more than compensated for the lira's steep depreciation against the dollar, in which company capitalisation is measured, from about L1,300 at the beginning of October 1992 to almost L1,600 at the end of September 1993. Share price indices show that it was, overall, a good year to be invested in Italian equities. When the market closed on September 30 1993, the Comit general index (1972 base=100) stood at 596, compared with 364 a year before. While the rise of 63.7 per cent left the index considerably short of the 908 high reached in May 1986, it regained all the ground lost between the beginning of October 1991, when it stood at 539, and the end of September 1992. A substantial part of the price recovery occurred during autumn 1992, with the Comit general index rising 22.5 per cent in the final quarter to 446. However, the improvement continued strongly in the first nine months of 1993, with the index gaining 33.6 per cent. The MIB general index, which is reset to 1,000 at the beginning of each year, stood at 1,310 on 30 September 1993. Why have Italian stocks excelled? In common with other equity markets, Italy has benefited from the sharp drop in interest rates that has led savers to seek alternatives to bank deposits and government securities. While inflation stood at just over 5 per cent in September 1992, the average interest rate on treasury bills was nearly 18 per cent, and certificates of deposit were yielding around 12 per cent. Real returns have plummeted. In the 12 months to September 1993, rates on treasury bills plunged to just over 9 per cent, and rates on certificates of deposit fell to 8 per cent, while inflation was less than one percentage point lower at a little over 4 per cent. Attilio Ventura, chairman of the Italian Stock Exchange Council, noted the change in savings patterns when he addressed the Federation of European Stock Exchanges at the end of October. 'In the past few months, record amounts of money have flowed into mutual funds. Purchases of Italian shares by these funds have increased from L100bn in the last quarter of 1992 to L700bn in the quarter just ended in September.' Trading volumes and values have reflected the increased interest in equities. In August, September and October 1992, the average daily values of transactions on the Italian stock market were L111bn, L90bn and L156bn respectively. The average daily value in the first nine months of 1993 was L390bn, with high points of L455bn and L574bn in August and September. The Italian government's privatisation programme has helped stimulate the equities market. The start was made with the Amato government's announcement, in September 1992, that Credito Italiano (the retail bank controlled by the IRI state holding corporation) and Nuovo Pignone (the mechanical engineering company owned by the ENI state hydrocarbons holding) were to be sold. Privatisation progress has sometimes faltered. But the recent successful public offer of Credito Italiano shares, the sale of two divisions of IRI's stock market-quoted SME food and retailing group, and the imminent public offers of shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Treasury-controlled IMI financial conglomerate and insurer INA suggest that substantial privatisation will be a reality. The price of Credito Italiano's shares rose sharply when the bank's privatisation was announced, moving from L1,743 to L3,160 during the last quarter of 1992. It subsequently slipped back, but was nevertheless nearly 52 per cent higher at L2,643 on September 30 1993 than it had been 12 months before. The price of Banca Commerciale Italiana's shares rose 71.2 per cent from L2,838 to L4,858 in the year to September 30 1993, an improvement that lifted it to 219th place in the FT500, from 250th in 1992. Even more impressive was the performance of shares in IRI-controlled telecommunications companies, with the prices of Sip and Stet increasing more than 300 per cent to L3,677 and L4,405 respectively. It is not surprising that these two stocks moved firmly up, the former from 149 to 43 (to be ranked the second Italian) and the latter from 136 to 65. Sip and Stet have been among the most active, together accounting for around 11 per cent of total trading value in the year to September 30. According to Mr Ventura, 'the vast privatisation programme introduced by the government will have a triple effect: an increase in the number of Italian shareholders, an increase in the number of companies listed on the exchange and an increase in the float of state-owned companies already listed.' One-third of industrial activity and two-thirds of the banking and financial sectors are controlled directly or indirectly by the state, and state-owned companies account for over a third of the market capitalisation of the Italian stock exchange. But private-sector stocks have not been forgotten. Shareholders in Fiat, whose ordinary shares account for about 9 per cent of total trading, saw the share price bounce back from L3,460 on September 30 1992 to L5,648 one year later. There was also a small improvement in Fiat's FT500 ranking, from 94 to 85. Fiat's Toro insurance subsidiary performed well, improving 70 places in the list from 429 to 359. The other Italian insurers in the FT500 also earned higher rankings. Generali remained the top Italian company, in 20th place, having been ranked 23rd in 1992. (Shareholders saw the price rise from just over L20,000 to nearly L40,000 during the year.) Alleanza, RAS and SAI won higher places, while Fondiaria entered the rankings at 270. State-owned Assitalia, whose shares were subject to a purchase offer at the end of 1993 prior to the privatisation of its INA parent, crept into the rankings at 499. Having slipped ignominiously from the FT500 in 1992, Olivetti makes a reappearance in 363rd place for 1993. However, although shareholders have seen the share price move upwards, it has underperformed against the indices, and they were asked to subscribe to a substantial capital increase during the year, while seeing losses worsen.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 FT500    Company                         Dollars m     Rank   Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Generali (Assicurazioni)          18347.3       20      151  2 SIP                               11512.0       43      223  3 STET                               8790.5       65      171  4 Fiat                               6446.6       85      401  5 Alleanza                           6090.2       90      151  6 RAS                                3442.5      163      151  7 Mediobanca                         3361.4      168      121  8 Banca Commerciale Italiana         2604.7      219      112  9 Credito Italiano                   2184.3      256      112 10 Fondiaria                          2022.8      270      151 11 SAI                                1752.6      309      151 12 Italgas                            1661.8      324      222 13 Pirelli Spa                        1552.5      348      574 14 Toro (Assicurazioni)               1491.6      359      151 15 Olivetti                           1477.5      363      534 16 Gemina                             1476.4      364      131 17 Parmalat                           1409.3      382      451 18 Sirti                              1402.9      383      533 19 Banco Ambrosiano Veneto            1335.3      400      112 20 SME                                1206.3      429      451 21 IFIL                               1063.0      457      171 22 Rinascente (La)                    1062.6      458      491 23 Italcable                          1061.4      460      223 24 Montedison                         1033.8      468      622 25 Assitalia                           932.1      499      151  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

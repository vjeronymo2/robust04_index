			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (9): Gas market's potential - BOC's majority stake in Calcutta-based company The gradual opening up of the Indian economy and the fact that the market for industrial gases in India is growing at a rate of 10 to 15 per cent influenced the decision of BOC Group of the UK to raise its stake in IOL to 51 per cent from about 40 per cent early last year. The remarkable turnaround since 1990 in the workings of IOL, whose headquarters are in Calcutta, also encouraged BOC to take a majority holding in the Indian company. IOL is not only the biggest and most cost-effective producer of industrial and medical gases in the country, but it is also the only gas company with a financial and technological tie-up with an international company. In view of the potential of the Indian market, it is quite likely that other global gas companies will seek a foothold in India. Mr Shashi Shekhar Prasad, managing director of IOL, is, however, not unduly worried about the prospect. What gives the IOL management confidence to take on any future competition is BOC Group's growing support in 'terms of management and technology inputs to the Indian company'. But before BOC made IOL into its subsidiary, Mr Prasad had to take a number of major steps, including the hiving off of non-core businesses, to arrest the decline in its fortunes. He believed that IOL should concentrate on its core businesses: gases and health care products. This led the company to dispose of its welding division to Esab. In the process, IOL's workforce was reduced by nearly 1,600. Mr Prasad realised early that if IOL was to do well in India's new business environment, then it must become cost- effective. Today, at every level of the organisation, there is a desire to control costs. Like many Indian corporations, IOL was highly overmanned when Mr Prasad became managing director in October 1989. But through the introduction of an attractive voluntary retirement scheme and a constant dialogue with all sections of employees, it has been possible to reduce the labour complement from 3,900 to nearly 2,000. 'We could not have achieved so much unless the workers were convinced that what we were doing was good for them, as also for the company. The percentage of wage cost to sales was about 22 per cent in 1989. Today it is about 12 per cent. Ideally, it should be 7 to 8 per cent. We still have a long way to go,' says Mr Prasad. From the beginning, the new management made a relentless drive to upgrade gas-making technologies and modernise all IOL plants. The access to BOC group technologies has been of great help. As Mr Prasad says: 'The company is now using contemporary air separation technology to make 65 per cent of the gases. We were at the zero level in 1987. My target is to make 100 per cent gases through that technology route by 1997. We also have a lot of leeway to make up in cylinder filling and distribution of gases.' IOL, according to management sources, will need five to six years to catch up with BOC standards. But already it offers its customers 'tailor-designed new applications of gases, customised on-site gas plants and high purity special gases.' As Mr Prasad sees it, demand from the Indian food, chemical and electronics sectors for nitrogen will grow rapidly. IOL's easy access to application technologies from BOC will prove advantageous. The continuing modernisation of manufacturing facilities and rationalisation of labour are well reflected in IOL's balance sheet. In the six months to September 30, IOL's net profit of Rs40m nearly doubled over the corresponding period of the previous year. Mr Prasad thinks that it should be possible for IOL to invest Rs1bn every two years in new projects. IOL will also be ready to set up gas plants as joint ventures with the major gas users.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most experts agree that adequate nutrition is vital to helping older individuals remain independent, avoiding premature nursing home placement or using expensive health care services. Appropriate nutrition promotes health, prevents or delays the onset of disease, aids in recovery from illness and trauma, reduces incidence of hospitalization and rehospitalization, helps delay further declines in already functionally impaired individuals, fosters continued independent living in the community, and even plays a role in helping individuals who are terminally ill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on Aging have important responsibilities for promoting good nutrition and preventing malnutrition in the nation's older population. This priority area, which calls for the establishment of a National Resource and Policy Center on Nutrition and Aging, underscores the need for better knowledge, better information, and better trained personnel to better serve malnourished older persons. Under the Older Americans Act, AoA and the aging and nutrition service network of 57 State Units on Aging, 670 Area Agencies on Aging, 224 Title VI Grantees, and 15,000 nutrition sites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve approximately 243,150,000 meals to approximately 3.5 million people. Yet a study by the Urban Institute (November-1993) indicates that although community nutrition programs are reaching some of the at-risk older population, only about one-third of those in need are currently being served and that these programs are stretched to their financial limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recognizing both the importance of good nutrition for all older Americans and that nutrition services are an integral component of home and community based long term care services, the Assistant Secretary on Aging has established a Nutrition/Malnutrition Initiative that focuses on the prevention of malnutrition and food insecurity and the promotion of good nutritional practices. The Initiative places responsibility on AoA to undertake four interrelated strategies:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Increasing the awareness of consumers, providers, administrators, and policymakers regarding the importance of good nutrition among the aging population and its role in home and community based long term care services;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Providing leadership among various agencies and organizations including the aging and nutrition networks in promoting a nutrition agenda for the future;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Developing and promoting direct prevention and intervention strategies which will enhance the nutritional status of older individuals and nutrition programs at all levels; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Developing public policies which will ensure greater access to appropriate food and nutrition services for older individuals, especially low-income, minority, and those at nutritional risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration on Aging and the National Resource and Policy Center on Nutrition and Aging, to be established under this priority area, will work through a Cooperative Agreement in implementing the Nutrition/Malnutrition Initiative to promote and improve nutritional and health status for older Americans. The Center will focus on the following three activities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Information Dissemination: Applications should include effective methods for sharing the latest thinking, methods and findings regarding nutrition/malnutrition and the elderly with the Aging Network, service providers, researchers, educators, private industry and the public. The Center will also be responsible for developing a media campaign to educate consumers, providers, the private sector and policy makers about the issues and interrelationships of adequate nutrition, malnutrition, hunger and food insecurity on health, independence, and quality of life for older individuals. Applications must describe what outcomes and impacts are anticipated as a result of the information dissemination efforts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Training and Technical Assistance: Applications should describe how the Center will assist agencies in the Aging Network and other organizations and agencies that work in the field of nutrition and aging to develop effective strategies for preventing malnutrition and promoting good nutrition at the community level. Such activities should include encouraging leadership within communities to identify and strengthen community supports; developing strategies to enable these entities to intervene in innovative ways, developing direct prevention and intervention strategies, and; encouraging new partnerships with the private sector. Applications must describe what outcomes and impacts are anticipated as a result of the training and technical assistance efforts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Knowledge Building and Policy Analysis: Applications should describe how the proposed Center proposes to assist AoA and the Aging Network through the conduct of research for improving the nutritional well being of older adults particularly the vulnerable and at risk populations. Research is to be limited to short term studies with practical and useful products that develop, enhance, or promote knowledge of and solutions to issues surrounding malnutrition and nutrition with respect to older people. Applications must describe what outcomes and impacts are anticipated as a result of the research and policy development efforts. Applicants should have the capacity to meet the need for short-term policy analysis on topics relating to nutrition/malnutrition and the elderly. Based on a high level of knowledge and information synthesis, applicants should propose possible subjects for policy analysis but also demonstrate that they possess the capacity to respond flexibly and quickly to such needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AoA and the organization/institution selected to serve as the National Policy and Resource Center on Nutrition and Aging will work cooperatively in the development of its scope of work and agenda of major events and activities. (However, applicants are expected to propose an agenda for the first and subsequent years based on their assessment of salient issues). AoA will share with the Center information on other federally supported projects and activities relevant to malnutrition, nutrition, and the elderly. The Center shall have a Director with an appropriate background and qualifications in aging and policy studies who shall devote a minimum of 50% of her/his time to this position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AoA expects to fund the National Policy and Resource Center on Nutrition and Aging through a cooperative agreement award for a period of three years. The federal share for the first year will be $300,000 with second and third year federal funding at $400,000 per year. The deadline date for submission of applications under this priority is October 7, 1994. Eligible applicants for the Center are public and private non-profit organizations with knowledge and experience regarding nutrition, malnutrition, nutrition programs and nutritional needs of the elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Blueprint for an Aging Society  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1&blank;National Academy on Aging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administration on Aging is soliciting proposals, under a new competition, for the continuation of the National Academy on Aging, which was established with funding from the Administration on Aging in FY 1991. The Academy has and will continue to serve as a valuable source of knowledge and guidance on the critical future issues shaping a blueprint for an aging society. It has brought together leaders in American society to discuss and debate emerging aging trends and issues, as well as strategies regarding how they and their organizations can better meet the challenges inherent in the graying of America. The Academy has achieved national recognition as an impartial national forum for policy analysis and debate on the major policy issues of our current and future aging society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leaders and decision makers are increasingly aware of the challenges in responding knowledgeably and effectively to the growth and change in our nation's older population. Leaders at national, state, and community levels_ from public, private, and voluntary sectors alike_must become more cognizant of the transformations now taking place toward an aging society, and be able to provide wise and timely decisions affecting the elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

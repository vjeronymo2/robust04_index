Procedure for the Appeal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The Senior Credit Review Committee of the field office with jurisdiction over the conservatorship shall normally decide the appeal of the non-defaulting commercial borrower. However, if the adverse credit decision under appeal was made by a field office's Senior Review Committee, or by a person or entity at a level of authority above the field office Senior Credit Review Committee, then the person or entity at the next level of authority above the initial decision maker, as determined by the RTC's delegations of authority, shall decide the appeal of the non-defaulting borrower. (The person or entity deciding the appeal is hereafter referred to as the ``hearer of the appeal.'') <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must file an appeal, in writing, with the hearer of the appeal within 60 calendar days of receipt of the notice described in subparagraph IV.B above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must state the grounds for the appeal. The non-defaulting commercial borrower may submit only documentary evidence in support of the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The hearer of the appeal shall make a good faith effort to decide the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal and all documentation necessary to act on the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) (a) The record of an appeal shall consist of the written appeal and documentary evidence submitted by the non-defaulting commercial borrower and any other evidence and information within the possession or control of the RTC that relates to the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have the right to review any documentation submitted by such borrower, along with the appeal or prior to the filing of the appeal, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the RTC's records. The hearer of the appeal may extend the period for deciding the appeal of such reasonable time as may be necessary to permit any such review of the documentation submitted by the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The hearer of the appeal may reverse an adverse credit decision if the hearer determines that (a) the extension of credit is likely to reduce a conservatorship's overall losses, or (b) the extension of credit would not be likely to increase the conservatorship's overall losses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Odinga, fighter for Kenyan independence and democracy: Obituary Kenya has lost one of its few remaining national leaders with the death of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, 82, the country's veteran opposition leader, after suffering a heart attack at his home outside Nairobi on Thursday, his family announced yesterday. Late in life, Kenya's campaign for multi-party democracy galvanised him with the same conviction with which he had fought for the end of colonial rule three decades before. In between, Odinga's independence of spirit, and an irrepressible habit of speaking his mind, earned him spells in jail and in the political wilderness. His exclusion from power, however, did not dent his popular following. He could have been Kenya's first president. While Jomo Kenyatta, the country's founding father, was still in colonial jails, Odinga spurned covert offers from the British to groom him for power. Kenyatta rewarded his loyalty with the vice-presidency after independence in 1963. But disenchantment with the way Kenyatta began to amass illicit wealth and policy differences led Odinga to resign from the government in 1966. Branded a communist for his close ties to China and his opposition to a pro-western foreign policy, he disagreed with Kenyatta's decision to purchase land from white settlers for the African population, instead of expropriating it. He left the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu) party to found the Kenya People's Union, which was soon proscribed. He spent the late 1960s in prison and thereafter endured long spells under house arrest. Kanu made several attempts to lure him back to the fold, but Odinga's strong speeches denouncing corruption and abuse of public office rendered any rapprochement impossible. Disillusionment with Daniel arap Moi's government, and a campaign for multi-party democracy, gave Odinga a second lease of life. He was among the reformist politicians who founded the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), the focal point for the pro-democracy campaign that culminated in the legalisation of opposition parties in 1991. Ford, however, was unable to sustain its unity. Odinga, was a member of Kenya's second largest tribe, the Luo, and his rivalry with Kenneth Matiba, of the larger Kikuyu tribe, eventually splintered the movement. The division of the opposition along ethnic lines opened the way for President Moi's re-election in December 1992. Kenya had a tumultuous first year of democracy, with corruption scandals rocking the government and Odinga, leader of the opposition in parliament, spearheading the campaign for good governance. His reputation, however, suffered a fatal blow last year when he admitted to receiving political funds from a local banking group that was shut down for fraud and embezzlement. Several leading members of his party, Ford-Kenya, resigned in protest. Perhaps sensing that his end was drawing near, Odinga became a conciliatory figure in his final months of life. He praised President Moi and spoke of the need to maintain national unity in the face of mounting ethnic violence. He never explained his sudden change of heart.</p>

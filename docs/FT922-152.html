			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Stainless steel deal with Avesta AVESTA, the Swedish steel company, and British Steel announced yesterday they intend to create Europe's largest stainless steel group through the merger of almost all their stainless steel production facilities and distribution networks in a Pounds 199m deal. The new company, called Avesta Sheffield with headquarters in Stockholm, will have initially an annual turnover of about SKr12.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn), production of 600,000 tonnes of stainless steel a year and employ 9,000 people. Net assets are valued at Pounds 547m. It is hoped to begin operations by the end of the year. But this is subject to the deal being approved by the European Commission and Avesta shareholders. Under the deal British Steel will hold 40 per cent of the equity in the new company while the other main shareholders are Swedish companies which hold a majority stake in Avesta - NCC, the Swedish construction group, with 25.1 per cent; Axel Johnson, the trading company, with 7.5 per cent; and AGA, the industrial gases group, with 7.2 per cent. The group's first chief executive will be Mr Per Molin, currently Avesta's chief executive. Mr David Grieves, British Steel vice-chairman, will chair the company. The merger will involve Avesta issuing 55.3m new shares worth Pounds 164m to British Steel in return for its stainless steel business. In addition, British Steel will receive a 5 per cent loan note amounting to Pounds 35m from the new group repayable in instalments over the next four years. British Steel's stainless operations had turnover of Pounds 458m last year, 60 per cent from outside the UK. It has production plants in Sheffield and Panteg, south Wales, and distribution facilities in the UK, continental Europe and North America. Avesta, with sales of Pounds 697m, last year is solely a stainless steel producer. Mr Molin said Avesta Sheffield should benefit from an annual Pounds 40m costs savings by the middle of the 1990s. He said there would be a 'sharp cut' in the cost per ton of stainless steel produced. The stainless steel market is forecast to grow at an annual 4 per cent in the 1990s after a 5-6 per cent increase in the late 1980s. Mr Molin emphasised that the new company would benefit from having a strong capital base, a wide sales organisation around the world, the high utilisation of production capacity, and a complementary product range.</p>

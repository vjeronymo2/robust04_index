			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Scalfaro To Be `Insistent' on </F> Employment"]    [Text] (ANSA) Cagliari, April 28 -- President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro said he would be "attentive and insistent" on  employment issues during the term of the government expected to  be ushered in by his meeting at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) this afternoon  with the leader of the conservative coalition that won the  elections, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi.    Talking to reporters at the inauguration of the Cagliari  Fair, Scalfaro was asked if Berlusconi's word would be enough to  allay conflict of interest concerns. "I cannot say before we  have had a talk," was his reply.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: West German output up 2.5% Industrial production in western Germany rose by 2.5 per cent in April compared with the previous month, with the main sectors showing signs of emerging from the recession, the Federal statistics office reported yesterday. The sharpest increases occured in mining, which rose by 6.5 per cent over the same period. Electricity and gas grew by 4.5 per cent. Even in the manufacturing sector, one of the areas worst hit by the recession, there was an increase of 3 per cent. The combined industrial production figures for March and April also compare favourably over the corresponding period of 1993, with overall growth rising by 1.9 per cent, and the manufacturing sector increasing by 2.1 per cent. However, utilities fell by 4.5 per cent, largely due to weather conditions and high prices. Dutch consumer borrowing rose 7.7 per cent year-on-year to Fl 3.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the first quarter of 1994, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Spain's trade deficit widened to Pta273.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) in April from Pta163.276bn in March and was up 30.2 per cent year-on-year, the Economics Ministry said.</p>

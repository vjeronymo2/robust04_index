			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0003 GMT on 20 February in its 75-minute-long  "Discussion" program, which begins at 0000 GMT, carries a  27-minute live interview with Komeito General Secretary Yuichi  Ichikawa on the cabinet reshuffle Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa is said to be planning. The interview is conducted by  NHK commentator Takashi Tamamoto and Tokyo University Professor  Takeshi Sasaki.    Tamamoto first asks Ichikawa for his view on why Hosokawa is  thinking of a cabinet reshuffle now.    Ichikawa says: "One reason is that with such major questions  as the rice market, political reform, tax reductions and tax  system reform, and budget formulation having been taken care of,  the government thinks it has cleared a big hurdle. Another is  the relationship between the top leader -- the prime minister --  and the chief cabinet secretary -- his housekeeper or assistant.  Of course they are likely to have differences of view, they are  only human. But if these differences are intentionally brought  to the attention of the public, it causes friction within the  government and the ruling coalition. The prime minister wants  to bring unity -- or centrifugal power -- into the cabinet now  that he has surmounted the big hurdle."    Ichikawa adds: "But Mr. Takemura is an intellectual man. I  don't think he will threaten to quit the cabinet if someone else  becomes chief cabinet secretary."    At 0006 GMT, Professor Sasaki says some senior coalition  politicians doubt the wisdom of implementing a large-scale  reshuffle with the Diet deliberations on the budget bill set to  begin soon. He asks Ichikawa to comment on this point of view.    Ichikawa says: "I don't think the prime minister is thinking  about effecting a big-scale reshuffle."    He adds: "This is a problem created by Mr. Takemura  personally."    He is then asked if there is any possibility that Sakigake  [Harbinger] might drop out of the coalition as a result of such  a reshuffle. Ichikawa answers that it is not a matter over  which the party should quit the coalition.    At 0010 GMT, Tamamoto refers to remarks Ichikawa has made  that the coalition parties should merge and become a new party.  He is asked if this is the only way the coalition can retain  power at the next general election.    Ichikawa says: "Unless a new party is formed, there is no  point in having worked so hard to adopt the new electoral  system."    Tamamoto points out that the Social Democratic Party of  Japan  [SDPJ], Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party [SDP] appear  to be considering a merger without Komeito or Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and asks Ichikawa to comment.    Ichikawa says it is important for the SDPJ to decide its  basic stand on policy on such matters as national security. He  says it is meaningless to talk about forming a new party until  such basic policy matters are decided. Once the policy matters  are decided, however, he says they can be discussed within the  framework of a new party combining all coalition partners.    At 0016 GMT, the moderator turns to rumors Komeito may  cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] at the next  general election. Ichikawa says: "We are not thinking about  cooperating with the LDP."    At 0019 GMT, Tamamoto asks Ichikawa about the timing of any  cabinet reshuffle. He says: "I would like to think it will be  sometime after the political reform issues are cleared and  before the Diet starts to deliberate the budget bills."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Petrovich Korovkin, president of </F> Izdat-Bank, by Yelena Levina; place and date not given: "Keeping  Manuscripts in the Bank!"]    [Text] There were many banks in Russia prior to the  revolution: land banks, banks for the gentry, industrial banks,  trade banks... We have enough banks today too. But a bank for  the publishing sector is a unique phenomenon. The major  publishers of the past--Sytin, Sveshnikov--relied on their  private capital. And indeed, Izdat-Bank is the one and only  financial institution of publishers today in the world. Why do  they have a bank? With this question we began our conversation  with Ivan Petrovich Korovkin, president of Izdat-Bank.    [Korovkin] The entire old system of banking services  collapsed in five years, and the mass media confronted the  problem: With what do we go to the market? Usually people go  there with their intelligence and a ruble in their pocket. But  where is the poor publisher to obtain money? So the concept was  born of establishing a sector bank. The founders were the  Russian State Committee on the Press, Ukraine State Committee  for Publications, Republic of Belarus Ministry of Information,  MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA publishing house, and others. They attempted  to take into account the specific interests of the sector,  developed a mechanism for supporting publication programs,  created conditions for protecting the interests of investors,  and gradually the editorial offices of 400 newspapers and  magazines began opening up current accounts with us.    [Levina] What about the banks that used to hold their money?    [Korovkin] Some 114 banks were just about all at once  deprived of steady clients--this does not come easy. We are  trying to justify such a decision on the part of editorial  offices and provide high-quality service. According to data from  the Reyting agency, our bank is in the top 100 of Russia's  largest banks. The annual balance-sheet turnover of Izdat-Bank  is just short of half a trillion rubles. But this is not the  main service we provide. Our assistance has enabled publishers  to safeguard themselves from landslide devastation and  bankruptcy. We have made conscientious outlays, and if a choice  was presented whether to aid "our own" or "others," preference  was shown to those connected with printing and publishing. They  were afforded credits on preferential terms. We do not receive  payment for opening current and settlement accounts. The  interest rate for deposits in our bank is 300-310 percent. A  client has the right to withdraw a portion of his investment at  any time.    [Levina] It is said about banks that they are the  circulatory  system of the economy. Our economy is gravely ill. Are the banks  not at least somewhat to blame for this?    [Korovkin] Banks constitute the only genuine market element  of our economy. And for some reason it is they the state is  ruining, choking them with taxes, leaving them no funds for  investments. And this is one reason for the current wave of bank  collapses. A second reason is reciprocal nonpayments. Banks are  bearing tremendous losses due to untimely return of extended  credits--they themselves are turning into debtors. The  delinquent indebtedness of Izdat-Bank has increased 5.7-fold as  of 1 January 1994, although the bank is replete with  professionals who used to work in the Ministry of Finance, USSR  Gosbank [State Bank]...    [Levina] Sometimes it seems that all our bankers and other  prominent individuals in the business world--they all originate  in the ministries...    [Korovkin] A misplaced irony. The system of bank formation  we  have in Russia is just now being established. We are sending  young and willing specialists for instruction and on-the-job  training in the United States, Austria, and Japan.    [Levina] Forgive me, but what is the benefit to us  journalists by virtue of the fact that there is an Izdat-Bank in  Russia?    [Korovkin] We opened up accounts for the families of  journalists who died in Moscow during the events of 3 and 4  October--accounts of one million rubles per family. Through  financing we have supported the international book fair. We  allocated funds for publication of the Russian-French magazine  VIS-A-VIS. Until the Fund for Financial Support for Needy and  Novice Authors is established, writers and journalists need not  be ashamed to turn to us for assistance. Right now we are  materially supporting the Russian classicist Leonid Leonov, who  is 95 years old. He continues to work. He is writing a  philosophical novel and is in critical need of funds.    [Levina] To the best of our knowledge, you yourself are now  in need of money?    [Korovkin] I would not put it so strongly. We assumed  responsibility for the accounting operations regarding budget  financing of newspapers and magazines. We tried to establish  control over the use of these funds and get an effective  arrangement for knocking these funds loose from the Ministry of  Finance. And then--we encountered opposition from officials of  the Operations Directorate of the Russian Central Bank. They  have been doing everything possible to impede the transfer of  budget funds to the legal disposal of the sector bank.  Intervention by the Ministry of Finance, the government, and  even the president himself--have failed to produce a positive  result. The Central Bank usurped the right to dispose of your  money and ours. And this is R70 billion. Will we get this money?    [Levina] And after you--will we journalists get any money?  And after us--will our readers get their newspapers and  magazines? At the end of this rhetorical question let us not put  a period, but an ellipsis...</p>

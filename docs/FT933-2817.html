			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Athens dips after government resigns The resignation of the Greek government last week and the subsequent decision to call an election for October 10 led to an immediate flight out of equities in Athens. The selling has since stabilised, but last Thursday's sharp decline saw the market record the largest fall on the week, in dollar terms, among the indices included in the IFC's table. In spite of the decline, Carnegie International's Greek analysts remain reasonably confident about the future direction of equities. 'The present consensus is that the index might move down as low as 750 (it is currently moving in the 765 area) before consistent buying interest returns,' they comment. 'The banking sector, however, is likely to remain weak as questions are now being raised over whether the Commercial Bank's outstanding rights issue will be fully taken up; while Credit Bank's capital increase is once again hanging in the balance.' The downtrend in Greece was the only negative factor in an otherwise strong European region, with Turkey once more impressing investors with the week's best gain. Trading activity in Istanbul has been fuelled by a regulation approved last month making mutual funds tradeable on the stock market. Schroder Securities currently forecasts a continuation of the rally, with occasional dips for profit-taking, and sees the index advancing to the 14,000 to 15,000 region by the year-end, from the present 13,000 level. Latin America's emerging markets were relatively subdued last week, with only Brazil and, to a lesser extent, Argentina standing out. Meanwhile, Mexico has been steadily losing ground over worries surrounding the successful passage through the US congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement. While President Bill Clinton has expressed his full support for the agreement, and many observers expect it to come into force, as planned, by January, certain doubts remain in some investors' minds. Although Peru is not included among the IFC data, the equity market there has, according to Latin American Securities in London, been the second best performer in dollar terms this year to date after Brazil with a rise of some 90 per cent. Latin American Securities says that one of the significant features of the Peru stock market has been its improved liquidity this year, with some 20 companies having a trading frequency of 90 per cent, compared with just 10 at the end of 1992. Among the Asian markets, Malaysia fell back throughout the week, although it still shows a good performance over the year to date. In a recent review of the market, Wardley James Capel forecasts that Malaysia will continue to attract overseas funds, given the growth in second-quarter GDP (around 10 per cent) and the good interim results. Most analysts expect the bull run to continue ahead of the October budget.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Dollar terms                    No. of           Sep 10      % Change      % Change Market             stocks             1993     over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina            (11)           728.99          +2.0         +25.7 Brazil               (44)           233.43          +5.0         +86.7 Chile                (20)           435.13          +0.1          +4.0 Colombia*             (8)           484.12          +0.9         +13.9 Mexico               (58)           731.58          -0.5          +8.2 Venezuela**           (8)           475.91          -2.1          -8.4 East Asia South Korea***      (130)            95.46          +2.3          -2.8 Philippines          (11)           189.76          +3.2         +42.1 Taiwan, China****    (76)            80.84          +1.3          +9.6 South Asia India*****           (61)            91.35          +1.3          -2.5 Indonesia******      (31)            97.38          +3.8         +65.9 Malaysia             (61)           235.24          -2.4         +43.8 Pakistan*******       (8)           219.44          +0.4          +9.6 Thailand             (52)           277.05          +0.6         +20.3 Euro/Mid East Greece               (17)           226.20          -8.1         +15.8 Jordan                (5)           159.53          +2.6         +36.5 Portugal             (16)           114.53          +3.9         +48.5 Turkey********       (31)           154.82         +12.0        +131.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Local currency terms                    No. of           Sep 10      % Change      % Change Market             stocks             1993     over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina            (11)       447,326.97          +2.0         +25.9 Brazil               (44)    33,201,766.36          +9.5      +1,492.1 Chile                (20)           709.27          -0.3         +10.6 Colombia*             (8)           693.95          +1.2         +13.5 Mexico               (58)           981.36          -0.6          +8.1 Venezuela**           (8)         1,033.43          -1.5         +10.7 East Asia South Korea***      (130)           101.29          +2.3          -0.4 Philippines          (11)           253.48          +3.2         +56.8 Taiwan, China****    (76)            80.94          +1.2         +16.1 South Asia India*****           (61)           101.02          +1.2          +5.8 Indonesia******      (31)           111.21          +3.8         +69.1 Malaysia             (61)           220.81          -2.6         +39.9 Pakistan*******       (8)           296.48          +0.4         +27.9 Thailand             (52)           276.77          +0.7         +18.7 Euro/Mid East Greece               (17)           352.42          -7.9         +23.8 Jordan                (5)           226.42          +2.1         +36.5 Portugal             (16)           128.50          +1.4         +64.8 Turkey********       (31)           846.13         +11.4        +215.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

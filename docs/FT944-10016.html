			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / GEC appointment adds to speculation on succession Speculation over the likely succession at GEC, the UK's biggest electrical and electronics company, intensified yesterday after Mr Peter Gershon was appointed managing director of GEC-Marconi, the group's most profitable subsidiary. Mr Gershon, 47, is managing director of GPT, the telecommunications equipment joint venture between GEC and Siemens of Germany. He will replace Mr Roy Gardner, 48, who has been appointed finance director of British Gas. Mr Gardner will remain a non-executive director for the period of GEC's bid for the submarine builder VSEL. Mr Gershon, Mr Gardner and Mr James Cronin, 56, managing director of GEC Alsthom, were appointed to the GEC main board in July this year. This suggested that the choice of successor to Lord Weinstock, who retires in two years at the age of 72, would be made from the three newcomers together with Mr David Newlands, 47, GEC finance director, and Mr Simon Weinstock, 42, commercial director and Lord Weinstock's son. City observers believe Mr Gershon is now favourite after an energetic performance at GPT where he has cut costs and improved profitability. He took over the telecommunications company after working for the computer manufacturer ICL and as managing director of STC Communications. He was not prepared to comment yesterday. Mr Gardner said his decision to move from GEC had been taken several months ago. He had a number of offers, chiefly in electronics businesses, but had decided to make a clean break. He said the succession at GEC had been a consideration, but that similar opportunities existed at British Gas. His appointment was greeted with little surprise in the City yesterday. British Gas shares slipped 5 1/2 p to 291p as analysts cautiously welcomed the appointment. Stockbrokers are relieved that British Gas has brought in a director from outside as further evidence of the drive to change the corporate culture. Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, is himself a recent arrival at British Gas and has pledged to convert the company from the inward-looking mentality of a former nationalised monopoly to a fast-moving international player. 'Roy Gardner's line management and overseas experience will obviously be useful, but he's unlikely to be able to change the core of the company or its performance,' said Mr Steven Turner, energy analyst at Nomura, the Japanese securities house. However, Mr Gardner is well respected in the City for his efforts in restructuring STC. See Lex</p>

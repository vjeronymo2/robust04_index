			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Rome RAI Uno Television Network in  Italian at 2215 GMT on 8 March carries a 15-minute interview  with Pact for Italy Leader Mario Segni by Bruno Vespa, in a  special election program. The program also includes a  five-minute talk by pundit Giovanni Sartori about the meaning of  the term "liberal-democracy."    Mario Segni starts by saying that Vespa and the media as a  whole does not seem to realize that as far as the  first-past-the-post part of the general elections are concerned,  the Pact for Italy is a unified alliance of which the Italian  Popular Party [PPI], and the Italian Republican Party [PRI], are  members. He explaines that for the purposes of the proportional  representation part of the election, the alliance will split in  two: the PPI and the Segni Pact, which includes the PRI among  its members.    Quoting the Pact for Italy manifesto, Vespa asks Segni how  he  intends to create a million new jobs over three years. Segni  answers that unemployment is largely linked to the overall  economic climate and that the important thing is to aim for zero  inflation. He says that the state's role is to draw up  large-scale plans for investing in infrastructure, and that Pact  for Italy experts have calculated that a 100,000 billion lire  investment over three years, largely paid for by the private  sector, would enable the government to rebuild the economy and  create jobs. Unemployed people would also be encouraged to  invest in small businesses.    Segni says that the Pact for Italy would not reduce taxes  immediately, because the public deficit would have to be taken  care of before this became possible. The Pact for Italy would  not, however, increase the tax burden. More money would be  raised by fighting tax evasion which would make it possible to  reduce taxes in the longer term.    Segni says that free health care should continue to be  provided for poorer people, but that private health care and  pension plans should be encouraged. Segni also reiterates that  his party would not join a government coalition with either the  Left or the Right, and in particular that there is no basis for  believing that the pact would rather arrange a deal with Achille  Occhetto's Progressive Alliance after the elections.</p>

His six offensive rebounds helped lead New York  to a 21-5 advantage in that department.  </P> <P> The fourth game will be Friday night at Madison Square Garden, and if the  Knicks win, the fifth and deciding game would be Sunday at Boston Garden, where  the Celtics have beaten the Knicks 26 consecutive times since Feb. 29, 1984.  </P> <P> Ewing had 21 points and 16 rebounds at halftime, but he committed his fourth  foul early in the third quarter and left with the score tied, 60-60.  </P> <P> But the Knicks outscored Boston, 21-19, and took an 81-79 lead into the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> Ewing returned and scored the first five points of the fourth quarter, giving  New York a seven-point lead.  </P> <P> The Knicks expanded the margin to 91-83 with six minutes left, but the Celtics  closed to 100-99 on a free throw by Reggie Lewis with 29 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Kenny Walker hit a jump shot from 15 feet for a three-point lead with 7.6  seconds left.  </P> <P> On the Celtics' final possession, Larry Bird missed an uncontested three-point  attempt.  </P> <P> Bird finished with 31 points, Dennis Johnson 18 and Kevin McHale 17 for the  Celtics. Gerald Wilkins had 15 points for New York.  </P></p>

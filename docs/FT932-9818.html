			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: Disastrously cocksure Sir, Another refreshing stream of opinionated political cynicism from Joe Rogaly: 'A few (sic) local authorities changing political colour means little now that the Tories have stripped so much power from the counties' ('Where comedy is king', May 7). The government's disastrous electoral results that very day stem from many factors. One was a cocksure assumption that ministers could trample over local democracy with impunity.

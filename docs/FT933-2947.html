			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Arts: The saga of 'Anna Karenina' - Ballet The albatross round the neck of our ballet companies, the horror in the East Wing, the gun pointed at classical dance's temples, is the three-act ballet. Down at the box office they know the ghastly truth: an evening of three one-act ballets will keep the audience away in droves. A full-length piece - and never mind its merits, just concentrate on the title - will fill the house. This preposterous situation is national (and increasingly international), and it is owed, I suspect, to the Royal Ballet's success in making the old 'classics' popular with audiences, and in then producing choreographers - Ashton, Cranko, MacMillan, Bintley - able to make valuable extensions of the genre. With emulative snobbery, other troupes have, since the 1950s, led audiences to believe that three acts of choreography is better than three separate works, that big is beautiful, and that packaging is more important than content. Our ballet companies are now Frankensteins, hostage to their evening-long monster. Large or small in forces and funding, they produce what their public paymasters want. Literature, opera, can be gutted for theme, irrespective of the original, provided that the title is well-enough known. In the darkest days of Stalinism, Soviet ballet found a creative refuge in such policies: today's imperatives are those of financial rather than artistic survival. And ballet is dying on its carefull -pointed feet because of this. Where the three-acters of Ashton, Cranko, MacMillan, extended and developed the idea of the large-scale piece, today's offering are in the main facile, safe, unthink-ing. Scottish Ballet under the choreographic direction of its founder, Peter Darrell, produced work that sought to show the possibilities of the form: his Sun into Darkness and Mary, Queen of Scots (with a brave score by Thea Musgrave), were adventurous. The company's latest acquisition, Andre Prokovsky's Anna Karenina is predictable. Prokovsky has produced several long ballets: his programme biography lists The Three Musketeers, Dr Zhivago, The Great Gatsby, La Traviata, Macbeth and Victoria (whether station, queen, or Australian state, I know not). Anna Karenina, which dates from 1979, is what one might expect, given the score (a Tchaikovsky hot-pot), the theme (parts of a Tolstoyan skeleton), and the designer (Peter Farmer at his most vaporous). The action amounts to 'unhappy married woman takes lover and chucks herself under train'. The choreography does what it does, and has to provide ensembles - a skating scene; a ball replete with dancers failing to convince us they are aristos; peasants romping - to give Anna and Vronsky time to change from one dull outfit to another. (Vronsky is got up like Prince Charming: Anna goes to a dressmaker who has been traumatised by seeing Georgiadis's designs for Manon.) The rest of the cast tread dutifully round the edges of the action. It is all well-meant and rather musty. I could see, during Tuesday night's performance at the Kings Theatre, Edinburgh, that with the artistry of Galina Samsova (now director of the company), the role of Anna - which Samsova created - might be fascinating. Noriko Ohara's Anna did not convince me at any moment, nor did Robert Hampton's Vronsky. Vladislav Bubnov, a recent recruit from the Bolshoi Ballet, showed in a couple of brief interludes a freedom and spaciousness of style that were a reproach to every other body on stage. Scottish Ballet performs Anna Karenina on tour to Aberdeen, Liverpool, Hull, Sheffield, Inverness, until the end of October</p>

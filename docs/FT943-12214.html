			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Austria sells remaining 26% stake in chip maker Austria Mikro Systeme International (AMS), a specialised computer chip manufacturer, has become the first company in Austria to be completely privatised following the sale of the state's remaining 26 per cent holding. According to Kleinwort Benson, which acted as international agent, Austria raised Dollars 25.2m through the private placement of 450,000 AMS shares at Sch608 each to domestic and international institutional investors. It also sold 75,000 shares to employees and 125,000 shares to a private, foreign investor for an undisclosed sum. Kleinwort Benson said the institutional tranche was over three times subscribed and the bulk went to international investors. A portion of the shares was placed in the US under Rule 144a. Yesterday AMS shares closed at Sch640 in Vienna, up Sch10 from Friday. The initial public offering for AMS was completed one year ago when 74 per cent of its equity was sold to international and domestic investors. It was the first sale of a majority shareholding by Austria.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The so-called "bolder-than-most" rapist pleaded guilty Monday to 12 felony  charges and will be sentenced to 50 years in prison.  </P> <P> Alvin Ray Quarles, 26, of Paradise Hills pleaded guilty to four counts of rape,  six counts of burglary with intent to commit a felony and two counts of robbery  as part of a crime spree that began June 9, 1985, and ended a year ago.  </P> <P> As part of a plea-bargain agreement, 50 other charges against Quarles were  dropped. The agreement calls for him to be sentenced to 50 years in state  prison, and he will be denied probation, Superior Court Judge Bernard Revak  said.  </P> <P> The judge set sentencing for March 6.  </P> <P> Quarles was nicknamed the "bolder-than-most" rapist because he entered homes or  motel rooms and raped women at knifepoint while their husbands, boyfriends or  roommates were in the room. He sometimes forced the men to watch the rape or  ordered them to go into another room by threatening to kill the women.  </P> <P> Quarles' trial had been set for Thursday. If he had gone to trial and been  convicted of each count, the maximum sentence would have been more than 200  years.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Lewis said the plea bargain reflects Quarles'  criminal activities with all 12 of his victims. Quarles will have his sentence  reviewed after he serves 20 years. The district attorney's office will not  oppose the review hearing, but will oppose any reduction in the sentence, Lewis  said.  </P> <P> Quarles was arrested Feb. 22, 1988, in National City after he was found  prowling around a motel.  </P> <P> The rapes occurred in East San Diego, Old Town, Mission Bay, Pacific Beach and  Mission Hills.  </P></p>

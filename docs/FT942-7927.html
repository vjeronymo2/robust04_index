			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bond yields, which fell 13 basis points last week, are likely to decline further this week due to the Bank of Japan's continued easy stance on short-term money market rates. The central bank still remains cautious on the economy and the negative effects of a higher yen on corporate profits. The bank said last week that economic conditions had stopped deteriorating but there was no evidence yet of a recovery. Such concerns are expected to be confirmed this week, with industrial production figures indicating a fall in output in April, and pointing to a decline in the second quarter. Retail sales figures for April and March household spending are expected to confirm that consumer confidence remains weak. James Capel in Tokyo forecasts a 2.5 per cent decline in industrial production for the first quarter of the current calendar year and a 1.5 per cent fall for the April to June quarter. Although such negative sentiment towards the economy has recently been factored into bond prices, further evidence of a delayed recovery is likely to support confidence among bond market participants. Meanwhile the consumer price index to be released Friday should reflect subdued inflationary pressures.</p>

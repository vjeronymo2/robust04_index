			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Bulls run upagainst realists in bleak Japan: Why companies are much more pessimistic than the markets For months the world's fund managers have been selling Japan to their clients. In a world haunted by rising inflation and interest rates, Japan, they say, offers growth potential. For the past two weeks, the corporate reporting season has put the sales pitch to the test. The hard facts of the 1993-94 results offered little more than the bleak superlatives of decline: a record fourth successive year of falling earnings pushed corporate profitability to depths last seen in the early 1970s; pre-tax profit margins as a percentage of sales fell below 2 per cent, down from a postwar high of nearly 6 per cent in 1989. Overall, turnover fell by 5.4 per cent and pre-tax earnings by 16.2 per cent. Manufacturers were worst hit. Their aggregate profits dropped by a fifth. But it has been an undiscriminating recession; other sectors fared only marginally better. The culprits were familiar: weak demand at home and a surging yen abroad. And yet for the moment it seems the equity market believes not only that the worst is over, but that Japan's companies are actually set for years of rapid growth. While the rest of the world's stock markets have taken to heart the principle of selling in May and going away, the Nikkei greeted the results season with a sustained rally, building on its steady rise since the start of the year. It now stands 21 per cent above its year-end level. The earnings collapse and equity price surge have sent price-earnings ratios back to their bubble highs. The bullish justification is that things can only get better. The company results, though poor, actually beat market expectations, or as Mr Jason James, equity strategist at James Capel, puts it: 'The results were better than expected, because it was always possible that they would be disastrous.' Just a month before the reporting season, analysts were forecasting an average 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. By that yardstick, a 16 per cent fall is encouraging. But while results were better than expected, companies' own expectations for the current year have turned out to be worse than market forecasts. Most observers had been expecting a rebound of more than 16 per cent in 1994-95 earnings. But the annual reports projected an aggregate improvement of just 9 per cent. For the first time companies are much more pessimistic than the market. Some see this as an encouraging sign. 'Japanese companies are at last having a dose of realism,' says Mr Jesper Koll of SG Warburg. 'They are no longer relying on either an economic or a policy bail-out to keep them afloat, but are instead looking to real improvements in their own performance.' If real improvements are to be found in 1994, they are likely to come in three areas. Demand: While many companies reported improving conditions in overseas markets, particularly Asia and the US, there was little optimism about domestic demand. Their average forecast is for another fall in sales, of around 0.2 per cent, as real demand weakness is exacerbated by price falls. The yen: Exporters were caught out by the appreciation of the yen in 1993-94. Last year on average they expected a rate of Y115-Y120 to the dollar. The actual figure was nearer Y105. This year most major exporters are playing safe and basing their earnings forecast on an exchange rate of Y105. This assumption may prove conservative and offers some hope for improving profits. Many companies have taken out protection against the currency's gyrations by shifting production offshore. According to Mr Robert Burghart, strategist at Smith New Court, the most striking feature of the 1993-94 results was a direct correlation between earnings and the scale of the company's offshore production. The electronics sector led the way, with companies such as Aiwa seeing higher profits as a result of an aggressive reorganisation of manufacturing operations. This reorientation is reflected in forecasts: manufacturers are much more optimistic for the current year than other sectors, expecting pre-tax profits to rise by 18 per cent, while non-manufacturers expect a fall of 4 per cent. Costs: 'Restructuring' has been the vogue word throughout the recession. The 1993-94 results suggest that companies have indeed trimmed costs to keep afloat. Employee bonuses, on average 30 per cent of total employment costs, have fallen by about 4 per cent this year. Headquarters costs have been held back for a third successive year. Exemplar of the trend was Ricoh, the photocopier manufacturer, which was one of the few companies to post higher profits, despite falling sales, thanks largely to the disposal of unprofitable divisions and better control of other costs. But such measures have not yet yielded results for most companies. There is little hard evidence that deep, structural cost-cutting, as distinct from cyclical shrinkage, is widespread. Payroll numbers have fallen only slightly and the commitment to lifetime employment, a significant contributor to companies' long-run costs, remains mostly undiminished. It is possible that companies' relative pessimism about the current year will prove excessive. The yen may fall and domestic demand may turn out stronger than expected. But if their expectations prove well-founded, earnings growth will be sluggish at best, and they will rely on their own internal reforms for recovery. Only those businesses for whom restructuring is a reality rather than an aspiration will justify the market's optimism. Japanese results, Page 22</p>

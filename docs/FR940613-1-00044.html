			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. The UST Security Interest Exemption and Intent of Today's Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The security interest exemption under subtitle I, section 9003(h)(9) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h)(9), provides: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As used in this subsection, the term ``owner'' does not include any person who, without participating in the management of an underground storage tank and otherwise not engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect the owner's security interest in the tank. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Limited legislative history exists concerning the RCRA subtitle I security interest exemption. No guidance or other indication is available concerning the types of activities that Congress considered to be consistent with the subtitle I security interest exemption, or about the types of activities that Congress considered to be impermissible participation in an UST or UST system's management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory exemption is limited to liability for corrective action at petroleum-contaminated sites. Since the subtitle I security interest exemption applies only to the corrective action requirements for petroleum_Part 280 Subpart F and portions of subpart E, one interpretation of the statute could hold that the holder is not exempt from complying with other portions of the statute and regulations applicable to an ``owner'' of a tank. These other parts include 40 CFR part 280, subparts B, C, D, E (&sect;280.50 only), and G (hereafter referred to as the ``UST technical standards'' for purposes of this rule), and Subpart H_Financial Responsibility. However, the statute is silent with respect to a holder's liability for these requirements solely as a consequence of having ownership rights in a tank primarily to protect a security interest. The Agency does not believe that these limited ownership rights rise to the level of full ``ownership'' sufficient to make the holder an ``owner'' of the tank, as that term is used in section 9001(3) of RCRA subtitle I. Therefore, EPA is proposing, under its broad rulemaking authority in section 9003, that a holder who meets the criteria specified in this proposed rule (i.e., whose only connection with the tank is as the bona fide holder of a security interest in the UST or UST system) is not subject to the UST technical standards and financial responsibility requirements otherwise applicable to a tank owner. EPA believes that this is both appropriate under the Agency's rulemaking authority and consistent with Congressional intent in providing the section 9003(h)(9) exemption for those persons who provide only financing to owners of a tank. Accordingly, a qualifying holder will not be required to comply with the full panoply of EPA regulations implementing subtitle I that apply to tank owners prior to or following foreclosure, provided that the requirements of today's proposed rule are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to a holder's potential to be an ``operator'' of a tank prior to foreclosure, consistent with the provisions of this proposed rule, the holder typically will not be involved in the day-to-day operations of the tank, and will therefore not incur liability as an ``operator.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  By foreclosing, however, the holder takes affirmative action with respect to the tank and displaces the borrower; therefore, by necessity, the holder has taken ``control of .&blank;.&blank;. [and] responsibility for .&blank;.&blank;.'' the tank, and is therefore a tank operator under the definition at 42 U.S.C. 6991(4). However, under today's proposed rule, a foreclosing holder's responsibility for corrective action as an operator is limited in certain circumstances: In general, a holder's obligations would be limited under the provisions of this rule where the foreclosed-on tank is no longer storing petroleum, or where the holder itself empties the tank within a certain time period. In these circumstances, while a holder is an operator and therefore subject to the UST program's technical requirements and other obligations, a holder may remain exempt from the corrective action requirements and satisfy the technical requirements by exercising one of the options for compliance described in Section III. D. 2 of this preamble. These options allow a holder to satisfy its regulatory obligations as an ``operator'' by undertaking specified minimally burdensome and environmentally protective actions to secure and protect the UST or UST system. On the other hand, a holder who operates a tank by, for example, storing or dispensing product following foreclosure will be subject to the full range of requirements applicable to any person operating a tank (including corrective action requirements).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Of course, a lender which has control of or responsibility for the daily operation of a tank would be an ``operator'' under section 9001(4), and therefore subject to all requirements applicable to an operator of a tank, including corrective action. Similarly, such acts may also constitute ``participation in the management'' of the tank, which would void the section 9003(h)(9) exemption and obligate the lender to comply with these same technical, financial, and corrective action requirements as an owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing today's proposal, EPA examined the potential obligations under subtitle I of government entities that act as conservators or receivers of assets acquired from failed lending and depository institutions, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Where a government entity or its designee is acting as a conservator or receiver, EPA interprets the security interest exemption in RCRA subtitle I section 9003(h)(9) to preclude the imposition of the insolvent estate's liabilities against the government entity acting as the conservator or receiver, and considers the liabilities of the institution being administered to be limited to the institution's assets. The situation of a conservator or receiver of a failed or insolvent lending institution is analogous to that of a trustee (particularly a trustee in bankruptcy) that is administering an insolvent's estate and, in accordance with those principles, the insolvent's liabilities are to be satisfied from the estate being administered and not from the assets of the conservator or receiver. Therefore, satisfaction of an estate's debts or liabilities would not reach the general assets of the FDIC, the RTC, those of any other government entity acting in a similar capacity, or those of a private person acting on behalf of the government conservator or receiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Legal Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legal basis for this proposed rule is the Agency's broad authority to issue regulations interpreting and implementing the provisions of RCRA subtitle I at issue in this proposal. Section 9003(b), 42 U.S.C. 6991b(b) provides EPA with authority to ``promulgate release detection, prevention, and correction regulations applicable to all owners and operators of underground storage tanks, as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Kelley, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 93&hyph;1312 (Feb. 4, 1994) does not apply to or affect the rule the Agency is proposing today. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Kelley <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  decision vacated the Agency's rule on lender liability under CERCLA, which interpreted a statutory exemption under CERCLA which is similar to that under RCRA Subtitle I, because ``EPA lack[ed] statutory authority to restrict by regulation private rights of action arising under the statute.&blank;.&blank;.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Kelley, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  slip op. at 3. As noted above, &sect;9003 expressly confers upon EPA a broad rulemaking authority; to the extent that the grants of rulemaking authority were not sufficiently explicit under CERCLA, such is not the case under RCRA Subtitle I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

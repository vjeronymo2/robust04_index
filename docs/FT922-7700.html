			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Travel: France in creole form - James Henderson philosophises on a Caribbean beach THE HEAT and the glare of the Caribbean sun begin to play tricks on your mind after a while. As I lay on the beach, the sea loomed at me in a surreal blue and an outsize pelican wheeled in the sky. And then it struck me - the absurdity of existence] After years of tittering at existentialism, could it have finally happened? Being and nothingness on the beach? Don't be ridiculous, I thought. Yet what more fitting place for dreamy French philosophical ramblings than Martinique, traditionally the heart of the French Caribbean? France always had a more thorough-going attitude towards colonisation than the British. Martinique has the strongest attachment to the metropole, as mainland France is known. The best and worst of France seems to be there in creole form: the bands of municipal strimmers, the well-dressed coquettes - and that infuriating pout when they are refusing to help you. The Martinicans are traditionally a bit more conservative than their confreres in other islands. They also have something of a superiority complex, which derives from their history as the senior French island, through which all business with the metropole was conducted. The principal port, St Pierre, was known as the Paris of the Lesser Antilles because it followed French fashion so closely. The dou-dous (douces cheries) of Martinique, mulatto girls of French and African descent, were famed as the prettiest in the area. A telling moment in the Martinicans' history came with the French revolution. The ideals of liberte and egalite could hardly tolerate slavery. But the royalist planters of Martinique preferred to call in the hated English rather than lose their ascendancy. Not so in Guadeloupe, the other large French island, which lies 100 miles or so to the north. Here the patriotes gained the upper hand and the slaves were freed. Today, Guadeloupe is a departement with the same status as Martinique, but it has always had a slightly more detached feel about it. One of my favourite Caribbean beach bars is on the north coast of Guadeloupe: Chez Francine is a log cabin with covered terraces lined by sandy walkways, set in a garden of banana and bougainvillea, all shaded by coconut palms. The view is superb, particularly as the sand turns golden in late afternoon light. Lying in a hammock in scenery like this is a time-honoured pastime here. There is something about the climate which seems to encourage it. In fact, the Carib and Arawak Indians, who lived here before Columbus arrived, actually invented the hammock. Francine herself disturbed me from my reverie as she rode up through the trees on a mountain bike, followed by her loping dog. Her hair was straighter than most Guadeloupeans' and her eyes were slightly pinched - characteristics of the Caribs, she told me. Over soursop milk and accras (codfish batter balls), we chatted about aphrodisiac cookery and about Guadeloupe and the metropole. Perhaps it was the Carib in her, but she found it difficult to feel a national identity with France. As the sky darkened, the tree frogs began to peep rhythmically on the cool air. And with them came one of the Caribbean's only afflictions: sandflies. They are so small that you can barely see them, but they pack an infuriating itch, from your ankles to your knees. Francine spun the top of a rum bottle and told me to rub some into my legs. St Barts, France's smallest but probably best-known Caribbean island, only watched the Revolution from the sidelines because it was not French at the time. It was on loan to Sweden for 100 years, in return for a warehouse in Gothenburg. Today St Barts is a classic Caribbean playground, as only the French could conceive - neat and very chic. Here, tanned beauties idle by in only a nuance of a bathing suit and their pig-tailed boyfriends tame the flightiest windsurfers; in the evening they repair for dinner a deux and jazz. The requisite transport on St Barts is a mini-moke or a Suzuki four-wheel drive; wherever you are, they seem to be zipping by. You can tell a hip place by the 150-yard line of them parked nose to nose. And there is not much in the way of philosophy to be found in St Barts, either, except a thoroughly 20th century pleasure principle. Thus it was that I was chattering with Chantal, champagne flute in hand, high on a balcony above Gustavia, the town. Chantal was a stylish nymphette - knee-length shorts and earrings that might have doubled as tennis racquets - and she was a Bartheleminoise of only two months' standing. She was really from Lyon. She was out there helping to run a dive- shop. We stood listening to Gerschwin and Cole Porter and she pointed out one or two of the celebrities that St Barts seems to collect. To be honest, they were lost on me, but then the drink was having its effect. Besides, I was beginning to fear another attack of the absurd, this time brought on by a huge earring that was threatening to swing round and hit me. Slightly dazed, I headed for my hammock. Getting to the French Caribbean from the UK involves a change of aeroplane: Air France flies to Martinique and Guadeloupe daily from Paris. In Martinique stay at the Novotel Diamant (tel: 596-764242) or the Auberge de l'Anse Mitan (885999) on the beach; in Guadeloupe, Le Hamak (590-885999) or the lower-key Toubana (882557); in St Barts, there is hilltop luxury at the Francois Plantation (590-277882), the new Ile de France (276181) on the beach, or the fun of La Banane (276826).</p>

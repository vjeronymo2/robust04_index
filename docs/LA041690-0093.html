			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES TRANSPORTATION;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC CORRIDORS MEET DEMANDS OF MODERN ERA;  </P> <P> JUST AS WARTIME GAS RATIONING REQUIRED ADAPTATION, FREEWAY CONGESTION  NECESSITATES CREATIVE ALTERNATIVES -- SUCH AS TOLL ROADS.  </P> <P> Not very many people may remember the old Red Car trolley line. Or gas  rationing during World War II.  </P> <P> But I remember those times. I was raised in the era of gas rationing, when  people were forced to find alternative means of transportation to respond to  the circumstances in which they lived.  </P> <P> I can remember when an A stamp got you only three gallons of gas -- so it also  gave you an incentive to get out of your car or find someone else with whom to  ride. We changed our work schedules if we had to. We responded to the demands  of the era.  </P> <P> In similar fashion, Orange County is responding to current traffic congestion  by designing, financing and building nearly 68 miles of toll roads -- the first  in the state. These transportation corridors are part of today's response to  the demands of this era, and they are also part of a system that includes  surface streets, freeways, buses, fixed rails, cycling and walking.  </P> <P> The corridors will provide tremendous relief to current traffic congestion in  Orange County. In fact, more than 200,000 cars are initially projected to be on  the corridors and off congested freeways and roads in 1995, when all three are  open. Significant traffic improvement will be immediate.  </P> <P> But opening the corridors doesn't mean they will be complete. They are being  designed to grow with the times and changing needs.  </P> <P> Construction will be "phased" -- meaning that median improvements such as  reversible lanes and fixed rail will be built as traffic demand warrants.  Motorists and commuters in 2010 will find that the facilities anticipated and  answered their needs too.  </P> <P> Recently, questions have arisen regarding the financial vitality of these  leading-edge projects. Yes, they are challenging from a financing standpoint,  as is every transportation project in Orange County right now. And the  corridors are the only roads being built virtually without federal, state or  local transportation funding.  </P> <P> But that has not rendered these projects infeasible. Quite the contrary.  Through a unique combination of fees on new development and tax-free,  toll-revenue municipal bonds, the financing for these three thoroughfares is  innovative yet practical.  </P> <P> Currently, all costs for design, operation, administration and environmental  documentation are being funded through development fees levied against  builders. Our strategy is to delay issuance of bonds as long as possible in  order to minimize interest costs. When projected cash flows deplete reserve  development fees, as the corridor agencies anticipate they will, they will  issue the bonds.  </P> <P> The question, then, becomes "How much new highway can be funded?" We are  confident that traffic demands will be more than met by the initial phase of  all three projects.  </P> <P> The philosophy of "phasing" is prudent. Using that approach, only the road  capacity needed to meet current traffic loads is constructed.  </P> <P> For example, on the Foothill Corridor (which runs roughly parallel to  Interstate 5, connecting with it at the San Diego-Orange County line), that may  mean an opening-day configuration of four instead of eight general-purpose  lanes.  </P> <P> Or, on opening day, the Eastern Corridor (running in two legs parallel to the  Riverside and Costa Mesa freeways from Gypsum Canyon Road to the Santa Ana  Freeway at the Laguna Freeway and Jamboree Road) could be six rather than eight  lanes, two of which could be High Occupancy Vehicle lanes.  </P> <P> Other options will be chosen considering such factors as air-quality standards  and traffic forecasting in addition to financing options.  </P> <P> The most advanced and efficient toll- collection technology will be used. The  new computerized scanning equipment and electronically printed toll tags will  enable motorists to enter and exit the corridors at freeway on-ramp and  off-ramp speeds without stopping. The tolls will be used to repay the  tax-exempt construction bonds.  </P> <P> Obviously, these innovations require thorough, complicated, meticulous  environmental documentation to answer local concerns as well as meet state and  federal regulations. Each corridor is currently in the midst of those  processes.  </P> <P> The design of the corridors also conforms to the mandates of the new Air  Quality Management Plan by increasing ridership and reducing auto emissions in  the basin.  </P> <P> Since I became executive director of the Transportation Corridor Agencies six  months ago, I've realized that I came to the agencies with some biases. Years  ago, like every other kid, when I turned 16, I couldn't wait to get my driver's  license. But during the war, even though I could legally drive, we simply  didn't have the gasoline.  </P> <P> Many of us became totally independent of driving. We learned to do what was  necessary to transport ourselves. Today's drivers are doing the same. The toll  facilities will provide additional options -- and a means to do so.  </P> <P> Another bias I brought to this job was the belief that cooperation between the  public and private sectors is essential. Having worked in both, I have seen  that the energy, skills, sensitivities and financial resources of both sectors  can be maximized when the relationship is not adversarial but cooperative.  </P> <P> We have been fortunate to have the benefit of a unique public/private  partnership as these corridors have evolved, with the development community  contributing part of the cost and the elected officials of 17 Orange County  communities joining together on our boards of directors to help solve a  regional problem.  </P> <P> I have seen a tremendous dedication to "making it happen." Local, parochial  interests are being integrated into a commitment to solving the transportation  problems of the county as a whole. There is significant participation from a  broad spectrum of groups.  </P> <P> The corridor agencies have a special relationship with Caltrans, enabling our  two organizations to work closely together on a project of massive proportions.  We're actively involved with the Southern California Assn. of Governments, the  Air Quality Management District, the Department of Fish and Game, and dozens of  other agencies.  </P> <P> I also realize that we have a significant responsibility to succeed. These  corridors are vital to Orange County's future. But they are also a bellwether  for the potential success of private toll roads in the state; a bellwether for  future partnerships between the public and private sectors; and a bellwether  for increased cooperation between local, state and federal transportation  agencies.  </P></p>

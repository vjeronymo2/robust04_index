			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> LAWYER WANTS CLIENT ON COKE  </P> <P> The lawyer for Ramon Salcido, charged with killing three members of his family  and three others in an April 14 rampage in Northern California wine country,  says he wants to prove his client has a brain disorder by giving him cocaine.  "I want to get him intoxicated with some cocaine and see what the connection  is," said Deputy Public Defender Marteen Miller, who believes Salcido used  cocaine and alcohol on the day of the killing rampage. Miller said preliminary  tests indicate Salcido may have a history of seizures and trauma that could  explain the crimes. The attorney said he will ask a judge to transfer Salcido  from the Sonoma County Jail to Orange County, where more neurological tests can  be performed. Dr. Monte Buchsbam of UC Irvine, who would perform the tests,  said they may tell whether Salcido is a schizophrenic, a manic-depressive or a  sufferer of some other mental illness, but said drugging Salcido with cocaine  might not prove much.  </P></p>

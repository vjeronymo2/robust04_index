Speaking at a press conference, Longuet said if Japan opens  up further to U.S. exports, he hopes the same treatment will be  awarded to Europe.    The French minister's remarks were in reference to the  drawing of plans by Japanese automakers to import more U.S. car  parts in line with ongoing U.S. trade negotiations.    Longuet said that during the meeting with Japanese leaders,  France and Japan agreed to set up a private-level committee to  promote European automotive exports to Japan.    He said automakers' use of European car parts in Japan is at  a ratio of only 1.4 percent.    He arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to have talks with Japanese  Government and business leaders and attend an international  conference on assistance to Cambodia.</p>

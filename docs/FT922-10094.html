			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Rambert workshops - Dance as old as the company, and hence as old as our ballet in this century - continues with this week's creative workshops at Riverside Studios. Six dancers from the company have produced new work. In commenting upon such shorn lambs, critical wind has to be tempered. That these debutants have made dances worth showing to the public is in itself an achievement. An awful lot of nonsense litters the modern dance scene. (I treasure the memory of Marie Rambert storming out of one performance in the 1960s, tossing away her programme with a ringing declaration of 'rubbish', as a proper response). The present Rambert editorial process has saved us from anything too embarrassing, and though the new works are uneven, none disgraces the company name. Solos by Glenn Wilkinson and Gary Lambert were evidence of the influence exerted by Laurie Booth. Both creators are plainly taken by the curving lines of dynamics that mark Booth's choreography for himself. Both extend this manner in terms of their own considerable technical skills. Wilkinson's dance looks lighter in musculature, movement oiling over the stage (though he seems occasionally to have been trapped into awkward transitions). It is mercurial, attractive. Lambert's solo is set to rap poetry, whose images provide occasional pauses and gestural references for a dance that is exact in its phrasing, stimulating (and taxing) in its flow of energy. Both pieces are well worth watching. I liked, too, Sara Matthews' Passing Through which has the audacity to use the andante from Beethoven's 'Ghost' trio. Seven dancers in pale costumes cross the stage, return for solos and duets, and their movement never offends Beethoven. It is quiet, contemplative dance, with particularly touching work for Jacqueline Jones and Paul Old, particularly well done. Impossible to expect the choreography to reveal even part of what the music does, but the matching of mood for mood is sensitive,and the movement is fluent, grateful to watch. Two studies, by Colin Poole and Sarah Worsop, were necessary exercises by apprentice talents, but I found Mark Baldwin's Gone altogether more considerable. Using Grieg piano music, he offered a series of half-serious, half-mocking movement sketches that sat with an off-beat appositeness upon the music's naivetes. Lee Boggess behaved like a strange bird; Amanda Britton drew unexpected shapes; other dancers ran, posed, were caught up in a secret world of games and relationships. There were moments that seemed bland, but Mark Baldwin is a choreographer. And as a traveller's note, let me again record that Hammersmith's abominable metro station and underpasses is a hell-spot, dangerous, confusing, hideous. Rambert Dance Company workshops continue at Riverside Studios until May 2</p>

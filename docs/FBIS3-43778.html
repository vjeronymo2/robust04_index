			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Mahamane Ousmane returned to Niamey  this afternoon from Dakar where he attended the summits on Air  Afrique and the Monetary Union of West African States [UMOA].  The president speaks here on the outcome of these two meetings,  beginning with Air Afrique:    [Begin Ousmane recording] The first phase of our  deliberations centered on our multinational airline, Air  Afrique, which, as you know, is in an extremely difficult  situation. This is not very surprising because air transport  has generally been facing serious difficulties over the past few  years owing to a combination of several factors on the African  continent and worldwide. [passage omitted] It was therefore  necessary that this situation be reviewed and steps taken to  ensure the airline's survival. This is what we did. What is  worth noting is that steps were taken to recapitalize this  company and draw up another rescue plan aimed at restoring its  smooth operations.    As you know, the chairman and managing director of the  airline was reelected and a number of specific recommendations  were made aimed at avoiding a relapse into the past situation.  I must stress that our French partners played a key role by  making a fairly substantial contribution to this rescue plan.  The various states were also requested to make significant  contributions in proportion to their financial standing. A  contribution of 100 million CFA is not much compared to 18  billion CFA francs to be provided by the other side. However,  in view of the hard times, it represents something all the same.  On the whole, what we can say is that we got in step with the  times, so to speak. [passage omitted]    The second meeting involved examining the situation of  member  countries of the franc zone. We all know the outcome -- the  devaluation of the CFA franc, which now moves from the previous  exchange rate of 1 French franc [Fr] to 50 CFA francs to a rate  of Fr1 to 100 CFA francs. Taking into account the present  predicament of a number of countries, including Niger, this  actually seems to be quite a high devaluation.    If we examine the reevaluation rate of this currency in each  country, we realize that the rates differ. As far as the Niger  economy is concerned, this rate is relatively lower than that  which has been adopted. But then, we are in a monetary zone.  There is a certain degree of solidarity which must be  maintained if we really want to enable the various countries to  continue to enjoy the benefits that go with belonging to a  single monetary zone and to forestall speculation. This is so  because, since this currency is still overvalued, a devaluation  at a relatively low rate would just encourage businessmen to  speculate by saying to themselves: Well, this is a first  devaluation and there must be others in the pipeline.    Obviously that would not get us anywhere, because the  investments which stopped will not resume. The flight of  capital will not end and people will continue to wait. With  this rate, which is quite significant, people will say: That's  right. The devaluation has been done once and for all. We can  now go ahead. Everyone is clear in their mind and knows that  surely there will be no further devaluation. There is that  advantage. There is also the considerable advantage of ensuring  that with this operation a certain number of problems faced by  our countries can begin to get resolved, namely, the  competitiveness of our various economies and the competitiveness  of the various products manufactured in our countries either for  domestic consumption or for export. Also, such an operation  enables us to cope with a number of problems, particularly the  fact that for some time now in the various franc zone countries  investments have ground to a halt. We cannot continue this way.    The crisis has led our countries to attempt a number of  adjustment programs and adopt internal measures. These measures  have shown their limitations. We must envisage new measures  which will enable the population to increase their production,  settle down to work once more, and equally earn substantial  income to be able to save and later invest. They should also  offer foreign investors opportunities so that they bring in  adequate capital to enable investments to restart. It is only  through investments that we can secure economic growth and  improve the living conditions of the people.    This is very important, because we must not look at this  devaluation solely from a negative angle. We must not. As I  said a short while ago, this is not the first time a devaluation  is being carried out in our African countries. For the franc  zone, it is perhaps the first time because that last setting of  parity rate between the French franc and the CFA franc dates as  far back as 1948. That was a long time ago. Nowhere in the  world can one find a similar situation.    Our economies now are very competitive with each other, and  the parity rates of the various currencies fluctuate  permanently. It must be stated that the pegging of these rates  and the time that this has lasted really constitute a record.  What should be borne in mind here is that we must avoid  panicking. Indeed, we must not panic. We must not embark on  speculation cycles either. I have just learned that at our  drugstores and some business houses, people have already begun  to increase prices. Why should that be? That cannot be  justified. There is absolutely no reason today, tomorrow, or  the day after for a Niger businessman, or for that matter any  businessman in the country, to increase prices. That cannot be  justified. On what basis will it be?    Devaluation ultimately has a certain propensity to push up  prices, but we need to wait for the various mechanisms to come  into play before this inflationist trend begins. A number of  measures were adopted precisely to contain this trend. We must  avoid speculation and ensure that each of us plays the game  honestly by avoiding pointless speculation and fraud, because  the goods in stock or on the shelves at the moment are not in  any way affected by this change of parity taking effect today.  Things must be clearly understood and our various business  organizations should see in this operation an opportunity  opening to them -- an opportunity to make a fresh start,  generally speaking.    This is what we can say about these summits. It was very  tough; it was very difficult; but we must say, especially with  regard to countries like Niger, that we came out positively.  Among the backup measures, there were some which were very  specific to our country. The agreements reached constitute a  good thing and it is up to us to mobilize fully so that together  we may tide over the crisis and set the national economy on the  move once more.    After the deliberations on the change of CFA-French franc  parity, we also conferred among ourselves as UMOA members. As  you are aware, a number of initiatives have been undertaken for  some time now. There was the experts' meeting and that of the  various ministers of finance, economy, planning, and commerce on  all matters relating to our UMOA. It was felt that we no longer  treat economic and monetary concerns separately. Nowadays the  two concerns are intimately linked. We decided to ensure that  all these issues are examined in the same manner. This is why  all the various meetings I mentioned earlier produced a draft  treaty instituting the West African Economic and Monetary Union  [UEMOA].    This treaty marks the birth of a new union which, in a way,  is an improvement over UMOA. It will have a high governing body  which will be the heads of state and government, and a  ministerial council. There will also be --and this is a novelty  -- a commission composed of parliamentarians of the 16-member  UEMOA, which will in a way serve as an executive organ of the  union. This is also a decisive turning point in the process of  integrating our economies as well as an action [words  indistinct] with this decision to review the CFA-French franc  exchange rate. In other words, the African integration process  as a whole is on course and we hope that our businessmen will be  dynamic enough to not only take part in the various actions  enabling the recovery of our national economy, but also ensure  our effective presence on the vast West African market which is  unfolding.

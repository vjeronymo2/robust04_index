			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Kovalev: "Belarusian Missile Workers </F> Hope To Conduct Field Firing in Russia"]    [Text] For two years now, units and subdivisions of the  Belorussian [Belarusian] Army Air Defense Force, which are  equipped with long-range antiaircraft missile complexes, have  been deprived of an opportunity to make combat launches. There  are no corresponding test sites on the Republic's territory.  When there was just one army, Belorussian Air Defense units  went to testing grounds in Russia. Yet since the  "nationalization" of armies the road there has been closed.    According to Lt.-Gen. Valeriy Kostenko, commander in chief  of  the Belorussian Air Defense Force, this summer Belorussian  missile workers can again practice combat firing in Russia. Our  countries, he said, do not intend to destroy the integral air  defense system.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): BSI guidance for small firms - In A Nutshell Small businesses which want to register for the BS5750 quality assurance standard are to be given extra help by the British Standards Institution. BSI will produce a new guide to applying for BS5750 designed specially for small firms. It will also consider giving additional guidance to companies purchasing from small businesses. Some small firms have complained that purchasers have misunderstood the nature of the standard and insist wrongly on all their suppliers being registered to BS5750. BSI will analyse the cost of registering to the standard, evaluate the role of accreditation in ensuring the quality of the certification organisations and advise on safeguards small firms may need to seek in using external consultants.</p>

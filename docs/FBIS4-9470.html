			<p>BFN     [Text] Piotrkow Trybunalski, April 26 -- The All-Poland  Strike Committee of the brown coal mines agreed on Tuesday [26  April] to deliver coal in quantities sufficient to generate some  25 percent of the energy generated by individual power plants.  The decision was announced following industry minister's  declaration during talks with union leaders here that he is  cancelling orders concerning the restructuring of the brown coal  sector.    Spokesman for Solidarity's national commission said that the  decision on resumption of coal deliveries will be lifted at 2000  hrs on Thursday if the government side fails to adopt a  time-table, approved by Solidarity, of dealing with the demands  put forward by the union.</p>

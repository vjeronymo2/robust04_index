			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- More than half of the heads  of local autonomies and economic organizations feel the  government's comprehensive national development plan aimed at  administrative decentralization has failed to accomplish its  ultimate goal, a survey by KYODO NEWS SERVICE showed Monday [23  May].    The heads of 22 local governments and seven economic  federations out of 23 autonomies and eight economic groups  polled responded to the poll, which was conducted in late April.    The survey showed that 59 percent of those polled felt the  goal of decentralizing the government has not been achieved  totally or substantially.    They based their responses on the wide gap between Tokyo and  local municipalities in such fields as population density,  economies and information propagation.    About two-thirds of respondents said some achievements have  been made in the four national development plans implemented  since 1962.    An overwhelming majority of leaders of local autonomies  called for the carrying out of another program to balance  development of the domestic economy.</p>

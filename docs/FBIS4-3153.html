			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  State Councillor Song Jian today praised Sino-U.S. cooperation  in science and technology and hoped for closer ties in the  political and economic fields.    Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and  Technology Commission, said that there had been problems in  developing the cooperation in science and technology, but they  had all been solved with concerted efforts by scientists of the  two countries.    He expressed confidence that Chinese and U.S. political and  business leaders could do the same in case of difficulties.    Song made these remarks here tonight during a reception  given  by Zhang Weichao, China's consul-general in New York, in honor  of Song for his visit to New York city.    Earlier this week, Song attended the Sixth Session of the  Sino- U.S. Joint Working Committee on Cooperation of Science and  Technology held in Washington.    U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren  Christopher met with Song and his delegation on April 12.    In his speech tonight, Song also expressed his hope that the  momentum seen in cooperation of science and technology between  the two countries would be maintained and that the fields of  cooperation further expanded.    "China imports more than 100 billion U.S. dollars worth of  commodities each year from foreign countries," he said, "and we  hope our American friends from the scientific, technological and  business circles will seize this opportunity to engage more  actively in economic, trade, scientific and technological  cooperation with China."    Also attending the reception were more than 100 leaders from  science and business circles in New York.</p>

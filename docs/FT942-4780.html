			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Arts: A very cultivated 'Falstaff' - Opera at the Holland Festival The trick of going to the opera in Amsterdam is to catch the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra on one of its periodic visits to the Muziektheater. Riccardo Chailly is the orchestra's Music Director and it was an obvious step to employ this Italian man of the theatre and his orchestra as a team: they opened the Holland Festival last week with a new production of Verdi's Falstaff. This opera is the most musically rewarding of all the Italian comedies. It is worth keeping its nationality in mind. Although Falstaff may be one of the great characters of the English theatre, Verdi bestowed upon him a kind of honorary Italian citizenship. In the 1960s and 70s the contrast was made clear by the leading Falstaffs of the day: Geraint Evans the figure of fun, the Italian Tito Gobbi more dignified and restrained. Sometimes the opera opens with a raucous guffaw from the brass, but nothing so vulgar was allowed in Chailly's performance. As always, he kept a watchful eye on every detail and the music came across as remarkably cultivated, its subtle blend of colours and pinpoint precision beautifully realised by the Concertgebouw players. What he missed was the rude energy that is just a much a part of Falstaff's character. Taking its cue from the musical performance, Llus Pasqual's production refused to lower itself to any knockabout fun. It would seem that the budget restricted the designer, Ezio Frigerio, to two sets, the first a huge barn stacked with bundles of hay, which had the sole advantage of not being any more inappropriate for one scene than another. The closing tableau moved to Windsor Great Park, where Herne's oak was surrounded by what looked like silver birch trees. Given a strong team of personalities, one would not mind if the opera was played on bare boards, but Pasqual did not ask much of his singers and they in turn gave him little. Bruno Pratico sang the Italian words with relish - every syllable of 'Quand'ero paggio' delightfully inflected - but he is too young to be a Falstaff. With his slim baritone and his lightweight manner, he cannot command much in the way of corpulent authority. Inevitably, he seemed a character without a past. There was an array of young Italians in the other roles, including Roberto Servile with an attractive baritone but a personality one size too small for Ford and Daniela Dess as his wife, cutting through the orchestra with her strident soprano. Anna Steiger's Meg Page actually seemed to be enjoying herself. Serena Lazzarini made an irritating Mistress Quickly, forever putting on airs in a role that asks for down-to-earth, good-hearted honesty. Patrizia Pace sang a bright and nicely poised Nannetta, paired with a gauche Fenton in Jose Bros. As an ensemble they had tangible virtues: all had been carefully rehearsed to sing (never shout) their music, to point the words clearly, to observe the details of Verdi's score. On a recording, these good points might add up to a recommendable performance. In the theatre, they just made a rather dull evening of Falstaff. Further performances ending June 24</p>

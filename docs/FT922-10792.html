			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Kravchuk wants western surety on missiles disposal UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk, facing what he sees as an increasingly hostile Russia, said yesterday he was seeking security guarantees from the west in exchange for dismantling Ukraine's strategic missiles. The republican leader, who visits the US next week, said he would link guarantees to 46 inter-continental ballistic missiles in Ukraine not covered by last summer's Start treaty between the US and the former Soviet Union. 'This question has become particularly acute because some of our neighbours are making territorial claims on us, especially our big neighbour, Russia,' he said. Meanwhile, Kazakhkstan's president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, said his country must be regarded as a nuclear state, if only 'temporarily.' His statement advances the much-feared possibility that all four nuclear republics  - Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan  - would continue to hold them indefinitely. Mr Nazarbayev said he wanted a 'strategic alliance' with guarantees from the US against nuclear attack from Russia, China or the US itself. In return, Kazakhstan would show 'flexibility' on signing the non-proliferation treaty. Both men's remarks drew a response last night from Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who said that the US had already offered a limited, standard security guarantee. Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine's pledge last autumn to become nuclear-free 'set a good example for the world' but 'we are also weakening ourselves'.  Ukraine would also require compensation to defray the cost of dismantling warheads. Since Mr Kravchuk's announcement last month of a temporary freeze on the shipment of Ukraine's 1,000 tactical weapons to Russia, their fate has been clouded by contradictory statements. Mr Kravchuk yesterday held out the hope that the troubled Start treaty, which covers 130 intercontinental missiles in Ukraine, would soon be ratified. He said the four nuclear republics would soon sign a protocol with the US clearing the way for ratification by all four. Mr Nazarbayev said he wanted his republic to sign the Start treaty as a separate state. Russia has insisted that it alone should ratify it, as successor to the Soviet Union. In a bitter comment on relations between the republics, Mr Kravchuk said the US had adopted a more favourable attitude to Ukraine, and that it was easier for him to reach an agreement with Mr Baker than with republican leaders. The tension between Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States dominated by Russia, was emphasised yesterday when the CIS navy commander dismissed officers who had sworn allegiance to Ukraine. His action followed a telegram from Colonel General Konstantin Morozov, Ukrainian defence minister, to Marshal Yevgeni Shaposhnikov, CIS commander in chief, requesting that all CIS officers serving on Ukrainian territory who had not taken an oath of allegiance to Ukraine be suspended and transferred. Gen Morozov also asked that Ukrainian officers serving outside the republic be sent home.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Italian rail given change of status ITALY'S Economic Planning Committee yesterday approved the transformation of the national rail system into a joint stock company, AP reports from Rome. The shares of Ente Ferrovia dello Stato (FS), which will be Italy's largest joint stock company with capital of L42 trillion (million million) - Pounds 19.6bn - will belong to the Treasury Ministry and stakes will eventually be transferred to the Transport and Budget ministries as well. The government hopes to raise about L42 trillion from privatisations by 1995 to reduce the budget deficit. The move follows transformation last week of the country's four main holding companies into joint stock companies to prepare for privatisation.</p>

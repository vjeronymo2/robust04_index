			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways Yesterday's third-quarter results from BA confirmed the extent of the short-term pressures afflicting the airline. But they also hinted at the long-term promise for shareholders able to contain their queasiness. The Pounds 80m drop in the quarter's profits largely resulted from the immediate impact of the falling pound and customers' continued reluctance to sit at the dearer end of the cabin. But sterling's devaluation should now work in BA's favour as 60 per cent of ticket sales are made overseas while only half its costs are incurred in harder currencies. Firmer evidence of recovery should prompt a strong rise in the shares of such a highly cyclical stock. In that event, however, BA will probably tap the market to ease the financial strains of its global ambitions.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Few schools report curriculum results Only 20 per cent of secondary schools in England and Wales reported the results of national curriculum tests for 14-year-olds to the government this year, although two teachers' unions lifted their boycott of the tests. But the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the education department quango which administers the tests, said it had collected enough data to treat the results as a benchmark for future years. It also stepped up the pressure on the National Union of Teachers, the only union which has continued with the boycott, to start preparing children for the tests. Mr Nicholas Tate, the chief executive, said: 'The message to teachers boycotting the tests is that they are missing a great deal of information about their own pupils and the effectiveness of their own teaching.' The format of the tests will remain unchanged next year, and the authority is exploring a marking system which would enable each child's work to be marked as a percentage. This would help in constructing 'value-added' tables, which measure children's progress. However, such tables will not be possible until 1996 at the earliest, when the results achieved by this year's 14-year-olds can be compared with their grades in GCSE exams, taken at 16. The authority was anxious not to draw strong conclusions from the test results, but found that physics results for 11-year-olds were weak. Officials believed this was because the subject was relatively new to primary schools. There was also evidence that primary school boys underperformed badly in English. This appeared to confirm academic studies which suggest that boys underperform at GCSE because they lack control of the basics of literacy. Mr Tate said: 'I think boys' under-achievement, in English in particular, is a serious problem. It is just as serious as girls' under-achievement in science in the past.' The authority will also simplify the language in science and mathematics tests, after pupils were shown to have difficulty with the scientific applications of words such as 'conductor', 'producer' and 'probability'. In the tests for 11-year-olds, only 29 per cent of abler children spelt 'illuminated' correctly, while more than two out of three spelt 'reference' incorrectly. In mathematics, the most common mistakes included misplacing decimal points, failing to calculate percentages and fractions in mental arithmetic, and confusion between squaring and doubling of numbers.</p>

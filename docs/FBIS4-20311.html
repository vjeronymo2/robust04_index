			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Si Da (1835 6671): "Symptoms in China's Civil </F> Aviation Industry, Countermeasures To Carry Out Reform"]    [Text] Frequent Accidents and Poor Service    During the past few years, crashes and hijacking of China's  civil air carriers continuously occurred. This has made people  doubt the standards of China's civil aviation industry and even  lose their confidence. The foreign press even rated China's  aviation industry as the least safe. In fact, the Civil Aviation  Administration of China really has something debatable in terms  of flight safety, keeping flights on schedule, and services.    -- There were frequent aviation accidents in the past few  years. The number of accidents even increased in 1992 and 1993.  In nearly four months from 31 July to 24 November 1992, five  major aviation accidents occurred in Nanjing, Guilin and other  localities causing 309 deaths and five passenger planes and  helicopters damaged. Another four accidents took place in 1993,  causing deaths. The number of accidents and deaths in China's  civil aviation industry is alarming. According to statistics, 25  accidents occurred during scheduled flights in the world causing  990 deaths in 1992, while the number of deaths during accidents  of Chinese air carriers accounted for one-third of the total  number of deaths caused by international carriers in the world  in that year.    If a Chinese air carrier has an accident, the reason for  such an accident is very seldom made public, stirring up a great  deal of doubts among the people. Although we should not blame  the flight crews of China's aviation industry for all the  accidents, the people's worries about the quality of these crew  members are not entirely groundless. An official of the  department of airworthiness under the State Administration of  Civil Aviation said: "The guerrilla sentiments of some civil  aviation flight crews is incompatible with the scientific  management procedure. They are used to do things by relying on  their experience instead of acting with a scientific approach."  In addition, the emergence of various regional airlines has also  brought many new problems to the management and safety of  China's civil aviation industry. According to a survey, three of  the crashes in 1992 involved air carriers of China's new  airlines.    -- Incidents of hijacking air carriers continuously  occurred. As of 26 November, there were eight cases of air  carrier hijacking in 1993. Among the eight cases, seven air  carriers were hijacked and flown to Taiwan, while in one  particular case, hijackers were later subdued on an Air Eastern  passenger plane on 26 November when the plane was seized and on  its way to Taiwan. Due to the large number of casualties on the  air carriers when attempts to thwart hijacking failed in the  past several years, we have always adopted the attitude of  attaching great importance to safety of passengers and air  carriers. Therefore, we do not desperately try to thwart  hijacking. Meantime, we have repeatedly asked the Taiwan  authorities to repatriate all hijackers back to the mainland so  that we can subject them to severe punishment in order to attain  the goal of executing one as a warning to a hundred.    -- Not many of China's air carriers depart or arrive on  time. According to statistics, 225 flights were delayed in 1991.  The number of flights delayed rose to 1,319 in 1992 in which 86  percent of all flights by Chinese carriers departed and arrived  on time, close to the international average. This percentage  declined to 81.9 during the first half of 1993, a drop of 10.2  percent as compared with the same period in 1992. The civil  aviation industry on the Mainland often gives no explanation for  its schedule delay. Nor does it offer any compensation for the  time loss, making the passengers unhappy. The schedule delay has  also drawn criticism from the media at home and abroad. However,  due to the fact that China's civil aviation industry has a  tremendous backlog in construction and it is hard to come up  with good measures to correct their outmoded practices.  According to an analysis conducted by a official of the Civil  Aviation Administration, China's air traffic control system, the  system of flight detours and that of holding planes in the air  have caused serious wastes and greatly affected the arrival and  departure of scheduled flights on time. Right now, the civil  aviation industry in foreign countries has generally used II-ILS  [instrumental landing system], but none of the airports on the  Mainland has met the II-ILS standard. Therefore, takeoffs and  landings are often delayed whenever the weather is abnormal. Not  long ago, heavy snow hit Beijing. Even after the snow stopped  and the airport was open to traffic our reporter's flight  schedule was still delayed for 10 hours. It was said that the  pilot refused to take the risk of taking off under such weather  conditions.    -- Poor service. In addition to the quality of flight  stewards and stewardesses, the poor service of China's civil  aviation industry is closely connected with the shortage of  flight crews. There are 13,000 flight crew members for China's  civil aviation industry with an average of 30 members for each  plane. According to statistics compiled by the FAA of the United  States in May 1992, there were a total of 6,083 planes run by  various U.S. airlines, and the number of flight crews reached  400,000 in 1900 [as received] with an average of 66 crew members  for each plane. Therefore, while we criticize China's civil  aviation industry for the poor service and indifference of the  service personnel, we have found, after a specific analysis,  that most of the flight crews for China's civil aviation  industry work many extra shifts and are extremely tired. There  was such a saying in China's civil aviation industry on the  Mainland. A Civil Aviation Bureau official was once on an  inspection tour of an airline service. He asked a stewardess a  question: "Why don't you smile while working in the passenger  plane?" "I cannot smile. I work overtime everyday. I am so tired  that I want to cry," replied the stewardess.    The aforementioned contradictions have greatly damaged  China's civil aviation industry's reputation at home and abroad.  Jiang Zhuping, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of  China, believes that in addition to the poor infrastructural  facilities, lack of professionally trained people and some of  the rules and regulations pending further improvement, an  outstanding problem is the lax administration. Right now, it is  of great urgency to strengthen administration in China's civil  aviation industry, he said.    To ensure the safety of the civil aviation system and  improve service, the related units in China have repeatedly  issued circulars and worked out measures to ensure civil  aviation safety. In early 1993, the State Council approved and  distributed the "Circular on Proposals Concerning Civil Aviation  Safety." Not long ago, Jiang Zhuping, director of the Civil  Aviation Administration of China, once again emphatically  pointed out the need to develop civil aviation transportation in  a safe and coordinated way. He said that to strengthen  macro-control in China's civil aviation industry, the central  task is to resolve the issue of structural imbalance caused by  over-expansion. If there are too many air carriers, they would  disperse productivity and lower the scale merit. Unreasonable  and improper competition between different air carriers would  adversely affect their stable development. Therefore, in  purchasing more passenger planes, we must take into  consideration the operational and maintenance capabilities and  ensure that the ground facilities are able to cope with the  additional planes. Meanwhile, we must make proper arrangements  to adjust the flight schedules. Right now, the Civil Aviation  Administration of China has temporarily stopped to accept  applications for the establishment of any new airline. He also  emphatically pointed out: "From now on, those who seek to buy or  rent planes will have to go through a strict procedure according  to the regulation, and we will strengthen the control over the  purchase and rental of airplanes. We will also set up a network  of training centers to strengthen the training of flight  attendants to help them improve their services. We have imported  a batch of sophisticated navigational equipment, and established  the Beijing Flight Attendants Training Center and the Zhuhai  Flight Simulator Training Center to improve the technical and  management skills in China's civil aviation industry.  <H5>  Low Starting Point, Large Rate of Growth </H5>   The speed in the development of China's civil aviation  industry in recent years is eye-catching. An official of the  Civil Aviation Administration of China, named Liu pointed out:  There are 38 air carriers in China right now, including 25  regional ones and 13 air carriers under the direct  administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.  China has more than 600 civil aviation planes of all types,  offering a total of 47,267 seats. As of the early 1993, the  Civil Aviation Administration of China opened up 563 domestic  and international air routes including 492 domestic air routes  and serving 110 cities. There are 58 international air routes  serving 53 cities. There are 13 regional air routes. Additional  35 domestic air routes will be added between the spring of 1993  and that of 1994.    China's civil aviation industry was placed under the control  of the Chinese Air Force prior to 1980. Only after 1980, it was  placed under the leadership of the State Council and under the  administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.  There are six regional civil aviation administrations. This is  the first major change in the civil aviation administrative  system in China. Another reform took place from April 1987 in  the civil aviation administrative system on the Mainland. The  State Council approved the plan for the reform of the civil  aviation administrative system. Its basic train of thought is  that as government organizations, the Civil Aviation  Administration of China and its regional branches play a  supervisory and administrative role. The flight operation,  transportation, service and other production units form various  air carriers. They and the airports become economic entities  which manage their own affairs with an independent accounting  system for each department or air carrier. Airports in various  districts have also become independent. In order to cope with  this situation, six regional civil aviation administrations have  been set up to perform official functions. In 1993, China's  civil aviation industry has become more comprehensive and  established a large number of regional aviation companies.    The reform measures taken by China's civil aviation industry  have made its business booming. In 1992, its air transportation  volume stood at 4.26 billion ton/km, up 32 percent over 1991 and  13.2 times over 1978, after it registered a sharp increase of 30  percent in 1991 over that of 1990. Its rate of growth is 3.4  times greater than the world average during the same period.  During the first half of 1993, China's civil aviation industry  still saw rapid growth in transportation volume which stood at  2.38 billion ton/km. A total of 15.8 million passengers flew  China's skies during that period. China's civil aviation  industry is among the top ten in the world.    This official pointed out that six of the 13 aviation  companies under the direct administration of the Civil Aviation  Administration of China are key enterprises. They are as follows:    China International Aviation Corporation. Its insignia is a  red phoenix. It has a total of 62 planes with 97 international  and domestic air routes including 39 international and regional  air routes. Its assets, volume of sales and profits exceed other  air carriers in China.    China Eastern Airlines. Its insignia is a flying swallow. It  has a total of 66 planes with its base in Shanghai. It covers  the whole country and connects China with Southeast Asia and  Europe. It has a total of 130 air routes at present, going to  more than 50 cities in the country. It also has regular flights  to the United States, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Belgium, Spain  and other countries as well as Hong Kong. Not long ago, a  Eastern Airlines Group was formed with the air carrier as the  center. It has more than 30 enterprises handling businesses in  aviation, tourism, air kitchen, real estate, trading and  advertisement.    China Southern Airlines. Its insignia is a red kapok flower.  It has a total of 89 planes. It is one of the air carriers with  more international air routes. The China Southern Airlines Group  which operates with the air carrier as its center mainly handles  air transportation. It also handles other businesses such as  express parcel delivery by air, commercial advertisement,  in-flight catering service, imports and exports, hotels and  tourism.    China Southwestern Airlines. Its insignia is a roc. It has a  total of 33 planes.    China Northern Airlines. Its insignia looks like a flying  hawk and also like the rolling Changbai Mountains. It has a  total of 92 planes.    China Northwestern Airlines. Its insignia is a swan flying  through a sickle moon. It has a total of 42 planes.    Because of economic factors, most of the passengers on the  mainland are businessmen or government employees on business  trips. Therefore, China's air aviation industry can still barely  meet the needs of the market right now in addition to  maintaining scheduled flights. In 1992, the busiest flights were  those between Guangzhou and Shanghai. There were 4,826 such  flights, offering 1,033,363 seats. The rate of passenger  occupancy is 88.6 percent. The next is Guangzhou-Beijing. The  number of flights totalled 4,166 in 1992, offering 1,006,150  seats. Its rate of passenger occupancy was 88.2 percent and its  regular payload is 61 percent full. There were 3,304 flights  between Beijing and Shanghai, offering 1,130,800 seats. Its  regular payload was only 43.4 percent full. There were only 830  flights between Guangzhou and Fuzhou, offering 111,016 seats.  The rate of passenger occupancy reached 96.3 percent, ranking  top in the country. The Guangzhou-Fuzhou flights are the busiest  on the mainland. As compared with the average world rate of  passenger occupancy of 66.2 percent, it is quite obvious that  there are more passengers than China's air aviation industry can  possibly serve.    Although the development of China's air aviation industry is  fast, it still lags far behind the world advanced nations,  because China had a weak foundation in the past. For example,  the Beijing International Airport has the largest number of  takeoffs and landings on the mainland every year -- 68,000.  However, this figure is only 10 percent of the world's busiest  airport -- the Osaka International Airport. The Baiyun  International Airport has the largest capacity for handling  passengers in China -- 9.01 million, but that of the Gatewick  Airport in London is 18 million. Therefore, from a long-term  point of view, China's air aviation industry is not large  enough. Some related experts believe that a large number of  Chinese passenger planes are outmoded such as AN-12, AN-24,  Y-11, Y-5 and Y-7. Some of the planes should no longer be used,  but they are still flying. In addition, the number of passenger  will greatly increase, as China's economy is rapidly developing,  the nation is opening wider and wider to the outside world, the  people's living standards are rising, and there will be more and  more foreign tourists. If we do not develop our air  transportation as soon as possible, our civil aviation industry  will become a "bottleneck" of China's development.  <H5>  Shockwave From Regional Airlines </H5>   An upsurge to establish regional airlines was whipped up on  the mainland since 1992. This has created a shock wave in  China's aviation industry. People call it a regional airlines  shock wave.    China's first regional airlines is the Shanghai Airlines  established in 1985. Right now, there are 25 regional airlines.  Except for a few regional airlines, large ones have five to six  planes, while small ones have two to three planes. Some ones  even have no planes at all. The majority of them render  passenger services. On the one hand, the regional airlines help  make more seats available to passengers, while on the other  hand, they offer competition to the national airlines.    Right now, the business of the regional airlines is booming.  In 1992, the total air transportation volume of regional  airlines stood at 200 million tons, and nearly 3 million  passengers flew China's skies, marking increases of 47.4 percent  and 33.5 percent respectively over 1991.    However, the most serious threat to the national airlines  posed by the regional airlines is their competition for  professionally trained people. A pilot must finish four years of  studies at the Institute of Civil Aviation and go through six  years of flying while learning in order to become a competent  pilot who can fly a solo. China's air aviation industry is  unable to solve the problem of staff shortages and help its  staff members improve their quality within a short period,  because it takes so long to train professionals. Meanwhile,  staff shortages lead to fierce competition between the regional  airlines and the national airlines for professionally trained  people. Right now, about 150 pilots graduated from institutes of  all types each year. With the number of intermediate and  high-level engineering staff included, only 500 to 600  professionally trained people are available each year for the  air aviation industry. This is far from being enough. It is only  a drop of water in a bucket.    According to an estimate made by an official of the  Department of Personnel and Manpower under the Civil Aviation  Administration of China, a civil aviation pilot's annual income  including basic pay, flying pay, flight crew meal subsidy,  comprehensive and frugality bonus is about 14,000 yuan. However,  regional airlines pay their pilots several times more than their  national counterparts. This is a tremendous attraction to the  pilots. This year, there are 100 military pilots who have been  transferred to work for the civil aviation industry after some  training. One regional airlines with only one plane,  successfully recruited more than 20 of these pilots at one fell  swoop with high pay. Only slightly over 10 such pilots have been  hired by the large China International Aviation Corporation.  Engineers and mechanics are also in great demand. The  maintenance department of a national airline had more than 200  engineers and mechanics. Over 70 of them left for other airlines  which offered higher pay. When the Hainan Airlines was  established, more than half of the Boeing 737 maintenance staff  working for the China International Aviation Corporation left to  work for the Hainan Airlines. The leadership of the China  International Aviation Corporation is worried about this  situation, but there is nothing he can possibly do for the time  being.    Meanwhile, due to the fact that most of the regional  airlines only have a few planes, some of the pilots who have  been hired by the regional airlines with higher pay have little  chance to fly, causing waste. Besides, accidents are prone to  occur in newly established airlines, because they have weak  foundation, less capital and poor operational conditions. In  addition, they are using outmoded or even obsolete planes. They  also lack of supervision to ensure flight safety and  airworthiness. There were three plane crashes in 1992 that  involved new airlines.    A relative department in China believes that the excessively  rapid increase of the number of airlines has further aggravated  the structural imbalance in the civil aviation industry and  brought many problems to aviation safety. As early as the  beginning of 1993, the State Council, in a document it issued,  pointed out the need to examine and approve any application for  the establishment of any airline in strict accordance with the  regulations, procedure and standards. Other departments must  not handle such application without the proper authorization.  Special consideration must not be given to any locality or unit  that has not met the requirements for the establishment of any  airlines. The State Council document also stipulated that no  airplane or helicopter is allowed to take off by any person  without a license issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of  China or without a certificate of airworthiness for the plane.  In order to rationally solve the contradiction between the  regional airlines and the national airlines, fully utilize the  limited manpower and ensure maximum flight safety, the Civil  Aviation Administration of China had temporarily stopped to  accept any new application for the establishment of any new air  carrier from July 1993.    An official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China  said to our reporter that right now, the administration has  worked out some measures to restrict airline staff in switching  jobs. The regional airlines are not allowed to contact pilots of  other airlines privately for job switching. If there is a need,  negotiations should be carried out between airlines to solve  problems. The national airlines may lease or transfer personnel  to help regional airlines develop themselves. Flight crews or  mechanics who privately switch jobs without authorization may  lose their licenses to fly or do aircraft maintenance work.  Airline, airport and flight control personnel are not allowed to  accept side jobs.  <H5>  Major Adjustments in Airline Ticket Price </H5>   For many years, China has implemented a system of dual  ticket price. That is, the officially announced price as well as  the discount price. Foreigners and residents of Hong Kong and  Macao buy their airline tickets at the official price, while  mainland passengers buy their tickets at the discount price with  the latter about 30 percent lower than the former. Both the  national or the regional airlines sell their tickets at the  unified price. They have no authority to change prices for their  tickets.    An engineer who is in charge of ticketing in the Beijing  Civil Aviation Building said, the official ticket price in 1992  is approximately 0.5 yuan per km, while the discount price is  0.31 to 0.34 yuan per km. For example, the officially announced  ticket price between Beijing and Guangzhou is 0.5 yuan per km,  while the discount ticket price is 0.34 yuan per km. The price  structure for about 90 percent of the flights on the Mainland is  like that. The ticket price for flights between Guangzhou and  Guilin is slightly exceptional. The officially announced ticket  price is 0.72 yuan per km, while the discount ticket price is  0.34 yuan per km. In addition, the price is comparatively higher  for flights of shorter distances. For example, the ticket prices  for flights between Guangzhou and Swatow are 0.92 and 0.97 yuan  respectively, while prices for flights between Guangzhou and  Chanjiang are 0.9 and 0.94 yuan respectively. Besides, foreign  residents must use foreign exchange certificates to purchase  tickets.    The dual ticket price system confuses foreign residents.  They  are not so happy. This system causes a great deal of  inconvenience. The leadership of the Civil Aviation  Administration also believes that this system is unable to keep  pace with the developing market economy and the opening-up  program. It makes China's air aviation industry less  competitive. It is against international practice, and should  be reformed. In June 1993, the Civil Aviation Administration  issued a circular to temporarily put the officially announced  price into effect from 25 June for passenger tickets on 114 busy  air routes from Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other localities. That  meant the abolishment of the discount price. Domestic and  foreign passengers must buy tickets in accordance with the  existing officially announced price list. Taking the officially  announced price list for these 114 air routes as the highest  limit, various air carriers have the authority to give their  passengers up to 20 percent rebate. The Southern Airlines  operates on 56 of the aforementioned 114 air routes.    On reforming the ticket price system, an official of the  Civil Aviation Administration believes that China's civil  aviation industry has begun to follow the international  practice. It has also given various air carriers even greater  power to manage their own business. From now on, various air  carriers may adjust their price list according to market demand  whenever conditions permit without the approval of the Civil  Aviation Administration. This encourages various air carriers to  compete with one another and improve their services.    Right now, various air carriers on the mainland have adopted  measures to attract passengers. The China Southern Airlines has  stipulated that passengers in group of ten may purchase group  tickets at a 10 percent discount. A 10 percent discount is also  given to any passenger who buys a round trip ticket between  Guangzhou and Tianjin and between Guangzhou and Shenyang.  <H5>  Structural Reform Is Key </H5>   Nearly all the people interviewed talked about issues on  reforming China's civil aviation industry. All of them believe  that without reforming itself, this industry has no way out.  Structurally China's civil aviation industry is gradually  turning the enterprises under its administration into a modern  corporate system. It is changing the situation whereas the  functions of government are mixed up with those of the  enterprises. This industry is becoming more and more  market-oriented and competitive so that it can set up a modern  enterprise system. Right now, there are two large civil  aviation groups -- the Southern Civil Aviation Group with the  China Southern Airlines as the mainstay and the Eastern Civil  Aviation Group with the China Eastern Airlines as the mainstay.  In addition, the China International Aviation Corporation which  has not yet formed any group because of personnel changes will  do so in the future. By forming groups, China's aviation  enterprises would have more power in managing their own  businesses. To form enterprise groups is an important measure to  improve the industrial structure of China's civil aviation  industry.    As for the investment system, China's civil aviation  industry will adopt the form of limited-liability companies to  raise its funds in society. Regional air carriers are welcome to  cooperate with and buy shares of main national air carriers.  China's civil aviation industry will support the various  localities to build airports, and it will share risks and  profits with them. As for capital, we may expand the scope of  business of Sino-foreign joint ventures and strengthen  international cooperation. Foreign airlines may become  shareholders of China's air carriers, and airports may be built  by Sino-foreign joint ventures. Foreign residents may be invited  to work as managers or consultants in order to make full use of  their managerial experience to improve management.    In fact, China has already attained some achievements in  opening its civil aviation market and attracting foreign  investments for its civil aviation industry. By the beginning  of 1993, the amount of foreign investments used in China's civil  aviation had exceeded US$5 billion. Some of the funds have been  used to rent 126 planes and set up 12 Sino-foreign joint and  cooperative ventures. The first Sino-foreign joint venture for  China's civil aviation industry is the Beijing Air Catering  Limited which is a joint venture with Hong Kong. The China  International Aviation Cooperation and the Lufthansa Germany  Airlines set up a joint venture called the Beijing Aircraft  Maintenance Engineering Ltd., forming a base area for doing  maintenance service to European and U.S. planes according to  international standards.    In order to meet the rapidly increasing social demands,  China's civil aviation has imported a large number of planes and  become one of largest buyers on the world aircraft market.  Since 1992, China's civil aviation industry has taken over 80  planes, including 65 passenger planes. In March 1993, it had  again ordered 20 Boeing 737 planes and one Boeing 757 plane.    In the early days, China's civil aviation industry had  already used foreign loans to rent planes. It also used its own  funds and special state loans to rent 238 large- and  medium-sized planes from abroad. Only in 1992 alone, it had  imported 25 planes with US$1.25 billion financed by the  Mitsubishi Trust Bank, the Hong Kong Ting Hip International  Leasing Company, the Hong Kong Bark Tat Leasing Company and the  U.S. Xinfu Company. In addition, China had begun to raise China  Aviation Funds abroad since last year. The first batch of such  funds in the amount of US$66.6 million has been secured.  Securities in the name of China Aviation Funds are already on  the European stock market.    Right now, foreign investments in China's civil aviation  industry are still limited to the building of airports, the  purchase of maintenance equipment and the development of other  infrastructural facilities. For example, the Wuhan Airport is  built by a joint venture between the Hong Kong New World Group  and the Wuhan City government. The Xiamen Butterfield and Swire  Aircraft Engineering Company Ltd, is one with six shareholders.  The Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Ltd, has a 41 percent  share, the Chinese side a 29 percent share and 10 percent each  by the Hong Kong Cathay Airlines, the Japan Airlines and the  Singapore Airlines Engineering Company Ltd.    Nevertheless, China's civil aviation industry remains weak  in flight control, aircraft maintenance and flight crew  training. There still exist all types of unfavorable factors in  this industry. In early 1993, the leadership of the Civil  Aviation Administration of China had considered the  establishment of air carriers in the form of joint ventures.  According to well-informed sources, the relevant departments in  China are prepared to work out some regulations for the  establishment of airlines in the form of joint ventures, but at  the present moment no such regulations have been announced.  Therefore, China's civil aviation still has a long way to go  before it attains a spectacular development and makes tremendous  progress.</p>

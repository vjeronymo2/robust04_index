			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The good news that overseas buyers bought a little over Pounds 1.1bn of gilts in March has its counterpart in data on purchases by other investors. Banks and building societies bought Pounds 1.3bn, other UK investors only Pounds 370m. The figures may have been distorted by the March auction which was only settled in April. However it looks as though institutional interest reported during March was more related to switching out along the yield curve than outright buying. Institutions' reluctance to commit much new money to gilts is disconcerting given the fickleness of both overseas and bank buyers. In public most banks have professed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for gilts. Those that have built up their holdings have less incentive now that hopes of lower base rates have faded. Understandably liquidity worries are growing in the gilt market, which is expecting a new auction announcement soon as well as large calls in existing issues. Overseas buyers are less likely to come to the rescue now that sterling's failure to rise above DM 2.50 has cast doubts about its room for further appreciation. Insofar as this reflects Bank of England intervention, the authorities are making life more difficult for themselves. Already in March, PSBR funding was offset by about Pounds 1.6bn in intervention, presumably to replace the money spent defending the ERM parity. The longer that continues, the more gilts the Bank will have to sell.</p>

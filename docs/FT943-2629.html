			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (18): Bargain hunters back on the road - Investing in classic cars / Prices have stalled, but the cheaper end of the market is revving up again The pain of burned fingers is still being endured by many who invested in the classic and exotic car boom of the late 1980s. Throughout this year some dispiriting dramas have been played out in the salerooms of Brooks, Coys, Christies and other of the principal auction houses through which a large percentage of the world's more valuable and interesting cars changes hands. Owners of many cars bought near the peak of the boom in 1989 have seen values plummet to levels they would not have thought possible. In 1989, the 'middle market' of collectibles, embracing a multitude of Ferraris, Aston Martins, gull-wing Mercedes, SS Jaguars and other minor exotica, spanned a price range of Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 700,000. Today, those same cars will fetch between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 125,000. The top end of the market has frequently fared little better. In 1989, Aston Martin DBR2/2, one of the illustrious Le Mans 24-Hours racing cars of the 1950s, went under the hammer at Brooks for Pounds 2.1m. In June of this year, at the Brooks sale during the Earl of March's festival of speed at Goodwood, bidding on its DBR2/1 sister car - in better condition and with an even greater racing pedigree - sputtered to a halt at Pounds 840,000. The car remained unsold. But it's not all bad. The cheaper end of the market - that is, up to Pounds 20,000 - has become quite active again. And, in the middle market, bargain-hunters have already reappeared in some numbers to mop up cars reluctantly being sold by owners no longer able to withstand pressure from their bankers - or by the banks themselves liquidating debtors' assets. Auction house principal Robert Brooks and his colleagues acknowledge readily that those who came to the classic-car market in the late 1980s strictly as speculators will never be back. Nor do they expect to experience within the forseeable future a repetition of the late 1980s bubble - 'prices were crazy,' acknowledges Brooks. But what the current situation does mean is that there is now plenty of scope for wealthy individuals to indulge an enthusiasm for classic and exotic cars, without necessarily having to pay a financial penalty for such enthusiasm - and with at least some prospect of long-term gain. A well-chosen chosen 'stable' of cars, bought now, as most sectors of the classic market continue slowly to lift off the market bottom, is certain to sustain modest value gains over the coming years. As an example, such a stable is quite likely to include the Jaguar E-Type, one of the most popular classics and a public sensation when it was launched in the early 1960s as the first fairly affordable 150mph sports car. While the prices bubble was still growing, many E-Types had Pounds 50,000-Pounds 60,000 spent on them, to bring them up to concours condition, in the expectation by their owners that they would achieve Pounds 100,000-plus in the auction rooms. Such cars are typically being sold for around Pounds 30,000, and by almost any measure must be accounted a bargain if the restoration work has been done well. At more exalted levels, Brooks insists there is even the prospect of substantial gains for those prepared and financially able to invest strategically at the very top end of the market - a commitment admittedly requiring the expenditure of several millions at least. 'If someone is prepared to make a collection of 30-40 cars, buy only the very, very best and take an eight-to-10 year view, then I cannot think that an investor would lose,' he maintains. This, however, is to view the investor once again as dispassionate speculator. Those professionally involved with the classic and historic cars would maintain that, for such investments to make full sense, the cars themselves must be used and enjoyed, not stashed away in a heated motor-house. The auction houses that dominate this esoteric trade - only around a quarter of sales are believed to be accounted for by private treaty - are well to the fore in promoting their use. Coys, the Kensington-based auction house, backs the annual International Historic Festival of Speed at Silverstone in July, where hundreds of such cars are raced and otherwise put through their paces. Brooks is a backer of the Earl of March at the Goodwood festival. Neither puts up the funding out of unalloyed enthusiam - both events provide a showcase for simultaneous auctions, and a reason for potential buyers to converge from all around the globe in what is now unquestionably an international market. But the occasions do provide the proof that many owners are indeed getting much more out of their investment than a financial return. The sector could have provided a more appropriate alternative for a wealthy group of individuals who asked a US investment banker, in the late 1970s, whether they should invest in the ill-fated DeLorean sports-car project. Back came the reply that they should put the money into wine and women instead - 'You'll get the same return and have a lot more fun.' Over a decade, even the few DeLoreans made have been appreciating slowly.</p>

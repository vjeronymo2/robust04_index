			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Companies urged to audit interim financial statements COMPANIES will be urged to obtain audits of their interim financial statements instead of relying on a single annual audit in a wide-ranging report on corporate governance due out tomorrow. The recommendation is to be included in the final draft report from the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, the chairman of which is Sir Adrian Cadbury. The recommendation, like many others in the report, is likely to spark controversy both from those who feel it goes too far and from those who believe it does not go far enough. While many of its recommendations deal with the presentation of accounts, it will urge a number of reforms to board structures, including a larger role for non-executive directors with specific obligations towards shareholders. It will also press for greater disclosure of certain kinds of information beyond the corporate accounts. While no company need comply with its recommendations, the report will urge the Stock Exchange to adopt a new listing requirement to force companies at least to disclose the extent to which they comply with the Cadbury Committee's recommendations. Since Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the Stock Exchange chairman, is a member of the committee and was instrumental in its establishment, the rule is expected to be adopted. The evolution of the committee, launched last spring, has its roots in the accountancy profession. Mr Michael Lickiss, former chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, and Sir Andrew Hugh Smith organised its creation, galvanised partly by several well-publicised corporate collapses which were nowhere reflected in their financial statements. The committee's founders, therefore, felt the greatest reforms were needed in accountancy and auditing procedures. For instance, the committee's suggestion that interim statements be audited comes as institutional investors are increasingly questioning the reliability of corporate accounts between the audited periods. Earlier this year, a call for the auditing of preliminary statements was issued by the auditing committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. But Sir Ron said that, while the Cadbury Committee was being drawn up, its founders realised that the structure of boards of directors and their relationship with shareholders needed review as well. The report is expected to include these recommendations: Each board shall have separate audit and remuneration committees composed entirely of non-executive directors - a move that could force all boards to include at least two non-executives. Performance-related pay elements of each director's remuneration shall be disclosed. Directors' terms of office should run for no more than three years. Companies shall be required to make funds available to non-executive directors wishing to get independent professional advice on certain corporate matters. Ways to make the annual general meeting a forum for small shareholders to obtain information and voice their concerns. Several of the recommendations are likely to disturb a large number of directors. The investment company 3i, in a survey of finance directors at some of the UK's largest companies, found that 82 per cent opposed giving shareholders representation on remuneration committees, while 78 per cent opposed their representation on audit committees. A number of the Cadbury report's suggestions have been opposed by the Confederation of British Industry. However, the report is likely to fall short of what had been sought by the more hawkish institutional investors, some of which have urged that directors' remuneration packages and terms of office be disclosed annually and that US-style accounting reports be introduced to help shareholders learn more about the profitability of corporate subsidiaries. It is also likely to fall short of what some Labour MPs had hoped for.</p>

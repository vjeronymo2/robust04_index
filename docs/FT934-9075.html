			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Lib Dem by-election win eases fears FEARS of rising support for far-right parties were eased last night when the Liberal Democrats took a council seat in Feltham South, west London, with a 15-vote majority, forcing the National Front candidate into fourth place. The NF candidate, Mr Raymond O'Connor, was expelled from the local Conservative association earlier in the week. The results were: Mr Roy Haines (Lib Dem) 984; Ms Lynda Walmsley (Lab) 969; Mr Anthony Gurrin (C) 367; and Mr Raymond O'Connor (NF) 261.</p>

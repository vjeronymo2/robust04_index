			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] HAMAS [Islamic Society Movement] issued a statement  in which it appealed to the Algerian people and all the sides in  the opposition to shoulder the historic responsibility before  God and before the nation.    In its appeal to the authority and the Islamic Salvation  Front (FIS) and other parties and forces, Hamas underlines the  need to participate in ending bloodshed, the destruction of  installations, the threatening of worshipers, and for the need  to stop statements for scoring one-upmanship and for bargaining.  All must work for restoring tranquillity and must safeguard the  supreme interest of the homeland.</p>

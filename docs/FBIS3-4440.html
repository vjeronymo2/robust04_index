And he said that he believes the tour has provided the  momentum to unfold a new age for the Asia-Pacific region with  South Korea, Japan and China walking hand in hand.    Kim explained that in discussions with Japan's Prime  Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa he had explored ways to further promote mutual  cooperation, and in China he had shared with President Jiang  Zemin the view that peace and stability on the Korean peninsula  are essential to maintain that state for the whole of Northeast  Asia.    He added that South Korea and China have an identical view  on  the realization of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula  and that the two countries will cooperate closely in resolving  the nuclear dispute over site inspections with the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    He said he believed that his visit to China has laid a solid  foundation for strengthening economic cooperation between the  two countries.    Kim paid a state visit to China from March 26 to 30 after  his  three-day visit to Japan, his first visit to China since he  assumed office in February last year.</p>

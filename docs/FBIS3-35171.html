Had this been true, U.S. national security would appear  fragile and more like a paper tiger just when various U.S.  sources testify to the opposite.    Ambassador 'Imran said what is true is that the continuation  of U.S. threats and UN sanctions against Libya represent a  threat to stability in the Middle East.    He noted that the Arab League is continuing its efforts to  settle the Libyan-Western crisis in a way that would protect  Libya's dignity and sovereignty and remove the misunderstanding  between it and the countries concerned.    Ambassador 'Imran added that what has been clear since the  first UN Security Council resolution was issued against Libya is  that the Western countries have exploited the Security Council  and the international situation to pass resolutions without fear  from any party.    He expressed the view that these resolutions are contrary to  the UN Charter, the constitution of the international  organization, which confirms the right of every state to  exercise sovereignty over its own territory.    He explained that these resolutions set a serious precedent  which shakes the confidence of the nations in this organization.  For this reason the Arab League has called for a suitable  solution to this crisis.</p>

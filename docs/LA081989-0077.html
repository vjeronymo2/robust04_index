			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES DROPPED IN ENDANGERMENT CASE  </P> <P> The district attorney's office in Pomona on Friday dropped felony charges  against an Albuquerque, N.M., man accused of endangering six boys when he took  them on a trip to California.  </P> <P> The case was dismissed because the boys' mothers told authorities that the man  was innocent and refused to testify in the case.  </P> <P> Gary Steven Davis, 37, had been arrested July 27 after one of the boys, Robby  Criner, 11, was discovered by a sheriff's deputy as the boy was trying to sell  candy in a Diamond Bar K mart parking lot. After interviewing the six children,  authorities believed that Davis had forced the boys to sell candy in exchange  for a trip to Disneyland and that Davis had neglected to feed them and lodged  them in a Pomona motel frequented by prostitutes, drug dealers and gang  members.  </P> <P> But shortly after Davis was released Aug. 3 on $1,500 bail, the boys recanted  parts of their stories, contending that Davis followed through on his promise  to take them to Disneyland and never neglected them, according to Deputy Dist.  Atty. Michael Yglecias. One of the boys' mothers described Davis as a  "trustworthy" man who had kept the boys out of trouble, prosecutors said.  </P></p>

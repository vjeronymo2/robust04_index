			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (31): Not everyone has come aboard - Efforts to create a level playing field for exporters have a long way to go / International standards The emergence of global trading blocks and the opening of frontiers to the freer flow of goods have given impetus to the view that international standards can help trade grow, while protecting consumers from unsuitable products. Standardisation is an important consideration in a company's development plan, but it generates mixed emotions. Ignored by many companies until they find their product is outside the specifications of the export market they seek, some non-European exporters say Europe-wide standards are a block on their business. Within Europe, there are complaints that multinationals show little enthusiasm for introducing standards which would allow a much wider number of companies to trade across Europe. The EU strongly denies that standards are a block on trade. It allocates funds and technical assistance to strengthening standards bodies in developing country trading partners. It has also started work on the difficult process of bringing standards closer together. This centres on the mutual recognition of certification and testing bodies in the different European countries. The introduction of standards usually follows a period of industry consultation. Except in the most controversial cases, it rarely makes headlines. So quiet is the process that a lack of lobbying by consumer groups is, arguably, apparent in the drawing up of European standards. Few industry groups, for example, have bothered to reply to EU requests for ideas in drawing up mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with the US, Japan and other leading trading partners. The EU argues that industry input is essential in drawing up lists of priority products to be included in the planned MRAs. The Geneva-based International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is responsible for drawing up international standards, including the ISO9000 quality assurance standard. CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, is responsible for introducing identical standards across Europe - a key element in the EU's single market initiative. While Europe has taken a lead in the move towards international standards, other trading blocs, including the North American Free Trade Area and Japan, are taking a closer interest. But, even in Europe, the move to international standards remains a long-term process. 'It took Germany 50 years to build a strong caucus of standards,' says Jacques Repussard, CEN secretary general. 'To replace this and construct them at a European level will take 30 to 40 years.' Mr Repussard expects 80 per cent of national standards included in the EU's single market directives to be harmonised in 1995-96. But these account for only about 10 per cent of the standards covered by CEN. Mr Repussard says CEN's long-term plan is to produce 10,000 standards, of which 1,200 are published and 2,000 more are under way. The aim of all this, Mr Repussard says, 'is to have a level playing field for the economy'. The main beneficiaries are small and medium-size companies (SMEs) who, when they only have to take one standard into account, can trade more easily across borders. Multinationals have invested to meet national standards in a range of markets. In some cases, they have tried to block measures 'which would allow SMEs into their garden,' Mr Repussard says. 'A more level playing field means more people playing in it.' The EU plans to go further by concluding mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) authorising bodies in countries with reciprocal agreements to certify that goods meet EU requirements. Exploratory talks on MRAs with 10 leading trading partners were held in 1992-93. Full negotiations recently started with Australia, New Zealand and Canada and are planned shortly with the US. The EU has identified four areas in which MRAs could reduce barriers: differing technical requirements at national, state, provincial and local levels; a lack of transparency in the operation of standardisation and certification systems; labelling, marking and intellectual property barriers; differences in product liability requirements. In spite of the willingness of countries to enter into talks on standardisation, the process could take a long time, officials say. 'Australia and New Zealand know the European market is important and are ready to make their systems evolve to meet ours,' a European official says. US agencies are active in CEN and other European committees and have observer status in the ISO. But when it comes to more profound change, powerful opposition exists among federal agencies, industrial associations and local government. Japan has proved most reluctant to enter talks, and has only recently made a first step by opening negotiations on a good laboratory practices agreement. Outside Europe and the OECD, exporters often complain that the implementation of rigorous standards blocks their access to markets. Developing local standards bodies and mutual recognition capacity is essential. In many cases, including Russia, technical assistance is seen as more important than immediate agreements. Bodies such as the certification agencies SGS and Veritas, and Resource, a British Standards Institute affiliate, have been active analysing these countries' needs and, in some cases, helping to establish testing and certification bodies to meet international standards. Studies have been financed through the Commission's Phare Programme for central and eastern Europe and the Tacis programme for the former Soviet Union. Studies have been carried out in Latin America, the Asean region and India. Under way are projects in Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia. Mr Repussard says that CEN's emphasis on promoting standards bodies in emerging markets has been much appreciated in eastern Europe, where 'governments say for the first time we have something European'. Poland and other ex-communist countries still work under the old Comecon standards system known as Gost, but Poland and Hungary are now involved in about 100 CEN technical committees and will probably be full members by the end of the century. Similar radical change is expected even in the most advanced economies. In the next few years standardisation procedures will increasingly be required for fast-developing information technology and services industries. 'The challenge for CEN is to get everyone on board for the massive negotiations ahead,' Mr Repussard says. It may not prove an easy task.</p>

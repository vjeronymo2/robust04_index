			<p>BFN     [Text] At a House of Representatives' Budget Committee  meeting on 8 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on the  DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons. He said: "The  situation will become serious if nuclear arms development should  progress. In some cases, sanctions will be necessary to deal  with such a situation. In a conflict of power, I think  (imposing sanctions) is effective under certain circumstances."  In this way, the prime minister stressed the effectiveness of  sanctions by the UN Security Council.</p>

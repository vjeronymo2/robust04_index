			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nobel blames currency losses for halved profits NOBEL Industries, the Swedish chemicals group, yesterday blamed poor management and weak control for SKr750m (Dollars 97.6m) in foreign exchange losses which more than halved 1992 profits to SKr200m. The result is much worse than predicted last October when the group said 1992 profits would exceed 1991's SKr460m. The weakening of the krona in the final months of last year lowered the group's result by SKr300m. Mr Ove Mattsson, president and chief executive, said no unauthorised transactions had come to light, but he admitted the group had made excessive provisions for its tax exposure and said human error was partly to blame. He did not rule out the possibility of some staff being dismissed on the completion of an inquiry into the group's finance and control functions. The group is taking immediate steps to correct its tax hedging position, although it admits that a further weakening of the krona since the start of 1993 will result in additional foreign exchange losses of SKr150m at current exchange rates. It said it still had SKr2bn in open currency positions caused by tax-related hedging. Mr Mattsson said SKr450m of last year's foreign exchange losses could be blamed on hedging designed to limit the group's exposure to Swedish tax on foreign assets. However, he stressed that this process became unnecessary when the group's tax position changed in 1991 (it accumulated large tax loss carry-forwards after the restructuring of the stricken finance company Gamlestaden) and it should have changed its policy sooner. The remaining SKr300m of exchange losses arose because 'we were unable to protect all our positions and because of human error. It was a question of late action and lack of communication,' said Mr Mattsson. Shares in Nobel were suspended on Tuesday pending the results announcement and resumed trading yesterday. The company said it requested the suspension because it did not want to mislead the market when disclosing a separate deal under which it will sell its defence electronics operations to the state-owned Celsius group for SKr1.55bn. Nobel stressed that its underlying business activities were performing well, producing 1992 earnings after depreciation of SKr1.39bn, against SKr1.42bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (5): Volatile political fortunes  -Linda Bilmes assesses one of the first studies of Russia's progress towards a free-market capitalist economy / Privatisation in Russia 'PROPERTY TO THE PEOPLE' by Lynn D. Nelson and Irina Y. Kuzes M. E. Sharpe Dollars 19.95, 267 pages Russia has changed so rapidly during the past three years that it is difficult to understand just how it happened. The country's evolution - from a socialist, centrally-controlled economy toward a capitalist, privatised one - has been moulded by the volatile political fortunes of Russia's leading politicians and economists. The most tangible result of economic reform - the privatisation of Russia's shops, factories and agricultural land - was by no means pre-ordained. So it is most welcome to all students of Russian political economy that Professor Lynn Nelson, of Virginia Commonwealth University, and Russian urban planner Irina Kuzes have published a study of what is clearly the first chapter of the Russian privatisation story. The book, which covers the period from October 1991 through the Yeltsin referendum in April 1993, offers an account of the privatisation process, with particular emphasis on the political background to key economic events. The authors base their analysis on interviews with the architects of Russian privatisation, Anatoly Chubais and Dmitri Vasiliev, on Russian news coverage, opinion polls, and on their own survey of decision makers in four Russian cities: Moscow, Ekaterinberg, Voronezh and Smolensk. What the authors do best is to unravel the economic strategies and political motives of those who have been involved in Russian economic reform. The period prior to the attempted putsch in August 1991 was characterised by a struggle for power; Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, Grigory Yavlinsky, Stanislav Shatalin, Abel Aganbejian, and Yegor Gaidar all vied for the right to steer Russia's economic course. The book helps to explain their different approaches, and to analyse why certain proposals were never implemented. The book also documents the extent to which Mr Yeltsin's popularity has been tied to economic performance, and how he has personally intervened in every major economic decision. The fascinating fourth chapter of the book sheds new light on the events that led up to the creation of the State Property Management Committee (GKI) and its privatisation programme. For example, in the controversy surrounding the use of cash-redeemable vouchers, the authors state that Yavlinsky had argued against vouchers, predicting that they would either lose value or fuel inflation. However Mr Yeltsin saw vouchers as a way to divide state property among millions of people; hence the political objectives of the voucher idea came to override the potential economic drawbacks. Regarding Mr Gaidar's fall from power in December 1992, the authors cite a mismatch between Mr Gaidar's upbeat economic predictions and the deteriorating economy. And the authors document how inflation became the pivotal issue in the power struggle between reformers and conservatives. The book covers the nitty-gritty details of the privatisation law, describing the auction process, the role of local privatisation commissions, and the voucher distribution system. What is new is the perspective of those on the receiving end of privatisation - gleaned from the authors' survey of decision-makers in four Russian cities. Responses to the questionnaire, which includes measures of job satisfaction, decision-making authority, and attitude to privatisation, are woven into the text and also recorded in the appendix. The analysis shows that in 1992, an overwhelming majority of people supported the idea of privatisation, although fewer supported the government's methods of implementing it. One hesitates to criticise a book which is one of the very first studies of Russia's remarkable privatisation drive. Nevertheless, the book suffers from the fact that neither Nelson nor Kuzes are economists. For example, the authors are dismissive of GKI Deputy Minister Vasiliev's defence of the price liberalisation in October 1991, reporting that acute food shortages occurred three months after the price liberalisation was put in place. They imply that price liberalisation caused the food shortages. Although some economists have linked these two events, the subject is controversial and complex, with factors such as contracting gross domestic product, a complete breakdown in storage and distribution, and falling productivity all contributing to the shortages. Overall, however, this book is highly recommended reading for anyone who has watched the Russian economy during this period. With the second phase of privatisation now under way in Russia - covering divisive issues such as land and health care - the authors' second volume will be eagerly awaited.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS TREE WARS: Fashion Island once boasted that the eight-story white  firs erected there each Christmastime were the tallest in the nation, but the  Douglas fir at the National Enquirer's offices in Florida proved to be one  story taller. . . . After winning that commercial tree derby in 1987, the  Enquirer retired from competition, but Florida seems intent on regaining the  title. . . . This year's 110-footer at Fashion Island will come up short when  Miami unveils it 144-foot tree. . . . The all-time record: a 221-foot Douglas  fir at a Seattle shopping center in 1950.

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Independent's founder rolls up his sleeves Mr Andreas Whittam Smith has decided to take a decisive grip on the loss-making paper he founded by coming out of his office and editing The Independent from the home news desk. After months of talks and negotiations about the future of Newspaper Publishing - owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday - Mr Whittam Smith has decided it is time to roll up his sleeves and work his way out of trouble. For the past 10 days he has been on the news desk, briefing reporters and choosing stories, and he intends to stay there for some time. 'The home news desk is the driving force of the paper,' says Mr Whittam Smith, conceding that perhaps he was better at working with words and pictures than issuing generalisations and grand statements from an editor's office. After a long spell on the home news desk, the man who may soon be chairman as well as editor-in-chief, will move on to work on the foreign desk and even the sports desk. Mr Whittam Smith was discussing his new role on the day the consortium of which he is part received the blessing of the independent directors for an improved offer for the company, in particular a cash offer of 355p. This values the company at more than Pounds 74m. Mr Whittam Smith said he would eat his hat if the consortium - which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - did not take its present 47 per cent stake quickly above 50 per cent. However, it may be the week after next before Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decides whether to refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The company has warned the Department of Trade and Industry that a further three months of uncertainty caused by referring the matter to the MMC would be 'seriously damaging' to the business. Whatever happens, Mr Whittam Smith is going to have his work cut out. Last month Independent sales settled at about 285,000 with the Independent on Sunday selling about 350,000. Losses in the financial year to September could be between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m compared with Pounds 480,000 last year. The independent directors, however, are pleased at the price they have persuaded the consortium to offer, that 'certain pledges' have been made about editorial independence and that redundancy terms will be those generally available at Newspaper Publishing over the past three years. MGN, which could end up with between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the company, will have a detailed service contract to provide all the needs of Newspaper Publishing including printing, excluding editorial, and what Mr Whittam Smith calls the company's 'marketing brain'. MGN will be paid according to running costs, spread across all the national titles of the two organisations rather than a fixed annual fee. There will be penalty clauses for failure to meet performance targets. About 120 redundancies are expected at Newspaper Publishing among non-editorial staff. The company also said it had sought and received assurances that Independent staff would be given an equal opportunity with existing MGN staff for new jobs under the pooled organisation. The position of Mr Tony O'Reilly whose Independent Newspapers group of Ireland holds 29.99 per cent, is another uncertainty although the company is expected to keep its stake as the largest individual shareholder. The mood of Independent journalists, worried about whether guarantees of editorial independence could really be believed, was described yesterday as 'very glum'. But Mr Whittam Smith was much more optimistic. 'I think the future is going to be one of steady improvement,' he said.</p>

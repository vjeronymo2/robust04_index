In Medellin, capital of Antioquia Department, northwest of  here, and Santa Fe de Bogota these actions occurred for the  second time in a little less than one week, carried out by  members of student and youth organizations, the sources added.    The first contingent of U.S. military troops arrived on the  Colombian Pacific Coast late in December with the announced  purpose of building a school and hospital in that region.    There are currently some 259 U.S. troops, who must leave  Colombia in three months, although journalistic circles speak of  a possible extension of their stay.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: M&amp;S advances A mixed performance in the stores sector saw shares in Kingfisher battling and Marks and Spencer gathering plaudits. Kingfisher lost 4 at 665p after fighting back from a day's low of 660p. Some market-watchers blamed fallout from recurring DIY fears after Do It All's recent reported performance, but others saw the stock embarking on a rocky rebalancing act at the end of a good run. Interest rate disappointment in Europe, especially concerning Kingfisher's French interests, cannot have helped the stock. M&amp;S proved favourite of the sector, and was said to have attracted significant US interest in a turnover of 4.6m. The shares climbed 8 to 373p. One analyst said the squeeze in M&amp;S shares added to their strength. Another put some of their performance down to the fact that the stock often acts as a proxy for the sector, and if investors want to increase their exposure to stores then M&amp;S is often the recipient of their money. The oil majors were again among the FT-SE 100's best performers, with the recent upsurge of interest in the oil sector once more being focused on the two biggest of the oil stocks, BP and Shell. Dealers said US institutions returned in force to buy the two stocks, in spite of the early uncertainty displayed by Wall Street. Goldman Sachs was said to have been among the most aggressive buyers of the oils, which were additionally boosted by an acute stock shortage. UK oil analysts said the main thrust of the US buying argument for the UK oil stocks was that they look cheap on a cash flow basis compared with their US counterparts. BP moved up 3 1/2 more to 321p on continuing heavy turnover of 9.8m shares. The stock has risen from 298p since the start of the week. Shell put on 2 1/2 at 674p on 2.9m traded, with oil specialists noting large-scale switching into Shell from Royal Dutch, citing the yield argument. Enterprise Oil continued to move ahead, adding 3 at 451p. Lasmo came under pressure at the outset, slipping to 142p in the wake of some determined profit-taking, but began to edge forward later in the session, eventually standing a net penny ahead at 146p. Turnover in the stock was 2.8m shares, well down from recent levels. Calor Group, a strong market all week following a buy note issued by Hoare Govett, ended 9 higher at 274p, its best level since June 1990. Hardy Oil appreciated 7 to 171p, still boosted by recent broker visits and buy recommendations. Among the second-liners, exploration hopes lifted Pict Petroleum by 8 to 126p. The utilities areas of the market made good progress early in the session, with institutions said to have chased the regional electricity stocks, generators and water issues higher amid hopes that any early cuts in European interest rates would continue to focus investors' minds on the high yields available in those areas. The absence of a cut in German rates, however, was the trigger for a widespread bout of profit-taking in the utilities, which generally closed with losses on the day. Severn Trent was one of the water sector's most prominent performers early in the session, the shares moving up to 553p at one point after a strong buy recommendation issued by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker. CLL's Mr Robert Giles said: 'The high quality of the underlying businesses and robust financial position make Severn Trent the best value of the major water stocks.' The stock turned tail later with the rest of the market and closed unaltered at 541p after good turnover of 1.5m. The other water issues in the FT-SE 100 ended down on the day, with Thames 3 off at 539p, North West 5 lower at 515p and Anglian 2 easier at 527p. The leading drug stocks were among the market's laggards, suffering from sustained selling pressure on both sides of the Atlantic after their recent strong gains. Glaxo, heavily traded in both the stock market and the traded options market, fell 10 to 573p, with turnover of 3.3m accompanied by the equivalent of 3.3m traded in the options. Yield seeking investors once again went shopping for BICC, which improved 6 to 408p. The shortage of stock in Smiths Industries continued and the shares advanced another 5 to 385p. Babcock International was strongly traded. Volume rose to a hefty 14m. The day's total included a block of 4.5m done at 44p, and another of 5.3m at 43 1/2 p. The shares closed  1/2 lighter at 45p. One of the day's biggest falls was recorded in Glasgow-based pumps and valves manufacturer Weir Group, which disappointed the market with a 10 per cent decline in interim figures. Profits were Pounds 16.8m, against Pounds 18.4m a year earlier. The shares dropped by 9 per cent, ending 30 weaker at 318p, as brokers reduced full-year forecasts by about Pounds 4m to around Pounds 39m. The availability of stock, together with general profit-taking, once again exacted a toll on engineering group Siebe. The shares slipped 10 to 527p. General investment support was seen for Westland Group, which closed 6 better at 236p. Business services company Rentokil Group pleased the market when it reported figures above analysts' expectations. The shares gained 9 at 219p in trade of 3.3m. Profits downgrades at US rival Philip Morris were said to have been responsible for softness in tobacco to insurance group BAT Industries. The shares eased 4 to 475p. A broker's visit to Rank Organisation's Haven Warner operations on the south coast of England on Wednesday cheered analysts, boosting the shares yesterday. They hardened 3 to 777p. The departure of Owners Abroad managing director Mr Roger Allard saw the share price climb 4 to 84p in hefty turnover of 5.5m. But an analyst said the market was finding it hard to make predictions for Owners. Mr Hamish Dickson of Hoare Govett said: 'We have suspended our forecasts for the time being. We feel so much in the dark.' Ladbroke felt the force of pre-interims nerves with its share price losing 3 to 202p. US buying interest was said to have continued in Vodafone Group, which was lifted 8 to 578p. A squeeze was reported in Transfer Technology shares, which forged ahead 19 to 489p. Kleinwort Benson recommended the stock earlier in the week. HSBC jumped 13 1/2 to 730p following a sharp rise in the Hong Kong market. There were no surprises in interim results from Guardian Royal Exchange, whose shares settled a penny easier at 213p.</p>

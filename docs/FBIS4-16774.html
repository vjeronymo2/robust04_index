			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own information" report: "TRETYE SOSLOVIYE Continues To </F> Live..."]    [Text] Publication of the newspaper TRETYE SOSLOVIYE  [third estate], founded by Aleksey Adzhubey [Khrushchev's  son-in-law] shortly before his untimely death, has been resumed  with the appearance of issue No. 12. The newspaper, as is clear  from its name, is aimed at representatives of the nascent estate  of Russian entrepreneurs and attempts to fulfill the active  function of their enlightener.    After issue No. 11 the founders and the editorial board got  into financial difficulties (the newspaper does not receive  state subsidies). The "debts" to subscribers are now being  repaid.    In the present issue the reader will be attracted, above  all,  to a double-page spread of previously unpublished photographs of  N.S. Khrushchev from R.N. Adzhubey's personal archive with her  own comments and reminiscences (pegged to Khrushchev's  centenary), as well as a number of articles by well known  political experts and economists devoted to the most painful  problems of Russian society.</p>

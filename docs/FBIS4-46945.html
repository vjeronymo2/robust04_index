G-7: Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA, France  and Japan.    E-10: Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland,  Russia,  Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and the Czech Republic.    The third "East-West" Conference of Ministers of Economics,  Industry and Trade of the G-7 countries and of the ten reforming  countries was recently held in the Polish capital.    The "East-West" conferences (the two preceding ones were  held  in Germany and Japan) dealt with not only the forms of  cooperation between the G-7 countries and the reforming ones,  but also areas of possible technical assistance which can bring  early returns and promote market relations and democratization  in the former Eastern Bloc countries in the best way possible.    A feature of the Third Conference is the "East-West"  business  forum that preceded it which furnished a reply to the intentions  voiced earlier of drawing the business community into the  discussion of possibilities and conditions for accelerating  reform in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the  former Soviet Union.    The direct participation of about 200 businessmen in the  transformation process imparted a dynamic and genuine character  to the meeting. Their proposals and recommendations for the  governments of the 17 countries spelled out in the Warsaw  Declaration were presented to the Ministers and discussed at  round-table sessions.    Those present acknowledged the following as the three  pillars  of partnership between the advanced countries and the reforming  countries: an effective private economy, foreign investment and  international trade. Hence the goals of the ten countries are  these: 200 billion dollars in direct foreign investment, 70  percent of GNP produced by the private sector, and 17 percent of  trade should be conducted with countries of the G-7 (currently  this figure stands at 6-7 percent).    As was stressed at the conference, the countries which  belong  to the so-called E-10 Group are currently experiencing a  difficult transition to a market economy. Apart from the  variations in their economic development, there are certain  problems they all share. First of all, there has been a marked  decrease in GNP caused by a slump in industrial production  accompanied by high inflation and unemployment rates. There has  also been a plunge in trade between the former CMEA countries.    But the first positive effects of the economic changes are  appearing. Some countries have registered a significant GNP  increase, and others have registered a slowing in the  downward-trend. This tendency has been due to increases in  output: in Poland -- by 6.2 percent and in Hungary -- by 4.3  percent. The first results of privatization have also been  appearing. According to estimates, in Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Hungary, toward the end of this year fifty percent  of their GNP will be created by the private sector.    Everyone agreed that for the economic reforms in the E-10  countries to be successful, there needs to be considerable  activity by foreign investors. Benefits from their investments  are many and diverse: they spur production growth and job  creation, they pay taxes which add to the budget, and they  introduce state-of-the-art technologies and modern-day  managerial techniques. Foreign capital in Eastern Europe since  1989 has totaled more than 20 billion dollars. The biggest share  has been invested in Hungary (5.6 billion US$), then Poland (3.0  billion US$), followed by the Czech Republic (2.16 billion US$).  At the same time, the value of foreign capital in international  investment markets totalled 200 billion dollars last year. Of  that sum, South American and Asian countries succeeded in  attracting 56 billion dollars. In China, for example, foreign  investment totaled 26 billion dollars.    The capacious market of "the Ten" will remain attractive for  foreign investors. In the view of many participants in the  Warsaw meeting, there are vast investment opportunities in the  Russian and Kazakh fuel industries, the Ukrainian agriculture  sector, the region's transportation, water-management and  energy-producing infrastructure, as well as in the development  of the banking and telecommunications sector.    The G-7, voicing its readiness to invest before the year  2000  a total of 200 billion dollars in the post-socialist countries,  is nonetheless setting its own stipulations. They concern  explicit investment conditions, especially a plain and  unequivocal tax system, as well as customs privileges,  possibilities for profit repatriation, patent protection,  privatization, and how jurisdiction is divided between the  central government and the local authorities.    As to the latter, businessmen recounted quite a few  impressions of their association with bureaucrats of every  stripe who seemed to be deliberately created to prevent the  formation of a market. "Businessmen will invest their money  provided it can make a profit." A British entrepreneur was  hammering this idea and his colleagues were nodding with  approval.    The conferees in Warsaw continued their essential  conversation about a model program for restructuring industrial  enterprises. The basic concept of the program drafted by a group  of Japanese specialists envisages the development and  implementation of pilot projects, under a Western technical aid  scheme, to restructure the basic enterprises in different  industrial sectors of the countries undergoing reform. This goal  is to introduce into these firms effective management techniques  and to expedite their privatization.    So far only Japan has taken real steps in this direction.  Japan's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry has enlisted the  services of the "Nomura" private research institute and the  "Rotobo" association and has drawn upon funds earmarked by the  Japanese government, with aid and assistance from the Russian  State Committee for Industrial Policy. This group has formulated  a project for restructuring the Murom engineering plant and has  started similar work on the Smolensk garment-making association  called "Charm." Japanese Minister Eijiro Hata informed the  Warsaw conferees about a series of seminars being prepared to  discuss Japanese experience in the field of industrial policy,  to be held in Poland and Russia later this year.    "The "East-West" conference is truly unique because it  realizes two fundamental ideas," First Deputy Economics Minister  of the RF Andrei Shapovalyants told this correspondent. "One of  them is that now, on the geopolitical plane, an economic  mechanism is being created for cooperation among all countries  in conditions of reform of the post-communist countries, and  this raises the question: in what form can the Western countries  help those being reformed precisely in the way of developing  market relations and building a civilized economic mechanism  which should perhaps take shape towards the close of the year  2000 in all countries constituting "the Ten." The other idea is  to see how direct investment, forms of technical aid, and  organization of aid in privatization and in solving the  questions having to do with liberalization, work directly for  the entrepreneur. So, it is important that not only officials  but also representatives of the business world have come  together here. [quotation marks as published]    How do you view the sum of 200 billion dollars as  investment for "the Ten" with respect to the Russian  economy?    I would not view this figure as a binding plan which we have  to implement. It is meant as an estimate of possibilities  afforded by the E-10 investment market so as to be able to  implement effective projects which would attract the interest of  foreign investments. That the requirements of every country  exceed manifold this sum is crystal-clear. To distribute the sum  in anticipation of which country will implement a highly  effective project is not essential yet. What is meant is a total  estimate of projects that can be "mastered" by Western investors.    And do you believe that 70 percent of Russia's gross  national product will be created by the private sector by the  year 2000?    A program for post-voucher privatization to enter into force  after July 1, 1994 is in the works. Under that program,  depending on the chosen scheme, it will take the shape of either  investment trading or portfolio investments, and maybe it can  place heavy emphasis on foreign investment, drawing foreigners  into the sphere of privatization. Which regime will be decided  upon will determine whether the private sector will account for  70, 62 or 54 percent of the economy. I would not regard this as  a binding plan. Together with the 200 billion dollar sum we have  interlinked estimates whose accuracy still needs to be verified.  That is to say, for each of the countries it would be essential  to make an elementary survey as to what foreign investments will  do to increase the proportion of private capital within the  economy. I for one am confident that in Russia, for instance,  the growth in the share of private capital will be due not to  foreign investment but to the development of inner processes of  privatization.</p>

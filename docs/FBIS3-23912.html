			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by V.T.: "`Flight Analysis' Has Began"] </F>   [Text] The city electoral commission yesterday  continued registration of candidates for deputies to the City  Assembly and reviewed complaints of independent contenders, whom  district commissions earlier had refused to register.    There were a total of six petitioners. The commission  reviewed the complaints of five yesterday. So far, only one  candidate--Gennadiy Gordiyenko--was granted registration after  the city commission decided that the district commission had  invalidated too many signatures without sufficient grounds. The  refusal to register one contender, who collected part of the  signatures outside of his district, was upheld. The review of  other complaints has been moved to today. The commission will  consider the claims of Konstantin Ivanov, whom the district  commission has accused of bribing voters, as well as of Vladimir  Radushnyy and Feliks Sagaydakov, with respect to whom the  district commission has annulled a considerable number of  signatures from the lists on the grounds of suspected  falsification.    The Electoral Commission Chairman Vladimir Fomichev reported  that, by preliminary data, about 750 candidates will be in the  running for 50 deputy seats in the City Assembly. Of them, 500  have been nominated by electoral coalitions, and the rest are  running as independents.    By profession, administrators, businessmen, and white collar  workers comprise the greater part of contenders. The  overwhelming majority are male.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Jonassaint government will not allow the  reformation of the VSN [Volunteers for National Security] corps.  Minister of Information Jacques Saint-Louis recalled that the  VSN corps was dissolved by the government of General Henri  Namphy and the dissolution decree is still in effect. But he  says he understands some people's fears about a foreign  intervention. Rothschild Francois Junior met with the minister  of information. He has some details:    [Begin recording] [Francois] The Jonassaint government  opposes the formation of a new paramilitary corps in Haiti.  Questioned about the return of the VSN to the political scene,  the minister of information explained that the Armed Forces and  the police are the only armed corps authorized in the national  territory. Jacques Saint-Louis stated, however, that he  understands the attitude of some sectors of the population in  the face of threats of intervention, which weigh on Haiti. The  minister of information stressed that patriotism under attack  requires more social and republican discipline.    [Saint-Louis] We consider that this attempt to bring back  this corps dissolved by decree, dated, I believe, in 1986 by the  government of Gen. Namphy, is a manifestation of people being  under attack and feeling threatened; while an American  intervention is being considered, it is quite normal for people  feel the need to organize themselves. A decree was written,  however, in that respect for the dissolution of this corps and  we, as the government, do not intend to take a step backward by  authorizing another armed corps, parallel to the Haiti Armed  Forces and the police.    [Francois] If there is pressure from the Volunteers for  National Security, would you reconsider this decision?    [Saint-Louis] It is out of question. The Constitution is  clear on that. Only the Armed Forces and the police remain the  armed corps. We count on the population, however, in the sense  that the population remains mobilized so that if need be, we can  call on the people to assure together the defense of national  sovereignty.    [Francois] Questioned on the press releases recently issued  by the government regarding some provisions of the Penal Code --  an initiative which has provoked many negative reactions -- the  minister of information of the Jonassaint government defended  himself by explaining that the government only wanted to make a  point of recalling that those laws exist.    [Saint-Louis] It is just a reminder. You know that with the  threat of an intervention, people [word indistinct] and do not  know exactly what attitude to adopt, etc. I then thought that  it was necessary for the Ministry to recall that there are [word  indistinct] regarding those questions.    [Francois] Mr. Minister, some sectors accuse your government  of wanting to establish a dictatorship in Haiti.    [Saint-Louis] We do not intend to establish a dictatorship  in Haiti at all. We have a very specific mission and we are  going straight to elections. We have some constitutional  deadlines to achieve and we make it a point of achieving them.  [end recording].</p>

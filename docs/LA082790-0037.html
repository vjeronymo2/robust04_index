			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OLAZABAL WINS WORLD SERIES BY 12 STROKES  </P> <P> It was no contest; a rout all the way.  </P> <P> The last lingering doubt that Jose Maria Olazabal would win the World Series of  Golf was dispelled when he started with consecutive birdies in Sunday's final  round at Akron, Ohio.  </P> <P> "I was 12 ahead with 16 holes to go," the 24-year-old Spaniard said. "I never  had that kind of a lead before. I didn't know what to do."  </P> <P> He handled it very nicely, going on to a 12-shot victory, the largest victory  margin in 15 years on the American pro tour.  </P> <P> "Go on home. Get the hell out of here," a laughing Lanny Wadkins said after  congratulating Olazabal on his first PGA Tour victory.  </P> <P> After going 12 in front on the second hole, Olazabal turned the last round into  a victory lap over the Firestone Country Club that he dominated as no one ever  had, as few would have thought possible.  </P> <P> "I never thought I'd see 18-under at Firestone," said Wadkins, who had the  previous record at 13-under. "I didn't think I'd live to see 13-under broken,  let alone finish second to it."  </P> <P> For the other 46 players in the international field of winners only, it was an  exercise in frustration, with more than a trace of humiliation thrown in.  </P> <P> Olazabal led all the way and set a flock of course and tournament records. But  that doesn't begin to describe his domination.  </P> <P> "The most amazing thing is that there were only three guys within 18 strokes,"  Wadkins said.  </P> <P> Olazabal, now unquestioned as the outstanding young player in the world, won  with rounds of 61, 67, 67 and 67 on a 7,149 yard, par-70 course with the  reputation and respect of the touring pros as one of the most difficult they  encounter all season.  </P> <P> Olazabal, playing Firestone for the first time, simply took it apart. He opened  the tournament with a birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie burst in the first round, and  had a legitimate shot at breaking 60.  </P> <P> He set course and tournament records for 18 holes (61), 36 holes (128), 54  holes (195) and 72 holes (262). His 36, 54 and 72-hole scores also were the  best on the PGA Tour this year.  </P> <P> While Olazabal was smiling and waving to galleries that gave him standing  ovations on every back-nine green, Firestone was exerting its more customary  pressure on the rest of the field.  </P> <P> Wadkins, Hale Irwin and Donnie Hammond were the only others under par for the  tournament. Wadkins, with a 66, took second at 274.  </P> <P> U.S. Open champ Hale Irwin shot a 74 and was third at 277. Hammond was 71-279.  </P> <P> No one else was within 18 strokes of the runaway winner. Some examples: Greg  Norman was 19 behind at 281, Tom Kite 20 back 282 and PGA title-holder Wayne  Grady was 29 behind at 291.  </P> <P> And then there was John Huston, a winner in Florida earlier this year. He  finished 45 strokes behind the winner.  </P> <P> Olazabal, who won $198,000, is now in his fifth season as a touring pro. He has  played most of his golf on the European tour. He has eight European victories.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel shot four-under-par 68 to win the Northgate LPGA tournament by six  strokes, the third victory in the past four tournaments for the LPGA's leading  money winner this season.  </P> <P> Daniel, who shot 66 and 69 in earlier rounds, finished at 13-under 203 for 54  holes over the 6,149-yard Edinburgh USA course in Brooklyn Park, Minn., and won  $56,250.  </P> <P> Penny Hammel, who shot 69 Sunday, and Chris Johnson, with a 68, tied for second  at 209.  </P></p>

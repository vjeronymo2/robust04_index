He will also hold meetings with Agriculture Minister Jose  Ocampo, Economic Development Minister Mauricio Cardenas, and  Health Minister Juan Londono, who visited Havana in January and  signed cooperation agreements in various aspects of his field as  well as for the purchase of $7-million worth of vaccines.    On the afternoon of 10 February, before leaving Colombia,  the  Cuban leader will meet with the board of directors of the Bank  of the Republic, the central bank which regulates the financial  and fiscal policy.    He will also meet with Armando Montenegro, chief of the  National Planning Institute, and he will hold contacts with  various media.

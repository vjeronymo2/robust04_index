			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Labour hints at deal on PR LABOUR yesterday signalled a willingness to strike a deal with other parties on electoral reform as Mr John Major closed off the option of an accord with the Liberal Democrats to save his prime ministership. With the looming prospect of a hung parliament next Thursday's general election, Mr Major said the Liberal Democrats' calls for electoral reform would lead to damaging uncertainty and indecision. 'There are no circumstances in which I would introduce proportional representation,' he pledged. However, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, shifted in the opposite direction, with a pledge - if elected - to open membership of the party's inquiry on electoral reform, the 'Plant committee', to other political parties. Senior Labour officials denied it was a deliberate response to the Liberal Democrats' surge in opinion polls, describing the move as part of a pre-agreed strategy to broaden the appeal of Labour policies. The move was swiftly derided by the Liberal Democrats. However, senior colleagues of Mr Kinnock indicated that the stance Labour was formulating on constitutional reform - including its pledge to Scottish devolution - might be enough to split off some Liberal Democrat MPs in the event of a hung parliament. To the annoyance of Liberal Democrats, Mr Kinnock again refused to make public his own views on proportional representation. Liberal Democrat strategists, however, are delighted to have set constitutional reform on the election agenda. During a tour of the west country, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Kinnock was 'wobbling on the fence'. His principal term for working with another party in government is a commitment to legislation on proportional representation in the first Queen's speech. Mr Ashdown believes the system of proportional representation could then be decided in time for legislation to be passed within a year, followed by a referendum prior to enactment. However, Mr Major said yesterday that proportional representation was being rejected by political leaders in other countries. 'Some countries would like to get rid of it. . . They cannot get governments, with clear majorities, to take difficult decisions', he said. 'You are in a perpetual state of campaigning, backstairs deals and trying to cobble together deals for individual policies. That is no way to run this country at all.' Meanwhile, Mr Kinnock told journalists that he wanted a broad consensus for Labour's programme. In government, he would extend membership of the Plant committee, chaired by Professor Raymond Plant, to other political parties and representatives of churches, trade unions and business. 'It would be extremely dog-in-the-manger if parties like the Conservatives and the Liberal (Democrats) were not to take full advantage of the invitation,' Mr Kinnock said. Labour remains publicly confident of winning an overall majority and dismissed the suggestion that it might enter a coalition. It will today publish a 'Queen's speech' outlining its legislative programme for a first parliamentary session, including measures on training and on a Scottish parliament . With the Tories confident that economic competence remains one of their strongest cards, Mr Major warned that Labour would prevent the recovery that he insisted had begun. Speaking in south London, Mr Major used the example of Tuesday's Pounds 1.3bn fall in share prices after polls showed a clear Labour lead, to warn of the disastrous economic consequences of a Labour administration. 'One rogue poll, a glimmer of thought that there might be a Labour government,' and Pounds 1.3bn was wiped off share prices, he said. Mr Kinnock last night admitted to making errors of judgment in supporting unilateral nuclear disarmament and in failing to campaign to change Labour's policy on the European Community after the 1975 referendum.

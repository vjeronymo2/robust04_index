			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Confusion at EBRD over top management changes A GROUP of directors at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will this week try to postpone any formal decision to appoint Mr Ernest Stern, the present number two at the World Bank, as the EBRD's new senior vice-president. Mr Ron Freeman, the bank's first vice-president in charge of merchant banking, who told colleagues on Friday he would probably resign, yesterday decided to stay on and is likely to support the directors' campaign to postpone any decision on the bank's management reorganisation. Some directors want to delay changes until after an audit into the bank's control of expenditure is completed on July 15. They believe it would be wrong to restructure the management until they can assess who was responsible at the bank for the overspending on its new building, the charter of private aeroplanes and other expenses reported in recent months. The directors believe a decision to appoint Mr Stern now could make it difficult to remove Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, should the audit report criticise him. Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, who is chairman of the EBRD's governors, last week expressed her support for a delay in the management reorganisation until after the audit report. The issue threatens to become a serious row between the senior financial officials of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries which own 54 per cent of the bank's shares, known as the G7 deputies, and the non-G7 members of the board of directors. The G7 deputies offered Mr Stern the new appointment without reference to the board of directors. 'The G7 deputies have been duplicitous,' said one EBRD director, who believes they have gone behind the back of the board of directors. The directors oppose Mr Stern's appointment for several other reasons. They believe it will lead to a radical shift away from the bank's original philosophy of focusing on financing the fledgling private sector in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to a more traditional development banking strategy of investing in infrastructure. At a board meeting last Thursday, most directors made it clear to Mr Attali that they would strenuously oppose such a change. Some directors are also angry after being told that Mr Stern has been offered an after-tax salary of Pounds 250,000, similar to Mr Attali's. Together with other benefits, this is equivalent to a pre-tax package of about Pounds 700,000. Appointments of vice-presidents must be approved by the EBRD's board of directors, which meets today. Nine directors will make clear this week they will use procedural devices to prevent the appointment of Mr Stern until they have received the report by the bank's audit committee on why the bank spent Pounds 55.5m on fitting out its headquarters and why it has been lax in control of other expenditure. Mr Stern is understood to have accepted the offer of a position as deputy to Mr Attali. That role has, in effect, been filled by Mr Freeman, who is understood to be bitterly disappointed that Mr Attali has supported the recruitment of Mr Stern. A bank executive said Mr Freeman feels he has given unwavering support to Mr Attali since details of overspending and mismanagement at the bank were disclosed in April. Observer, Page 15</p>

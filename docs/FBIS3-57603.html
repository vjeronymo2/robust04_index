			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] I shall familiarize you with a statement by Georgian  Deputy Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili. With obvious  instigation from Vladislav Ardzinba's fascist regime, the  criminal and socioeconomic situation in Abkhazia has sharply  exacerbated. It can be said with confidence that complex  anarchy is reigning there. The law enforcement bodies fail  completely to monitor the situation, let alone the repressions  carried out against the remaining Georgian population.  Abkhazians and the Russian speaking population -- Russians,  Armenians, Greeks, and others who are forced to leave the  autonomous republic of Abkhazia and seek refuge somewhere else,  are also alarmed.    In only the Ochamchire and Gali rayons over the last three  months -- October-December -- about 40 Abkhaz combatants were  killed in clashes between separate individuals and armed units  over pillaged goods. On 10-11 January this year, almost a real  war was waged between the Abkhaz population of the villages of  Chlou and (Arasartikhi) in Ochamchire rayon. Famous people  living in Abkhazia are falling victim to the lawlessness of  Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries. The public was alarmed over  the news of the beastly killing of Shitnik, the chief doctor of  Sukhumi's ambulance service. Especially worrying are instances  of the mass killing of people of various nationalities. The  mercenary executioners Balov, Smetanin, and Krasnov set up an  horrific slaughterhouse in the village of Odishi in Sukhumi  rayon as a result of which about 30 people were killed, mostly  of Greek nationality.    It is obvious that we are dealing with the genocide of the  Greek population. Against this background, the populist  statement by the Gudauta leader [Ardzinba] about the need for  those Greeks who were evicted from Abkhazia in the 1940s to  return to their homes can only be described as cynical.  Drawing your attention to the above-mentioned atrocities, we  call on the world community to strictly condemn the criminal  acts committed by the Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries as well  as their Gudauta patrons.</p>

Improve the investment environment and guide the  direction of foreign investment. The following things are to be  done in this area. The first thing is to formulate short-term  and medium-term plans for using foreign capital, to strengthen  the construction of urban infrastructure, to strengthen  legislation of economic laws involving foreigners, to create  conditions for treating foreign-invested enterprises like those  run by local people, and to improve services for using foreign  capital. The second thing is to guide foreign businessmen to  focus their investment in infrastructure, basic industries,  high-technology and new-technology industries, and the technical  transformation of old enterprises, to encourage running  export-oriented enterprises, and to run Sino-foreign joint  ventures of railways, expressways, and power plants. The third  thing is to absorb investment of transnational and well-known  corporations. The fourth thing is to explore new forms of using  foreign capital. Infrastructure projects are to try to follow  the building-operation-transfer process in using foreign  capital. The Beijing International Industry Consultancy  Holdings Corporation is to be established to invite tenders and  to introduce foreign capital. Listed share-holding enterprises  are to be encouraged to issue B shares if conditions are  available and the financial institutions concerned are to be  encouraged to issue bonds abroad. The fifth is to use foreign  capital to develop commerce and to strive to increase the number  of projects selected for experimentation; to explore how to use  foreign capital in monetary affairs, insurance, and financial  companies; to attract major foreign corporations with powerful  strength to make investment in real estate and to use foreign  capital to develop tourism; to make use of foreign capital to  set up professional and service organizations for consultancy,  information, quality accreditation, and professional appraisal;  and to run accounting, auditing, and law office joint ventures  on a trial basis.    2. Deepen foreign trade reform, change the mechanism of  enterprises, and move toward the modern enterprise system.  State-owned enterprises for foreign economic relations and  trade are to be reorganized according to the modern enterprise  system. A municipal import, export, credit, trust and  investment corporation is to be set up to manage and operate the  state assets of economic and trade enterprises of the whole  municipality and to ensure that the value of state assets is  maintained. The work of projects selected for experiments on  the system of listing shares of garment import and export  companies is to be grasped firmly. In this year, one third of  the foreign trade enterprises are to carry out reform and to  institute the share-holding system, the limited liability  company system, and the share-holding cooperation system.  Restrictions on ownership are to be removed and a new pattern  of foreign trade which takes state-owned foreign trade  enterprises as the main body and incorporates the common  development of various forms of ownership is to be formed  gradually. Restrictions on the scale of operation are to be  removed; the division of work according to specialities in the  management of export commodities is to be abolished; and  diversified management is to be extensively carried out, while  import and export activities remain the major business.  Finally, various kinds of large groups for foreign economic  relations and trade are to be organized.    3. Develop resources to earn foreign exchange and change the  structure for swapping foreign exchange. Barter trade is to be  expanded; trade in technology is to be promoted; and trade in  the service industry is to be developed with great efforts.    4. Develop overseas enterprises. Large enterprises and  large groups are to be encouraged to develop their businesses  abroad, and several influential transnational corporations are  to be set up.    5. Carry out organizational reform with a view to  strengthening macro regulation and control.</p>

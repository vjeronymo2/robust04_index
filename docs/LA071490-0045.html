			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LAWRENCE WALKS AWAY WITH AMERICAN RECORD  </P> <P> The track and field competition slowed to a walk in the U.S. Olympic Festival  on Friday.  </P> <P> Debbi Lawrence of Kenosha, Wis., broke her American record in the 10-kilometer  race walk, and two-time Olympian Carl Schueler won a 20-kilometer event that  wound up being shorter than planned.  </P> <P> Also Friday, Wendy Lian Williams and defending champion Matt Scoggin won the  10-meter platform preliminaries.  </P> <P> Lawrence finished her race in 46 minutes 10.26 seconds, breaking the American  record of 46:14.4 she set in The Athletics Congress meet June 15. She also  broke the Festival record of 47:54.0 by Maryanne Torrellas of Clinton, Conn.,  in 1987.  </P> <P> Lawrence, 28, got an assist from the crowd, which gave her a standing ovation  throughout her last lap. She covered the final 400 meters in 1:45 after going  at a 1:51 pace for most of the race.  </P> <P> "I think I wanted it bad enough that it (the crowd) wouldn't have made any  difference," she said.  </P> <P> Schueler knew early on that something was amiss in the 20-kilometer race.  </P> <P> "I've been racing for 12 years, so when we came through the first lap at the 2  1/2-kilometer mark I saw the clock and knew the course was short," Schueler  said. "When six guys are on world-record pace at 2 1/2 kilometers, you know  something is not right."  </P> <P> The course was inadvertently laid out to cover 18.230 kilometers. Schueler, of  Colorado Springs, Colo., won the race in 1 hour 18 minutes 59 seconds.  </P> <P> Phil Henson, the U.S. Olympic Committee's commissioner of athletics, said  turnaround cones for the race were mistakenly placed at the wrong marker of  what was supposed to be a 2 1/2-kilometer loop. The error shortened the loop by  about 200 meters.  </P> <P> "After it was discovered, they considered extending it another lap," Henson  said. "But the referee felt that would be too confusing to the athletes."  </P> <P> National champion Meredith Rainey of New York won the 800 meters in 2:03.40,  overtaking silver medalist Celeste Halliday of Bloomfield, Conn., in the final  50 meters.  </P> <P> In diving, Williams easily finished first in the 10-meter platform  preliminaries in her first festival appearance since 1985. The 447.69 points  were a personal preliminary best for Williams, a 1988 Olympic bronze medalist.  </P> <P> Her closest pursuer was Cokey Smith of Ann Arbor, Mich., the only competitor  whose eight-dive total (381.15) exceeded Williams' score after seven dives  (372.93).  </P> <P> Scoggin, of Austin, Tex., won the men's preliminary round with a 628.86, taking  the lead with a near-perfect dive in the next-to-last round. He was awarded  three 10s and four 9.5s for an inward 3 1/2 somersault in the tuck position.  </P> <P> Edward Morse of Miami was second with 574.35 and Pat Jeffery of Madison, N.J.,  was third at 572.37.  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE J. Sainsbury, which earlier this year wrested the crown from Marks and Spencer as the UK's most profitable retailer, is likely to present an encouraging set of numbers when it reports its interim results on Wednesday. Analysts suggest that Sainsbury's will be able to stretch its profits by about 16 per cent to Pounds 380m even though the food retailing market has proved to be somewhat sticky of late. Added interest will stem from the fact that this set of results will be the first to be presented by Mr David Sainsbury, who will have succeeded his cousin, Lord Sainsbury, as chairman earlier in the week. Associated British Foods, reporting its preliminary full-year results today , will highlight again the value of its purchase of British Sugar. With milling and baking profits under great pressure despite ABF's 30 per cent share of the bread market, sugar will have contributed about half of the group's profits. Despite that profits are likely to be down sharply from Pounds 332m the year before to around Pounds 290-Pounds 300m. British Petroleum, the UK oil group, announces its third-quarter results on Thursday. Although its shares have outperformed the UK market since their fall following the halving of the dividend in August, analysts say it is too early for any of the strategy changes and cost-cutting measures announced then by BP to be reflected in the results. Forecasts for net income on a replacement cost basis range from Pounds 100m to Pounds 170m, but most are between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m, little changed from Pounds 107m before the Pounds 1bn of exceptional items in the second quarter of this year or, from Pounds 129m in the third quarter of last year. Unilever will continue its stately progress on Friday. Third quarter profits are likely to be around Pounds 580m (Pounds 525m) for a nine-months total of Pounds 1.48bn (Pounds 1.39bn), despite adverse currency translation. Wm Low, reporting full-year results on Thursday, is one supermarket chain which has lost its way. After the Scottish group warned a few months ago that its operating margins were 'below expectations', analysts cut their forecast. They are now looking for about Pounds 20m pre-tax against Pounds 23.6m a year earlier. UK COMPANIES TODAY COMPANY MEETINGS: Property Trust, The Dorchester, Park Lane, W, 10.00.

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHERRY CANYON SITE TO REMAIN OPEN SPACE;  </P> <P> LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE TO BUY 37 ACRES  </P> <P> The city of La Canada Flintridge reached an agreement this week with a group of  New Jersey developers to purchase 37 acres of open space that the city has  fought for two years to preserve.  </P> <P> City Manager Donald H. Otterman said the developers, Flintridge Estates  Partnership, have agreed to accept $1.75 million for a portion of their  property at the end of Sugarloaf Drive in Cherry Canyon.  </P> <P> The city earlier purchased two other parcels in Cherry Canyon totaling more  than 80 acres, Otterman said.  </P> <P> The canyon is a rustic area in the San Rafael Hills on the border of Glendale  that is popular with hikers and horseback riders.  </P> <P> The purchase includes an agreement by the city granting developers an option to  build nine homes on the remaining 10 acres of land that they are retaining. Any  development would still require a public hearing and city approval, Otterman  said.  </P> <P> Developers had originally proposed building 29 homes on the 47-acre site, but  scaled down their plans to 22 homes in the wake of widespread community  opposition.  </P> <P> Otterman said the city's hillside development ordinance would have permitted  only 15 lots on the site.  </P> <P> The purchase is contingent upon the city receiving a $1-million state grant  from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which is expected to approve the  funds next month, Otterman said. The earlier land purchases were also partially  funded by the state.  </P></p>

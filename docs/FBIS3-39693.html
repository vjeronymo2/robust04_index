At a meeting of the Protestant Academy  in Bad Boll, Bubis said on Sunday [20 February]: "Throwing fire  bombs into asylum-seekers' hostels is just as terrible as  assassinating Hanns-Martin Schleyer." He does not understand  why the state does not act against violent rightist  organizations just as it acted against the terrorist Red Army  Faction (RAF) in the past, which killed the president of the  employers' association.    In Bubis' view, the problem of rightist violence has been  played down in Germany far too long. Despite a dangerous  interconnection of the right-wing extremist scene, politicians  still speak of individual perpetrators and people who are just  running along. Addressing approximately 1,000 conference  participants, Bubis came out against special laws and a  tightening of the penal code: "The existing instruments are  absolutely sufficient." However, the judiciary must not orient  itself primarily "at the lower limit" in meting punishment for  rightist acts of violence.    Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social  Democratic Party of Germany) also criticized the many cases of  incomprehensibly mild punishment. Birzele thinks the danger to  society posed by right-wing extremists is far greater than the  threat that has emanated from leftist groups. With 400-500  right-wing extremists who are ready for violence in  Baden-Wuerttemberg alone, the circle of potential perpetrators  is far larger than it ever was in the case of the RAF.</p>

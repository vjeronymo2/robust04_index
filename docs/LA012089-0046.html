			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: COURT BATTLE LOOMS FOR BROTHERS IN LIONS GAME  </P> <P> It will be brother against brother Saturday when Loyola Marymount plays a  conference basketball game at the University of Portland.  </P> <P> Portland is off to a disastrous start at 1-14, but one of the Pilots' bright  spots has been the play of guard Josh Lowery, its leading scorer. The Lions  have freshman Terrell Lowery, a backup point guard of great promise and the  Portland star's younger brother.  </P> <P> When they face off, Terrell Lowery said, it will continue a lifelong rivalry.  Josh is three years older. Growing up in Oakland, Terrell said, "we played  against each other all the time."  </P> <P> Josh, a 6-3 redshirt junior who transferred out of San Diego State, is the only  Pilot averaging double figures, scoring 14.5 points per game. He's not shy  about putting it up. "He's more of a flat-out shooter," said Terrell, a  combination point and shooting guard. "He'll pass it, but he'd rather shoot."  </P> <P> Terrell, 6-1 1/2, is averaging 5.8 points and plays sporadically in Coach Paul  Westhead's rotation but has had good games, with a high of 18 against U.S.  International.  </P> <P> Josh is highly regarded as a baseball shortstop and has been drafted twice by  the Cleveland Indians, after high school and again last year. Terrell favors  basketball. "We're different types of people," Terrell said. "I liked to do  different things. I played second base, he played shortstop. He played baseball  in the summer. I didn't."  </P> <P> Until now, Terrell has been following his older brother. On Saturday, they  finally end up on equal footing.  </P> <P> Lowery isn't the only Loyola player with a talented brother in the same sport.  Lions star Hank Gathers doesn't have to go far to check out brother Derrick,  who is having an outstanding year at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> Derrick, a 6-3 guard, leads the Matadors and is among California Collegiate  Athletic Conference scoring leaders with an 18.5 average. Hank, elder by 10  months, often played on teams with his brother in their native Philadelphia and  would have dearly loved to see him in a Loyola uniform. Derrick played at Santa  Monica City College last year.  </P> <P> "He's a very good player. He's a very good three-point shooter (35 for 81 this  season). He could certainly play here," said Hank, whose exploits have tended  to overshadow Derrick. Hank leads the NCAA in scoring and rebounding, but the  6-7 forward said he hates to have to play against Derrick: "He's one of the  best defensive players I've ever seen. I wouldn't want him sticking me. He's  like (Oklahoma star) Mookie Blaylock -- he's everywhere."  </P> <P> Who would win a duel of Lowery brothers versus the Gathers? "We'd win," Terrell  Lowery said somewhat uncertainly.  </P> <P> Hank Gathers laughed and said: "I don't think it would be much of a comparison.  We'd just post 'em up."  </P> <P> After a shooting slump that stretched through several games, Loyola guard Jeff  Fryer shot the lights out against DePaul last Saturday. His 42 points tied him  with Greg Goorjian for most points scored by a Loyola guard. It's also the  third-highest total in a Loyola game. His performance earned him West Coast  Athletic Conference Player of the Week.  </P> <P> Fryer, who has been the focus of opposing defenses lately and entered the game  shooting less than 40%, hit nine of 14 shots from three-point range and 13 of  22 overall. Several of his baskets came from beyond the NBA stripe in Rosemont  Horizon, legitimate 25-footers. One time, when Fryer was near the DePaul bench,  Blue Demons Coach Joey Meyer told him, "Open your eyes."  </P> <P> It's the second time Fryer set a personal best on national television. He  scored 28 points in the final game last season against North Carolina. Each  time, on CBS-TV, Fryer was the Chevrolet player of the game in a losing cause,  which Coach Paul Westhead humorously noted:  </P> <P> "Fryer's got two Chevies in the garage now. I just wish we'd win a game."  (Players don't actually get a gift. Chevrolet makes a donation to the school in  their name.)  </P> <P> Streak Starter: It may just be coincidence, but since Kevin Shaw's insertion  into the Cal State Dominguez Hills starting basketball lineup, the Toros had  not lost going into Thursday's game against UC Riverside. Shaw, a forward who  has spent most of the last two seasons on the bench awaiting his chance, has  played more minutes in the last five games than in his previous two years. The  defense-minded 6-3 junior has averaged three points and four rebounds a game  since he became a starter. Shaw got his chance when Kenyatta Kalisana went out  with a knee injury.  </P> <P> The NCAA made several more entries into the record book after Loyola  Marymount's recent 162-144 victory over U.S. International. Along with the  Lions producing the first 90-point half in NCAA history (93) and the teams  combining for the most total points (306), the game set marks for:  </P> <P> * Most players on one team with 30 or more points: three (Loyola -- Hank  Gathers 40, Enoch Simmons 38, Jeff Fryer 30).  </P> <P> * Most total players with 30 or more points: five (USIU's Gary Williams had 40,  Demetrius Laffitte 34.  </P> <P> * Most shots taken in a game: 245 (Loyola 124, USIU 121);  </P> <P> * Most points ever against a Division I team (Loyola's 162. Loyola and  Nevada-Las Vegas have scored 164 against non-Division I opponents);  </P> <P> * Most points ever by a losing team (USIU's 144, erasing old mark of 142 set by  Utah State in triple overtime.  </P> <P> The NCAA was also happy to report that the new records eliminated the need, in  several cases, to distinguish between overtime and regulation.  </P> <P> Erasers are being kept handy. The teams meet again Jan. 31 at Loyola.  </P> <P> College Notes  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills point guard Robert Barksdale has averaged 16.3 points and five  assists and shot 52% in his last eight games. In that streak, the sophomore has  made 12 of 23 shots from three-point range, 26 of 30 free throws and has  committed only 11 turnovers . . . Loyola is the only basketball team to score  more than 100 points against DePaul in Joey Meyer's five years as head coach.  The Lions have done it twice this season -- and lost both games . . . With  1,105 career points, Enoch Simmons is five points away from moving into the  13th spot on Loyola's career scoring list. With 288 points this season, Simmons  has topped his previous season high.  </P></p>

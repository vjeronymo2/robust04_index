			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY, SPORTS ARE FAIR GAME  </P> <P> Scott Ostler's column (Feb. 2) was written in such a narrow-minded, cynical,  (argumentative) way that I wonder . . . why did he wait so long to write it? I  loved it. Maybe it will wake up that sports fan who thinks he or she knows what  an athlete is worth.  </P> <P> When it comes to money for athletes, a Proposition 48 casualty becomes a genius  of the financial world, able to coax an extra $200,000 a year from a real  estate and investment tycoon. Of course, he gets help from a 400-client sports  agent, but hey, who really cares about all that stuff? As long as they don't  raise taxes to pay this guy, I can sleep at night and I'll watch the game  Sunday morning.  </P> <P> But if I paid $10 for a ticket and was refunded $5 if the home team lost, I  wonder who I would root for. I wonder if I would have Clipper season tickets. I  wonder if the Clippers could offer season tickets.  </P> <P> DOUG PADILLA  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

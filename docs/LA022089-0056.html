			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTMENT BANKERS SURGE FROM DOWN UNDER TO DO TAKEOVERS  </P> <P> With little fanfare, Australian companies came, saw and acquired U.S. firms at  an accelerating pace between 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> However, this quiet invasion may have been officially signalled when an  Australian investment bank called Capel Court Pacific established U.S.  operations by planting its corporate flag in Los Angeles. Indeed, the presence  of Capel Court is a sign of the times: Increasingly, firms from "Down Under"  are aiming to take over.  </P> <P> Capel Court, which provides Australian firms with acquisition strategies,  became the first Australian investment banker to establish a U.S. presence when  it opened the Los Angeles office in November, 1986. The firm -- it's part of an  Australian conglomerate called Capel Court Group -- recently sent a corporate  director to manage the office, a move designed to bolster the operation.  </P> <P> The presence and the upgrading of an Aussie investment bank in the United  States was an important development in business relations between Australia and  the United States, according to Denis Hardiman, president of the Australian  American Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I think it's a very significant thing," said Hardiman, a senior vice president  at the Los Angeles offices of the Melbourne-based National Australia Bank. "To  me, it suggests there will be heavier investment."  </P> <P> Capel Court's presence is a sign of the expanding role of Australian companies  in the world economy, according to Julie Bayliss, a commissioner at the Los  Angeles-based Australian Trade Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sign of Development  </P> <P> During the first and second year of its operation in the United States -- 1987  and 1988 -- Capel Court helped arrange six deals, transactions totaling about  $500 million. For example, it helped the Sydney-based QBE Insurance acquire  Sequoia Insurance Co., a Menlo Park, Calif.-based property and casualty insurer  in 1987. One of its larger deals -- Sydney-based Paul Ramsey Group's 1987  acquisition of Health Care Services of America, a Birmingham, Ala.-based  hospital chain -- involved about $130 million.  </P> <P> "It shows that the Australian investment community is casting farther afield,"  Bayliss said. "It's a sign of the growth and development of Australian  companies and evidence of the importance of overseas markets."  </P> <P> This expansion was prompted partly by the Australian government, which  concluded that Australian companies could only continue to grow by boosting  exports and by acquiring other firms, according to Gerald H. Watkins, senior  commissioner at the Australian Trade Commission.  </P> <P> The government early this decade encouraged acquisitions because some  Australian export products can obtain only small shares of certain foreign  markets, Watkins said. Some markets have high tariffs or other trade barriers,  and other markets -- like those in the United States -- are already saturated  with a large supply of competitively priced products, Watkins said. "Australian  firms . . . quickly outgrow the domestic (Australian) market of 16 million  people, and the U.S. -- with a free and open market -- is very attractive,"  Watkins said.  </P> <P> Australian firms responded by investing $10.5 billion in the United States  between 1981 and 1986 -- much to the glee of U.S. investment bankers who  collected large fees for preparing takeover strategies and arranging financing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comfortable With Area  </P> <P> Capel Court executives monitored the spree and decided it was their turn to  respond, according to David McDougall, the Capel Court Group director now  overseeing operations at the Los Angeles office. Top executives at Capel Court  Group decided to establish a U.S. presence to develop a special relationship  with acquisition-minded Aussies, McDougall said.  </P> <P> Capel Court opted for a Los Angeles office because Southern California is a  major financial center and for geographic reasons, McDougall said. California  is the first scheduled stop for many executives departing Australia en route to  various destinations in the United States. Culturally, Australians are more  comfortable in sunny, ocean-rimmed environments where people are relatively  informal -- characteristics of California, according to McDougall.  </P> <P> "Management saw it as an opportunity to create for Capel Court a niche that no  other investment bank had," McDougall said. It was an opportunity to get in on  the ground floor because we could see significant investment and we wanted to  be a part of that."  </P> <P> As Capel Court expected, the pace of activity has accelerated. Australian firms  spent at least $2.4 billion -- about 35% of their total foreign investment --  on just corporate mergers and acquisitions in the United States in 1987. The  tally excludes real estate deals and investments in stocks and bonds. That  investment level surpassed the $1.5 billion -- again, excluding investments in  land and the money market -- in reported merger and acquisition spending by the  Japanese in the United States in 1987.  </P> <P> Japanese firms surged ahead of the Australians in 1988, investing a whopping  $11.9 billion for mergers and acquisitions in the United States. Still,  Australian spending more than doubled -- reaching $5.4 billion in 1988. In  contrast, Australian firms invested only about $305 million for the 12 months  ending in July, 1979.  </P> <P> Now that the stakes are higher, Capel Court actually stimulates the process by  proposing matches or takeover targets for Australian companies. The firm helps  with negotiations and is willing to find financial backers. Recently,  Australians have tended to invest more heavily in the states of Georgia, New  York, Texas and California, according to McDougall. Statistics show they often  invest in manufacturing, mining and in companies involved in construction and  the production of building materials.  </P> <P> There have been blockbuster transactions. Two of the more publicized big deals  involved News Corp. Ltd., which acquired Metromedia Inc. for $1.5 billion and  20th Century Fox for $575 million -- both in 1985. There was also Bond Group's  acquisition of G. Heileman Brewing Co. for $1.2 billion and BHP Co.'s purchase  of Monsanto Oil Co. for $745 million -- both in 1987.  </P> <P> However, Australian companies tend to acquire small-to-medium-sized firms. For  example, 86% of the Australian acquisitions in the United States in 1987 were  for less than $100 million, according to Capel Court. About 71% of the 1988  Australian deals in the United States were for under $100 million. In contrast,  only 44% of the Japanese acquisitions in the United States were for less than  $100 million in 1988, according to Capel Court.  </P> <P> Because so many Australian acquisitions involve smaller operations, they often  go unheralded, according to James Reno, vice president at Capel Court Pacific.  Reno, an American who joined Capel Court in 1987, said Capel Court is  positioned primarily to help Australian firms interested in acquiring  medium-sized U.S. firms. "There are a lot of middle market firms -- companies  worth between $20 million to $200 million -- in the U.S.," Reno said. "I think  that's where you see the best opportunities. That's where you find the best  undervalued operations."  </P></p>

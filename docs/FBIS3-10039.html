Alfredo Diaz Urbay, director of the Labor Research  Institute,  told PRENSA LATINA that by January the State Committee for Labor  and Social Security [CETSS] had received 156,828 applications  for permission to do this type of work. According to the decree,  in force since the second half of 1993, 136 forms of  self-employment are allowed, he said.    Diaz Urbay also said that over 70 percent of the authorized  persons practice less than 20 percent of the activities  permitted, particularly the following: craftsmen, coachmen,  carpenters, barbers, handcart drivers, and manicurists. He said  that 76.9 percent of the permits have been issued to males. Of  those receiving permits 35.5 percent work, 27 percent are  retired, 19.7 are jobless, and 16.7 percent are housewives.    According to the document, the regulations are established  by  two state committees -- labor and social security, and finance.  The former issues the permit for self-employment and the latter  collects, because these persons must pay for their permits, thus  helping bolster the state's treasury.    State finance committee sources have reported that Cuban  authorities are studying the implementation of a general tax  system which, if approved, would include the self-employed.    The production of various crafts, which makes it possible  for  the Cuban population to buy minor articles, particularly for  domestic and decorative purposes, has been observed to increase  since the State Council decree was enacted.    The current conditions of the so-called special period in  time of peace, a stage of serious economic crisis after the  collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union, Cuba's main  commercial partners, and the aggravation of the U.S. embargo  determined the need to expand the opportunities for  self-employment.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FELONY CASE FACES PAIR IN ARMS STASH  </P> <P> Felony charges will be sought against a Cal State Northridge student and  another man, both suspected gang members, after a cache of weapons was  discovered in a student housing apartment last month, campus police said  Friday.  </P> <P> Daniel Cho, 18, a student at the school, and John Lee, 18, of Northridge were  arrested after a Nov. 21 search of Cho's apartment at University Village in the  10000 block of Zelzah Avenue, Lt. Mark Hissong said.  </P> <P> Next week, investigators will ask the Los Angeles County district attorney to  charge the two men with possession of stolen property and possession of a  firearm on a state university campus, both felonies, Hissong said.  </P> <P> Hissong said the officers found and confiscated seven rifles and four handguns  and arrested Cho and Lee, who were in the apartment. Some of the guns were  openly displayed and others were concealed, he said.  </P> <P> "It is probably the largest number of guns we have ever taken out of a campus  apartment," Hissong said.  </P> <P> One of the seized weapons belongs to a Northridge homeowner who reported it  stolen during a burglary in October, Hissong said. Investigators are still  attempting to trace the ownership of the other weapons and determine why they  were in Cho's apartment.  </P> <P> "We think it is gang-related," Hissong said. "We are reasonably convinced the  suspects are gang members. We don't know if this is where the gang kept all  their weapons or if this is just one portion of what they have available."  </P> <P> Arraignment for Cho and Lee, who were released on $5,000 bail each, is  scheduled in San Fernando Municipal Court on Dec. 13.  </P> <P> Hissong said the investigation began after a student reported seeing a man  carry a gun into Cho's apartment. When officers arrived, Cho granted them  permission to search the apartment, he said.  </P> <P> Since his arrest, Cho has moved out of the student housing complex, Hissong  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [[Interview with Fernando Illanes, minister of economic </F> development, in La Paz; date not given: "Capitalization: A  Complicated Economic and Social Equation"]    [Text] Minister of Economic Development Fernando Illanes is  an outspoken man. As various governments and social sectors have  found, he pulls no punches.    Despite some disagreements, the president of the Republic  has  entrusted him with this difficult ministry and the mission of  maintaining the macroeconomic balances and implementing the  capitalization of state-owned enterprises, the main plank of his  government's platform.    Illanes has long lived in the spheres of power and is  accustomed to exercising authority, a fact that sometimes  subjects him to setbacks. He has twice been president of the  CEPB [Bolivian Private Businessmen Confederation], ambassador to  the United States, and minister of energy.    PRESENCIA interviewed him in his office, and the hour he had  allotted to the interview extended to almost two hours, during  which he spoke "his mind, (because) we are not in a political  arena." Space, however, prevents us from publishing the  interview in its entirety.    [PRESENCIA] During the electoral campaign, you were a harsh  critic of capitalization. You even said that you knew nothing  about it and that you were going to vote for Oscar Bonifaz. How  did President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada manage to lure you?    [Illanes] I did not say I was going to vote for Bonifaz. You  media people still turn my words around at your convenience. I  said that Bonifaz was the only one who openly said that the  economy should be privatized.    When the president invited me to be minister I had already  spent some time working with him, because he first asked me to  be part of an advisory team that, between June and August,  cooperated with him on several matters, mainly the  reorganization of the executive branch of the government and  capitalization. At that point I stated to the president my  objections especially to what I saw as not conducive to the  attracting of investments, because, in the end, that is what it  is all about.    Some of those objections have been incorporated, to a  certain  extent, in the capitalization project. The original plan has  undergone some changes, and now I am convinced that it is viable  and will attract foreign investments. There have been  substantial changes: stockholding, management contracts, and  stock operations.    I do not mean to say that I imposed those ideas. It was an  enlightening dialogue with several experts and the president  himself that convinced me that capitalization is a process that  goes well beyond privatization. Capitalization has a very  important social aspect, which is the inclusion of a universal  pension plan that has no place in a privatization process. In  the privatization case, one sells an enterprise, receives money,  spends it one way or another, and there the process ends. It is  a one-shot investment spanning one, two, or three years, and  then there is nothing.    [PRESENCIA] Why has the possibility opened that the TGN  [National Treasury] will acquire creditors' rights, by  subrogation, against the enterprises that are to be capitalized?    [Illanes] One little word in the bill to be enacted needs to  be underlined: It says that the Treasury "may" acquire such  rights as subrogee, not that it "must" do so; and therein lies a  subtle but big difference. "May" means yes or no. Everyone is  assuming "yes"; I, on the contrary, assume "no." Between these  two positions, there are many possibilities that will depend on  the situation of each of the enterprises.    Besides, one must analyze the reason why that article was  incorporated. The object is to maximize the amount of the  investment so as to create more jobs, more capital, more  economic activity, more growth of the GNP (gross national  product), and hence more funds that can be devoted to health,  education, and basic housing.    The more the liabilities the TGN can absorb, the more the  book value of the enterprises' assets increases. Besides, there  are assets that cannot be included in book value, such as  reserves, contracts, trademarks, market, etc., but that are  quantifiable in the acquisition of an enterprise; and these will  be quantified in the capitalization process.    There are two sides to the coin. If the TGN absorbs these  liabilities, it will be affected, but only relatively because  the credits are very soft; they are renegotiable; they will go  to the Paris Club; etc. That is to say, there are many  mechanisms that can lighten the load. And as I have said, if  economic activity picks up, the Treasury will collect more  revenue.    There are also problems with leaving these liabilities on  the  books of the enterprises. First, foreign loans are always  guaranteed by the state, and to the international lending  institutions it makes very little difference whether the loan is  to the enterprise or to the TGN, as long as the ultimate debtor  is the state.    Second, it places the enterprises in a disadvantageous or  unfair competitive position with respect to others that may seek  to enter the same field. A YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil  Deposits] with very soft credits will be much better able to  compete than an enterprise that has to resort to bank loans.    The pros and cons must be balanced against each other, and  it  is for this reason that the article stipulates "may." We are  going to consider case by case, in accordance with the degree  and type of debt of the enterprise, the desire or needs of the  provider of capital, etc.    [PRESENCIA] Why was it decided to release 50 percent of the  enterprises' stocks to investors, when initially it was to be 49  percent?    [Illanes] In order to render their capitalization viable.  Indeed this was precisely one of my major doubts concerning the  Plan of Everyone. A private investor holding 50 percent of an  enterprise's capital stock and a management contract that can  only be revoked by 51 percent can sleep peacefully and manage  and operate the enterprise.    [PRESENCIA] Assume, for example, that within some 15 years  the capitalized enterprise needs more money. Will it be injected  by the provider of capital? If so, will parity of capital shares  not be broken?    [Illanes] We must paint things in their true colors; we are  not in a political arena. The stocks belong to the Bolivians,  but they are deposited in a trust fund managed by the pension  fund management firms, which in turn are obliged to open savings  accounts for each and every citizen.    We believe there will be between five and 10 firms of this  type. Assuming there are 10, each one will receive more than  300,000 shares, will open more than 300,000 accounts, and will  be obliged to meet physically with its savers once a year to  show them what they have in their account, issue them their  individual passbooks, and certify the amounts entered therein.  For example, if the value of the stock is $1,000--everyone  refers to that figure, but the actual figure is not yet  known--each citizen will receive his or her passbook, in which  that figure has been entered. The following year, through  capitalization, dividends, stock market transactions, etc., he  or she will have, say, $1,200, and will be visited and informed  of it in person. When the account is opened, the citizen will no  longer be the owner of that stock, but rather of its value. And  even if, on the following day, all of the shares are sold, the  citizen will have benefited from 100 percent of the value of the  state-owned enterprises as of the date of the transfer.    The shares need to be traded in order to maximize the yield  of the savings. In other words, if tomorrow, ENTEL [National  Telecommunications Enterprise] begins to be a financially  troubled enterprise, the citizen is safeguarded, because the  pension fund manager will sell that stock and buy stock, say, in  YPFB, or the Brewery, or General Motors, or what have you.    Within certain limits, the fund manager could even transfer  the managed stocks outside of Bolivia, as all  individual-capitalization pension funds do, because the object  is to maximize the yield.    The same will occur when there is a capital increase. Let us  suppose that, five years from now, ENFE [National Railway  Enterprise] needs an influx of new capital. The decision will  have to be made by the fund management firms in the name of the  Bolivians, because it cannot possibly be made by 3.2 million  Bolivians. That is one of the reasons why we have chosen this  road. A physical distribution of the shares is an insoluble  problem, a lunacy, because there are physical problems, problems  of speculation, of abuse, and in sum, many things that have  dissuaded us from that approach, which was the one I initially  favored. But it cannot be done that way, and we have opted for  the approach wherein the stockholders have representatives  managing their money, whose objective is the same as that of the  stockholders: maximizing the return on those savings.    These representatives will attend stockholder meetings.  Certainly some, representing all, will be members of the boards.  It is they who will approve budgets, etc. The day that an  enterprises goes into the red, they will leave it and move funds  to another, because the enterprises will not be operating  jointly, but individually.    [PRESENCIA] Does this not contradict the example the  president cites when he recounts how the idea of capitalization  occurred to him? It is that of the small farmer who seeks a  partner to invest in his land, and does not need to sell it.  According to your explanation, the enterprises will no longer  belong to the Bolivians.    [Illanes] There will be a restriction as to those to whom  stocks may be sold. It is hardly likely that there will even be  a domestic market for those stocks for some time to come. We are  going to have to create it with the funds that these pension  managers put into those enterprises.    It is like a bank: Its capital is the contribution made by  its stockholders, and the money of the savings accounts is in  trust under the bank's management. Pension funds operate in a  similar manner, except that the savings are long-term deposits.  In this case, the future direct or indirect profits of those  firms belong to the Bolivians.    [PRESENCIA] What happens if one of them goes bankrupt?    [Illanes] How can it go bankrupt? In the first place, we are  demanding that the fund management firms be of international  class, highly experienced, and well capitalized, so that what  they invest here will be 1 percent of their assets. Thus, we  will have the backing of a parent company.    Secondly, there will be regulations and a superintendency of  pension funds--like that of banks--that will audit them  continuously.    In all of these financial entities, there are mechanisms for  avoiding disasters. For example, since the Superintendency of  Banks has been in operation, the banks have been doing just  fine. Before, it was a travesty. There is only one way that the  management firms could go bankrupt, and that is, for the six  state-owned enterprises to do so. But that would mean that the  country has gone to hell, that Bolivia has gone bankrupt.    [PRESENCIA] If the stockholder dies, is the saving passed on  to the stockholder's heirs?    [Illanes] Of course. There will certainly be the alternative  of either receiving a lump-sum settlement or an additional  number of years of pension, because, by actuarial calculations,  the value of the fund will grow.    We are creating a new system of social security and, above  all, an attitude toward saving that currently does not exist in  Bolivia. Our level of saving is probably one of the world's  lowest, and being a poor nation is not an excuse. Twenty or 25  years ago, countries as poor or poorer than we, like the Asiatic  ones, had a level of saving equal to 35 percent of GDP [gross  domestic product]--and they are maintaining it--because of the  high value they place on the mentality of living frugally and  saving for the future. I believe that we save 7 to 8 percent of  our GDP.    With this new mentality, we will begin to save voluntarily  upon seeing that our parents have an adequate retirement  pension. Thus, first we are going to raise the level of saving.  We are going to create a social security that I believe is of  utmost importance, perhaps the single most important thing.    Second, Bolivia's big problem is that over the past six  years  its economy has grown at an average rate of 3.7 percent  annually, and that is not sufficient to recover what we have  lost. During the period of hyperinflation around the beginning  of the 1980's, we lost 30 percent of our per capita production,  and at our current rate of growth it will take us 35 years to  reach where we were in 1980. We, therefore, have to break the  vicious circle by means of investment, and the only way to do it  is through capitalization. An investment of $3 billion cannot  other than generate massive direct or indirect employment and  further incremental investment. And our GDP will thus rise. I  believe that by 1997, with that $3 billion, we should be growing  at the rate of 8 percent annually. The economists express alarm:  There will be an "overheating" of the economy, they say. Well,  what do you know! I can only wish that were the problem on my  hands, rather than the current depression and this snail-paced  growth.    [PRESENCIA] What is the reason for first forming a mixed  state-and-private-owned corporation?    [Illanes] It is a legal mechanism for transforming the  enterprise into a corporation later. Otherwise, we would have to  call for bids, obtain a proposal, then go to Congress and  request approval. The reason is a practical one.    Besides, there is the desire that the workers become  stockholders in the enterprises that are to be capitalized. They  will be able to do this through their social benefits.    [PRESENCIA] What is going to be sold to investors?    [Illanes] Under this plan, the state never sells anything.  That is the big point. Let us say that a state-owned enterprise  has a present-day worth of 1,000. With its transformation into a  mixed corporation, the entry of workers adds 10, bring its worth  to a total of 1,010. Then comes the third stage, that of its  incorporation, in which the investor puts up 1,010, at which  point the enterprise is worth 2,020. The original 1,000 goes to  the people; that is, we have sacrificed nothing, we have sold  nothing, assuming that the provider of capital is going to put  up the enterprise's book value. Actually, however, the provider  of capital will be investing more. The YPFB's books, for  example, do not include as entries the contract with Brazil or  the hydrocarbon reserves because the deposits do not belong to  YPFB, but they can include the financial value of the expected  exploitation of those deposits.    [PRESENCIA] Who is going to set the value?    [Illanes] The market.    [PRESENCIA] Another question to which the proposed bill has  given rise is: If the enterprise's objective is profit, how will  the state address works of a social nature, such as rural  electrification, for example?    [Illanes] Two things can be done. First, adjust rates and  bring operations into the black. Second, subsidize through the  electrification enterprises, which is much easier, because there  will be competition and many power distribution companies (we  are not talking here of power generation).    For example, there is an isolated system that is having  terrible problems--the SETAR [Tarija Electric Service]--first  because it does not collect past-due amounts owed to it and  hence does not pay its debts, and second, it charges ridiculous  rates because it is a very small system. A private corporation  will certainly invest money and will interconnect with the rest  of the system in order to lower its operating costs. I believe  that is a viable approach to the solution. In the case of very  small enterprises, capitalization is not applicable, because it  is a very complex process. Therefore, they will be auctioned,  sold, or transferred to the private or cooperatives sector.    [PRESENCIA] Capitalization is a thesis. What is its  antithesis?    [Illanes] Continuing in our present situation, or worse. I  see no other solution.    The big problem is that the basic thesis is not ours alone;  it is worldwide. We have given it a social, plural content.    We believe that capitalization will produce a permanent and  growing effect. And since this is the international turn of  mind, the international institutions and all the countries that  offer us aid, loans, or grants reflect that mentality. Today,  the World Bank does not want to lend money to drill wells, or  build hydroelectric plants or railroads, but rather for health,  education, and basic welfare.    If state-owned enterprises want to survive they must resort  to banks for loans. And if they have been unable to survive to  date with low- or no-cost loans, how can they do so on  commercial loans, while remaining in the hands of the state,  with its inefficiency, its political meddling?    Not that the state is a poor manager. The problem is that  the  managers appointed by the state, good or bad though they be,  have to cope with political meddling. Every four years, there  are changes of personnel, including the managers. This produces  total instability in the careers of the workers and  professionals, and hinders the making of plans, the programming  of investment, etc.    What we are now trying to do is isolate the enterprises from  political influence, by transferring them to private-sector  management. If we do not capitalize, those enterprises will die,  and that would be unquestionably a disaster for Bolivia, because  the country would lose revenue and jobs. As things stand now,  the state-owned enterprises cannot survive.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Strategic Sectors?... Rubbish! </H5>   After the explanation given by Minister of Economic  Development Fernando Illanes on the necessity of attracting  capital, we asked if the influx of that capital might not bring  with it the danger of creating a state within a state.    He emphatically rejected that possibility. "We are not going  back to Patino's time. Let me give you an example. In 1952, when  the mines were nationalized, Mr. Simon Patino personally was  worth $4.2 billion (whose relative value today would be 10 times  more than that). There is probably not a single enterprise in  Bolivia that is worth even half that figure. In other words  Simon Patino would be worth some $40 or $42 billion in current  dollars. We are talking about a gentleman who was worth $4.2  billion in a country whose budget at the time, by all reckoning,  was surely not even $1 billion, and whose GDP was not even $1  billion."    Furthermore, he explained, there will be regulations.  "Insofar as possible, the market will be wide open. The market  for YPFB, which is the largest of the enterprises, will be the  widest open, because in its case it is indeed possible. There  are others that, as the economists are saying, are natural  monopolies, and one of the few among them is ENFE [National  Railways Enterprise].    "As for the rest, I believe it will certainly be possible to  open them up to, if not total market transparency, then at  least, in the worst of cases, to one or more oligopolies that  will be strictly regulated and supervised by a regulatory body  having oversight over the energy, hydrocarbons, rail, and  airlines sectors, etc."    The minister believes that, for these reasons, "no single  enterprise will be able to wield economic power of such huge  dimensions," and much less so if it is in the hands of not just  a few people, but of "hundreds of thousands or millions of  stockholders," so that decisions are arrived at through a  meeting of the stockholders and boards of directors.    He therefore asserts: "There will no longer be kings of tin.  I cannot imagine that happening. The conditions no longer exist  that might create such a distortion in our economy, which is now  very much more diversified. Before, we produced tin, period."    In another vein, we asked the minister whether it might be  possible for strategic sectors to be manipulated by  international capital. Illanes categorically rejected the idea.  "That line of thought marks a generational abyss. I do not  believe in the word `strategic.' I very much hope that a  transnational will come forth, and not some small-time company,  because our market is so insignificant that we are doing  handsprings specifically to attract big-time transnational  capital. It is our only hope of guaranteeing that these grounded  enterprises will be refloated, because they require colossal  investments and international markets.    "To my mind, only the human being is strategic. The rest is  rubbish. Pardon my frankness, but I do not believe in strategic  sectors."  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Everyone Will End Up With Less </H5>   There being no other way to broach the subject, Fernando  Illanes was asked directly about his forthcoming negotiations  with the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] and the universities,  and the degrees of flexibility he can bring to bear.    Without hesitation, he termed it "a question without a  response, because if I had degrees of flexibility I could not  reveal them since I would then be exposing my negotiating cards.  And if I said none, I would be lying."    He stated that the meetings held with the universities thus  far had been productive and cordial, and that he had offered  them, "within my concept that the human being is the country's  most important asset, personally to make every possible effort  to satisfy their needs. I know that I shall not be able to  satisfy them to the extent of 100 percent, I told them, but I  can at least improve the present situation of the universities."    "But," he added, "everyone wants more, including myself for  my ministry. And I have not succeeded in obtaining it, because I  have a secretary for finance and an undersecretary for the  budget who are more hard-nosed than I."    He said there should be no distinction between the technical  and the political as regards relationships with the different  sectors. We need to do the right thing, he said, "and not resort  to distortion or to causing unrest somewhere just to win votes.  That sort of thing, it seems, is what is called politics," he  stated with irony. Nevertheless, he asserted that the government  will necessarily "cause unrest throughout the nation, as well as  in all the ministries, because no one is receiving what it set  out to receive. No one, absolutely no one." And, he said, this  state of things will continue "until capital begins to flow into  Bolivia. If that flow does not occur, our future will be one of  very slow growth, which is not a solution for the people of  Bolivia. And a solution that does not resolve the problem of the  majority of the Bolivians is not a solution. Another one has to  be found."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Cuba issue is apparently the main course  today during the second and last day of deliberations at the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which is currently under way at  the seaside resort of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Before the  conference, the media and one or two leaders repeatedly referred  to the island -- mostly in an insidious way -- it was reported  by a PRENSA LATINA news agency report.    During the summit's inauguration, once the speeches before  the plenary session had concluded, Cuban President Fidel Castro  demanded -- in a second speech -- respect for his country and  recognition for the people given their tenacious resistance to  the U.S. blockade.    The Cuban leader's surprisingly strong reaction perplexed  most of the participants at the Cartagena de Indias meeting  because they were suddenly confronted with a reality that cannot  possibly be ignored, even if they tried to.

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Observer: All too present It's no secret that Brazilian President Itamar Franco hates foreign travel, but even he seems to be running short of excuses for his 11th-hour cancellations of overseas trips. China, the latest host to be snubbed, has been informed that Franco will be a no-show next week. Officially, he is concerned about a police strike, and also wants to be around for an economic stabilisation bill going before Congress. As the Chinese have no doubt twigged, however, the strike is winding down and the army, which had been sent in to seal off some police buildings, has returned to barracks. The new bill, the third such measure to come before Congress, is a mainly administrative affair which would normally not trouble the presidential office.</p>

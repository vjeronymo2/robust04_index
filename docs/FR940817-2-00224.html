			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Caution must be exercised in labeling a substance neurotoxic. The intended use and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of the chemical, the dose, exposure scenario and whether or not the chemical acts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly or indirectly on the nervous system, must be taken into consideration. A substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may be neurotoxic at a high concentration may be safe and beneficial at a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration. For example, vitamin A, vitamin B6, are required in the diet in trace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts, yet all result in neurotoxicity when consumed in large quantities. Pharmaceutical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents may also have adverse effects at high dose levels or where the beneficial effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outweigh the adverse side effects. For example, antipsychotic drugs have allowed many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people suffering from schizophrenia to lead relatively normal lives; however, chronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed use of some of these drugs may result in severe tardive dyskinesia characterized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs. Other examples include toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuropathies induced by chemotherapeutic agents like cis-platinum, toxic anticholinergic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of high doses of tricyclic antidepressants, disabling movement disorders in patients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated with anti-Parkinsonian agents and major tranquilizers, and hearing loss and balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disruption triggered by certain antibacterials (Sterman and Schaumburg, 1980). Drugs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse such as ethanol also have neurotoxic potential. Opiates such as heroin may lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependence, which is considered to be a long-term adverse alteration of nervous system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functioning. Simultaneous exposure to drugs or toxic agents may produce toxic interactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either in the environment or occupational settings. For example, exposure to noise and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain antibiotics can exacerbate the loss of hearing function (Boettcher et al., 1987; Lim,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986; Bhattacharyya and Dayal, 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nervous system is a highly complex and integrated organ. It is possible that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonlinear dose-response relationships or a threshold effect could exist for some agents. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been hypothesized that the nervous system has a reserve capacity that masks subtle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage and any exposure that does not overcome this reserve capacity may not reach the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold and no observable impairment will be evident (Tilson and Mitchell, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the functional reserve may be depleted over time and the manifestations of toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be delayed in relationship to the exposure. The reserve may be depleted by a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors including aging, stress, or chronic exposure to an environmental insult, in which case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functioning will eventually be impaired and toxicity will become apparent. If a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events occur simultaneously, the response is progressive in nature, or there is a long latency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between exposure and manifestation of toxicity, the identification of a single cause of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional impairment may not be possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.3. Basic Neurobiological Principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.3.1. Structure of the Nervous System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The nervous system is composed of two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980). Within the nervous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, there exist predominantly two general types of cells_nerve cells (neurons) and glial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells. Neurons have many of the same structures found in every cell of the body; they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unique, however, in that they have axons and dendrites, extensions of the neuron along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which nerve impulses travel. The structure of the neuron consists of a cell body, 10 to 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> m in diameter, containing a nucleus and organelles for the synthesis of various components  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for the cell's functioning, e.g., proteins and lipids. There are numerous branch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patterns of elongated processes, the dendrites, that emanate from the cell body and increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the neuronal surface area available to receive inputs from other sources. Neurons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicate with each other by releasing chemical signals onto specific surface regions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receptors, of the other neuron. The axon is a process specialized for the conduction of nerve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impulses away from the cell toward the terminal synapses and eventually toward other cells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (neurons, muscle cells, or gland cells).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neurons are responsible for the reception, integration, transmission, and storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information (Raine, 1989). Certain nerve cells are specialized to respond to particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stimuli. For example, chemoreceptors in the mouth and nose send information about taste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and smell to the brain. Cutaneous receptors in the skin are involved in the sensation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure, pain, heat, cold, and touch. In the retina, the rods and cones sense light. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, the length of the axon is tens to thousands of times greater than the cell body  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diameter. For example, the cell body whose processes innervate the muscles in the human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foot is found in the spinal cord at the level of the middle back. The axons of these cells are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than a meter in length. Many, but not all, axons are surrounded by the layers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> membrane from the cytoplasmic process of glial cells. These layers are called myelin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sheaths and are composed mostly of lipid. In the PNS, the myelin sheaths are formed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Schwann cells, while in the CNS the sheaths are formed by the oligodendroglia. The myelin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sheath formed by one glial cell covers only a short length of the axon. The entire length of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the axon is ensheathed in myelin by numerous glial cells. Between adjacent glial sheaths, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very short length of bare axon exists called the node of Ranvier. In unmyelinated axons, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nerve impulse must travel in a continuous fashion down the entire length of the nerve. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of myelin accelerates the nerve impulse by up to 100 times by allowing the impulse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to jump from one node to the next in a process called ``saltatory conduction.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nerve cells of the PNS are generally found in aggregates called ganglia. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brain and spinal cord make up the CNS and the neurons are segregated into functionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related aggregates called nuclei. They synthesize and secrete neurotransmitters, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialized chemical messengers that interact with receptors of other neurons in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication process. Various nuclei together with the interconnecting bundles of axonal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers are functionally related to one another to form higher levels of organization called  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. For example, there is the motor system, the visual system, and the limbic system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the base of the brain, several small nuclei in the hypothalamus form the neuroendocrine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, which plays a critical role in the control of the body's endocrine (hormone-secreting)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> glands. Nerve cells in the hypothalamus secrete chemical messengers into a short loop of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blood vessels that carries the messengers to the pituitary gland which, in turn, releases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical messengers into the general circulation. These pituitary messengers regulate other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> glands (e.g., the thymus and the gonads). The entire system maintains a state of optimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physiological function for all of the body's organ systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

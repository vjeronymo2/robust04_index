			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's pay policy MR KENNETH Clarke, self-styled champion of the cabinet's hard centre but suspected by many of softer inclinations, was always going to have an image problem in his early months at the Treasury. Faced with a gaping fiscal deficit, and with Britain's recent inflationary past still fresh in the memory, the chancellor could not afford to give the impression that the government will be lax on either wage inflation or public spending. Yesterday's announcement that the government will freeze next year's public sector wage bill may help to dispel doubts about his resolve, as well as bolstering his credentials as a fearless combatant against the trade unions. By buttering up the Tory right, the move should also enable him to keep open the option of a tax increase in the November Budget. Whether it will serve the longer-term interest of the economy is another question. The precise nature of the medium-term framework for pay-setting, towards which Mr Clarke appears to be moving, remains rather obscure. The sentiment is clear enough: 'For next year, 1994-95,' yesterday's statement said, 'the government will expect any increase in pay for its own employees to be matched by improvements in productivity.' But what does this mean in practice? 'Government departments,' the statement continues 'will be expected to keep their running costs, including pay budgets for their own employees, to their 1993-94 level in cash terms, except where there are significant changes in activity above that which can be accommodated by marked improvements in productivity.' Credibility For most of the public sector, the consequence of cash limiting pay bills is clear enough: accept a pay freeze or reduce employment. The chancellor's calculation must be that the economic and political risk of adding to unemployment while the economy remains depressed will be outweighed by the rise in fiscal and political credibility from holding back public sector wages. The medium-term danger is that the gain in fiscal credibility will be undermined by the inflationary signals that the chancellor's public pay policy implies. For Britain's new chancellor appears to have fallen into the very same trap into which chancellors and wage-bargainers have fallen for decades: endorsing the fallacy that real wage increases at the company level are justified if, and only if, they are matched by productivity gains. Unstable recipe For the economy as a whole, this principle makes sense. But at the sectoral level, it is an unstable recipe. Productivity gains are inevitably faster in manufacturing than in public services. In the short term, encouraging manufacturers to pass their productivity gains to employees, while holding down public sector wages, stores up the old problem of recruitment and motivation of public servants. In the medium term, it just pushes the average rate of wage inflation higher, as public sector workers seek to catch up with the more rapid rises which have been justified in the private sector on the basis of productivity ad-vances. Moreover, it is the private sector that continues to generate inflationary pressures, as the government's submission to the pay review bodies yesterday makes clear. Public sector wage settlements for this year were just 1.5 per cent compared with expected underlying inflation of 3.75 per cent. But average earnings in manufacturing are still rising at an unsustainable 5 per cent a year. The chancellor's short-term case for keeping the lid on public sector pay is reasonable enough and it is true that the scale of the problems it causes will depend on whether private wage inflation falls further and stays low. It is for this reason that the chancellor should follow up his public sector pay strictures with a sustained effort to persuade the private sector of its responsibilities. The success of the government's economic strategy requires that average pay in the private and public sectors should rise in line with underlying economy-wide productivity. By appearing to endorse the muddled notion that productivity-related pay increases are always acceptable, he risks sending precisely the wrong signals to private sector wage-bargainers.</p>

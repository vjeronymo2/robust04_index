			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Growers approve cut in Colombian coffee price AN EXTRAORDINARY National Coffee-Growers' Congress yesterday approved a 10.5 per cent cut in Colombia's coffee producer price, coffee officials said, reports Reuter from Bogota. Mr Jorge Cardenas, general manager of the National Coffee-Growers' Federation, said the congress approved a reduction in the internal price to 85,000 pesos (Pounds 70) per load of 125 kg from P95,000. It is the second reduction this year in the price paid to Colombian producers for their coffee, following a 5 per cent cut in February. The reduction was part of a package of measures approved by the congress to counter a financial crisis in the National Coffee Fund, which finances the purchase of coffee in Colombia. Mr Rudolf Hommes, the finance minister, said earlier that the fund could become insolvent next year unless urgent measures were taken. Mr Cardenas said the reduction in the producer price would save Dollars 150m of the fund's present Dollars 500m imbalance. The congress adopted a package of measures proposed by the National Coffee-Growers Committee with a few amendments, coffee industry officials said. The plan finally adopted calls for 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) to be taken out of coffee production in the next year and aims to ultimately eradicate up to 100,000 ha. Producers who participate will receive compensation of 1m pesos per hectare, according to the final document. Where possible, farmers will substitute other crops. Producers who wish to uproot their plantations for sanitary reasons will receive P350,000 a hectare in compensation. A programme to promote the renovation of coffee plantations will be suspended and the government will ask financial institutions to make loans available for diversification, the document said. The National Coffee-Growers' Federation will cut its costs by a real 20 per cent next year through adjustments to programmes and staff reductions. The National Coffee Fund will postpone or suspend new investments. Regional coffee committees have committed themselves not to promote new sowings of coffee or the modernisation of plantations.</p>

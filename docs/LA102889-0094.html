			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN CHIDES HIS JAPANESE HOSTS;  </P> <P> TRADE: SOME FRICTION WITH THE U.S. STEMS FROM MISUNDERSTANDINGS, BUT AMERICANS  HAVE A STRONG AVERSION TO UNFAIRNESS, HE ASSERTS.  </P> <P> After nine days of friendly toasts and gala banquets, former President Ronald  Reagan issued a mild rebuke to his Japanese hosts today on unfair trade  practices.  </P> <P> "I've come to Japan as a friend, as someone who wants to see us get through the  friction of our relationship so that it does not rub the relationship raw,"  Reagan said in a speech prepared for delivery today to business leaders in  Osaka.  </P> <P> He said a "communications gap" looms larger than the trade gap between the two  countries and conceded that trade barriers account for only 15% to 20% of the  U.S. trade deficit. But he also warned that "fairness is a very strong strain  in the American people," and referred to the 1773 Boston Tea Party as an  example of Yankee rancor against foreign powers.  </P> <P> We don't want a Japanese Tea Party," he said.  </P> <P> Reagan, whose visit is sponsored by a communications conglomerate that is  paying him a $2-million honorarium, said, "The fact of the matter is that until  Japan's trade barriers -- whether they're regulatory, cultural, structural,  whatever -- until they're lowered, the focus in the U.S. is not going to be on  whether American companies have the quality products Japanese consumers want to  buy, but that the Japanese system won't let Japanese consumers buy them."  </P> <P> He went on to warn Japan of international denunciation of its environmental  policies, "an emotional issue that has the potential to harm Japan greatly." He  noted the increasing news coverage in the United States of Japan's drift-net  fishing and its tropical logging.  </P> <P> "No country is without blame when it comes to the environment," he said. "But  Japan will come under increasing pressure, perhaps even the boycott of Japanese  products."  </P> <P> His remarks were relatively harsh compared to his comments Wednesday, when he  denounced the backlash against Japanese investment in the United States and  said he saw "nothing wrong" with Sony Corp.'s recent $3.4-billion purchase of  Columbia Pictures. He added, in a TV interview, that the investment might  restore decency and good taste to Hollywood movies, which he said too often  display immorality and vulgarity.  </P> <P> Yet Reagan showed his usual optimism today, advocating a U.S.-Japan free-trade  zone that would unite the "two greatest economic powers in the world."  </P> <P> "Let us leap beyond no-win squabbling by undertaking a breathtaking plan," he  said.  </P> <P> Former U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Mike Mansfield first proposed such a trade  zone, similar to the free-trade pact between the United States and Canada, but  the idea has been given little serious attention on either side of the Pacific.  </P> <P> While decrying American perceptions that Japan poses a greater threat to U.S.  security than the Soviet military, Reagan also criticized some Japanese  attitudes about a weakening America.  </P> <P> "I'm told there are those in Japan who believe the United States is a declining  superpower propped up with Japanese money and technology, that the United  States is lazy, soft, and simply living off its past glory," he said. "Well, I  say to those voices of demise . . . you don't understand America. You don't  understand our strength and potential."  </P> <P> On Friday, Nancy Reagan delivered a pointed warning about the potential for  drug abuse in Japan.  </P> <P> "Please, do not be complacent in thinking that the drug tragedy cannot come to  these islands," she said after lunch at a Tokyo hotel. "We in America were once  complacent, too. A terrible disaster has befallen the United States. . . .  Please do not let it happen here."  </P></p>

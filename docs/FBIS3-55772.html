			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] The visit to be paid by President Bill Clinton to  Minsk confirms that the United States reacts to Belarus's  denuclearization initiatives more concretely than anyone esle in  the world does, said Valeriy Tsepkalo, foreign policy adviser to  the chairman of the Belarusian parliament.    He believes that after President Clinton's visit European  countries -- Germany, Britain, France -- will have a more  sympathetic attitude to the problem of global security.    Belarus, Tsepkalo said, was the only one among the former  Soviet republics to sign with the United States a package of  agreements concerning such issues, as the conversion of defence  plants, the forming of an exports control system, and  recultivation of territories where strategic and chemical  warfare troops were deployed. "Each of these agreements  requires substantial currency infusions from the United States,  and they have already begun to arrive," he said.    Several important agreements, particularly on lifting trade  barriers and on giving Belarus technical aid in building  free-market infrastructure and promoting privatization, are  expected to be signed in Minsk, said INTERFAX's interviewee.    However, even when these documents are signed, Belarus can  hardly hope to get a vigorous flow of American investment,  Tsepkalo noted. "What Belarus is likely to get is a tangible  incentive for creating a more favorable climate for investment,"  he said.</p>

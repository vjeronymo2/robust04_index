			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 1st Rank A. Pilipchuk: "In a Checkmate </F> Situation"]    [Text] We have grounds to call this news from  the Northern Fleet very unpleasant: They have decided to prepare  the Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser "Kiev" to be cut up for scrap.  Ship repairmen have not managed to breathe new life into this  first-born of the series of aircraft-carrying ships that are  capable of receiving vertical take-off and landing aircraft on  board and which was delivered to the plant quay for repair  several years ago. The press of the economic crises has  disrupted these plans.    Ships are built not for centuries but each of them has its  own measured off time period. For example, American Iowa Class  Battleships were destined to serve for approximately 50 years  and many U.S. Navy aircraft carriers --for 30 years. The  "Kiev's" fate was allotted a total of two decades and its  younger brothers "Minsk" and "Novorossiysk" -- even less. They  left for the ship cemetery long before the calculated time  period, without experiencing the rejuvenating impact of capital  repair and modernization that extend the lives of combat ships  by many years. Having found colossal resources for the  construction of an aircraft-carrying "squadron", the state found  itself incapable of maintaining it. The state itself collapsed  and the priority program for the development of surface  combatants that are capable of unfurling the air "umbrella" of  cover over the fleets forces at sea was buried under its  fragments.    Right now it is already clear that the Russian Navy faces  decades of intense labor for its rebirth. And not only in the  context of the construction of aircraft-carrying ships. Speaking  about them, we must note the obvious paradox that is so  characteristic for us: Russia -- a pioneer of the utilization of  aircraft from the decks of ships -- does not have its own  aircraft-carrying fleet. During the course of the latest  polemics on this issue, which have died down for well-known  reasons, the sensation frequently arose that currently some  people in our country do not at all want to see Russia as a  powerful maritime power that is not moving in the wake of the  policy of the Western "flagships", but that is affecting the  course and the progress of the entire world "armada".    God be with them, with the clever writers, who want to  convince us that, if we don't build one cruiser, we will be able  to erect an entire housing microrayon. It is insulting only that  they are being allowed to confuse unsophisticated people as if  such simple "arithmetic" solutions exist in the economy. We  would like to believe that common sense and a truly scientific  approach to these problems reign and our Navy's service record,  on which is listed over 300 years of irreproachable service to  the Fatherland, will continue with honor and glory. But today,  when military shipyards are nearly empty, it is important to  preserve if only the naval cadres among which the state of naval  aviators causes special alarm and for whom an airfield is the  deck of a ship. And there are substantial grounds for alarm here.    Soon two years will have passed since the time of the  serious  flying accident in the Northern Fleet Air Force shipborne  antisubmarine warfare regiment. While accomplishing a flying  mission, a Ka-27ps (search and rescue) helicopter crashed into  the Barents Sea and sank. The tragedy took the lives of seven  aviators. What is the need to return to the events of the winter  before last, and events so tragic at that? The entire matter is  in those conclusions which the official commission, that  investigated the causes of the accident, came to at that time  and the "independent panel of experts" that was conducted by the  helicopter crewmen themselves -- the fellow servicemen of the  dead comrades. Both the one and the other cited the prolonged  gaps in flights from the decks of ships as one of the causes of  the accident. It resulted in an error in flying technique, in  shortcomings in air traffic control and, ultimately, in a great  misfortune.    New Regimental Commander Colonel Gennadiy Stepanov, who was  appointed after this accident, while describing the situation  that had developed in the unit in 1993, noted that not a single  pilot, including he himself, a pilot-expert marksman, had a  certification to land on a deck at that time. Yes and how can  you obtain it or confirm it if some of his regimental colleagues  had not taken off into the air a single time since the beginning  of the year. The fuel that was allotted for flights was enough  only for several officers who had just completed school "to take  to the sky" and to permit seven instructor pilots to "fly a  bit". In 1993, the combat training flying period actually went  to restore flying technique in the airfield area and on a route  over the sea.    By the way, the regiment has been designated for joint  basing  with aircraft on Northern Fleet aircraft-carrying cruisers. We  discussed the fate of the "Kiev" above but its counterpart  "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" has already  been moored to the plant quay of the naval plant in Murmansk for  several years. The ship repair facility of Russia's largest  fleet -- the Northern Fleet -- is breathing asthmatically from  the shortage of financial resources (even the government has  been compelled to review the issues of financing the Northern  Fleet) and from the loss of many suppliers who were left behind  the new borders. Ships are leaving the combat formation and not  are being "restored to health" at the plant quays which could  still have acquired a second breath for many years. And along  with them, the deck is leaving from under the feet of the  carrier-based aviators, the "squaring" of which is being reduced  with each written off ship.    That is how it already occurred in the Pacific Fleet from  the  complement of which both aircraft-carrying cruisers -- the  "Minsk" and "Novorossiysk" --, that were designed for VVP  [vertical takeoff and landing] "Yak's", were withdrawn one after  the other. I visited that fleet not too long ago as part of a  group of admirals and officers of the Naval Main Staff headed by  First Deputy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Igor Kasatonov. During  the flight from Vladivostok to Sovgavan [Sovetskaya Gavan], a  view of the dead skeleton of the "Novorossiysk" opened in one of  the bays under the aircraft's wing. I had the opportunity to put  to sea in this, at that time full of force, ship and my heart  sank at the sight of the enormous "lifeless" ship.    At one time, we discussed at great length the imperfections  of the Yakovlev firm's vertical take-off and landing aircraft  that are based on aircraft-carrying cruisers. But today we  essentially have a new "vertical take-off aircraft" that largely  exceeds its foreign equivalents but only one floating airfield  has remained for them and that one is in repair. Like some kind  of hostile arm, someone's evil genie is always throwing us  decades back in the construction of a modern navy, attempting to  leave our gigantic maritime borders, as we shamefully say right  now, "transparent" and actually -- defenseless.    If the Pacific Fleet's naval ground attack aviation has  already been deprived of a deck, then shipborne antisubmarine  warfare aviation is waiting its turn. The number of ships on  which antisubmarine warfare and rescue helicopters can be based  is steadily declining and they infrequently put to sea. In 1993,  the number of times they put to sea was reduced practically by a  factor of two in the fleet due to the shortage of POL  [petroleum, oils and lubricants] (yes and those of low quality)  and spare parts for repair. And many of them have been serving  for nearly 20 years and need the renewal of existing technical  resources. Incidentally, the fleet's air fleet is in the same  condition where very many of them need repair or are subject to  being written off. And therefore the situation with  flying-tactical training remains extremely complicated. And here  primarily the instructor staff takes off into the sky to  maintain its skills.    Surprisingly, in the process fleet aviators have managed to  primarily accomplish the missions with which they have been  tasked. For example, the antisubmarine warfare crews have  detected an entire series of foreign submarines which are  constantly roaming off our shores. Yes, people are literally  working miracles. But for how long will they suffice? In 1993,  more than 1,500 Pacific Fleet seamen, including hundreds of  aviators, submitted requests to be released into the reserve and  nearly half of them were approved. If this is the path for the  reduction of our Armed Forces, then we are successfully  following it...    Mentally shifting from East to West, we see a similar  picture  in the Baltic Fleet that has also been exacerbated by the losses  of part of the bases in the Baltic Region. Indeed, Baltic Fleet  Air Force Commander Lieutenant-General Vasiliy Proskurnin is not  inclined to dramatize the situation and along with his staff is  doing everything so that ship-based helicopter crews maintain  their skills as much as possible, even at the cost of their  rehearsal at land-based airfields. Not everyone, and first of  all the commander himself, understands that it is impossible to  maintain an adequate level of training without a ship's deck.  Already during the time of service in the Polar region, he  nurtured the idea of equipping each fleet with floating  pontoons, including towed pontoons, to rehearse helicopter crew  take-offs and landings. This proposal appeared in the press in  1993. And a firm in St. Petersburg immediately announced that it  was prepared to patent this idea which will not become expensive  during its embodiment but the need for something like it is high  today.    When this theme ripened in my journalistic note pad, I  visited the Russian Naval Aviation commander's directorate and  met with Major-General Anatoliy Tikhomirov and Colonel Boris  Ruchkin. They confirmed the entire complexity and urgency of the  problems that have accumulated in naval aviation. Today Naval  carrier-based ground attack and fighter aviation aviators have  found themselves simply in a checkmate situation. Already  several years ago training of carrier-based fighter-ground  attack aviation pilots was occurring at the "NITKA" training  complex in the Crimea in parallel with the construction of the  heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers "Admiral of the Fleet of the  Soviet Union Kuznetsov" and "Ulyanovsk" (the heavy nuclear  aircraft-carrying cruiser that has been cut up for scrap at the  slipways of Nikolayev Shipbuilding Plant and "Varyag" (the fate  of this uncompleted heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser has still  not been resolved). It is currently located on the territory of  a neighboring sovereign state. This "NITKA" training complex  permitted us to rehearse elements of a take-off from a ski jump  and glide slope descents and landings while catching the  aircraft tail hook on an arresting cable on a deck mock-up. The  firm OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] imeni P.O. Sukhoy  maintained a contract with the Ukrainian side for a certain  period of time on the training of several pilots of the lead  group for the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser "Kuznetsov". But  Russia needs a more serious -- on the governmental level --  contract with Ukraine for the mass training of pilots. For the  time being, the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser "Kuznetsov's"  enormous take-off and landing deck is empty. During a two-month  cruise, only one aircraft landed on the deck.    It's clear that Russia must have its own training complex or  center to train and retrain naval fighter-ground attack aviation  pilots. The Navy's aviation command authorities went to the  government with a petition to grant a location and resources for  its construction in Russia. But it seems that right now they are  busy with other things and it is hard to predict when the  government's hands will reach the essentially urgent problems of  naval aviation...    Of course, carrier-based aviators have more problems than I  am capable of including in these remarks. The shipbuilders,  aircraft designers, and aircraft builders also have problems.  The new understanding of the country's security that was set  forth in the recently approved Russian Federation military  doctrine places these problems among those of state importance.  It is hard to imagine a priority direction of the structural  development of the Russian Armed Forces, like the creation of  mobile forces which the doctrine discusses, without the  development of a modern navy and its most important components.

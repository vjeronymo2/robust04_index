			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON RUNNING CONTROLS GAME  </P> <P> Troy High School's vaunted passing attack was no match for the unpretentious  option running of Fullerton, which wound up with a 14-7 Freeway League football  victory Friday night at Fullerton College.  </P> <P> The decisive touchdown came after Troy's punter, Chad Hartford, bobbled a high  snap, and Fullerton's Matt Milligan recovered the ball at the Troy 49.  </P> <P> Fullerton (7-1, 3-0), scored 10 plays later on David Chacon's two-yard run with  3:59 to play.  </P> <P> Fullerton's defense sacked Troy quarterback Greg Windle five times for minus 38  yards and applied enough pressure to take away any advantage one of Orange  County's leading passers might have had.  </P> <P> Windle completed 12 of 26 attempts for 148 yards. He entered the game with more  than 1,500 yards passing.  </P> <P> Troy (3-5, 1-2) took a 7-0 lead when Windle hit Steve Friedrich for a five-yard  touchdown on the opening possession.  </P> <P> Fullerton tied the score on the opening possession of the second half, using  six minutes to go 62 yards to D.C. Olsen's one-yard run. DENNIS KAISER  </P></p>

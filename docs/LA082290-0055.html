			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY HOSPITALS BEGIN OUTPATIENT SERVICE  CUTS  </P> <P> Five Los Angeles County hospitals Tuesday began implementing a 9.5% cut in  outpatient services to the poor -- an action that health officials said will  result in longer waits for treatment.  </P> <P> The cuts were ordered earlier this month by the Board of Supervisors in  response to a shortfall in state funding.  </P> <P> They will result in a reduction of 11,508 outpatient visits a month to  County-USC, Harbor-UCLA, Martin Luther King-Drew, Rancho Los Amigos and Olive  View medical centers, health officials said.  </P> <P> The length of the wait will depend on the clinic. At County-USC's surgery  clinic, which evaluates patients before and after surgery, patients who  currently wait eight weeks face a 12-week wait, said a health department  spokesman.  </P> <P> County Health Director Robert Gates told supervisors the cuts will cause 100  layoffs.  </P></p>

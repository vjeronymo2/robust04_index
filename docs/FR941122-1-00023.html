			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this proposal, a household with no heating or cooling costs which is certified for three summer months and which expects to be billed for heating costs in the fall would be entitled to a heating or cooling standard at the time of certification. Also, a household that incurred no heating or cooling expenses in the past which moves to a living arrangement where it will incur heating costs in the next heating season would be allowed the annualized standard from the time of the move. If a State agency uses seasonal standards, households would be entitled to the appropriate seasonal standard if they incur or expect to incur a qualifying expense (or receive or expect to receive a LIHEA payment) during the season covered by the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe this proposal is more equitable and easier to administer than current policy. We would appreciate specific comments supporting the proposal or pointing out any problems with the proposed change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although food stamp households are categorically eligible for LIHEA, not all food stamp households receive the assistance, either because they do not apply for it or because LIHEA funds run out before all eligible households can be served. This makes it extremely difficult for State agencies to know in advance whether or not a household will receive LIHEA and be entitled to the standard. To grant the standard beginning with the month the household reports receipt of LIHEA would not meet the intent of the LIHEA legislation. Therefore, we are also proposing in revised &sect;273.9(d)(6)(ii) that the State agency shall allow a heating or cooling standard to households that receive or anticipate receiving LIHEA in the next heating or cooling season. These households shall continue to be entitled to the standard until they no longer receive or anticipate receiving LIHEA in the next heating or cooling season. The State agency would consult with the household concerning the household's intention to apply for LIHEA, determine whether or not the household received LIHEA for the previous season at the same address, and contact the LIHEA agency if necessary to determine the availability of funds and the likelihood that the household will receive energy assistance. The case worker would document the case file to support the decision to allow or deny use of the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii)(C) require that households incur recurring costs for heating or cooling in order to qualify for a heating or cooling standard. The regulations are confusing in that they specify that the household must be billed regularly, but, if the household is not billed regularly, it may use the standard between billing periods if it is otherwise eligible to use the standard. Under this proposed revision, the regulatory provisions for billing would not be needed. Entitlement to the heating or cooling standard would be based on anticipated expenses. Most households that are responsible for paying heating or cooling expenses have these expenses on a recurring basis. Therefore, we are proposing to remove the provisions regarding recurring costs from the regulations. We are also proposing to remove the provisions in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii)(C) and 7 CFR 273.10(d)(6) regarding households that incur out-of-pocket expenses for heating or cooling in excess of non-LIHEA energy assistance. These provisions would also be unnecessary under the proposed revision of the regulations. Any household that receives LIHEA or incurs an out-of-pocket expense for heating or cooling (except a household in public housing billed only for excess usage) would be entitled to an annualized heating or cooling standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing a conforming amendment to 7 CFR 273.10(d)(3) to provide that standard utility allowances shall be allowed in accordance with 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6). This change is necessary because the provisions allowing the averaging of fluctuating expenses and the determination of entitlement to an annualized heating or cooling standard based upon anticipated heating or cooling costs are exceptions to the provisions regarding billed expenses in 7 CFR 273.10(d)(2) and anticipating expenses in 7 CFR 273.10(d)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Household option. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(vii) require State agencies to advise households at the time of certification that, except for the telephone allowance, they may deduct their actual verified utility costs or the standard allowance throughout the certification period. The State agency is also required to advise households that they may switch between the use of actual utility costs and the standard at the time of recertification and one additional time during each twelve-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies have pointed out that households may move from one residence to another more frequently than once a year. Current policy is that the household's eligibility for the heating or cooling standard must be redetermined at the time of the move. We have granted waivers to several State agencies to allow households to choose between actual expenses or the standard when the household moves without having the choice count as a ``switch.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar faces strike as talks fail Caterpillar, the US heavy equipment maker, last night said the United Auto Workers had rejected the company's offers to resume labour contract negotiations and its offer to arbitrate a labour dispute. The company also said the UAW was planning to call a strike at its plants tonight. Caterpillar made the announcement after talks on labour practice disputes broke down between the two parties in Indianapolis. It said the UAW demanded that the company reinstate workers who had been discharged for what Caterpillar called illegal behaviour in some cases. Mr Bill Casstevens, UAW secretary-treasurer said the union was still willing to meet Caterpillar officials to resolve labour complaints. The UAW's 14,000 workers at Caterpillar plants have been operating under a company-imposed contract since they returned to work in April 1992 after a 163-day strike. Pressure within the union to resume the battle has increased recently, as Caterpillar's profits and share price have risen. The union last month rejected a new contract proposed by the company, insisting on job guarantees.</p>

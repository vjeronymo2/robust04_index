			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: FNAC returns to profits growth FNAC, the French music and books retailer, returned to profits growth in the first half of the financial year with a 20 per cent increase in net profits, to FFr60.6m (Dollars 10.8m) from FFr50.5m a year earlier. The group, which faces fierce competition from Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Megastores, said it was on course for recovery after a sharp fall in net profits, to FFr31.9m, in the year to August 31 from FFr159.5m the previous year. FNAC last year was destabilised by the financial pressures of the French recession, and by uncertainty over its future ownership. GMF, its old parent company, was forced to cede control to a consortium composed of subsidiaries of the Credit Lyonnais bank and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the industrial group. Although the economy is still under pressure, it has improved since last summer. FNAC, which also benefited in the first half from the opening of a store in Madrid, saw interim sales rise 5.5 per cent to FFr5.31bn from FFr5.03bn.</p>

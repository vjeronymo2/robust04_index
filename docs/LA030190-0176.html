			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CITY TO SPEND $3,000 TO PLAN NEW SIGNAL  </P> <P> The City Council voted this week to spend $3,000 to begin planning a pedestrian  traffic signal at the busy intersection of Knott and Danbrook avenues, but  residents who have been pleading for a signal in recent weeks said the council  did not go far enough.  </P> <P> "Once again, it appears we are getting the runaround," said resident Joe Van  Gilder.  </P> <P> "As Anaheim citizens, we deserve to be protected."  </P> <P> The residents at the meeting urged the council to move faster on the project by  approving $45,000 to install the signal.  </P> <P> The intersection is among the city's top 10 priorities for a signal, and city  plans had called for the signal to be planned and built in fiscal 1991, which  begins July 1. The council's decision to spend $3,000 allows the planning to  begin this fiscal year.  </P> <P> A temporary sign with yellow flashing lights was installed at the crossing  about two weeks ago.  </P></p>

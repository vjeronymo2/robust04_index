			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: BA's special relationship Anyone believing that British Airways would act as USAir's sugar daddy now knows that it will be sparing with the financial lollipops. But given that BA did not plan to invest any more money until 1996, that reassurance is somewhat superfluous at this stage. It rather suggests BA is playing to three broader galleries. BA's reticence will help USAir talk tough to the trades unions in its efforts to cut costs. It will also help calm shareholders' fears that it will throw good money after bad. BA comments may also be an attempt to take some sting out of the current controversy surrounding future UK-US aviation arrangements. USAir is certainly in a sorry state having lost Dollars 1.1bn over the past three years. The winter weather has caused severe disruption. But more worrying is the impact that low-cost rivals are having on USAir's main routes. It will take time and drastic action to address that threat. BA is relatively protected from USAir's losses given it receives a fixed 7 per cent coupon on its Dollars 400m of preference shares. That, though, will provide little comfort if USAir is forced to seek protection from its creditors. But BA's exposure to USAir is not just financial. The alliance forms a central strut in its global strategy and its collapse would badly tarnish its expansion plans. That makes it all the more unnerving that BA appears to have little control over its destiny in the US.</p>

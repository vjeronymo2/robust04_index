			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Baltica moves to shore up capital base ahead of expected deficit BALTICA, the Danish insurance group, is to strengthen its capital base ahead of a loss which is expected to reach between DKr2.5bn and DKr2.8bn (Dollars 430m-Dollars 482m) this year. That would cut shareholders' equity from DKr9.2bn at the end of 1991 to about DKr4.5bn at the end of 1992, and the group will not pay a dividend for 1992. The group has shored up Baltica Holdings, its parent company, by selling 32.35 per cent of its shares in Baltica Insurance to Den Danske Bank at DKr1,512 per share, which will raise DKr2.5bn. The deal gives Baltica the right to buy back the shares before the end of 1993. The holding company is selling some of its shares in France's Suez, in which Baltica has a total stake of just under 3 per cent, but this will not affect the co-operation agreement with Suez and Victoire, the insurance group controlled by Suez. Suez has a 23.4 per cent stake in Baltica Holding. Baltica said it will also sell its 4.9 per cent holding in Skandia, the Swedish insurer. In its first-half statement in August, Baltica reported a DKr991m loss, but said it expected a better second half. However, the group has subsequently had to make a DKr600m write-off on a property investment in Gibraltar and additional property write-offs of DKr200m. It also expects a loss of DKr300m in Baltica Bank, double the earlier forecast. Baltica Insurance is injecting DKr500m into Baltica Bank, which received lower credit ratings recently, and making a DKr500m deposit with the bank. The group said that Baltica Holding expects to make a profit in 1993. Jyske Bank reported a third-quarter loss of DKr400m, taking the operating loss for the year so far to DKr913m. The total loss for the year is expected to be about DKr1bn.</p>

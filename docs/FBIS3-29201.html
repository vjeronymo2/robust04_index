Commenting on the U.S. move  at a news conference on 15 February, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister  of international trade and industry, said: "Perhaps the U.S.  Government is considering various options. I hope that the U.S.  Government will not deal emotionally with the issue. If the  reasons for the United States to slap sanctions on Japan are  deemed to be unfair, Japan will have to argue fearlessly with  the United States at the GATT." In this way, the minister  indicated that Japan would take its case to the GATT depending  on how the United States handles the issue.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / April shake-up 'to slow upturn' The economic recovery will slow next year because of the impact of April's planned tax increases, says a London Business School forecast. It expects growth in UK gross domestic product to fall to 2.2 per cent in 1995, after 2.5 per cent this year. The latest edition of the LBS's Economic Outlook says tax increases of a similar magnitude have only been imposed three times during the past 30 years. On each occasion the result was sluggish growth in consumer spending. The same impact is predicted next year with the LBS forecasting a rise of just 1.1 per cent in consumer spending in 1995. It also predicts that inflation will sit in the top half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range until 1997. It believes underlying inflation, excluding mortgage payments, will be 3.1 per cent this year, 3.4 per cent in 1995, 3.3 per cent in 1996 and 3.1 per cent in 1997. As a result the LBS expects the government to raise interest rates next year. It predicts base rates will average 5.8 per cent next year and 6.4 per cent in 1996, before falling back to 5.5 per cent in 1997. Rising rates will reinforce the slowdown in economic activity. Unemployment will fall, according to the LBS, but only as far as 2.4m in 1997. 'Increased labour market flexibility should allow the economy to grow on a lower real wage and productivity growth path, at least while unemployment remains so high,' it says. 'However, whether this improved performance would allow the UK to sustain unemployment of below 2m without a serious resurgence of inflation is still open to question,' it adds.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW OFF 27.74 AS RUMORS SINK MARKET  </P> <P> The stock market yielded to a late-afternoon barrage of selling Wednesday,  sending the Dow Jones industrial index below 2,700 for the first time in three  weeks.  </P> <P> Brokers attributed the selloff partly to rumors, which were quickly denied,  that a major brokerage firm faced large losses from a position in junk bonds.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 27.74 to 2,679.52, closing below  2,700 for the first time since it stood at 2,678.11 on Aug. 23.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 555 up, 912 down and 526 unchanged.  </P> <P> The market's drop in the last hour of trading came as rumors spread that  Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was sustaining losses from holdings in bonds of a unit  of Campeau Corp., which is undergoing a financial restructuring that includes  plans to sell its Bloomingdale's department store chain.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch denied that it faced any losses in the junk bond sector and said  it owned no bonds related to Campeau. But Merrill stock dropped 1 3/8 to 32  7/8.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 175.33 million shares, up from 142.14 million on  Tuesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including  trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter  market, totaled 208.69 million shares.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, investors afflicted with interest rate jitters let the key 225-share  Nikkei index slip 45.94 to close at 34,286.94 after surging 219.22 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at  2,401.5, up 3.9.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Prices of long-term Treasury bonds and corporate junk bonds fell in a "flight  to quality" that sent money into safer short-term Treasury securities.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 15/32 point, or nearly $5, per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield climbed to 8.14% from 8.09% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.8125%, down from 8.875% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar declined against all key foreign currencies in quiet trading. Gold  prices rose slightly after falling overseas.  </P> <P> On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled  at $359.90 an ounce, up 40 cents from Tuesday. Republic National Bank's late  quote was $358.70, up 20 cents.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 146.70 Japanese yen from 146.73 yen Tuesday. It  traded at 146.90 yen in London, and at 146.40 yen in New York, down from  146.905.  </P> <P> In London, the pound rose to $1.5530 from $1.5470 late Tuesday. Sterling  fetched $1.5585 in New York, up from $1.5485.  </P> <P> Gold traded at $358.50 in London late Wednesday, down from $358.75 Tuesday, and  in Zurich, Switzerland, fell to $358.25 from $358.55. In Hong Kong, gold closed  unchanged at $359.93.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Prices of cotton futures skyrocketed on the New York Cotton Exchange, climbing  as much as 2 cents a pound, the permitted daily limit, on fresh signs of  shrinking world supplies.  </P> <P> On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell steeply, most energy futures  advanced, and precious metals, livestock and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Cotton futures settled 1.13 to 2 cents higher, with the contract for delivery  in October at 73.77 cents a pound.  </P> <P> The rally was rooted partly in Tuesday's Agriculture Department crop report,  which painted an ultimately bullish scenario for cotton although it was not  apparent at first blush.  </P> <P> Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade in selling  sparked by a higher 1989 wheat crop estimate and expectations for an increase  in 1990 wheat acreage.  </P></p>

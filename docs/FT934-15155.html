			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: FR falls 5% to Pounds 10.4m and warns on second six months FR GROUP, the maker of in-flight refuelling equipment, yesterday disappointed the market with a 5 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits and a larger fall in earnings, partly due to an increase in the tax charge. Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said that the cost of redundancies announced in August at Flight Refuelling and some closure costs would mean the next six month period was unlikely to produce results materially different from the first half. For the six months to June 30 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 11m to Pounds 10.4m, on sales ahead 2 per cent at Pounds 86.9m. Earnings per share fell from 10.2p to 9.01p and the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.46p. The group also announced the Pounds 13m acquisition of High Temperature Engineers, a company that makes aerospace components similar to those produced by Flight Refuelling. Mr Page said the acquisition should give the group critical mass in fuel systems. It would double Flight Refuelling's aircraft fuel systems business. Flight Refuelling suffered from lower demand for civil aerospace products worldwide and a fall in defence procurement spending and some delays in the placing of contracts. Stanley Aviation, which supplies engine positioners to the USAF, experienced technical difficulties. FR was also hit by falling demand from the Dutch armed forces for ammunition containers and has decided to close part of its Markhorst business in the Netherlands. Mr Page said that the other businesses, comprising about 66 per cent of the group's sales, were doing well. Redundancy costs in the second half should be about Pounds 1.4m. FR also said it has exchanged a contact to buy the assets of the life support products division of Aro Corporation, a subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand. It is paying about Dollars 9.5m (Pounds 6.3m) and completion is expected later this year. FR's shares closed 19p lower at 232p. COMMENT In the short term it is difficult to get excited about FR's prospects. Despite being well placed with niche military and aerospace products these results demonstrate that both markets are vulnerable to postponement of customers' programmes. Granted the Ministry of Defence should decide to go with the Phoenix programme after the budget, with positive impact on profitability next year. And the HTE acquisition has for the first time given FR a critical mass in fuel systems that could be developed. But with the uncertainty surrounding timing of its contracts, a prospective multiple of about 12.8, on profits of Pounds 20.8m, is a correct rating.</p>

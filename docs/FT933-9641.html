			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Private sector wins big share of councils' cleaning PRIVATE contractors have won more than a third of council contracts for building cleaning, the Institute of Public Finance says today in a survey on compulsory competitive tendering. The institute, the research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, found that 119 private companies had won contracts for cleaning buildings - more than for any other council service. They account for 35.8 per cent of all contracts awarded. However, the private sector has been most successful in winning small contracts, and its share of the total council market by value is lower, at 15 per cent. But the institute says their market share should grow in the next three years, as governors use their powers under local management of schools to contract out cleaning on individual contracts. Most school cleaning is now organised by local authorities in contracts which are too large for most private contractors to win. The private sector has steadily gained ground over the past four years. But the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981 regulations, known as Tupe, which implement the EC Acquired Rights Directive, could inhibit further private-sector gains. The institute says the regulations, which in many cases oblige private contractors to employ council workers on their original pay, terms and conditions, cause concern because 'it is estimated that up to 90 per cent of contract-cleaning costs are taken up by labour requirements'. The report adds: 'With competition within the industry so intense, success in the market is often synonymous with the lowest labour costs.' Costs of entry into the market are low because of cheap cleaning equipment, while there are few economies of scale, allowing small companies to bid successfully. The institute also suggests that experience with contract cleaning in the National Health Service has helped the smaller players. Regional variations are marked, with the private sector accounting for 53 per cent of contracts in the south-east and 49 per cent in London, but only 6 per cent in Wales and 12 per cent in the northernmost counties of England. Conservative councils are far more likely to award work to the private sector than Labour authorities, where 91 per cent of cleaning contracts stay in-house. CCT and the Private Sector, Volume 2.

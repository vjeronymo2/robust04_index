			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMING THE MIDDLE EAST: AN OMINOUS LIST EXPANDS  </P> <P> The quickening arms race in the Middle East is raising concerns among nations  bordering the Mediterranean. Libya, Israel, Syria, Iraq and Egypt have acquired  new and dangerous military technology, dramatically increasing the dangers of  local confrontations.  </P> <P> Europeans, who welcomed the elimination of the SS-20, cruise and Pershing 2  missiles, are dismayed by the prospect of a proliferation of new  mass-destruction weapons at their southern doorstep.  </P> <P> The list of hardware creating ominous risks gets longer every month: chemical  weapons, missiles, nuclear arsenals and sophisticated bombers.  </P> <P> As for Col. Moammar Kadafi's chemical plant, strong U.S. pressures have not  prevented the continuing transfer of technology and basic materials from  industrialized countries to Libya, according to European sources. The Western  World will soon have to decide what to do about it, but in the meantime a new  dimension has been added to the Libyan threat: the Soviet supply to Tripoli of  high-performance bombers and an airborne refueler.  </P> <P> Allies on the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have  been puzzled by the Soviet move, which contradicts the Kremlin's claim that  Moscow wants to play a more conciliatory role in the Arab-Israeli conflict,  seeking to increase its influence in the region through policies that bolster  stability, rather than undermine it.  </P> <P> The international press has focused its attention on the threat that an  enhanced Libyan capability might imply for Israel. However, William H. Webster,  director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, recently told a congressional  committee that if Libya extended the range and performances of its warplanes,  the entire balance of power in the region could be altered. All the more so,  given Kadafi's unpredictability. A couple of years ago he substantiated his  threats against Italy by ordering two Scud missiles -- which fortunately missed  -- to be fired at the Italian island of Lampedusa. Kadafi claimed a U.S. Coast  Guard station on Lampedusa had guided American planes on their April, 1986,  raid on Libya. The Italian Ministry of Defense has pointedly announced that new  radar systems will be installed in the southern part of the peninsula,  acknowledging that the Soviet SU-24 bombers recently sold to Libya could, if  refueled in the air, reach all of Italy -- as well as parts of France and West  Germany.  </P> <P> While the chemical weapons situation is not encouraging, recent developments  concerning missiles and their potential payloads are no brighter. These weapons  appear to be more freely available in the international arms market than was  intended by the seven industrial nations (the United States, Britain, Canada,  France, Italy, Japan and West Germany) when they agreed to restrict access to  missile technology in April, 1987, with the Missile Technology Control Regime.  And now there is a growing risk that surface-to-surface medium-range missiles  will be armed with nuclear warheads and spread throughout the Middle East.  </P> <P> Israeli officials have alleged that Iraq is secretely engaged in a crash  program to build nuclear warheads for a medium-range missile under development  with technical and financial assistance from Argentina and Egypt. While the  missile project (called Condor 2 by the Argentines) has been confirmed, the  allegations about the Iraqi nuclear program have raised doubts. Both the news  and the unconfirmed allegations, nevertheless, offer Israel a good reason -- or  a good pretext -- for proceeding with its crash program on nuclear arms,  missiles and other sophisticated weapons.  </P> <P> Estimates on the number of atomic warheads Israel possesses vary considerably,  depending on interpretations given to data that Israeli technician Mordechai  Vanunu disclosed in his Oct. 5, 1986, interview with the London Sunday Times.  Israel might have an arsenal of 100 to 200 nuclear devices, according to  several specialists who analyzed the data and examined the photographs supplied  by Vanunu. Accepting the authenticity of his technical data, Theodore Taylor, a  former U.S. weapons designer, and Frank Barnaby, a British nuclear scientist  who debriefed Vanunu extensively, also believe Israel has produced weapons that  use nuclear fusion: H-bombs.  </P> <P> The consensus among U.S. officials who have access to the information provided  by intelligence sources is that Israel's nuclear arsenal contains no more than  50 to 70 devices. Yet even an arsenal of this size is much bigger than all  previous estimates and could enable Israel to develop a nuclear strategy based  on a panoply of tactical, medium range and strategic atomic weapons.  </P> <P> This is a distinct change in the Middle East scenario. France has been until  now the only medium-size power to have a totally independent nuclear deterrent,  the force de frappe -- striking force -- and an original doctrine for its  employment. Has the force de frappe concept proliferated? Israel is apparently  developing a missile that can reach the Soviet Union. Should we conclude that  Israel has a nuclear defense strategy?  </P> <P> If this is a plausible conclusion, then Gen. Charles de Gaulle's predictions  have been proved right. De Gaulle was utterly skeptical about the possibility  of preventing the spread of atomic weapons trough international constraints.  His nuclear doctrine was based on the assumption that every industrial nation  would, in time, possess its own nuclear arsenal composed of a panoply of  weapons adapted to its specific situation and needs -- its own force de frappe.  </P> <P> The importance of Israel's nuclear development has increased to a point that it  might constitute an Israeli force de frappe doctrine -- a doctrine playing a  vital role in Israeli defense and strategic thinking. This, in turn, gives a  powerful impetus to the arms buildup of the Arab and Muslim states in the  region. Something must be done to arrest this calamitous spiral.  </P></p>

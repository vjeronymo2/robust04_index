			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (1): Eyes open wider to the green scene - Running a business with an eye to its impact on the environment may not improve profits - but there are other motives The high tide of popular green enthusiasm has partly ebbed away, but its legacy across Europe and North America is layers of environmental regulation directed at industry and commerce. It has left, too, cohorts of consultants urging companies to improve their environmental management. That exhortation covers a wide range of issues. Broadly, environmental management means managing a business with an eye to its impact on the environment and to environmental regulation. Surveys have shown that companies are increasingly paying attention to these issues. Last month's study of more than 200 environmental managers by Environmental Data Services, the well-respected journal, found that two thirds had been appointed in the last three years, and one third in the last year. KPMG Peat Marwick, the consultants, found that more than 40 per cent of 700 companies it questioned recently in industrialised countries published statements of environmental policy. The question of how management should take account of environmental concerns also contains a trickier conundrum: whether cleaning up the environment can be commercially worthwhile. There is fierce debate between those who see the environment and the new regulation as an extra layer of cost on business, and those who argue that 'greener' can mean richer. The costs of cleaning up, certainly, have become increasingly clear. As governments have enforced the new rules, some industrial and commercial costs have risen - in many cases passed on to the consumer. That recognition is behind the UK government's decision to tangle with Brussels over the question of whether some water quality standards are unnecessarily high. The message behind the higher fuel and road taxes in the UK's Budget last month  -measures presented as 'green' - was also that a clean environment costs money. But at the same time ministers and many consultants argue that the environment and the new regulation offer businesses new opportunities which only the most stubborn would ignore. The traditional confrontation between industry and environmentalists is giving way to co-operation. There is no simple adjudication of that debate. Few figures are available to show how much environmental protection is costing industry. Nor are there many answers that apply beyond specific, local cases. Of the reasons commonly given why it is worthwhile for businesses to improve environmental management, a few are plausible; many are unconvincing. Reducing the risk of prosecution under environmental regulations is one of the best reasons for improving environmental management. Environmental lawyers believe that companies' fear about potential liabilities is the reason why they are so busy. Under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, directors and managers can also be held personally liable for the company's pollution and can be subject to criminal prosecution. Increasingly, bankers and insurers survey their exposure to customers' environmental obligations, and want customers to demonstrate that adequate controls are in place. Improving public image is a powerful motive, although the benefits are hard to quantify. Mr John Cox, director of the Chemical Industries Association, which represents some 250 UK companies, says: 'The fall in the chemical industry's reputation coincides with growing public concern about pollution. It creates a political climate where legislators feel more bound to legislate, and it certainly can affect planning permission'. For example, he argues, industry needs a nationwide network of incinerators, but because of public opposition to incinerators, it is difficult for waste companies to get permission even to expand existing plants. 'We have never been able to quantify what the poor image is costing us but we do say it is a real cost to the bottom line and represents a threat to our freedom to invest as we require'. Minimising waste and saving resources, a favourite mantra of consultants, raises the question of why businesses were not making the savings already. The answer is that they should have been doing so, but the extra discipline of regularly looking at their impact on the environment helps companies locate new savings, according to Mr Martin Houldin, head of the environment unit at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'In recession there is a drive to get costs down, but they then creep up again as management priorities change'. He argues that tightening regulation on waste disposal means that the factory is 'no longer seen as a black box from which waste just comes out - managers are looking more at the internal use of resources'. For example, as regulators and water companies have increased the cost of drawing water and discharging effluent to rivers, even small companies are finding it worthwhile to recover, treat and re-use water themselves. Finding new markets. Environment ministers are fond of arguing that sales of environmental technology provide a new business opportunity. The success of UK water companies, notably North West Water, in winning overseas contacts for improving water quality, is a case in point. But these opportunities are accessible only to a small pool of companies compared to the number affected by tightening environmental regulation. Improving competitive advantage. One of the most difficult claims to assess is whether alertness to environmental issues gives companies an advantage in selling their products. In some, the answer is yes: for example, motor manufacturers expecting fuel prices or taxes to rise will find it worthwhile to develop more fuel-efficient cars. Companies which accurately anticipate these trends may then find they can secure a competitive advantage within the arena where the taxes or rules apply. It is also in their interest for the rules to be vigorously enforced. However they could find themselves handicapped by a higher cost structure compared to countries with looser environmental regulation - a concern which the European chemical industry has voiced strongly. It is also difficult to judge whether consumers prefer 'green' products and will pay more for them. Claims that consumers would tolerate a 'green premium' have been called into question by recession - price has become a greater determinant of preferences, some surveys report. Consultants acknowledge the difficulties of estimating the benefits of environmental management. Mr Houldin says: 'There are very few companies who will say that there is already a net financial benefit in what they have done. But they would not be taking these steps if they did not believe there would be a benefit.' Complex environmental regulation means there is a need for companies to keep abreast of environmental regulation and changes in customers' tastes. But governments are worried about the costs of cleaning up the environment, concerned that these costs should be compared with the environmental benefits before regulation is passed. The fashionable claim that environmental management is a wand to transform the expensive process of complying with regulation environment into a business opportunity has not been proven, and it ignores the unavoidable costs of making the environment cleaner.</p>

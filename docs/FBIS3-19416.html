			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Popular Party Secretary Mino </F> Martinazzoli by Antonio Padellaro in Brescia; date not given:  "They Cannot Win, So I Will" -- first two paragraphs are  L'ESPRESSO introduction]    [Text] First, Mino Martinazzoli protested: "There is a  conspiracy of silence against the center, and I wonder why so  many newspaper commentators, including some authoritative ones,  are still writing -- and in so doing stating something that is  clearly untrue -- that the 27 March electoral race will be  contested only by [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi's  right and [Achille] Occhetto's [Democratic Party of the Left,  PDS] left." But why should the newspapers conceal the truth?  "Perhaps because of the cynicism of the financial groups behind  the major sectors of the press." Does he think that the center  can win? "I say that the race is still on. There are still a  large number of unknown factors."    Enveloped in a blue haze of smoke from his Muratti  cigarette,  Martinazzoli knows that he cannot do much to cloud the reality  of the election forecasts. According to the opinion polls, his  Popular Party [PPI], at best, is worth 12 percent. This,  together with the 6 percent from [Mario] Segni's Pact for Italy,  would seem to lend strength to the arguments of those who,  whether out of opportunism or for other reasons, prefer not to  bet on the center. And even though from here (we were in  Brescia, in a prosperous attorney's office which it would be  ridiculous to compare to the grandeur of Arcore [Berlusconi's  home]), Rome looks like a front abandoned to the overwhelming  strength of the enemy, the PPI secretary does have a strategy.  He explained it to L'ESPRESSO, pointing out that the first rule  is not to overestimate your adversaries. Starting with Achille  Occhetto who, Martinazzoli said, "inebriated by the results of  the November and December local elections and, among other  things, ignoring the fact that they were held under different  electoral mechanisms, has believed that the same pattern could  be reproduced in the general election."    [Padellaro] Whereas?    [Martinazzoli] Whereas Occhetto will probably lose. But  above all, by so doing, he has not helped the development of the  Italian political system. And he has not fulfilled his ambition  to really build a democratic left, freed from the old origins of  the PCI [Italian Communist Party].    [Padellaro] Could you be more specific in your charges?    [Martinazzoli] A party, the PDS, that solemnly declared that  it wanted to distance itself from its origins should not have  got together again with that part of it, Communist Renewal, that  did not accept that challenge. And neither should it have  permitted such a movement as Rete to characterize the ideology  of the so-called progressive alignment in such a marked way.  The representatives of the left are seeking votes on the basis  of their guarantee that they are no longer what they were in the  past. But they are unable to say what they are now.    [Padellaro] What about Berlusconi? He seems unstoppable.    [Martinazzoli] Forza Italia is exploiting the draw of the  television message and its power of suggestion. It is no  coincidence that, as far as can be gathered, it is mainly women  and young people that are captivated by the image that  Berlusconi is able to project. He may be victorious in those  sectors that have fewest social reference points. We certainly  have candidates that have a more direct relationship with their  environment.    [Padellaro] But who are Berlusconi's potential voters?    [Martinazzoli] They are certainly people who want a little  more order and a few more certainties. They are outraged by the  political corruption. Deep down, they have always nurtured a  certain mistrust of politics. They are people who identify with  the figure represented by Berlusconi and who regard him almost  as an avenger against the attitudes and behavior of professional  politicians. And by virtue of this identification, they expect  an immediate appropriation of the political dimension.    [Padellaro] Is their confidence well placed?    [Martinazzoli] When I think about Berlusconi, I feel  prompted  to say that politics concerns not your own affairs, but those of  others. I would add that, in general, those who are too  successful in their own affairs are rather neglectful of other  people's.    [Padellaro] So was it what we could call this difference of  mentality that prevented an election agreement between you and  Berlusconi?    [Martinazzoli] When I went to visit him around Christmas he  presented me with the logic of the abacus. He told me, there is  the left which is all united, and we must unite everything other  than that. Perhaps I failed to understand that what was at  stake was a victory by the left-wing forces in our country. I  replied to him that the arithmetical logic of the abacus would  have defeated even our traditional reservations about the MSI  [Italian Social Movement]. I tried to explain to him that we  have been part of Italian history since 1919. We saw Mussolini  win, and we saw many Popular Party members who considered it  more realistic to side with him. Sturzo, however, preferred to  go into exile, and it was in exile that [Alcide] de Gasperi's DC  [Christian Democratic Party] gained its legitimacy. True,  between Berlusconi and me there was not merely a tactical lack  of understanding, but an acknowledgment that our respective  visions of politics were incompatible. But he knew that  already, and had prepared himself in time.    [Padellaro] Why do you think that?    [Martinazzoli] The fact is that Berlusconi had decided to  enter the arena some time before. Otherwise, why would he have  tried to scale down [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi's  leadership? And why would he have encouraged and helped the  mini-split within the PPI by Casini and company?    [Padellaro] Are you worried about the prospect of  Berlusconi's becoming prime minister?    [Martinazzoli] Probably in the United States too, on the eve  of Reagan's victory, some intellectuals may not have been happy  about the idea of a Hollywood actor's becoming president.  Later, however, Reagan showed that he possessed certain  capabilities. The problem with Berlusconi, rather, is that he  is someone who has closely involved his business with politics,  though he now portrays himself as a hero of the free market.  Certainly I feel like laughing when I read, on the subject of  the composition of the next government, that Berlusconi's  orchestra or [Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni's  band will include a woman judge whose job will be to organize  her former colleagues.    [Padellaro] Are you not talking that way out of envy for  Berlusconi's political successes?    [Martinazzoli] It may be that I display the complex of the  nobleman in decline, but permit me to draw a parallel, albeit an  apparently unpleasant one. The judiciary will decide on the  matter of [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi's  criminal responsibilities, though his political faults are in  any case clear. But I was a minister in a government of which  Craxi was prime minister, and Craxi was a politician who did  have some political ideas, and that is a fact. The destruction  of the race of politicians and their massacre is a price that we  have to pay for the faults that they committed, but it is  certainly not the remedy to all this country's ills.    [Padellaro] Some people say that the errors that led to the  elimination of several of the Popular and Pact candidates were  no accident. And that in fact they conceal a maneuver on the  part of the sector of the former DC which, deep down, supports  Forza Italia. It is also said that cooperation between you and  Segni is not always of the best. Is this so?    [Martinazzoli] No, it seems to me that in Latium, which is  where we had the biggest problems, an error was made in the  interpretation of the law, which is in any case a kind of trap.  Certainly, at the local level there were some misunderstandings  with Segni's people. We had situations in central Italy where  the Pact first demanded certain constituencies for their own  candidates and then, the next day, decided not to gather  signatures. I am not blaming Segni for this, but the fact is  that he has some local officials, often former Christian  Democrats, who, like all those who have left, maintain difficult  relations with us. It is not an intolerable problem, but it is  a problem.    [Padellaro] You are very critical of Occhetto and  Berlusconi.  After the elections, however, the center may be forced to ally  with one or the other.    [Martinazzoli] We could also go into opposition. But if  nobody is victorious, the problem of alliances will arise for  all the forces. In a situation in which the absence of a  victory by the left or the right destroys these schemes, it is  we who will be the point of attraction. We are arrogant enough  to think that it is the others that will offer us an agreement.    [Padellaro] An agreement for what kind of government?    [Martinazzoli] I see no chance of continuing with a  government of experts. I think that we must act on the lesson  that we learned from the Ciampi government, namely, that the  more skills, seriousness of purpose, and impartiality there are  in a government, the better it is for everyone. This, even  though I hope that Ciampi will remember to make it clear to the  Italian people that it is we and the others who enabled him to  govern well. But I fear that we no longer need a politically  neutral government, if we consider the complexity of our new  problems. In past months there has been a revival in Europe of  major wars and of grand diplomacy to build industrial alliances  that will later be brought to bear in the subsequent stage of  the European market and in economic competition with America.  Will our iron and steel industry look toward France or Germany?  And how will the automobile industry resolve its problems? We  also need a government that is equal to the complexity of the  constitutional problems -- a constituent government, therefore,  that will tackle first and foremost the problem of federalism  and that can complete the electoral reform.    [Padellaro] A reform to introduce a two-round system?    [Martinazzoli] Yes, though, rather than runoffs, a  French-style open system would be preferable.    [Padellaro] A new system with which to hold another election  soon?    [Martinazzoli]That remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Sharp drop in west German GDP WESTERN Germany's gross domestic product fell by a real 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of the year, compared with the same period of 1992. It was the sharpest drop in economic activity since 1975. The figure was immediately seized upon by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, as confirmation that Germany could be facing its most severe recession for more than 30 years. He warned that the downturn could jeopardise recovery in eastern Germany, which is heavily dependent on western investment. He called for urgent measures to control inflation and limit public spending, to provide room for further cuts in interest rates to stimulate a recovery. Yet the Bundesbank, whose governing council yesterday decided against any further rate reductions, cautioned against excessive pessimism about the figures. Mr Otmar Issing, a leading director of the bank, said the figure was distorted by special factors. Economic activity in the first quarter of 1992 was exceptionally favourable, thanks to a particularly mild winter; and there was a surge in consumer spending in the last quarter of the year, before a one percentage point increase in value added tax on January 1. A second set of figures just released, for manufacturing activity in April, showed a better than expected recovery of 0.5 per cent compared with March. The March figure was also adjusted upwards, and the two-month total showed an increase of 1 per cent against January-February. All categories of economic activity in the GDP were down in the first quarter, however, with the sharpest fall (14.8 per cent year-on-year) recorded for investment in plant and equipment. Private consumption was down 1 per cent, state consumption down 1.4 per cent, while imports and exports both showed sharp declines: 5.4 and 6.3 per cent respectively. Gross national product, which includes external trade, showed an even sharper decline than GDP, down by a real 3.7 per cent over the year. Mr Rexrodt said the figures confirmed his repeated view that 'the current recession in western Germany could prove more serious than those in the 1960s, the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s'. He said there was 'still no concrete sign of a turn in the economy'. His gloom contrasted with the more relaxed attitude of Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, in Bonn on Wednesday, when he warned against a 'mood of black despair', and insisted that the slump in industrial production was no more dramatic than in the past recessions of 1973-75 and 1980-82. On the other hand, the German trade union federation called for an emergency DM30bn (Pounds 12bn) economic growth initiative to counter rising unemployment, and for the Bundesbank to take immediate action to 'loosen its interest-rate stranglehold' on the entire European economy.</p>

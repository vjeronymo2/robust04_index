			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ECKERD OPEN SEES SELES ADVANCE WITH CAUTION  </P> <P> Two days after achieving a career-high No. 3 world ranking, Monica Seles is  heading into the round of 16 with a determined note of caution.  </P> <P> The 16-year-old native of Yugoslavia cemented her newest ranking Tuesday night  with another big victory, quashing qualifier Sandy Collins 6-1, 6-1 without a  hitch in the Eckerd Tennis Open.  </P> <P> But Seles, who now faces Donna Faber, said after defeating Collins that she  doesn't want to become overconfident.  </P> <P> "You can be going along full of confidence, then it can go away just as  quickly," Seles said after the Tuesday match. "I feel good about my game and  things are going very well. I'll just continue to try my best."  </P> <P> Also Tuesday, sixth-seeded Helen Kelesi of Canada outlasted Mercedes Paz of  Argentina 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 7-6 (7-5); while No. 8 Susan Sloane rallied to upset  Shaun Stafford 6-4, 2-6, 7-5. No. 7 Sandra Cecchini of Italy downed Ann  Grossman 7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> Tonight, Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the tournament's No. 2 seed, is to  play her first-round match against Tami Whitlinger.  </P> <P> Kelesi said she was relieved after pulling through a three-hour test in  88-degree temperatures.  </P> <P> "There was a point when I was down 5-4 in the third set and I was thinking I  had lost the match," Kelesi said. "I wasn't doing anything right, and she was  playing very well. I really had to fight to keep my spirits up. But if there's  one thing about me, it's that I'm a fighter."  </P> <P> It looked as if Kelesi would close out the match after breaking Paz in the 11th  game to go ahead 6-5. But Paz broke back and forced a tie-break, and surged  ahead 4-1 in the tie-break.  </P> <P> Kelesi then won the next three points. At 5-all, Paz netted a backhand, then  her forehand sailed wide, giving Kelesi the match.  </P></p>

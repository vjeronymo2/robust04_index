			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (9): Paid-up members of the black-pack - Lucia van der Post runs her eye over the fashion designers / The designers' wardrobes Nothing about the world of haute couture - or even its humbler relation, ready-to-wear - is amenable to the rational laws that govern so much else. This, of course, is part of its charm. Take the designers. There they are building businesses - and sometimes lucrative global empires - in which success depends on persuading people that they need new clothes. Their very existence depends on change, on imbuing dress with excitement and innovation, with generating an imperative to embrace the new and the different. What then, might the novice observer of the scene ask, do they wear? Are they founts of originality, of quirky creativity, of visual excitement? The answer is that they are the most conservative dressers around. Mostly they evolve a personal style early in their creative lives and stick with it. Show me a plain cashmere jumper, a simple T-shirt, an ancient bomber-jacket or an old pair of jeans and in it probably lurks a designer even now persuading some fashion victim in a far-flung city to part with more money than most of us would consider wise. Designers, like fashion editors (their judges and jury), have a strong penchant for black and there is a perverse pride in not being caught in anything new. Even snappier dressers, those who go in for a little colour, such as Christian Lacroix and Gianni Versace, tend to be seen endlessly in the same garment. Of all the black-pack members Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons, is probably the most stalwart member. She has been known to change her seemingly endless succession of black shrouds for a crisp white shirt (worn with - you've guessed it - black trousers) but only on rare occasions. Most women designers, for obvious reasons, work more or less with their own image in mind. Sonia Rykiel, lean as a whippet and given to wearing wide, floaty-legged trousers teamed with skimpy little jumpers, is a paid-up member of the black-pack who makes clothes for other whippets. When she comes out on the runway what you see first is the cloud of red-hair but then you notice the shades of black relieved only by a belt with words such as Love, Paris or, for the slow-witted, Rykiel. Caroline Charles, who understands perfectly the clothes that should adorn the English social season, is hardly ever seen in the colours that complement her customers' complexions so well. From the top of her chic little black head to the bottom of her impeccably-cut, long, narrow, cigarette trousers, it is usually black all the way. While Donna Karan seems to require inordinate amounts of black, Jean Muir is famous for never wearing anything but navy. 'It simplifies the matter of dressing and packing,' she says. This is perfectly true and a good motto for those whose aim and object is the simplification of dressing and packing. Katharine Hamnett, in her army fatigue trousers and a T-shirt that looks as if it has seen better days, manages to make many of us feel over-dressed, while Betty Jackson wears her own clothes with so much panache that, as one fashion editor put it, 'when you see them, you want them'. For those who think the matter of clothes should be invested with a whiff of danger, a sense of potential disaster, Vivienne Westwood is the designer to watch. She wears her own designs and these vary from improbably neat twinsets and pearls, which could have come straight from the stodgiest of stores, to a transparent figure-hugging body sheath (and who among those of us who saw it can forget that embarrassing matter of the fig-leaf?). When it comes to men, the garments most frequently seen after the catwalk show ends are jeans and T-shirts. Even Gianni Versace, king of Glitz, at the party he gave for the opening of his Bond street shop, turned up in a pair of jeans, although in honour of the event he teamed it with a brightly-patterned silk shirt. After his shows Claude Montana wears the same old beaten-up leather jacket (much akin to a biker's jacket) and tight jeans. Karl Lagerfeld, of course, wears a pony-tail and with it a sharply-cut and expensive suit, contrasting shirt and tie (white on black) which, in spite of its impeccable designer lineage, brings to mind nothing so much as Chicago gangster-style. Jean-Paul Gaultier wears beaten-up old jeans, a T-shirt (often of matelot stripes), some sort of leather blouson jacket (biker imagery is strong among the frock-designing set) and brilliantly dyed blond hair. Yves Saint-Laurent these days requires careful tailoring to hide a less-than-lean silhouette. When his fragile health allows him to make it on to the runway he normally wears a good grey suit, shirt and tie - classic and flattering. For those who value eccentricity above classicism John Galliano is the designer to watch. He is addicted to gruesome little shorts which he teams with some sort of T-shirt and a jacket with some historical provenance, say a 19th century hussar's jacket worn casually slung over the shoulder. The whole is frequently topped by some bizarre head-gear - Russian fur hats are a favourite. The one almost inviolate rule that unites them all is that whatever a designer wears it must on no account be new. Issey Miyake in his jeans and his indigo cotton shirt, Giorgio Armani, in jeans and white cotton T-shirt in summer, navy-blue cashmere in winter, Calvin Klein in his laid-back tweed suit and white cotton T-shirt - the message they convey is loud and clear. If in doubt dress down. Invest in quality classics about which you never need to think and then you can get on with the more important things of life  -such as living. Perhaps there is a lesson in there somewhere.</p>

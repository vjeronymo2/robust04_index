			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China likely to approve power deals - Energy demand soars; Investors expect 15-22% return; Dollars 1.2bn Guangdong plant High level meetings in Beijing over the next few weeks are expected to sanction the first of about 50 proposed power station projects worth billions of dollars relieving a logjam on approvals which has frustrated some of the world's largest power companies. Power industry representatives will be looking particularly to an economic 'work conference' and follow-up planning sessions for indications that argument over rates of return payable on equity investment in Chinese infrastructure has been resolved. The Ministry of Electric Power Industry declined comment yesterday on reports that China had sanctioned a new formula that would satisfy investors. Equity participants in proposed power projects had baulked at a 12-15 per cent 'cap' on returns on investment. But a western official in Beijing, whose responsibilities include the power sector, said China appeared at last to have recognised that if it wanted projects to go ahead it would have to yield to investor demand for more generous returns. He said that under a proposed new formula returns would range between 15-22 per cent depending on the efficiency of new plants. Chinese-equipped plants run at about 60 per cent 'availability', while foreign-supplied equipment provided efficiency ratios that were close to 90 per cent. Higher returns would be guaranteed for more efficient plants. Among international power companies involved in negotiations with Chinese institutions are GEC of the UK, and Mission Energy, Wing International, General Electric and Entergy Corporation of the US. Industry representatives regarded as a 'promising development' the Dollars 1.2bn preliminary agreement announced this month for construction of twin 660MW coal-fired power plants and associated facilities in Guangdong province. The project brings together Entergy, Marubeni of Japan, Hong Kong investors and local power authorities in Guangdong. The representative in Hong Kong of a large European power utility described the Guangdong deal as an indication of progress, but he also noted detailed discussions had not begun on implementation. Beijing was also yet to approve the agreement. An official of the Ministry of Electric Power confirmed yesterday that the ministry was working on its final proposals for the ninth five-year plan to carry China through to the year 2000. These will be presented to a national planning conference early next month. Rapidly rising demand for energy, due to China's explosive economic growth, and an increasing shortfall in available power have put pressure on the government to accelerate approval of new plants. According to a recent report by CS First Boston, China's 'reserve ratio' of available power became negative for the first time in 1991 and the situation had continued to worsen 'The surplus of energy has seen a precipitous drop through the 1980s and into the 1990s,' the report stated. 'In 1981, the surplus was 11.8m tonnes of SCE (standard coal equivalent) or a reserve ratio of 1.9 per cent. China has seen a rapid and sustained drop in its reserve ratio annually since 1981.' The CS First Boston report estimated that new spending on the power sector would 'have to exceed' Dollars 14bn-Dollars 15bn a year for the rest of the decade to keep pace with current demand. Mr Jiang Shaojun, director of the General Office of the Ministry of Electric Power, estimates that China's 'shortfall' of energy nationwide averages 20 per cent, with shortages most acute in the fast growing southern coastal regions. He said that China planned to add another 117,000MW of generating capacity by the year 2000 to reach a planning target of 300,000MW. He estimated the cost of adding 117,000MW at Yn570bn (Dollars 67bn), somewhat less than western estimates. Mr Jiang described China's ambitions of reaching its power planning targets as a 'huge task'. He also said it was essential that China 'cut down on waste' in the delivery and utilisation of power. In Hong Kong, Mr Paul Schulte, China analyst with CS First Boston, said Beijing faced a difficult challenge in convincing equity investors in the power sector that their investments would be secure and reap reasonable returns. He described as 'stumbling blocks' worries about the arbitrary setting of electricity tariffs, stability of the currency, inflation, and guaranteed reasonable returns on investment. 'If these issues are not resolved, many of these projects involving foreign investors will be dead in the water,' he said. 'They are not going to have foreign investment.'  ------------------------------------------     CHINA - POWER SALES AND GENERATION  ------------------------------------------ Sales by customer  ------------------------------------------ Agriculture                 11.7 percent Transport                    1.2 percent Other                          4 percent Residential                  7.5 percent Commercial                   1.3 percent Industrial                  73.6 percent  ------------------------------------------ Generation by fuel type  ------------------------------------------ Hydro                       20.3 percent Gas                          0.5 percent Oil                          7.6 percent Coal                        71.6 percent  ------------------------------------------ Source: Jardine Fleming Research  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Cap Sesa Counting On PME's"] </F>   [Text] With 1 billion francs[Fr] of annual revenue within  the industry, representing 3.6 percent of the French software  and computer services market last year, Cap Sesa Industrie is  aiming at a six percent share of the market by the end of 1996.  To attain its ambitious goal, in a context in which acquisitions  are at a forced standstill, and in which double-digit growth is  a thing of the past, this Cap Gemini Sogeti [CGS] subsidiary is  banking mainly on a new organization and on a shift in strategy  toward the most promising sectors in terms of growth. "Overall,  French industry's spending on computerization last year totaled  Fr92 billion, of which Fr29 billion went into software and  computerization services alone," says Gerard Mezin, general  manager of Cap Sesa Industrie. This figure can be expected to  grow at an average rate of 8.6 percent annually, approaching  Fr40 billion in 1996, and to represent approximately 35 percent  of the industrial sector's computerization budgets. "With the  big enterprises reducing their investments in computerization,  the growth of the market is currently being fostered by the  medium-sized industries." A Cap Sesa survey of the major  industrial sectors indicates fields of activity that are still  largely underequipped. The food processing industry devotes not  more than one percent of its revenue to information processing,  versus around 12 percent for the aeronautics and defense  industries. The automobile, steelmaking, and petrochemical  industries devote between 2.5 and 3.5 percent of their revenue  to this need. Based on these findings, the CGS subsidiary has  decided to shift to a new operational organization, effective 1  January 1994, involving market development units designed to  sell to specific sectors and to centers of expertise  specializing in a particular type of services or applications.  This should enable Cap Sesa Industrie to better attack the  market and occupy niches with high value-added potential.</p>

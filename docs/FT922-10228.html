			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Observer: Scarecrow transformed 'It'll take some getting used to,' said Jenny Colborne, goggling at her husband. Although just pronounced Britain's scruffiest man, he had been transformed for the occasion by the British Clothing Industry Assoc- iation's gift of a Pounds 1,200 wardrobe including Centaur double-breasted suit, Savile Row shirt and Frank Theak and Roskilly tie. A management consultant and spare-time lute-maker from Worcester, John Colborne normally rigs out his 6ft 2in frame with short-sleeved shirts above cords in all weathers, even meeting clients while shod in trainers cast off by his 70-year-old father. The scarecrow effect won him pride of place in a 300-strong entry for the association's Super Scruff title, its latest effort to promote British-made male attire. Previous stunts have included presenting former trade and industry secretary Peter Lilley with basketfuls of old socks. But whereas most of the other contenders were nom- inated by despairing wives, some considering divorce, the winner was shopped by a next- door neighbour. 'One of those neat little people,' Jenny Colborne said, doing another double-take at the sartorial elegance topped by newly mown hair and beard. On reflection, she added, the worst shock after 20 years of mar- riage was the 'lack of chin'.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Toyota and Renault fall foul of ASA CARMAKERS Toyota and Renault have both fallen foul of the Advertising Standards Authority over the way they have advertised the speed of their cars, according to the latest report on complaints made to the authority published today, Diane Summers writes. The authority said it had received fewer complaints about car advertisements following its clampdown in 1990. However, the authority said there had been a 'blip a couple of months ago' as some manufacturers 'appeared to be returning to speed as an advertising platform'. It said that the text of the Toyota national press advertisement for the MR2 GT (above) 'placed too great an emphasis on fast and possibly unsafe driving'. A complaint against a Renault Clio advertisement showing a car on a race track ahead of a Formula One racing car was also upheld.</p>

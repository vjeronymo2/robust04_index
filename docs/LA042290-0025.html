			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW DAY FOR EARTHLY CONCERNS;  </P> <P> WITH 5 BILLION ABOARD, TIME FOR THE NEXT REVOLUTION  </P> <P> Earth Day is at its best at the neighborhood level, with nature hikes and trash  pickups -- but it's bigger than that. It brings forth resounding speeches by  politicians, some of them sincere, but it's bigger than that, too. There are  Hollywood events, TV specials and ads telling us how various corporations love  the planet, but it's much bigger than that.  </P> <P> Every school in Thailand is planting a tree; every church in Costa Rica is  giving an Earth sermon; there are concerts in the Soviet Union, a rain-forest  roadshow in Japan and a beach cleanup in Tanzania -- but I think, and hope,  that Earth Day is bigger than all that.  </P> <P> If we're wise and lucky, Earth Day 1990 can be one of those peoples'  demonstrations, like the ones in Berlin and Leipzig and Wenceslas Square, that  launch a revolution. The revolutionary opportunity is not the turnover of one  government for another, nor even the establishment of a new idea of government.  It's bigger than that. The potential revolution is equivalent to only two  others in human history -- the Agricultural and the Industrial revolutions.  </P> <P> About 8,000 years ago, when there were just 10 million people in the world,  some hunter-gatherers started domesticating animals, cultivating plants and  founding humanity's first permanent settlements. They altered the face of the  planet and the thoughts of humankind.  </P> <P> For the first time it made sense to own land. People who stayed in one place  could accumulate things. The ideas of wealth, inheritance, trade, money and  power were born. Some people lived on excess food produced by others and became  full-time potters, toolmakers, musicians, scribes, priests, soldiers or kings.  Thus arose, for better or worse, the division of labor, experts, armies and  bureaucracies.  </P> <P> As its inheritors, we think of that revolution as a great step forward. At the  time it was a mixed blessing. Agriculture was not a better way of life, but a  necessary one, because of increasing population and decreasing game. Settled  farmers got more food from an acre of land, but the food was of lower quality  and less variety and it required a lot more work. Farmers became vulnerable, as  nomads never were, to weather, disease, pests, invasion and oppression from  their own emerging ruling class. Since they no longer moved away from their  wastes, they experienced humankind's first environmental problems.  </P> <P> The Industrial Revolution was also a brilliant adaptation to the problem of  populations growing beyond their technology and resource base. Agriculture was  a response to wildlife scarcity; industry to land and energy scarcity. Around  1750, when there were 800 million people in the world, the Industrial  Revolution began with science and coal and led quickly to steam engines and  capitalism (and later to capitalism's dissenting offshoot, communism).  </P> <P> Again, everything changed. There were roads and railroads, factories and smoke.  The cities swelled. Again, the change was a mixed blessing. Human labor became  harder and more demeaning. The environment turned unspeakably filthy. The  standard of living for most workers was far below that of a yeoman farmer. But  work in a factory was better than starving on the crowded land.  </P> <P> It's hard for us to appreciate how profoundly the Industrial Revolution changed  human thought, because we still think its thoughts. Historian Donald Worster  described the thought-revolution:  </P> <P> "The capitalists . . . promised that, through the technological domination of  the Earth, they could deliver a more fair, rational, efficient and productive  life for everyone . . . . That meant teaching everyone to treat the Earth, as  well as each other, with a frank, energetic, self-assertiveness . . . . People  must . . . think constantly in terms of making money. They must regard  everything around them -- the land, its natural resources, their own labor --  as potential commodities that might fetch a profit in the market. They must  demand the right to produce, buy and sell those commodities without outside  regulation or interference . . . . As wants multipled, as markets grew more and  more far-flung, the bond between humans and the rest of nature was reduced to  the barest instrumentalism."  </P> <P> That bare instrumentalism engendered incredible material success and, in a  world that now holds more than 5 billion people, severe environmental  degradation. It created the necessity for the next revolution, the one we  celebrate with Earth Day.  </P> <P> Few of us picking up trash and carrying Earth banners think we're participating  in a thoroughgoing revolution in human culture. But some of us suspect that's  the direction our concern will take us. We know it is impossible to go on  finding, moving and wasting oil, leveling forests, paving land, dumping poisons  and multiplying our numbers. A new way of life, a new set of thoughts must be  found.  </P> <P> Earth Day coordinator Denis Hayes clearly hopes to launch a thought-revolution:  "I would really like to create a situation where people become more  introspective about themselves and think more carefully about purpose and  meaning in life. There is a sort of mindless, heedless rush -- an enormously  acquisitive preoccupation with more and more and more. I hope people will begin  to question our purpose and come up with more satisfying answers."  </P> <P> A more satisfying answer is already here in the idea of sustainability -- a  word that has just surfaced in the discourse of the industrial world. It means  using the planet's resources in a way that permits future generations to have  some, too.  </P> <P> It's as impossible for us to describe a fully sustainable world as it would  have been for the farmers of BC 6000 to foresee present-day Iowa or the English  coal miners of 750 to imagine a Toyota assembly line. We only know that a  sustainable world would be highly efficient in its energy use. It would  respect, reuse and recycle materials. It would have a stable population. Human  needs for community, identity and self-respect would be met directly, rather  than with expensive material substitutes. The thoughts in people's heads would  be about harmony with nature, rather than conquest.  </P> <P> Like the other great revolutions, an environmental revolution will require  sacrifices and lead to enormous gains. It too will change the face of the land  and human institutions, hierarchies, self-definitions, cultures. It will take  centuries.  </P> <P> If it happens. There is no guarantee, of course. There were hunting-gathering  tribes who spurned the idea of agriculture and either died out or were engulfed  by powerful settled neighbors. There are agrarian societies that still resist  the industrial mind-set. An environmental revolution can't be piecemeal,  however, because the ecological problems it must solve are global. Humankind  has to pull off this revolution as a whole -- or sink as a whole into the  ecological and economic impoverishment of a culture that has failed to adapt to  historical necessity.  </P> <P> William D. Ruckelshaus, former administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency, recently wrote about the enormous nature of the challenge:  </P> <P> "Can we move nations and people in the direction of sustainability? Such a move  would be a modification of society comparable in scale to only two other  changes: the Agricultural Revolution of the late Neolithic and the Industrial  Revolution of the past two centuries.  </P> <P> "Those revolutions were gradual, spontaneous and largely unconscious. This one  will have to be a fully conscious operation, guided by the best foresight that  science can provide . . . . If we actually do it, the undertaking will be  absolutely unique in humanity's stay on the Earth."  </P></p>

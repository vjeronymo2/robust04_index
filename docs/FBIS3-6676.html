			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with a political essay entitled "Epic of Love and  Faith" on the lapse of one year since a former war correspondent  of the Korean People's Army, Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith  and will, was returned to the embrace of the socialist homeland  on March 19, 1993.    The political essay says it is a miracle of miracles that Yi  In-mo could return alive from South Korea where he had been  detained for 43 years, undergoing all sorts of indescribable  outrages and appeasement by fascist hangmen throughout his 34  years in prison in particular.    He has been able to take the course of his life to a  paradise  from the "hell", overcoming innumerable trying difficulties  because he has fought and won with his iron faith and will, says  the essay.    When we say about his faith and will, we cannot but think of  his mental support, the basic factor of it, the essay says, and  goes on:    It was his belief that victory was sure to come as long as  there a the great general, that the bosom of the general was a  true cradle of life for all his soldiers and that a bright  future of the revolution and the Reunification of the country  and prosperity of the nation lay in following the road indicated  by the general.    It was his unquestioned trust in the illustrious leader that  enabled him to enjoy respect and love of all the people as the  incarnation of faith and will, the highest honour ever granted  to the revolutionaries in the world.    "Our party remembers Comrade Yi In-mo, the incarnation of  faith and will" -- these words written in person by the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il before Yi In-mo returned to the  bosom of the homeland reflect his trust in a soldier who was  suffering in South Korea and contain his iron will and  determination to bring him home to a paradise under whatever  circumstances.    Our general Kim Chong-il did not forget even a moment about  the fate of a soldier but took all steps for his repatriation,  although he was busy leading the whole party, all the people and  the army to victory, shoulding the burden of all important work  decisive of the destiny of the whole nation and of world peace  and security.    On March 19, ten days after a semi-war state was proclaimed,  when a touch-and-go situation was created in which a war might  break out any moment, an old soldier, a veteran party member who  had already been sentenced to death by the enemy returned to the  northern half of the country, all alone, making a breakthrough  in the wall of division.    Indeed, in the mind of our general Kim Chong-il are all his  soldiers, the whole nation, and he is in the minds of our  people, our nation. For this close bonds of kinship the dear  leader is regarded as the mental support of all his soldiers.    Referring to the highest honour and happiness Yi In-mo has  experienced in the last one year since his return to the  northern half of the country, the political essay goes on:    Comrade Yi In-mo was awarded "Order of Kim Il-song", the  highest honour of the DPRK, and the medal of Hero of the  Republic and even his bronze statue was erected at his hometown  thanks to the broadminded benevolence of the great general Kim  Chong-il.    The bosom of the great general Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a  cradle of life without which all our soldiers cannot live even a  moment, the bosom of the mother always dear to their hearts and  a benevolent bosom which brings socialist life into full bloom.    The great general's benevolence gives the worth of life and  pleasure not only to comrade Yi In-mo but to all the people of  the country.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi clients keep their options open Two big clients of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, said yesterday they were still considering their relationship with the company, amid continuing uncertainty over the future of Mr Maurice Saatchi, the deposed chairman. The clients - Mars and British Airways - are watching the looming deadline of next Tuesday given to Mr Saatchi to decide whether he will stay with the group in the largely honorific position of president and chairman of the subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi said yesterday that no decision on Mr Saatchi's future remuneration had been taken. Commenting on reports that Mr Saatchi had been offered a Pounds 100,000 pay rise to stay with the group, the company said: 'There have been no negotiations on salary. This story does not move on until Maurice desides whether to take up the post with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide.' Mars, the privately-owned confectionery and pet foods group, said a review of its Dollars 1bn worldwide advertising expenditure would take 'weeks, if not months'. Mr Bob Eagle, the company's UK external relations manager, said: 'Clearly any decision that Maurice Saatchi takes will be taken into account.' BA said it was still 'considering' its account with Saatchi after Sir Colin Marshall, the airline's chairman, had written to the group expressing his concern about the board changes. BA indicated that it was unlikely to desert the Saatchi group, but was keeping its options open. Another client, Mirror Group Newspapers, said it would keep its account with Saatchi unless it became unhappy with the agency's work. The account would not be affected by Mr Saatchi's future. Mr David Herro of Harris Associates, the Chicago fund managers which led the campaign to oust Mr Saatchi, said yesterday he hoped the deadline of next Tuesday would be adhered to. 'There is no desire among shareholders to keep prolonging this. We want to get the whole thing behind us and be finished with it one way or the other.' Mr Herro added: 'I'll be surprised if Mr Saatchi stays on, but it's possible he might.' He described as 'incorrect' reports that he had approved a Pounds 5m share option package for Mr Saatchi after earlier opposing it. 'We (the US shareholders) objected to the options package as proposed by Mr Saatchi. We were never opposed to a share option package being put to shareholders for a vote.' Mr Herro said that US shareholders controlling 30 per cent of the shares had wanted Mr Saatchi removed because of unacceptable terms he proposed for an options package. They were also angry about his opposition to dropping the 'Saatchi' name from the holding company masthead. Mr Saatchi was on holiday abroad yesterday and unavailable for comment. A friend said he would not be returning to the UK until January 2. Mr Saatchi was forced to stand down as chairman of the advertising group he founded in 1970 two weeks ago after the board succumbed to pressure from US and UK shareholders.</p>

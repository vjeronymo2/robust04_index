			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by Estonian Prime Minister Mart </F> Laar in Tallinn on 9 May -- received via Internet E-LIST]    [Text] At a press conference which took place in Moscow  May 6, the Russian Federation's Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev,  stated that Russia will keep its forces in Estonia as long as it  deems necessary and even reserves the right to bring in more  troops if necessary.    This kind of statement by the Russian Defense Minister can  be  classified as a direct threat to Estonian independence and  sovereignty.    Within the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations,  Russia has made a commitment to withdraw its troops from  Estonia, without any connection to any other issue. The August  31, 1994 date was offered by Russia itself. Likewise, Russia  has no basis for tying the withdrawal of troops from Estonia to  the withdrawal of troops from Latvia and Lithuania.    I hope that this statement by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  represents his personal opinion and not Russia's official  position. In this connection, I have directed our Ministry of  Foreign Affairs to request an explanation from the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the hopes that Russia's Foreign  Ministry will refute Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's  irresponsible and tension producing statement.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Iridium raises further Dollars 733.5m in equity Iridium, the international consortium building a global satellite system for mobile phones, has raised a further Dollars 733.5m in equity, which completes its equity financing. This brings the amount raised to Dollars 1.57bn and opens the way for debt financing for the Dollars 3.4bn project conceived by Motorola, the US-based electronics group. Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, heads the list of new investors with a Dollars 140m investment as part of its strategy announced earlier this week to expand its telecommunications operations. Veba's commitment represents Dollars 70m in new investment and an assumption of Dollars 70m of Motorola's existing commitment. Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corporation leads a group of Korean companies investing Dollars 70m. Other new investors include Inepar, the Brazilian energy and telecoms group. More than Dollars 400m of the Dollars 733.5m comes from existing investors which include US groups Lockheed and Sprint, Bell Canada and 18 Japanese companies including Sony and Mitsubishi. Iridium is one of several groups seeking to build satellite networks for mobile phones. The intended market is international business travellers and regions without existing infrastructure for cellular communications. Last week, Inmarsat, the London-based international maritime satellite communications organisation, launched a company aiming to raise Dollars 1bn in equity from its 75 members by the end of the year. Globalstar, another consortium in the market, is being developed by Loral, the US defence group, and Qualcomm, a California high-technology supplier. Globalstar has raised nearly Dollars 300m from investors such as the French telecommunications groups Alcatel Alsthom and France Telecom. Iridium's network will comprise a constellation of 66 low-orbit satellites. Subscribers will access the network through dual mode handsets connected to earth-based mobile cellular networks. Iridium's services will include voice, data, paging and fax. The group, with more than 4,000 employees, is developing its network and negotiating rights of access with regulatory authorities worldwide. Mr Robert Kinzie, chief executive, said: 'With the commitment of the US government to license low earth-orbit satellite systems by the end of January 1995, and the associated grant of interim construction waivers, Iridium's satellite personal communications system will be available worldwide by the end of 1998.'</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk rights issue NOVO Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company specialising in insulin production and diabetic care, plans a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 223m) rights issue. At the annual general meeting on April 24, the board won agreement to increase share capital by up to a total of nominal DKr160m in one or more stages, distributed proportionally between A and B shares. The ceiling on increases in share capital in connection with acquisitions was raised from nominal DKr60m to DKr100m. The company said group sales for 1990 rose by 10 per cent to DKr8bn while pre-tax earnings grew by 8 per cent to DKr1.1bn. Insulin sales grew 19 per cent and the company reported significant market share gains in key areas such as the US and Japan. Results for the first quarter of this year, which are due in mid-May, are forecast to follow this favourable trend and based on this the company has opted for a pre-emptive rights issue. In the short term it expects investment needs to be substantial.</p>

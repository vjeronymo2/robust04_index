			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The need to show a clearer vision / Pondering the uncertainty over Arjo's future direction ANNUAL general meetings are seldom the setting for hard questioning of company directors, but Arjo Wiggins Appleton's meeting on Tuesday could prove the exception. Shareholders will want some answers from the chairman, Mr Cob Stenham, and his team about the Anglo-French paper group's future. The direction of the company was thrown into doubt on Thursday when Mr Stephen Walls, chief executive, announced he was resigning after a disagreement with other directors over the group's future development. The board rejected Mr Walls' plan to grow the company through acquisition, choosing organic growth and selective small purchases instead. Mr Walls' vision made considerable sense, according to some analysts. A Price Waterhouse study showed it had the best return on capital of any paper company in the world. With its high margins - its average selling price is Pounds 1,200 per tonne compared with an industry average of Pounds 600 - the company had weathered the recession well. The problem facing AWA is that most of its markets are mature or maturing. In particular, the carbonless paper market, currently growing at about 3 per cent a year, is likely to slow down as businesses start installing high-speed laser printers. Similarly, the facsimile paper market is likely to start shrinking as the price of plain paper fax machines continues to fall. Although the company has proved resilient, it is not as highly geared to recovery as other paper manufacturers. Mr Walls realised that earnings momentum could slow, but also recognised present opportunities. With its low gearing, AWA was in a good position to start picking up acquisitions from paper groups suffering from overcapacity in the pulp area. Analysts believe Mr Walls identified KNP, a Dutch-based manufacturer of coated paper which also has merchanting operations in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. They think the deal could have MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forest products company, holds a 30 per cent stake in KNP. AWA is European market leader in all of its product areas apart from wood-free coated paper where it is in third or fourth place. Before he announced his resignation Mr Walls said that although there was presently over-capacity in the market, it would grow rapidly with the greater penetration of colour photocopiers. Now Mr Walls' vision has been rejected, the board will need to convince shareholders that it has a coherent strategy. Earnings growth seems assured in the short-term as the European and US economies picks up. In the medium-term, however, doubts remain about the rate of dividend and earnings growth. Shareholders will also be interested to know the identity of the new chief executive as soon as possible. One analyst, who refused to be named, said the replacement needed to have a powerful track-record to have much credibility. Otherwise he will be seen to be in the pocket of the French minority shareholders. Worms et Cie, the French financial group, indirectly owns about 39 per cent of AWA. It holds a 38 per cent stake in St Louis which in turn owns 39 per cent of AWA. Analysts believe the KNP deal would have required a dilution of that stake. Those French shareholders were last night denying the boardroom split, which also ended in the resignation of Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, had been along Franco-British lines. However, analysts remain concerned whether the interests of Worms et Cie will be the same as UK shareholders. Yesterday some shareholders demonstrated their displeasure at Mr Walls' departure. A line of 20m shares, equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the company, was sold at below the market price. Mr Walls, who has refused to discuss his departure, also demonstrated his feelings: he sold 5,515 of his shares too.</p>

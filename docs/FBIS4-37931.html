			<p>BFN     [Text] We open with the findings of the Shamgar commission  of inquiry into the massacre of Muslim worshipers in the Hebron  Cave of the Patriarchs. The report was just published 30  minutes ago and its main finding is that Barukh Goldstein acted  alone. New arrangements are to be introduced for prayers in the  cave and there will be a complete ban, which applies to soldiers  as well, on carrying weapons. At the Supreme Court, where the  Shamgar report was released for publication at 1230 [0930 GMT],  is Mark Weiss:    I am speaking here from the Supreme Court. The report was  delivered to journalists just half an hour ago: a 350-page  document, very detailed. We received the conclusions -- some  30, 40 pages in English -- and as you said, the main conclusion  is that Dr. Barukh Goldstein's actions were premeditated and  that he acted alone. Let me quote this important section from  the document: We were not presented with credible proof that he  was helped while carrying out the killing or prior to that time  by another individual acting as an accomplice nor was it proven  to us that he had secret partners. According to the evidence  before us, his wife was also not aware of the matter.    The report also found no evidence that Goldstein threw a  hand  grenade, as claimed by some of the Muslim worshipers, or that  soldiers fired into the Isaac hall. There is no reliable proof  of how Goldstein entered the Isaac hall although entry via the  main entrance or via the Yosifya door are the most likely.    Concerning the deployment of security forces in and around  the cave on the morning of the massacre, the commission  concludes this, and again I am quoting directly from the report  in front of me: The absence of the full complement of forces at  the time of the massacre was an unfortunate coincidence whose  roots lie both in shortcomings in coordination between the  forces and in the level of discipline in some of the units.    The Shamgar commission also found that if the forces that  were supposed to be on duty were present then they could have  impeded Goldstein's efforts to enter the Isaac hall. A lack of  coordination is noted between the police and IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] units.    Regarding opening fire regulations, there is no  justification  for different guidelines for opening fire in cases of  disturbances and criminal offenses. The report here is talking  about the different guidelines that existed at the time for the  police and Army.    The last conclusion is that the report found serious  shortcomings in the area of law enforcement in the territories  and in the absence of effective law enforcement, the report  says, there could be no effective government. Now those are the  main conclusions.    Briefly to the main recommendations following those  conclusions. The main recommendation concerns prayer  arrangements at the mosque. Again I am quoting directly: We  recommend first and foremost that arrangements intended to  create complete separation between the Muslim and Jewish  worshipers be adopted in order to ensure the safety of all  worshipers, and to prevent friction, dispute, and acts of  violence.    Other recommendations from the findings are that security  outside the tomb should be provided by a regular army unit while  the findings recommend the creation of a special tomb guard unit  that will be responsible for security at the entrance gate and  inside the tomb. Members of the two units should serve for at  least a year. The report also recommends an absolute ban on  individuals carrying weapons entering the tomb. It calls for  larger police funds to ensure law and order for the Jewish  residents in the territories and finally recommends that open  fire instructions be formulated in a clear manner, with  reference to disturbances and violent offenses.</p>

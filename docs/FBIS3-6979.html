			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Siti Rahil] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 23 KYODO -- A high-powered  nongovernmental Asia-Pacific economic group has voiced concern  about some countries linking trade and investment to human  rights and democracy in a statement to be issued at the end of a  three-day conference here on Thursday [24 March].    A copy of the finalized draft statement of the Pacific  Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) obtained by KYODO NEWS  SERVICE on Wednesday said no region should be stopped from  forming its own economic group as long as it is not  protectionist.    "PECC expresses concern about the tendencies of some member  economies to condition trade and investment on achievement of  political or ideological objectives," said the statement, to be  officially released at the end of PECC's 10th assembly.  Delegates said this is an implicit reference to the tendency of  some Western powers, such as the United States, to pressure  Asian nations into adopting Western standards of human rights  and democracy by threatening trade sanctions.    Called the "Kuala Lumpur Concord on Open Regionalism," the  statement, which will be signed by representatives of each of  the 21 member economies of the PECC, also stressed "the rights  of all regions to organize in nondiscriminatory groupings,  whether this be in the northern, southern, eastern or western  Pacific." Delegates said this phrase apparently alludes to  Western opposition toward the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC),  which is being planned by the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN).    The PECC statement was pushed by Malaysia, which wants to  use  the opportunity as host country of the current meeting to rap  the United States for trying to institutionalize Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) when it hosted the first APEC  informal leaders' meeting in Seattle last November. The meeting  was boycotted by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, who  strongly opposes the institutionalization of APEC.    "The danger to a Pacific community, to the Pacific age, to  our common future, can come from many directions," the statement  warned.    While "the end of the Cold War has clearly contributed to  the  making of a wider Pacific community...excessive domestic  preoccupation can put a brake on the Pacific movement," it said.  "A diversion of commitment to narrow regional interests and  pursuits can be a serious detour from a path to which some might  never return."    It pledged to establish measures to study and monitor the  development of protectionism and liberalization in the Pacific  and elsewhere and "ensure that any subregional grouping  contributes to open regionalism and to lowering the barriers to  nonmember economies."    PECC, whose members include ASEAN, the United States, Japan  and some Latin American countries, is a nongovernmental  organization that allows eminent thinkers, business leaders and  government officials to meet every 18 months for spontaneous  discussions on ways to promote economic cooperation in the  region.    Started in 1980, the PECC paved the way for the formation of  the governmental APEC forum in 1989 and advises governments in  the region on matters of economic cooperation.</p>

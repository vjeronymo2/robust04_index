			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries Reports that substandard Lucas gearboxes have forced US Navy jets to make scores of emergency landings look wide of the mark. Even so, the company's embarrassment from the alleged use of non-conforming materials by its Lucas Western subsidiary in Pentagon contracts is acute. The allegations follow Lucas' admission earlier this week that AUL, another US subsidiary, falsified test results on other kit supplied to the US military. The direct financial damage from the affair - a fine expected to be Dollars 25m or so - is not huge. Moreover, it looks unlikely that Lucas Western will be debarred from supplying the Navy. It is the Navy's sole supplier of gearboxes and would be expensive to replace. In fact, the company started providing the same equipment again only yesterday, following a suspension which has lasted since July. Nevertheless, with a dented reputation, Lucas could well find it harder to win future contracts from the US defence forces. The affair appears to reflect sloppy management at the US subsidiary and inadequate control from the centre. Fortunately, the new management  - led by Mr George Simpson, the highly regarded chief executive - is not tainted by the failure to exert quality control. It has also acted swiftly to replace management at Lucas Western and put in place a compliance regime designed to satisfy the US that similar problems will not recur. The betting must be that Lucas' current embarrassment will be only temporary.</p>

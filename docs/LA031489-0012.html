			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Chicago Acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer declared that he would not endorse a  candidate in next month's mayoral election, despite pleas from the Rev. Jesse  Jackson and others to support the only black candidate in the race. Sawyer, the  city's second black mayor, spurned calls from Jackson and several local  committeemen to help community by backing Alderman Timothy Evans. Evans, who  did not support Sawyer in last month's Democratic primary, is running as a  third party candidate in the April 4 election against Democrat Richard M. Daley  and Republican Edward R. Vrdolyak.  </P></p>

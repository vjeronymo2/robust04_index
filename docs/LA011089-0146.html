			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUSTRIA'S NIERLICH NIPS ZURBRIGGEN IN SLALOM  </P> <P> Hometown favorite Rudi Nierlich of Austria won the men's second giant slalom of  the ski season today, finishing ahead of veteran Swiss ace Pirmin Zurbriggen  and Italian star Alberto Tomba.  </P> <P> Nierlich was fastest in the first heat and second-fastest in the second run for  a winning total of 2 minutes, 44.72 seconds.  </P> <P> Zurbriggen was second in 2:45.10 and Tomba third in 2:45.26.  </P> <P> Tomaz Cizman of Yugoslavia was fourth in 2:45.55 and Austrian-born Marc  Girardelli of Luxembourg finished fifth in 2:45.74.  </P> <P> "I was not nervous at all today," the 22-year-old Nierlich said, hinting that  he has matured since last season, when his nerves would sometimes fail him.  </P> <P> "I knew that Zurbriggen was leading" midway through the second heat, he said,  "but then I did not do a lot of pondering and just went down full speed.  </P> <P> "This was the kind of track where you had to try and ski not too aggressively  but ease through the gates."  </P> <P> The Austrian team was bent on getting one man among the leaders. Four  Austrians, including Hans Enn, abandoned the race. Enn suffered a knee injury.  </P> <P> Tomba, an Olympic double gold medalist in Calgary, Canada, last year, could  have done much better had he not made a mistake in the first heat that cost him  time.  </P> <P> A good track and the fine weather helped young, lesser known skiers starting  with high starting numbers to make it into the top 30 group for the second  heat.  </P> <P> Ole-Christian Furuseth of Norway, with starting number 51, finished sixth, and  West German Michael Eder was 10th with starting number 55.  </P> <P> The top American was Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt., who finished 16th in 2:48.43.  </P></p>

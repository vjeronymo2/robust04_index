			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Ticket sales rise The West End theatre had a record year in 1993, writes Antony Thorncroft. Ticket sales topped 11.5m, 6 per cent higher than in 1992, and beating by 2 per cent the previous record year of 1990. Some of this total can be attributed to the re-opening of three theatres, the Savoy, the Criterion and the Donmar. But even so, the West End seems in remarkably good health. In particular, the serious play - long considered endangered in an age when theatre-goers were besotted by costly, escapist, musicals - has made an impressive come back. An Inspector Calls, Oleanna, Medea and Six Degrees of Separation performed well at the box office as did classic revivals such as The Importance of Being Earnest and She Stoops to Conquer.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Trade associations are not mainly political lobbyists Sir, Andrew Taylor's article 'Lobbying not worth a button' (July 15) must not be allowed to pass without comment. I am sorry my response is so delayed but I have just returned from leading a trade mission to Tehran; very successful, despite many problems on the way. I must challenge the statement: 'The principal role of trade association is to lobby government . . .'. This displays a degree of ignorance of the real world that in itself casts doubts on whether the Department of Trade and Industry lives on planet earth or elsewhere. The Engineering Industries Association, a fairly substantial organisation with affiliates of some 2,000 small and medium-sized mechanical/electrical engineering companies, does not see its main role as lobbying. Indeed, this is a fair way down its list of priorities. The EIA is a 'one-stop shop'. We help our members with legislative, commercial, financial or any other problems. We run exhibitions; we sponsor overseas trade missions. We obtain trade opportunities at home and overseas; we offer excellent courses/seminars at low cost and we help with contractual problems. When the government gets it wrong, as regrettably it all too frequently does, then my members tell the secretary of state and will continue to do so. This dreadful old lobbying chestnut, as Lord Devlin's report demonstrates, really ought to be buried. We live in a parliamentary democracy. This means all voices must be heard. The EIA's certainly will be. Convenience of ministers does not register very far up the priority list. The secretary of state should listen to all voices and decide on the course of action he wishes to pursue. He has more than sufficient staff to help him.

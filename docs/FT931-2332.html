			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British-Borneo Petroleum surges by 73% to Pounds 7.8m BRITISH-BORNEO Petroleum Syndicate yesterday joined the chorus of concern from oil and gas explorers about the tax changes for the sector announced in Tuesday's Budget. Reporting a 73 per cent surge in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.81m in the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 4.52m, the company said it would have to carry out a strategic rethink of its plans to expand significantly its activities in the North Sea. The proposals would stop companies offsetting exploration and appraisal costs against income from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax, leaving them paying a net 64p for every Pounds 1 spent instead of 17p under present rules. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo would almost certainly slow down exploration in the North Sea. He called for clarification of the government's intention to allow a two-year extension of PRT relief on existing contracts. It was not clear whether four wells British-Borneo had obligations to drill but on which work had not yet begun would qualify, he said. Revenues from oil and gas were up almost four times at Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 3.7m), outstripping for the first time revenue from the investment portfolio. Mr Gaynor said there was strong growth potential in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly in gas. He announced British-Borneo's first move into direct operating, through an operating consortium in the Gulf of Mexico with American Cometra, a subsidiary of Electrofina, and Ranger Oil of Canada. Earnings per share were down at 16.93p (19.95p), while the proposed final dividend is 4.433p, making an unchanged total for the year of 7.1p.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: What the economists have to say now GERRY HOLTHAM, Shearson Lehman A cut in interest rates won't necessarily lead to higher growth if the US experience is anything to go by.  High household debt and a weak housing market will still act as a constraint.  The only way the government can do anything about the situation is either to allow inflation to rise - not really a viable option - or to take over some of the private debt and not to worry about the PSBR.  Ultimately the government has to wait until Sunday to see what happens and then try to construct a sane European macro-economic policy. ***** PAUL CHERTKOW, UBS Phillips and Drew The main aim for Britain is to stimulate recovery under an independent Bank of England. The government should cut interest rates immediately to 9 per cent and then by further steps to 7 per cent by the end of the year. That would mean sterling floating to around DM2.50 - a level which would see investor support for the currency because recovery prospects would look an awful lot better. As for the exchange rate mechanism the whole system seems to be in danger of collapse. There is no certainty about the system any more. ***** ROGER BOOTLE, Greenwell Montagu abandon any idea of returning to the exchange rate mechanism. It should adopt a policy of setting interest rates with regard to domestic economic conditions and let the exchange rate do what it wants. An appropriate level for interest rates would be 6 per cent. At this level I don't think the pound would be dramatically lower and the inflationary consequences of this strategy would be comparatively minor. I cannot think of circumstances better suited to successful devaluation than the ones at the moment. ***** PETER SPENCER, Kleinworts I would not touch the exchange rate mechanism with a bargepole unless the French vote very positively for economic and monetary union. I would go for a system of free floating exchange rates with monetary targets based on a weighted average of monetary aggregates. Whatever we do, it will be very difficult to duck Germany's high interest rates, so I doubt interest rates will come down quickly. I think strong inflationary impulses have been un-leashed by this devaluation. If we cut rates the pound would go into free fall. ***** DAVID CURRIE, London Business School The government was right to pursue the policy of European convergence within the exchange rate mechanism to attain low inflation and a central role in Europe. The failure of this policy following tactical errors leaves its European strategy in disarray. The government will be tempted to resume that policy but that may well be a mistake. The severe dent to credibility means that a return to ERM membership even at current levels of the pound will mean continued high UK interest rates, holding back economic recovery.</p>

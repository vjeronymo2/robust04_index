			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Port police lose fight on sell-off THE Port of London Police Federation failed yesterday to win a judicial review of the government's decision to privatise the port's force as part of the sell-off of Tilbury Docks. The High Court ruled that although the 1991 Ports Act contained no specific provisions for transfer of the police to a private company, it allowed Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, to approve privatisation of the force as part of the port authority's scheme for the docks' sale. Mr Justice Pill said: 'I am unable to hold that it is arguable that the nature of police functions is such that specific provision was required, on constitutional or any other grounds, for the transfer of the police force.' Counsel for the federation had argued that the force should remain under the control of the port authority and that its constables should keep existing rights, privileges and powers. The federation, which has 47 members in the port's force, fears that independence and constitutional functions will be compromised under a private company. It will consider an appeal.</p>

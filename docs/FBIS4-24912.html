			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Visiting U.S. President  Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major held talks  today at chequers, the prime minister's country residence in the  northwest of London.    A British official told reporters that North Korea nuclear  issue "featured large on the agenda" of the talks.    "There is a clear requirement on the international  community...to address that question very seriously," the  spokesman alleged.    He said that the two leaders also discussed Bosnian peace  efforts, the civil war in Rwanda and the July summit of seven  western industrialized nations in Naples, Italy.    Clinton arrived in Britain this morning to attend  commemorative ceremonies of the 50th anniversary of D-Day  landings in Normady during the World War Two.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Indian investors form a queue for new issues - Renewed interest in equities Indian companies are planning an unprecedented wave of corporate fund-raising, which will test the capacity of the country's capital markets to the limit over the next few months. First in a queue of big issues is Reliance, the textiles and chemicals combine, which yesterday launched a Rs8.6bn (Dollars 277m) slice of a Rs21.7bn convertible debenture issue by a new company - Reliance Petroleum, which is building a Rs51.4bn oil refinery. It is the biggest public offering made in India, raising funds for the largest-ever industrial investment. Reliance will be followed by about 15 other companies, each planning to raise Rs1bn or more in equity and bonds before the end of the year. Brokers estimate that, altogether, some 800 companies are planning issues totalling Rs110bn by the end of December. This compares with an estimated total of Rs92.5bn expected to be raised in the six months to the end of September, the first half of the 1993-94 financial year, and Rs185bn raised in the whole of 1992-93. The rush to raise money reflects a belief that the financial scandal which hit the securities markets last year has almost run its course. The market's strong surge this summer tends to support this argument, though the scandal is still able to deliver unexpected shocks. Only this month shares on the Bombay stock exchange suffered a nasty tumble when it emerged that income tax inspectors had frozen dealings in blocks of shares linked to Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of the scandal. Hasty intervention by the Finance Ministry, which gave an assurance that innocent investors would not suffer, restored confidence in the market. The BSE index, which was closed yesterday, ended at 2,751 earlier in the week. However, according to data supplied by the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, India remains among the worst performing emerging markets in dollar terms over the year to date. With bank lending rates high - standing at an official minimum of 15 per cent - companies are prepared to risk the perils of the capital markets. Corporate bonds yield about 14.5 per cent, whereas the yield on equities is under 1.5 per cent. Few individual Indian investors look at the yield of a new issue. They are after the quick speculative profits to be made from 'stagging' - buying the stock in a public offer and then selling as soon as possible on the open market. Although share manipulation is forbidden, it is easily done since 75 to 85 per cent of all trades consist of deals in an informal forward market called badla. So investors who expect brokers to help launch a new issue by pushing up the share price are rarely disappointed. They just have to remember to sell in time. The success of an issue depends critically on the broker's marketing skills. The streets of Bombay and other cities are hung with banners promoting offers, although they have become more conservative since the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, banned the portrayal of scantily clad models. Brokers do not expect investors to disappoint Reliance. The group's last large offering, a combined issue of Rs7bn by Reliance Polypropylene and Reliance Polyethylene, attracted applications from 10m individuals. For Reliance Petroleum, the group has devised a complex mix of sweeteners, which reflect the increased technical sophistication of Bombay's financiers. Investors will be permitted to pay for their paper in four instalments over three years. Their securities will consist of convertible debentures with detachable equity warrants. Investors will have no less than three ways of converting their bonds into combinations of warrants, equities and cash. The offer document runs to 101 pages. As well as the Rs8.6bn public offering, Reliance is offering paper worth Rs8.6bn to Indian institutions and mutual funds, Rs2.2bn to foreign institutions, and Rs2.2bn for shareholders of Reliance Industries, the group's flagship company. Reliance Industries itself is putting up Rs5.77bn.</p>

A total of 31 percent of 2,522 persons polled by the Forsa  Institute supported Scharping, and 28 percent Kohl. Thus,  Scharping has won another percent after the verbal duel at the  Bundestag during the budget debate. Kohl lost 1 percent.    Asked about the different parties, 42 percent endorsed the  SPD -- 2 percent more than last week. The Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union lost 2 percent and was only  supported by 34 percent. Alliance 90/Greens achieved 8 percent  in the weekly Forsa poll carried out on behalf of RTL, and the  Free Democratic Party of Germany 7 percent.    Chances are also increasing for the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS] to reenter parliament after the next elections.  In the most recent Allensbach poll, the successor party of the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany achieved over 5 percent (5.3)  for the first time. In eastern Germany, its share of votes  doubled from 1992 to 1993 to 21.9 percent. In the Brandenburg  local elections, which took place at the beginning of December,  the PDS emerged as the second strongest party (21.2 percent).    The PDS also notes growing support in the West. Election  manager Andre Brie estimates PDS potential at approximately 2  percent. "Our election opportunities have, so far, been  massively underestimated." This should change. The fight for  votes and mandates is being strategically planned. A total of  17 million German marks will be made available for the campaign  for the Bundestag and European elections. Brie mentioned these  figures in Berlin yesterday.    To explore the mood among the people, the PDS engaged  several  polling institutes. The tenor of the results is: Over 50  percent of the east Germans and approximately 15 percent of the  west Germans are likely to endorse the "leftist-opposition"  spectrum and, thus, the PDS. Brie hopes for considerable  support among those younger than 25. According to Emnid, 55  percent of this age group support the PDS campaign against the  asylum law and the great bugging campaign.    Brie considers the fight for the nonvoters decisive for a  PDS  success. A total of 43 percent of the citizens in the new  laender (35 percent in the west) want to boycott the upcoming  elections.</p>

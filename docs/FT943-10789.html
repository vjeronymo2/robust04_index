			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Arts: The Card - Entrepreneurs with a difference / Review of a musical based on an Arnold Bennett hero and a play about deep-freezing bodies for profit The hero of Arnold Bennett's The Card epitomises the entrepreneurial spirit with a human face. Denry Machin's charm, chutzpah and cheerfulness enable him to soar from washerwoman's son to mayor in a series of audacious bounds that include the highly dubious 'Universal Thrift Club': a way of inveigling the poor into buying goods on lashings of credit. Acclaim for this philanthropic initiative bespeaks a touching innocence long dead. At the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, a musical version of Bennett's novel takes the stage. Book by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, songs by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, the show originally reached the West End in 1973, before entrepreneurial virtues were in fashion. It returns, revised, with additional lyrics by Anthony Drewe, just as entrepreneurial values are being discredited. It lacks its protagonist's sense of timing. Whether it shares his resilience remains to be seen. Tim Goodchild's set gives us rows of terraced-cottage front doors dominated by the Victorian pomp of the town hall clock tower, a fit background for young Denry's ambition never to work 'in clay' ('pottery's for mugs . . . crockery's not my cup of tea'). The stage is banked by a collage of plates, dishes and tea-pots, a reminder of what the prosperity of Bennett's Five Towns was literally built on. Doors swivel to reveal the office where junior clerk Denry purloins a socially advantageous invitation to the municipal ball, the terpsichorean academy where he meets the gold-digging dancing teacher, and the stately home of the Countess of Chell. The attitude to this aristo is intriguingly feudal for an industrial society: the local do-gooder, she is respected, revered and credited with the sort of glamour we used to attribute to royalty. The musical makes it plain what a good egg she is with a sad little song of frustration which Hayley Mills delivers rather touchingly in well-bred, slightly flat sprechgesang. Interestingly, the best songs are those of aspiration or yearning. Ruth, the calculating dancing-mistress, is given the first of several songs ('Another time, another place') where characters long for something better. This is in keeping with the optimism permeating a story of get-up-and-go, but the general impression is formulaic. One can see the ingredients being ticked off: romantic ballad, self-doubting but heroically determined soliloquy, rollicking company number. The song explaining the function of the Thrift Club seems a distant descendant of 'Pass it along' from Bernstein's Candide, but opts for bland jollity without any bite. The same might be said of the whole show. For all the enthusiasm of Ian Talbot's production, a terrible sameness sets in after 20 minutes or so. The peaks are not high enough, as witness the big laudatory number halfway through the second act, 'The Card' - one of those ensembles of glorification like 'Hello Dolly' or 'Mame' which should sweep us unresistingly into believing in a star. Here the sentiments seem on auto-pilot. The present cast carry it off, however, because Denry is played by Peter Duncan who beamingly capers, cavorts and connives his ingratiating way through the piece, even prompting applause for backing a car through a narrow opening while singing. He carries the evening since John Turner's bluff councillor has only a stereotype to work with, Jessica Martin is unable to blend gold-digging with romantic longings and ends up as not very convincing at either, and Jenna Russell, as the down-to-earth local girl who finally wins Denry, is conceived in terms of cliche. Even the dour figure of Denry's mother, marching across the stage from time to time with a deflationary comment on her son, t her teeth into.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Midlands colliery to shed 580 jobs THE WORKFORCE at the Daw Mill colliery in Warwickshire is to be halved with the loss of 580 jobs, British Coal said yesterday. Daw Mill, the last pit in the Warwickshire coalfield, produced more than 2m tonnes last year, with 1,170 miners working on three faces. British Coal said the pit would be reduced to a single face to ensure that it remained competitive.</p>

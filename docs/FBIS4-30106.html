			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- Former war  correspondent of the Korean People's Army Yi In-mo, the  incarnation of faith and will, visited the exhibition of the  three revolutions in Pyongyang.    Being briefed on the brilliant achievements made by the  Korean people in carrying on the three revolutions, ideological,  technical and cultural, under the wise leadership of the party  and the leader, he saw with deep emotion exhibits at the general  hall, the heavy industry hall, the light industry hall and other  halls.    After his visit, he said that the Korean people have brought  a great change in socialist economic construction under the  party's unique banner of the three revolutions. The exhibition  well shows the economic development of the country which is  demonstrating its might to the whole world, he noted.    "Our country", he stressed, "could build a solid independent  national economy with a powerful chuche-based industry and  developed agriculture because it was under the tested guidance  of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il".    At the end of his visit to the West Sea Barrage, he wrote in  the visitor's book:    "This barrage fully shows the matchless grit of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and the looks of the Korean people  united around him in one mind.

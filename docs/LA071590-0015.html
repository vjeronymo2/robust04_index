			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BREATHLESS SEARCH FOR THE MOST EVIL VILLAIN IN 'DICK TRACY'  </P> <P> The most evil, cunning, two-timing, ruthless murderer that Tracy came up  against was Breathless Mahoney, chillingly portrayed by Madonna. I shudder to  imagine an impressionable child meeting up with someone who resembles that  villain. I hope America's youth can contain their horror and treat that  disfigured person with respect.  </P> <P> STUART BAILEY  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

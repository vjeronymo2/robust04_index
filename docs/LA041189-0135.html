			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: KRIGE CAREER TAKES A CONSPICUOUS TURN  </P> <P> Some first film appearances are more memorable than others. In 1981, a  then-unknown actress named Alice Krige played a beguiling young musical comedy  star who won the heart of Ben Cross in "Chariots of Fire." She was central to  the youthful verve and optimism of that remarkable movie, a career-launching  portrayal.  </P> <P> In what may be her most conspicuous and testing role since "Chariots of Fire,"  Krige plays a widow with two young children who marries Jeff Bridges in "See  You in the Morning," Alan Pakula's study of family ties -- tangled, untangled,  retied -- which opens here April 21.  </P> <P> Krige is a 34-year-old South African who attended Rhodes University, intending  to become a psychologist. One term she took an elective course in acting and  soon decided to rethink the whole matter of career.  </P> <P> Her supportive family sent her off to the Central School of Drama in London,  whose alumni include Vanessa Redgrave and Ian Holm, her co-star in "Chariots of  Fire" and the spy going back into the cold in the present PBS series "Game,  Set, Match."  </P> <P> After graduating in 1979, she played Lucie Manett in a BBC production of "A  Tale of Two Cities." One of her colleagues from Central had gone on to help  with the casting on "Chariots" and recommended Krige to producer David Puttnam  and director Hugh Hudson. The value of an education was never clearer.  </P> <P> Her success in the film led to her first miniseries, "Ellis Island," in which  she played an Irish lass, co-starring with Faye Dunaway and Richard Burton  (with whom, to her regret, she had no scenes).  </P> <P> She made her first American film, "Ghost Story," which was also released in  1981 and in which she appeared with Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman, Fred  Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Patricia Neal.  </P> <P> The company (enchanting, she says) spent a month at the Gideon Putnam hotel in  Saratoga, N.Y., in zero-degree weather but waiting much of the time for some  necessary but nonexistent snow.  </P> <P> Reversing the usual pattern, Krige temporarily abandoned the promising movie-TV  career to join the Royal Shakespeare Company where she won a best newcomer  award from the London critics for her role in the RSC revival of Shaw's "Arms  and the Man."  </P> <P> "I learned more at the RSC, trying to reach audiences of 1,500, than I ever had  before," Krige said. "I realized how little I knew or understood about acting  -- realized I was only at the beginning of a process of learning that never  stops."  </P> <P> She hadn't intended to become an actress, although she had trained as a ballet  dancer before she went to the university. Even when the idea of acting became  more absorbing, she says, "I didn't think I could do it. I still haven't made  up my mind about that."  </P> <P> But she has continued to find important roles. In "Barfly" she was an up-market  literary editor who falls under the spell of Mickey Rourke as the down-market  poet. She was Bathsheba to Richard Gere's King David in the film of the same  name, and Vanessa Redgrave's fiancee before the sex-change operation in "Second  Serve" on television. She did "Wallenberg" opposite Richard Chamberlain for  television and recently played Mary Shelley in the film, "Haunted Summer."  </P> <P> "See You in the Morning" was a unique experience because of the extended  rehearsal time that Pakula, who wrote and directed, spent with his cast.  </P> <P> "We lived and rehearsed in the house (where much of the shooting was later  done) for 3 1/2 weeks. I cooked in the kitchen. We slept on the set. We made it  ours."  </P> <P> Pakula and the cast, which also included Farrah Fawcett, David Dukes and  Frances Sternhagen among its principals, analyzed scenes, characters and  relationships at vast length.  </P> <P> "Alan said that when he worked with other people's scripts he felt a great  responsibility to the words. But he said that this time we didn't have to worry  about the writer, we could toss the script out the window."  </P> <P> The danger in such preparation is over-preparation and a loss of spontaneity.  "But," Krige says, "when you have that ease with your character you can take it  a step further." Occasionally Pakula and Bridges would have a whispered  conference and come up with an unexpected line, likely to draw an unexpected  reaction.  </P> <P> "So we had, I think, a wonderful combination of rehearsal and spontaneity," she  says. It is not always so. Doing television work, "Your head is on the block  all the time, and those retakes you'd like to do you can't do."  </P> <P> One of the frustrations of the actor's life, she has found, is that you can't  really be sure how well you've done. "I've come off stage thinking, 'Well, you  really blew it tonight,' and been told it was magical.  </P> <P> "We should be walking the knife edge all the time, trying to take the audience  totally by surprise."  </P> <P> She continues to think of herself as a working actress rather than as a star,  although the roles increase. She would not like stardom to come between her and  the audience, by coming between her and the free choice of work. The positive  side is that more scripts come along. "But there's not such a lot of wonderful  material out there, if you want to be challenged, and acting should never stop  being a challenge."  </P> <P> Pakula's film is a love poem to love, marriage and family. Just after  production was completed, Krige herself married actor-director Paul Schoolman.  It was, in a sense, her early review of the picture.  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Monarch of the Glen protected by English Laird - Fullarton's 14-year expansion in Scotland's computer industry NOT MANY UK manufacturing companies expect their turnover this year to be at least 50 per cent more than it was in 1990. Yet that is the forecast at Fullarton Fabrication, a Scottish company which supplies components and sub-assemblies to the computer industry. Fullarton is in the throes of the biggest investment programme in its 14-year history, spending Pounds 4.5m on increasing capacity at its eight plants at Irvine, Ayrshire. It expects this year's sales to exceed Pounds 50m - against Pounds 32m in 1990 - and envisages its workforce increasing by 140 to 1,400 over the 12 months. Fullarton is one of the few UK companies to exploit the concentration of large electronics manufacturing companies in Silicon Glen, the popular name for the Scottish electronics industry, and thus to compete with components suppliers from the Far East from which the multinationals draw many of their supplies. It is also unusual because it is to a large extent the creation of one man, Mr Allan McLuckie, its managing director. However, it operates with considerable autonomy as a subsidiary of the Laird Group, the London-based car parts, plastics and building products group. Fullarton was set up in 1978 by Mr McLuckie and five others when the night storage radiator manufacturer, where they had worked their way up from the shop floor, got into difficulties. They initially directed their metal-working skills to making farm gates and electricity meter boxes, but the objective was to become a sub-contractor to the computer industry. In 1979 Mr McLuckie, a tenacious Scot who wastes neither time nor words, achieved the remarkable feat of coaxing International Business Machines' plant at Havant, Hampshire, into buying metal casings for its computers from Fullarton when it had fewer than 30 employees. By 1984 turnover had reached Pounds 4.2m and Fullarton employed 180 people producing components for the computer industry in high volume. But Mr McLuckie and his colleagues reluctantly decided that further growth would require constant heavy investment and, as he puts it: 'Success was bringing its own problems; six guys were spending a lot of time running round the boardroom table.' In early 1985 Fullarton accepted an approach from Laird and sold out. Laird insisted on orderly financial planning to avoid the occasional overtrading of the past. Mr McLuckie now reports to Mr Ian Arnott, Laird's managing director, but says: 'We still look at this company as if we own it. Laird has given us the freedom to run our business.' Since then Fullarton has invested Pounds 8.7m (not including the current Pounds 4m programme) in expansion, with contributions from Laird supplemented by grants from the Scottish Office. It has expanded into electrical assembly, cable assembly and plastic injection moulding, and now operates seven plants. Fullarton's success - it is now the largest employer in Irvine - is based on the acceptance that it exists to service the multinationals. 'We're just the meat in the sandwich. We don't control our own destiny,' says Mr McLuckie. Supply contracts are often arranged at short notice and can be cancelled equally quickly, and delivery is normally on a just-in-time basis. Fullarton assembles keyboards for personal computers for IBM's plant at nearby Greenock and installs electrical components and cabling in sheet metal computer casings. Its other local customers, all within about 70 miles, include Oki, the Japanese printer maker, at Cumbernauld and Compaq at Erskine, as well as Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi, Unisys and Timex. It now supplies Intel, the US company, with PC cases in Oregon, as well as Ireland. Like many other company managing directors, Mr McLuckie says: 'Our best asset is our people.' What may make Fullarton different is that in addition to building a training and education centre, it brings all its employees up to date on the state of the company about every six weeks. Staff are bussed to the training centre in groups of about 80 and Mr McLuckie spends about an hour and a half briefing each group. It takes about 18 sessions and means interrupting production over a week and a half. Mr McLuckie says it pays off in terms of commitment and productivity. From Laird's point of view Fullarton is a profitable investment (though pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 2m in 1989 to Pounds 1.6m in 1990 on sales ahead from Pounds 30m to Pounds 32m) and is likely to grow further. Laird executives visit Irvine only about three times a year and there are no Laird appointees on the staff. 'It's a stand-alone business,' says Mr John Gardiner, Laird chairman, 'which brings no direct benefits to other parts of the group apart from profits.' But he says that Fullarton draws on the knowledge of Laird's engineering subsidiaries in France and Germany, which are run by local nationals. Fullarton's current expansion is aimed at increasing its capacity with an eighth factory (buying a redundant plant from a neighbouring company) and installing more metal-processing and plastic-moulding equipment. Mr McLuckie says that suppliers like Fullarton are becoming 'an extension of the multinationals' facilities', as the large companies increasingly obtain their components and sub-assemblies from a single company rather than from a handful. 'The multinationals' forte is R&amp;D and marketing; ours is providing a service,' he says. He calls Fullarton an 'industrial supermarket' where the customer can buy a wide range of goods and where the 'shelves' (ie the factories) can be rearranged and stocked to provide whatever the client wants. Neither Mr McLuckie nor Mr Gardiner is deterred by the shake-out taking place in the world electronics industry, with IBM's difficulties particularly well-publicised. 'In general electronics is tough at the moment,' admits Mr McLuckie. 'But currently our business with IBM is busy and we're expanding. 'I don't expect to get through 1992 without some tough times. But the beauty of our story is that, even with peaks and troughs, we've finished each year with more people than we started with.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Appendix A_Regulatory Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all hospitals to be small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any proposed rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. With the exception of hospitals located in certain New England counties, for purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area or New England County Metropolitan Area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 601(g) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;21) designated hospitals in certain New England counties as belonging to the adjacent New England County Metropolitan Area. Thus, for purposes of the prospective payment system, we classified these hospitals as urban hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is clear that the changes being proposed in this document would affect both a substantial number of small rural hospitals as well as other classes of hospitals, and the effects on some may be significant. Therefore, the discussion below, in combination with the rest of this proposed rule, constitutes a combined regulatory impact analysis and regulatory flexibility analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> II. Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The primary objective of the prospective payment system is to create incentives for hospitals to operate efficiently and minimize unnecessary costs and at the same time ensure that payments are sufficient to adequately compensate hospitals for their legitimate costs. In addition, we share national goals of deficit reduction and restraints on government spending in general.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe the proposed changes would further each of these goals while maintaining the financial viability of the hospital industry and ensuring access to high quality care for beneficiaries. We expect that these proposed changes would ensure that the outcomes of this payment system are, in general, reasonable and equitable while avoiding or minimizing unintended adverse consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> III. Limitations of Our Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As has been the case in previously published regulatory impact analyses, the following quantitative analysis presents the projected effects of our proposed policy changes, as well as statutory changes effective for FY 1995, on various hospital groups. We estimate the effects of each policy change by estimating payments while holding all other payment variables constant. We use the best data available, but we do not attempt to predict behavioral responses to our policy changes, and we do not make adjustments for future changes in such variables as admissions, lengths of stay, or case mix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we have done in previous proposed rules, we are soliciting comments and information about the anticipated effects of these changes on the prospective payment system, and our methodology for estimating them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> IV. Hospitals Included In and Excluded From the Prospective Payment System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The prospective payment systems for hospital inpatient operating and capital-related costs encompass nearly all general, short-term, acute care hospitals that participate in the Medicare program. We have included in our analysis only hospitals paid under these systems. There were 47 Indian Health Service Hospitals in our database, which we excluded from the analysis due to the special characteristics of the payment method for these hospitals. Only 55 short-term, acute care hospitals remain excluded from the prospective payment system under section 1814(b)(3) of the Act (in Maryland) or a demonstration project (in the Finger Lakes region of New York State). Thus, as of April 1994, just over 5,200 hospitals were receiving prospectively based payments for furnishing inpatient services. This represents about 81 percent of all Medicare-participating hospitals. The majority of this impact analysis focuses on this set of hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining 19 percent are specialty hospitals that are excluded from the prospective payment system and continue to be paid on the basis of their reasonable costs, subject to a rate-of-increase ceiling on their inpatient operating costs per discharge. These hospitals include psychiatric, rehabilitation, long-term care, children's hospitals, and cancer hospitals. The impacts of our proposed policy changes on these hospitals is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> V. Impact on Excluded Hospitals and Units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As of April 1994, just under 2,000 specialty hospitals are excluded from the prospective payment system and are instead paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling under &sect;413.40. In addition, 1,932 psychiatric and rehabilitation units in hospitals that are subject to the prospective payment system and 9 hospitals extensively involved either in the treatment of cancer or in cancer research are also excluded from the prospective payment system and paid in accordance with &sect;413.40.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 13502 of Public Law 103&hyph;66, the update factor applicable to the rate-of-increase limit for excluded hospitals and units for FY 1995 would be the hospital market basket minus 1.0 percentage point, adjusted to account for the relationship between the hospital's allowable operating cost per case and its target amounts. We are projecting an increase in the excluded hospital market basket of 3.7 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact on excluded hospitals and units of the proposed update in the rate-of-increase limit depends on the cumulative cost increases experienced by each excluded hospital and excluded unit since its applicable base period. For excluded hospitals and units that have maintained their cost increases at a level below the percentage increases in the rate-of-increase limits since their base period, the major effect will be on the level of incentive payments these hospitals and units receive. Conversely, for excluded hospitals and units with per-case cost increases above the cumulative update in their rate-of-increase limit, the major effect will be the amount of excess costs that the hospitals would have to absorb.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

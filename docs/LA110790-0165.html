			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 4 KILLED, 2 HURT WHEN TRAINS CRASH IN CORONA  </P> <P> Four railway crew members were killed and two others were injured this morning  when two freight trains collided before dawn, igniting a brief, spectacular  inferno, according to authorities and eyewitnesses.  </P> <P> Michael A. Martin, a spokesman for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway  Co., declined to immediately identify the dead, pending notification of their  families.  </P> <P> The deaths occurred about 4:10 a.m. when a Chicago-bound freight train collided  with another headed from Barstow to Los Angeles, according to Martin. The  entire crew of the westbound train -- an engineer, a conductor and a brakeman  -- died. On the eastbound train, the brakeman was killed, Martin said.  </P> <P> The two crew members of the eastbound train who survived were taken to area  hospitals with injuries that Martin described as less than life-threatening.  </P> <P> James Dawson, 50, was in fair condition with a fractured knee and head  lacerations at Riverside General Hospital, nursing supervisor Jane Dolan said.  Warren Sanders, whose age was not disclosed immediately, was in good condition  with a fractured ankle at Corona Community Hospital, according to nursing  supervisor Kathy Stephens.  </P> <P> Martin, the railway spokesman, said the cause of the accident was under  investigation. Four locomotives and at least six freight cars derailed. Both  trains were operated by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe company.  </P> <P> For reasons that Martin said were not yet known, the westbound train, weighing  8,700 tons and stretching 6,094 feet long, apparently moved forward from a side  track, its lead locomotive striking the eastbound train near the front of its  second engine.  </P> <P> The eastbound train, which Martin estimated was traveling up to 65 m.p.h., had  three locomotives, weighed 3,152 tons, was 4,229 feet long and was composed of  box cars, tank cars, hopper cars and empty automobile carriers.  </P></p>

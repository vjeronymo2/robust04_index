			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Milk prices best set in the market place Sir, Your leading article on the forthcoming reform of the milk marketing system ('Milking the milk monopoly', September 27) calls for a reply. The main thrust of your argument is that the current statutory and regulated system for the sale and purchase of raw milk and its replacement by free market system will inevitably cause prices to rise. To this, I would make the following points. First, if you believe in free markets, you certainly should be giving two if not three cheers in support of the new system. It may be that supply is limited by EC-imposed milk quotas. But far better that the limited supply is priced by the market place. At present, pricing and allocation of raw milk are agreed by the buyers and sellers of milk in committee. Under the new system, the price of milk will be decided in the market place where dairy processors will compete with each other in terms of price and supply of milk. That's not my idea of a monopoly. I also take issue with the underlying assumption of your article that, if there were a rise in the price of raw milk, it would inevitably mean a rise in the price to the final consumer. The customers of raw milk are dairy companies and processors. The level of their efficiency is vital in determining the price they charge supermarkets. For example, butter factories in Holland operate at 80 per cent capacity and so are able to provide good prices for farmers and charge fair prices to consumers. In the UK, such factories utilise only 25 per cent of their capacity. Surely there is a moral here. Andrew Dare, chief executive, Milk Marketing Board, Thames Ditton, Surrey KT7 OEL</p>

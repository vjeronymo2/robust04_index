			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 25 YEARS LATER -- A NEW BATTLE AT BERKELEY;  </P> <P> ACTIVISM: PLANS TO ERECT A MEMORIAL TO THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT AT UC, THE  FIRST GREAT STUDENT UPRISING IN THE 1960S, STIRS DEBATE.  </P> <P> Twenty-five years ago, UC Berkeley was recovering from a divisive three-month  battle over the right to engage in political activity on campus -- the famed  Free Speech Movement.  </P> <P> Today, battle lines are drawn again, this time over whether the movement -- the  first great student uprising of the 1960s -- deserves a memorial.  </P> <P> "The Free Speech Movement represented a rebirth of student activism in this  nation and remains an inspiration to students around the world," said Peter  Selz, a retired UC Berkeley art professor and one of the main backers of a  memorial.  </P> <P> Selz added: "Look at the students in Prague, Leipzig and Tian An Men Square;  they are the direct descendants of the Free Speech Movement."  </P> <P> But support for the memorial is far from unanimous. One of the memorial's  leading foes, journalism professor David Littlejohn, said that to welcome it to  campus "would be to reject and insult the opinions of many who did not regard  (the movement) as Berkeley's finest hour."  </P> <P> The idea of commemorating the Free Speech Movement evolved in 1988 through  informal discussions among Selz, physics professor Charles Schwartz and  architecture professor Galen Cranz. Some form of public art, they decided,  would best honor the movement.  </P> <P> "We want to commemorate more than just one point of time in history here," Selz  said. "We want to commemorate the idea of free expression. We want it to serve  as an inspiration for future generations of student activists."  </P> <P> The three enlisted the support of many prominent faculty and student leaders,  past and present, and formed the Berkeley Art Project. But rather than  commission an artist, they decided to have a contest, allowing entries to be  displayed and critiqued by the university community.  </P> <P> The contest attracted 275 entries, which on Feb 6. were narrowed to five  finalists by a panel formed by the art project. The panel is scheduled to  announce its top choice later this month.  </P> <P> Memorial backers so far have raised $30,000 from private sources. Their goal is  to raise $120,000 to pay for constructing the memorial and paying the artist,  yet to be selected.  </P> <P> Ultimately, however, several campus committees and outgoing Chancellor Ira  Michael Heyman must approve the memorial concept and its final design. That is  proving no sure thing.  </P> <P> Heyman has expressed "personal misgivings" about the project. And to many  members of the campus community, the Free Speech Movement is a bad memory and  an embarrassment to the school.  </P> <P> Littlejohn, who has taught at the university since 1963, said that by  commemorating the movement, "The university would be coming down on a specific  side of (what was) a passionate controversy. . . . There is no consensus on  this."  </P> <P> Selz conceded that the movement divided the campus. But he added: "Important  events are divisive. Look at the two most divisive in American history -- the  Civil War and the Vietnam War. In both cases, a work of art -- the Lincoln  Memorial and the Vietnam Memorial -- helped heal that division."  </P> <P> So far, the dispute has been limited mainly to the faculty and the opinion  pages of the campus newspaper. Few students have taken an interest in the  issue.  </P> <P> "We're in favor of the project, but it's mainly a faculty issue," said Cecilia  Wang, a student government representative who sponsored a resolution backing  the memorial. "We don't have the time or energy to get involved in this.  Besides, this is something from the past and we're more concerned with issues  that affect the future," such as ethnic diversity among the faculty.  </P> <P> The Free Speech Movement began on Oct. 1, 1964, when student Mario Savio and  ex-student Jack Weinberg set up a table on Sproul Plaza to recruit students  into a civil rights group. The two, supported by a coalition of student groups  ranging from socialists to Republicans, were intentionally challenging a 1959  UC Berkeley ban on advocating or collecting funds for off-campus causes.  </P> <P> Weinberg was quickly arrested by university police and placed in a patrol car.  But hundreds of students surrounded the vehicle, blocking its passage and  preventing police from taking him away.  </P> <P> While Weinberg remained handcuffed in the back seat of the vehicle, Savio and  other student leaders used the patrol car as a podium for anti-administration  speeches, receiving national television coverage. The standoff ended 32 hours  later.  </P> <P> The following months were marked by protests, strikes and arrests, including  one incident in which 773 students were dragged from an administration  building. After a semester of rebellion, the administration gave in to the  movement's main demands, allowing students to engage in activities promoting  off-campus political causes on university property.  </P> <P> The movement's tactics, which included sit-ins, teach-ins, satiric songs, skits  and other acts of civil disobedience, became the model used by protesters  against the Vietnam War, apartheid and other causes ever since.  </P> <P> Like the movement they seek to honor, the memorial contest's 275 entries ranged  from the irreverent and bizarre to the abstract. They included a full-size  ceramic police car, a giant screw, three monkeys in a cage, a toppled  Roman-style column with a broken bust of Cicero at its feet, and four pedestals  topped with busts of Abbie Hoffman sticking out his tongue.  </P> <P> The five semifinalists are as diverse as the group from which they were chosen.  </P> <P> One proposal would create a column of air 6 inches in diameter marked by a  round marble "frame." The air and the ground underneath it would be declared  "not a part of any nation and not subject to any entity's jurisdiction."  </P> <P> Two other semifinalists would have practical uses. One calls for a yellow block  labeled "soapbox" to be placed at the foot of the steps leading up to Sproul  Hall, which fronts the plaza. Another would mount a giant electronic billboard  over the student union building facing the plaza. Students and others would be  able to type their ideas onto a computer terminal that would then flash the  messages to thousands of passers-by.  </P> <P> The other two finalists propose that messages celebrating free speech be inlaid  into the pavement of Sproul Plaza. One would consist of letters made of  variegated red brick set directly into the pavement, while the other would have  letters set into large, metal-filled cracks that would emanate from the plaza's  central fountain.  </P> <P> Regardless of the final pick's artistic merit, Heyman may reject it. In a  recent letter to the faculty, he wrote, "For many, perhaps most, 1964 was a  time of universally shared agony."  </P> <P> Heyman's attitude surprised many because in the immediate aftermath of the Free  Speech Movement he headed a faculty committee that produced a report  sympathetic to the students' goals.  </P> <P> But Heyman has said he now regrets much of what followed the rebellion. In his  view, it opened an era of radical dominance at Berkeley that has squelched  other political opinions.  </P> <P> Savio, now a physics teacher in Modesto, and other leaders of the Free Speech  Movement -- Michael Rossman, an author and teacher living in Berkeley; Jackie  Goldberg, now president of the Los Angeles school board, and her brother, Art  Goldberg, a Los Angeles attorney -- strongly support the memorial and have  contributed to it. But they are unlikely to lead any protests over it.  </P> <P> "I'll send a check, but the younger generation is going to have to lead the  march this time," said Art Goldberg.  </P></p>

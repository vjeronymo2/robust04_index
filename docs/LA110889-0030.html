			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROAD TAX FALLS BEHIND IN EARLY SANTA CLARITA VALLEY RETURNS  </P> <P> A tax initiative to raise $285 million to build and improve roads in the Santa  Clarita Valley appeared to be headed for an overwhelming defeat in early  election returns Tuesday night.  </P> <P> But supporters of the tax held out hope that last-minute campaigning and  endorsements from a host of firefighter and law enforcement organizations would  win them the two-thirds majority needed to pass the measure.  </P> <P> Measure P would add between $75 and $200 to annual residential property tax  bills for all property in Santa Clarita and in most of the surrounding  unincorporated valley. Commercial and industrial property would pay 7 1/2 cents  per square foot.  </P> <P> The battle over Measure P pitted many the valley's leading citizens --  including City Council members, well-known civic volunteers and business owners  -- against a ragtag group of political unknowns who waged a campaign relying  mostly on volunteers.  </P> <P> The Roads Now Committee, bolstered by contributions from developers and  construction firms, raised $86,000 to push the road-building measure. The  opposition group, known as SMRT for Stop Mello-Roos Tax, raised only $1,900,  according to campaign finance reports.  </P> <P> John Machin, a SMRT spokesman, said the early returns showed that a grass-roots  movement could battle big money. Laurene Weste, a member of the Roads Now  Committee, said that if Measure P does fail, motorists will be the real losers.  "We'll continue to sit in traffic jams."  </P> <P> The Roads Now Committee, which hired a political consultant and sent 40,000  mailers to voters, made a last-minute push Tuesday. About 30 volunteers worked  a phone bank at the group's campaign headquarters, reminding Measure P  supporters to vote.  </P> <P> In other valley elections, 42 candidates sought 20 vacancies on school boards  overseeing seven rapidly growing school systems.  </P> <P> * In the Newhall School District, early returns showed a close race between  incumbents Pat Willett, Howard L. Hill and Charles E. Payne and challengers  Zandra B. Stanley, Michael McCabe and Leon Worden. Stanley led a field that was  separated by a handful of votes.  </P> <P> * The race was equally tight in the Saugus Union Elementary School District  where Eileen Connolly, a self-described "concerned parent," was leading the  field. Close behind were incumbents Marilynn K. Blaylock, Betty L. Lund and  Michael E. Rayfield. Trailing were Antonio M. Martino and Ralph Wilkin.  </P> <P> * At least one new trustee was to be elected in the Sulphur Springs School  District, where only two incumbents -- Art Wilde and Scott Seamons -- sought  reelection. Kerry Clegg, a research biologist at Cal State Northridge, was  leading newcomers Rob Werner and Bill Rattazzi.  </P> <P> * A community volunteer and former PTA president, Jane Pederson, was ahead in  early balloting for three seats on the board of the Castaic Union School  District. Trailing were incumbents David E. Worthington, Irene L. Massey and  Gloria E. Mercado.  </P> <P> * Seven candidates sought two seats on the board of the Santa Clarita Community  College District, which oversees College of the Canyons. Challengers Andrew  Martin and Ernest Moreno were leading John D. Hoskinson, the incumbent in Seat  1. Trailing Hoskinson was Nancy Neff. For Seat 3, incumbent Linda C. Cubbage  was well ahead of Dan Brown and Donald Gaskin.  </P> <P> * At least two new trustees were elected in the 1,500-student Soledad-Agua  Dulce School District, where two incumbents did not seek new terms. Nancy  Kelso, the lone incumbent, led a field that was separated by just a few votes.  Also running, in order of the most votes, were Ronnie Garner, Laurie Browning,  Rebecca Ann Small, Jo Ann Baker, Timothy Millen and Mark Samskar.  </P> <P> * In the tiny Hughes-Elizabeth Lake Union School District, high in the Angeles  National Forest, the early leaders were incumbent Lola J. Skelton Mantooth, Sue  Page, a teacher, and Steve Nemback, a water plant operator. Trailing were  Robert Janssen, Wayne Prindle and two incumbents, Richard Lewis and Bryant D.  Swenson.  </P> <P> COMPLETE RESULTS: A27, A28  </P> <P> MORE ELECTION STORIES: B10  </P></p>

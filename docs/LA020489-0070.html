			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LOVER OF MOVIES  </P> <P> Max Laemmle, the Man Who Loved Movies, was a major force in Los Angeles film  culture, not only for the films he presented but for his warm and generous  collaboration with other film organizations.  </P> <P> It was with the help of Laemmle (who died Jan. 20) that the American Film  Institute was able to reorganize the Los Angeles International Film Festival in  1987 (replacing Filmex) and present it at his Los Feliz Cinema. His  collaboration with the AFI continued in specialized festivals at his Santa  Monica Cinema devoted to European, British, U.S. independent and documentary  films. He will be greatly missed.  </P> <P> KEN WLASCHIN  </P> <P> Director, AFI/LA FilmFest  </P> <P> GARY McVEY  </P> <P> Associate Director  </P></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Banking on breaking down the barriers to China - Foreign trade and investment in China are growing rapidly and Hongkong Bank is well placed to benefit when the colony reverts to Chinese control in 1997 / The Battle for Midland OUTSIDE HONGKONG Bank's Shenzhen branch on a sultry weekday afternoon in the south China town, two dozen customers stand in line to use the cash machine. If they want, they will be able to draw cash from accounts on the other side of the world. The cash machine is one of many bridgeheads by Hongkong Bank into China. So far the Shenzhen cash machine is its only one in China and it can be used only by non-Chinese nationals who draw their cash not in the RMB of the People's Republic of China, but in Hongkong dollars. Hongkong Bank however hopes that the day is not too far off when the RMB will become a convertible currency and it will be able to offer a fuller range of banking services to China's 1.2bn citizens. Judged by the vast scale of the country, Hongkong Bank's three branches and six representative offices in China are little more than a toehold: but the Chinese operations are mostly concentrated in the south, where foreign banks and international investors are co-operating with Chinese authorities to produce an explosion of economic development. Only Standard Chartered has a comparable presence among foreign banks. Foreign trade and investment in China are growing rapidly, as manufacturing shifts from Hong Kong to Shenzhen and other towns in the Pearl River Delta in special economic zones in Guangdong province just across the border. The results are extraordinary. Between 1980 and 1991 Shenzhen transformed from a fishing town of 50,000 people to a frenetic industrial metropolis and financial centre with a population of 2m. In 1990 it opened its own stock exchange. 'The differences between Hong Kong and its neighbouring towns are getting rapidly less distinct,' says Miss Rose Lee, assistant general manager at Hongkong Bank. Not that Shenzhen is entirely what it looks. Most of its workforce comes from Chinese villages on one-year contracts. Workers may earn less than Dollars 100 a month. Their American and Hong Kong Chinese managers return home each night to the British territory. Like other Hong Kong business institutions, Hongkong Bank hopes that by 1997, when the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty, an economic miracle of unprecedented proportions will mean that actual changes in the business environment are relatively minor. The changes are a reward for several decades after 1949 when Hongkong Bank maintained a token presence in China believing that some day economic relations would revive. During the lean years its role as the de facto central banker of Hong Kong helped it in its dealings with the Chinese authorities. But at the end of the 1970s it had only the Shanghai branch in China. Business with China breaks down into several categories: trade finance, project finance for infrastructural developments such as the proposed motorway to link Hong Kong and Shenzhen; direct lending to joint ventures and state corporations; and bank guarantees for Chinese businesses. The bank provides no figures about the size of its business in China but, though most of China's USDollars 135.7bn foreign trade in 1991 seems to have been handled by Chinese banks, there is clearly plenty of business around. Unofficial estimates place the size of the the Hongkong Bank loan book in China at more than USDollars 4bn, well ahead of its nearest rival, Standard Chartered. Working relations with the Chinese authorities, especially the government of Guangdong Province, are clearly good and getting closer all the time. Just how intimate they are is difficult for third parties to assess. In Beijing relations are more delicate: Hongkong Bank is one of many supplicants, though it can project itself as an important source of information and good publicity about China to the rest of the world. Hongkong Bank officials are upbeat when discussing China's future and business prospects, but there is a slight note of whistling in the dark about predictions of China's political future. The underlying argument is that if there is a vast and thriving trading and industrial empire in free trade zones such as Shenzhen, the Pearl Delta, and perhaps by 1997 Shanghai as well, then the precise complexion of the Beijing government will not matter too much. There is special reticence on both sides about the precise reaction of the Beijing authorities to the bid for Midland and proposals to shift Hongkong Bank's headquarters to London. Peoples Bank officials, who are voluble about discussing plans to quintuple the size of the Shenzhen economic zone, fall silent when asked about the merger, and say they can add nothing to the Beijing Foreign Ministry statement. The acid test seems to be Hongkong Bank's future attachment to Hong Kong. Miss Lee said: 'They have told us that they understand about international acquisitions but we don't want you to do anything that is not in the interests of Hong Kong. That suits us because our intention is to increase our business here even further if we possibly can, on top of our very high market share.'</p>

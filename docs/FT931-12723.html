			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / French trade turnround FRANCE produced a record FFr30.55bn (Pounds 3.71bn) trade surplus last year, a sharp turnround from the FFr29.55bn deficit in 1991, thanks to a gain in market share by industrial exporters and a slowdown in demand for imports, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said the result was the fruit of French companies' rigorous control of wages and other costs, which had improved their competitiveness by 10 per cent over the past five years. The result, the biggest reversal in nearly 13 years of trade deficits, is good news at time when the Socialist government is threatened by electoral defeat.</p>

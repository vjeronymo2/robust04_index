			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES;  </P> <P> STUDIES CONFLICT ABOUT FARES FROM HUB AIRPORTS  </P> <P> Average airline fares have decreased at most major airports, with competition  increasing substantially since deregulation a decade ago, according to an  industry study released Tuesday.  </P> <P> But another report by the General Accounting Office to be released at a Senate  hearing today says airlines charge an average of 27% more per passenger mile on  flights to and from 15 major hub airports than to other airports included in  the study.  </P> <P> The airline industry report said that average fares have decreased since  deregulation in 1978 and that fares at 30 hub airports are only 1.5% above the  industry average. That study says hub fares are a little higher primarily  because hubs tend to have more nonstop flights.  </P> <P> Both studies are to be discussed today at a hearing of the Commerce, Science  and Transportation subcommittee on aviation, which is examining the airline  practice of feeding many flights through a single airport.  </P> <P> The study by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, says competition has  decreased at some airports because major airlines are dominating the market  where they have hub operations.  </P> <P> "Many travelers have less choice among airlines as more markets are being  controlled by a single airline," says an advance copy of the study obtained by  Associated Press.  </P> <P> The report says although the number of destinations served from hub airports  studied increased 10% between May, 1985, and May, 1988, most of the increases  were by dominant carriers and were offset by large service reductions by other  carriers.  </P> <P> At 13 of the 15 hubs studied, average air fares per passenger mile (one paying  passenger carried one mile) were higher for dominant carriers than for other  airlines serving the same airports, the report said.  </P> <P> "Hubbing generates important operating efficiencies, but it can also lead to  substantial market power for the airlines, which could lead to higher fares and  reduced levels of service," GAO official Kenneth M. Mead said in testimony  prepared for the subcommittee hearing.  </P> <P> The industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of Simat,  Helliesen &amp; Eichner concludes that competition in individual markets has  increased despite the greater concentration within the industry and at some  airports.  </P> <P> The study commissioned by the Air Transport Assn., which represents major  airlines, concludes that there is little, if any, relationship between average  fares and airline concentration at either hub or non-hub airports.  </P></p>

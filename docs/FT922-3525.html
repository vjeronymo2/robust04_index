			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / People: Racal realigns Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman and chief executive of Racal Electronics for 26 years, will relinquish the chief executive spot to his right-hand man David Elsbury from the beginning of August. While Elsbury, 56, was obviously the heir apparent, analysts yesterday expressed a degree of surprise that Sir Ernest had lined himself up as chairman of Chubb, the security locks and alarms business due to be demerged in October. The precise timing of the split chairman and chief executive role at Racal may thus have been determined by Sir Ernest's appreciation he could not inhabit all three positions - with the chairmanship of Vodafone, now spun off from Racal, into the bargain. Elsbury, who joined Racal in 1956, has been chief operating officer since 1989, and deputy chief executive since 1983. His task in the last three years has been to restructure the non-Vodafone side of the business. Sir Ernest, 66, yesterday also named the two non-executive directors he is bringing onto the Chubb board. One is Sir Colin Corness, chairman of Redland and the Nationwide building society and a director of the Bank of England. Sir Colin knows Chubb already, having been a non-executive director of Chubb &amp; Sons for ten years until the Racal purchase in 1984. Meanwhile, the other non-executive appointment, Michael Blackburn, who was until last April chairman of Touche Ross &amp; Co., has obviously forgiven the chairman his rhetoric in the midst of the recent Williams Holdings battle for Racal. Sir Ernest, a qualified accountant himself, was heard to make disparaging remarks about the profession as he laid into the Williams team - a bunch of 'accountants' who only knew how to slash costs. ***** David Downes becomes deputy chief executive of HUNTER SAPHIR in addition to his responsibilities as group finance director. Peter Austin becomes a director. Ken Payne is company secretary. ***** Christopher Rouse has been appointed development director of FORTE HOTELS. Mike Stevens becomes a director of FORTE POSTHOUSE. ***** Valerie Corrigan has been elected shareholder director of NFC. ***** Alastair Channing, deputy md of operating subsidiary Associated British Ports, and James Shaw, md of property subsidiary Grosvenor Square Properties, are appointed to the board of ASSOCIATED BRITISH PORTS HOLDINGS.</p>

Addressing the Lower House foreign affairs commission ahead  of a working lunch with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic,  Andreatta said his talks with Granic would focus on the  "worrying reports of direct intervention by Zagreb in central  Bosnia." "From my talks with Granic," he told the commission,  "I expect convincing elements as regards the groundlessness of  rumours -- which are however being firmed up by worrying details  -- concerning a build-up of Croatian forces."    Many countries have been pressing for an extension of the  embargo against the rump Yugoslav federation of  Serbia-Montenegro, to include Croatia.    Andreatta added that "a development of this kind" would risk  weakening the position of those such as Italy who have resisted  calls for the military embargo to be lifted to allow Bosnian  Muslims to defend themselves properly. On peace plans for  Bosnia, Andreatta criticised "a certain idealism that does not  look at costs," calling for "concrete positions."    In particular, he said that "if the condition for reaching  peace is the separation of ethnic groups, this must be  recognised, within the context of a European peace plan which  is, in any case, perfectible." (Andreatta will have talks here  tomorrow with international mediators David Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg.)    He defended the European peace plan for a three-way land  split, saying that while it "does not respect the principles of  morality and justice which the international community seeks to  use as inspiration for its actions, it nonetheless appears  necessary as a way of achieving the primary goal of stopping the  fighting."    Despite the mutual refusals to budge from territorial  claims,  Andreatta underlined the importance of "keeping the negotiation  process open" while re-affirming the possible use of NATO air  strikes against Serb positions, in support of UN troops hold up  at Srebrenica and Tuzla. He said that while action against  Srebrenica appeared "less probable" for the moment, "there  remains the possibility of action at Tuzla, unless Serbs supply  the necessary co-operation to re-open the airport there."    But in any case, he reminded the commission, any air action  will be "limited and targeted", and there should be "no  illusions" that their use might play any decisive role in  resolving a conflict that will ultimately be solved at the  negotiating table.    Andreatta reiterated the need for greater involvement on the  part of the United States, Russia, and moderate Islamic states  in the stalled peace process. He said that a perceived lack of  support from the United States might encourage the Bosnian  Muslims to "confirm their present tendency of preferring  military options." As for Russia, it must be called on to wield  greater pressure on Serbia and "adopt an attitude of maximum  openness towards Muslim requests."    He said Italy means to keep up all forms of pressure to  ensure that aid convoys are allowed to continue consigning their  precious deliveries, and reiterated that the presence of the UN  troops is "indispensable" for protecting these convoys and  acting as buffer between the warring factions and civilian  populations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Text] Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, presidential candidate  for the Workers Party [PT], on 11 April promised Bishop Luciano  Mendes de Almeida, chairman of the National Conference of  Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), that two controversial proposals that  irritated the church will be withdrawn from the PT government  platform: the legalization of abortion and marriage between  homosexuals.    Lula and Bishop Mendes de Almeida met in Sao Paulo at Lula's  request. "I told Bishop Luciano that the final decision on this  subject will be made at the national party convention, but I am  sure, just like the rest of my party, that although these  problems must be discussed by society, they must not be part of  our government platform," Lula said.    Lula is thus attempting to eliminate the discomfort created  in the relations with one of the PT's traditional allies -- the  so-called progressive church. Lula has guaranteed Bishop Luciano  that he is against abortion and that the PT's greatest concern  is "the defense of the lives of millions of Brazilians who are  alive and about to be born. Issues like these are not a  priority in a country where millions of people are starving or  unemployed. The priority is the distribution of wealth and the  agricultural and employment policies."    Lula discussed with Bishop Mendes de Almeida the document  "Brazil: Alternatives and Protagonists," which is an analysis of  the current situation prepared by the CNBB for its annual  meeting that will begin on 13 April in Itaici, Sao Paulo. "We  will speak with all the presidential candidates because it is  our duty as a church to bring suggestions to help solve the  national crisis," Bishop Mendes de Almeida said.    He clearly established that the church expects the PT to  reconsider its position regarding abortion and marriage between  homosexuals. "The key, for us, is the defense of life," he said.  "A fetus is defenseless and it is our duty to defend its  rights." As for the document that will be discussed in Itaici,  the CNBB chairman said: "We want a firmer stance by the  democratic state, an economy centered on society, and the  elimination of corruption in public administration."</p>

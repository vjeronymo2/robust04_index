The message says the dear leader, who was born as the  lodestar followed by all the people in the battle site in the  period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle with the soul of Mt.  Paektu, has performed undying feats for the country and the  nation, for the history and era with brilliant ideological and  theoretical activities and outstanding leadership.    "Guided by you Marshal Kim Chong-il, genius of the  revolution  and construction, our country has demonstrated its might as an  invincible socialist country and a model of best socialism  centred on the popular masses," it says, and continues:    "Marshal Kim Chong-il with unexcelled grit and iron will  defended the dignity and security of the socialist homeland of  chuche and won one great victory after another in political and  military confrontation with the enemy by declaring a semi-war  state and taking a decisive step of withdrawing from the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty to cope with the moves of the  imperialists and the reactionaries for isolating and stifling  our republic."    The message notes that the glory and happiness of Chongnyon  and Koreans in Japan are unthinkable apart from the wise  guidance and paternal affection of the sagacious leader Marshal  Kim Chong-il, who is leading them to victory by successfully  embodying the great leader President Kim Il-song's chuche-based  idea of the movement of Koreans overseas.    It expresses the resolution to vigorously promote the  modelling of Chongnyon on the chuche idea, strengthen it  organizationally and ideologically and register greater  achievements in the efforts for national reunification and all  other patriotic work, thus making this a year of a new victory  in the history of the movement of Koreans in Japan.    The message wishes Marshal Kim Chong-il good health and long  life.</p>

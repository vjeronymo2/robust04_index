			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / White House defends energy tax as rift grows THE Clinton administration opened the first of several critical weeks for its deficit reduction package by insisting, in the face of significant opposition in Congress, that it stood by the principle of a broad-based energy tax. Following President Bill Clinton's weekend broadside against the 'big oil lobby', Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said in a television interview yesterday morning that the president felt the energy tax was still central to the overall plan. Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York, chairman of the finance committee, predicted that some form of energy tax would be passed on to the full Senate from his committee, although he conceded amendments to it could be made. Senators David Boren of Oklahoma and John Breaux of Louisiana, both representing oil states, have qualified their opposition to the tax, based on the energy content of fuels measured in British thermal units (BTUs). However, Mr Boren, the principal sponsor of an alternative plan to put ceilings on social spending and increase taxes on the elderly, said he would still vote against the energy tax as it was now constituted in the committee. Mr Breaux said he could support a straight petrol tax, but at a rate (eight cents to the gallon) that would generate less than half the projected Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.2bn) a year revenue of the BTU tax once fully in place. The Senate machinations have cast a cloud over the more imminent deliberations in the House, which is due to vote on the overall package, including the energy tax, on Thursday. The general assumption has been that the bill will pass the House, where the Democrats have a comfortable majority, in spite of last week's rebellion by mostly conservative southern Democrats demanding deeper spending cuts and less reliance on tax revenues. As Mr Moynihan has indicated, the precise mix of the package may yet be altered. But even Mr Clinton's supporters in the House are concerned that their politically difficult vote on Thursday may be rendered null and void by subsequent amendments in the Senate. Recalling that the House passed the economic stimulus package only to see it killed in the Senate, Congressman Craig Washington, a Texas Democrat, questioned whether members 'are willing to fall on their swords again'. Among Democrats, fault lines other than that on the energy tax are becoming increasingly apparent over Mr Clinton's general approach to cutting the budget deficit. Mr Clinton came to office as a self-proclaimed 'new kind of Democrat', a believer in individual responsibility rather than the pre-eminence of government's role. But, in the opinion of old allies like Congressman Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, he has become increasingly captured by the party's 'tax and spend' and traditionally liberal forces. It is the emphasis on new taxation - a contradiction of Mr Clinton's campaign promise to lower taxes on the middle classes - that most disturbs these centrist Democrats. Senator Boren, for example, has justified his opposition to the energy tax as a way of reminding Mr Clinton to go back to his roots. 'Sometimes,' he said in a weekend talk show, 'when you see a friend go astray, the best thing to do is to tell the friend the truth.' Mr McCurdy said his opposition to the president was 'the most painful thing I've had to do in Congress'.</p>

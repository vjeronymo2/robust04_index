			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 19 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan  Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez today denied  reports two military bases had attempted to overthrow President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio.    The military chief told NOTIMEX via telephone the country is  calm, although he admitted there are sectors, which he did not  identify, interested in destabilizing Guatemala, as part of a  strategy to affect de Leon' government.    Various sources reported this afternoon a group of officers  discontent with the country's political situation had tried to  overthrow the former human rights ombudsman, who took power on 6  June 1993.    De Leon, who replaced deposed President Jorge Serrano Elias,  has faced over the past months a severe political and economic  crisis, heightened by the violence which claimed the life of  Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez.    Gonzalez, who declared as "unconstitutional" Serrano Elias's  decision to assume extraordinary powers last 25 May, was gunned  down on 1 April, dying the following day in a local hospital.    The defense minister termed as false rumors of an armed  uprising within the military ranks, because "Guatemala is on its  last leg toward peace."    "I have contacted some of the 22 military zones in Guatemala  and have confirmed there is no attempted coup d'etat," he added.    "We have confidence and faith in the president, because he  is  doing things well, and, although his government is temporary, he  will set down irreversible bases for lasting peace in this  country," Enriquez added.</p>

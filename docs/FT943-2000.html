			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Japanese deal postponed Nippon Shinpan, a leading Japanese consumer credit company, has postponed an offering of asset-backed securities, planned for this month. The deal would have been the first international issue by a Japanese company of tradable securities backed by domestic assets. The Japanese Ministry of Finance recently eased restrictions on issuing asset-backed securities in overseas markets. Nippon Shinpan's Y20bn to Y30bn eurobond, backed by Japanese car loan receivables, was due to be launched by Goldman Sachs. The company received official approval from the ministry last week, having applied a year ago, but has postponed the deal until later this year due to low demand for funds and continuing negotiations over issuance fees. Since Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, last week welcomed the finance ministry's decision to allow Nippon Shinpan's issue, adding that he hoped it would lead to broader liberalisation of the asset backed securities market in Japan. The most likely assets for securitisation are leases, car loans and consumer credit loans.</p>

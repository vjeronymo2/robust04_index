			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Not Wilde about Lady Windermere One of the most welcome features of British theatre in the 1990s has been the number of big productions of Oscar Wilde's plays. An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance, Salome, and, of course, The Importance of Being Earnest have all been seen in the West End and on tour. Now, to complete the set of Oscar's five main plays, the Birmingham Rep has launched a new production of Lady Windermere's Fan, his first theatrical triumph. Philip Prowse (who staged the RSC/West End Woman of No Importance) directs and designs. The staging will tour, and may reach the West End. Several of Wilde's plays deal with the mysteries of lost parents or children; but, again, his treatment of this theme is more daring in the early comedies. In The Importance, he keeps us in standard suspense about Jack Worthing's birth until the end. In Lady Windermere and Woman of No Importance, however, he lets us into the secret earlier on, for he has more important matters than suspense on his mind: he wishes us to attend to how these characters behave with their several secrets. Philip Prowse, however, takes a different line. He has not only staged Lady Windermere, he has adapted it fairly considerably. In particular, he tries to keep the audience from knowing the mystery of Mrs Erlynne's connection to the Windermeres until the last act. I cannot say I care for this device. The beauty of Wilde's last act should be in the delicacy with which we see the Windermeres and Mrs Erlynne negotiating the several problems of which we are already aware. Here, however, everything is put off-balance by the delayed revelation of Mrs Erlynne's identity - which makes Wilde's play a much more conventional affair. This staging, as always with Prowse, is strong on glamour. But the more of Prowse's work you see, the more samey it becomes. Black, gold, and red; he cannot keep away from this scheme, even though he dilutes it with paler colours for the Windermeres' home. Everyone's deportment is beautiful, which really helps the play. But Lady Windermere's party is stony and dull, and the supporting characters wield their witticisms not like stilettos but like bludgeons. Wilde was certainly prepared to criticise wit and to show it discomfited - a rare feat in which he resembles Shakespeare, Moliere, Congreve, Jane Austen and almost no one else - but why has Prowse edited away some of the party's witty small talk? In these conditions it is impossible for the leading five actors to present the full dimensions of Wilde's play. Francesca Annis is nonetheless a fine Mrs Erlynne, marvellously elegant in voice and person. She emphasises the sinister 'other woman' effect that this character makes at first, but she plays her big scene with Lady Windermere with surprisingly quiet eloquence; and the different emotions that she keeps beneath her perfect social veneer become superbly apparent in Act IV. And Frank Middlemass, as her devoted dupe Lord Augustus, is so natural that wherever he is seems the most convincing part of the room. Amanda Elwes and Rupert Frazer have all the poise for the Windermeres, but neither of them releases all the emotional intensity that is so crucial to these characters. Simon Dutton, as Lord Darlington, makes a very persuasive alternative suitor for Lady Windermere. But he and Windermere are so serious that we cannot believe they would socialise with the two-dimensional dandies around them. The dandies need more depth, and the rival lovers more wit, if all the facets of Wilde are to fall into place. In short, this staging is not yet fully alive on its own terms, let alone Wilde's. At the Birmingham Rep until May 14, then on tour</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities under pressure The latest slide in gilt-edged stocks, plus renewed worries about the forthcoming regulatory reviews, brought renewed pain to the electricity and water sectors. Last month the utilities provided 14 of the 20 worst performers in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index and the seven poorest performers in the FT-SE 100 Index. Both sectors closed well above the day's lowest levels after a modest rally in gilts triggered bargain hunting. In the 'recs', Eastern finished 7 1/2 off at 577 1/2 p and Southern 17 1/2 weaker at 548 1/2 p. The generators were equally punished, with more US selling hitting PowerGen, finally 15 off at 455p.</p>

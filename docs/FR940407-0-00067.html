			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each of the program elements that must be included, as applicable, in an EIP submitted to the EPA as a plan revision are described below. For EIP's that allow trading to meet existing source requirements, the EPA will consider a two-step process for State submittal and EPA review of the program elements outlined below. Under such a step-wise process, the initial submittal shall include both a framework for all the general elements of program design, as well as all the specific regulatory details for a source-specific trade or for an entire source category, which trade or source category is representative, with respect to all program elements, of the types of trading to be allowed under the general framework. For example, for an EIP designed to directly implement trading within source categories, the initial submittal shall include the full details of all program elements for at least one source category. Alternatively, for an EIP designed to implement trading on a source-by-source basis, with EPA review of each trade, the initial submittal shall include the full details of all program elements for at least one source-specific trade. Thus, required specific aspects of the emission quantification procedures and MRR requirements for additional sources and/or source categories could be submitted at a later time to allow the State to phase-in the application of the program to other individual sources or source categories. Because adequate enforceability elements_including emissions quantification procedures, test methods, and MRR requirements_are integral to any SIP program, approval by the EPA of a framework for trading would constitute approval only of the framework elements included as part of the initial submission and of trading for those sources or within those source categories submitted with the framework and approved for trading by the EPA. Trading involving other sources or source categories could not occur until all elements, including enforceability elements, were approved by the EPA through a subsequent step in the process. The EPA will apply the same criteria in reviewing step-wise submittals of emission quantification and MRR requirements as in reviewing such requirements submitted together with the other program elements. Thus, a subsequent submittal must be fully compatible with all the elements in the initial submittal, and, taken together, both submittals must meet all the requirements of the EIP rules and guidance. The EPA does not intend to consider use of this step-wise process for EIP's that mandate new requirements for affected sources (e.g., requiring mass emission caps on sources previously required to meet emission rate limits).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Program Goals and Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An acceptable EIP must clearly define the goals of the program and provide a rationale relating how the program design will accomplish the goals. These final rules and guidance establish as a goal for all EIP's that they be designed to benefit both the environment and the regulated entities. The final rules and guidance require States to design programs that will meaningfully meet this goal, while providing flexibility to the States to determine how best to accomplish such ``benefits sharing'' in the context of each specific program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``benefits'' is broadly defined to include not only economic benefits, such as cost savings and compliance flexibility for the regulated sources, but also environmental benefits that will result in States reaching attainment of the NAAQS faster than might otherwise occur solely through the use of traditional strategies. Environmental benefits can be created most directly by EIP's that require increased or more rapid emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a traditional regulatory program. Specifically, a 10 percent increase in emissions reductions would presumptively meet this benefits sharing goal. Alternatively, environmental benefits can also be achieved by programs that incorporate, for example, improved administrative mechanisms (e.g., that achieve emissions reductions from sources not readily controllable through traditional regulation), reduced administrative burdens on regulatory agencies that result in increased environmental benefits through other regulatory programs, improved emissions inventories that enhance and lend increased certainty to State planning efforts, and the adoption of emission caps which over time constrain or reduce growth-related emissions beyond traditional regulatory approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statutory EIP's will benefit the environment as a result of the requirement that they be designed to result in significant reductions in actual emissions. For discretionary EIP's, no standard formula for benefit sharing is specified, although the EPA encourages States, to the extent practicable, to design such programs so as to create most directly increased or more rapid emissions reductions (see paragraph IV.A.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA notes that any incentive-based program has the potential to create incentives for pollution prevention and technological innovation. Such an inherent potential benefit can only meaningfully meet the goal of providing benefits to the environment if the program is specifically designed to allocate some of the effects of such innovation to enhancing environmental progress. Likewise, for the other ways listed above in which environmental benefits can be accomplished, the EPA intends that these approaches be meaningfully implemented so as to produce real environmental benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

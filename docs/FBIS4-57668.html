			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] Military troops are patrolling Chapare Region.  Social Defense Under Secretary Mario Soliz confirmed this. He  stated, however, that the military troops are not involved in  the struggle against drug trafficking. "Right now military  troops, like any ordinary citizens, are circulating in the  Chapare zone and some of them are carrying out training  exercises. They are also investigating the possible existence  of narcoterrorism."    Soliz said the troops in El Chapare are subject to the  Defense Ministry and not the Social Defense Undersecretariat.  The under secretary said many peasants oppose the presence of  the Leopardos [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas, UMOPAR]  because they are involved in drug trafficking.    "Operation Amanecer was carried out in Sinahota, and within  two hours some six kg of cocaine were seized. Moreover, 45  maceration pits and 32 cocaine factories were found during the  course of the day. This is really frightening because the  average number of maceration pits UMOPAR members usually find  ranges from six to eight per day."    Recently the government approved a decree referring to the  industrialization of coca leaf, which was not welcomed by the  leaders of the coca farmers. "There is a surplus coca leaf  production that is illegal; these are illegal plantations.  Therefore, the government can, by no means, authorize the  industrialization of something that is illegal, as this would be  illogical; it would mean violating laws and, I repeat, this  makes no sense." [passage omitted]    Mario Soliz asserted that the said decree cannot be modified  as the Chapare leaders have requested. In turn, he asked them  to fulfill the commitment to voluntarily eradicate part of the  surplus production. "What we want to say to them, in the first  place, is: Gentlemen, let us eradicate 3,000 hectares because if  we do so, the country will receive $20 million which it needs.  We are not talking about compulsory eradication. The law  clearly states that we must eradicate between 5,000 and 8,000  hectares, but we want to reach a consensus."    Soliz then said that with or without a consensus, the  alternative development plans and the voluntary eradication of  coca plantations will in any case be implemented in Chapare. "We  do not want to resort to violence because, after all, the  government has the necessary tools to see to it that the law is  respected, but we believe that interdiction is not the best  alternative at this moment if we are able to reach a consensus."</p>

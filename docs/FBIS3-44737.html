Gu  Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the  forum. Responsible comrades of LIAONING RIBAO, the Liaoning  Provincial Radio and Television Department, the Liaoning  People's Broadcasting Station, the Liaoning Television Station,  and the Liaoning Branch of XINHUA News Agency gave speeches.  They reviewed the achievements and problems of the press units  of the province and those of the central authorities stationed  in the province in their efforts to persistently take economic  construction as the central task and adhere to correct press  guidance in 1993. They also offered views and suggestions on  ways to make this year's press and propaganda work successful.    Vice Governor Zhang Rongmao spoke to put forward specific  requirements on how press units should strengthen guidance  through positive examples and improve the propaganda front. He  urged press units under party leadership to adhere to the  principle of propaganda through positive example, correctly  report the provincial situation, and guide the people throughout  the province to make contributions to accelerating Liaoning's  economic construction.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, also  spoke after attentively listening to the speeches. He said: In  1993, press units of the province persistently took the  guidelines of the 14th party congress as guidance and economic  construction as the central task and carried out a great amount  of work focusing on the arrangements of the provincial party  committee and government, thus promoting Liaoning's economic and  other work. The year 1994 will be one when the largest number  of China's major reform measures will be executed and also a  crucial year for the endeavor to more rapidly establish the  socialist market economy system. Therefore, it is very  important to do a good job in news reports.    He emphasized: The focus of the 1994 press work should be on  conscientious implementation of the guidelines of the 14th party  congress, especially those of the third plenary session of the  14th party Central Committee, and the execution of major reform  measures should be regarded as an important part of news reports  to facilitate the establishment of the socialist market economy  system. Press units should intensify publicity of economic work,  adhere to the essential criterion of development, and emphasize  improvement of economic efficiency as the focus to bring about  healthy, sustained, and rapid development in Liaoning's economy.  In publicizing the spiritual civilization, they should adhere  to the major trends to encourage people's enthusiasm for  building socialism and for plunging themselves into economic  construction. They should do a good job in publicizing unity  and stability to provide a good social environment for reform  and opening up and to ensure the development of economic  construction and other undertakings.    Gu Jinchi also put forward specific demands for improvement  of the leading bodies and contingents of the press units of the  province.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, March 16 (XINHUA) -- More and more  residents of northwest China's Gansu Province are now becoming  better off with the construction and operation of hydroelectric  power stations on the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow  River.    Local farmers in drought-hit areas such as Yongjing County,  Dongxiang Autonomous County, Gaolan County and Lanzhou city have  built pumping facilities with cheaper electricity generated by  nearby hydroelectric power stations on the Yellow River.    According to local officials, the pumping projects have  irrigated about 133,000 ha [hectare] of farmland along the  river. More than 300,000 local residents, who used to have to  fetch drinking water from wells or rivers far away, are now able  to drink clean water from the Yellow River, which used to be  called "China's sorrow".    With stable irrigation, some of the areas, such as Jingtai,  Gaolan, Jingyuan and Yuzhong Counties and Baiyin city have  developed into high-yield production centers of grain.    Jingtai County used to depend on an average of 1.34 million  kg of grain allocated and moved in from other parts of the  country each year before the Jingtaichuan Electrical Pumping  Project was completed in the locality. Now, farmers in the  county sell 7.5 million kg of surplus grain to the central  government annually besides reserving enough grain for  themselves.    More than 100,000 residents from other drought-stricken  areas  of the province have moved to areas within the irrigation range  of the Yellow River.    Lanzhou, the provincial capital, and Baiyin city, one of the  country's leading production bases of nonferrous metals, have  gone a step further; they have made good use of the vast areas  of tidal zones along the river and have built 1,000 ha of fish  ponds, which turn out 1,900 tons of freshwater fish a year.    Moreover, farmers around Baiyin have also developed some  2,000 ha of quality rice fields and 2,670 ha of orchards on the  banks of the Yellow River.</p>

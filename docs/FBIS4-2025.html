			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Response To Beijing's 1st Offering Is </F> Just Tepid"]    [Text] Bankers in Beijing smiled last week as money flew  into the city during its first public stock offering.    The three-day issuance, from March 27 to 29, raised 1.786  billion yuan ($205.29 million). Investors had to deposit cash  for receipts that will be used in a lottery to determine who can  buy the shares. The money is being held in Beijing financial  institutions.    However, the capital's first public offering did not meet  the  expectations of securities firms and the four companies floating  the shares. The four companies are Beijing Department Store  (Group) Co Ltd, Beiren Printing Machinery Co Ltd, Beijing Light  Bus Co Ltd and Beijing Town County Trade Centre Co Ltd.    Although stock offerings are the subject of much street talk  these days, masses of investors did not queue in Beijing as they  have in many other cities.    According to underwriters of the flotation, the lottery  rates  for the four companies all surpassed 2.7 per cent. This means  that the chances of a subscriber being able to buy shares are 27  in 1,000.    Beiren had the highest lottery rate, 10.5679 per cent. In  comparison, the rate for Tsingtao Beer was 0.06 per cent when it  publicly floated shares last year.    Experts say the months-long contraction in the country's  stock market dampened people's enthusiasm for the new issues.    In addition, the public has learned that new issues may not  promise the easy fortunes they did several years ago when demand  for stocks far out paced the supply.    Observers also point out that Beijing people are  conservative  investors. They prefer the lower risks of financial instruments  such as treasury bonds to the higher risks of stocks.    The major challenger to the new stock issues is this year's  treasury bonds, whose yields have lured many investors.    Of the four companies, investors preferred the two retail  companies over the two industrial firms, although the former  carry higher issuing prices.    The lottery rate for Beijing Department Store is 2.9384 per  cent and for Beijing Town and County Trade Centre, 2.7721 per  cent. For Beiren it is 10.5679 percent and for Beijing Light  Bus, 6.3549 per cent.</p>

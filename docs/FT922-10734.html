			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Waterford Foods shows 40% advance to IPounds 15.9m WATERFORD FOODS, now Ireland's largest dairy group following the completion of its acquisition yesterday of three Grand Metropolitan subsidiaries in Ireland, reported a 40 per cent jump in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 11.3m to IPounds 15.86m (Pounds 14.4m), for the year to December 31. Turnover was 3.5 per cent down, from IPounds 439m to IPounds 424m, but operating cash flow increased by IPounds 4.2m to IPounds 24.9m. Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, said that all segments of the business had performed well during the year and there had been a sig-nificant reduction in interest costs by IPounds 3.1m to IPounds 6.8m, improving interest cover to 3.3 times. He said that IPounds 58m in goodwill relating to the acquisition in 1989 of Healds Dairies in northern England and Galloway West in the US has now been written off. Analysts in Dublin were encouraged by the results and are anticipating strong earnings growth in the coming year, as Waterford's latest acquisitions are consolidated into the group. These are United Co-operative Dairies (UCD) in northern England which was acquired in November last year, and which is being integrated into the Healds operations, and the three Grand Metropolitan subsidiaries in Ireland which have just been purchased for a consideration of IPounds 63.2m. Mr O'Connor also announced Waterford's intention to buy the remaining 50 per cent stake in WED, one of the three Grand Met subsidiaries, held by Waterford Co-op and which is the principal shareholder in the Waterford Group. This will involve a further consideration of IPounds 26.4m. The acquisitions are being financed from the recent IPounds 24.3m rights issue and new borrowings. Mr Michael Dempsey, assistant chief executive for finance, said that the goodwill involved in the UCD and Grand Met acquisitions, amounting to IPounds 66m, will be written off over 20 years. Mr O'Connor anticipates that the group's annual turnover will now increase to more than IPounds 700m, and will generate operating profits in the region of IPounds 40m. Some words of warning have been issued by brokers over the group's borrowings to finance its acquisitions, estimated at IPounds 130m, although the company believes this will be paid off 'in two to three years' out of the increased cash flow. Mr O'Connor said that interest cover is expected to remain above 3, despite the new borrowings. Earnings per share rose to 9.27p (6.26p) and a final dividend of 1.525p per A share is recommended, giving a total for the year of 2.625p (2.5p).</p>

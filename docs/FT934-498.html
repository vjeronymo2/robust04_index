			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Suez rescues troubled banking unit Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company, is taking full control of Banque Monod, its troubled banking subsidiary, in a FFr150m (Dollars 25.9m) financial rescue package. Banque Monod has, like other French financial institutions, been badly affected by the crisis in the property market. The bank has incurred heavy losses in its property financing activities. Mr Francois Lesieur, deputy chairman, yesterday warned that Banque Monod, which made a net loss of FFr74m in 1992, had fallen further into the red this year with a net loss of about FFr200m. The rescue package involves a capital injection worth FFr150m and the restructuring of Banque Monod's interests. The banks will withdraw from the property financing sector and will concentrate on property management and commercial loans. Mr Lesieur said he hoped the bank would return to 'an acceptable level of profitability' in 1994. As a result of the recapitalisation, Suez, which owns 90 per cent of the bank, will take full control as Financiere de l'Atlantique, the other minority shareholder, relinquishes its 10 per cent stake. Suez has encountered difficulties with its other banking subsidiaries that are exposed to the problems of the French property market. Last year, it recapitalised Banque Indosuez, its main banking unit, and this year has been burdened by the losses of Banque Henin, another subsidiary.</p>

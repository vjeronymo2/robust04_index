But already these soccer ball-shaped carbon cages,  incorporating 60 or 70 carbon atoms, have become the subject of  application research.    If a recent Tokyo symposium is any guide, both the chemical  industry and the semiconductor industry could one day be  transformed by the ideas now coming out of research labs.    A group from Hokkaido University has confirmed that the  fullerene can be modified to act as catalysts to promote  chemical reactions between organic compounds. Combined with  alkali metals, the fullerenes in some cases work better than  platinum as a catalyst, the group reports.    In one experiment, they attached six atoms of cesium to  carbon-70, and then evaluated the ability of this complex to  facilitate the synthesis of compounds containing hydrogen and  tritium--a standard test for catalytic activity. The results  showed the fullerene complex to be around ten times more  effective than a platinum catalyst, which is one of the most  active catalysts known.    In another experiment with more direct industrial relevance,  the fullerene complex was able to promote the synthesis of  ethylene and propylene from ethane and propane at a low  temperature of 200 C, or 30 C below that required with a  platinum catalyst.    But catalysts are not the only potential application for  fullerenes. Groups from the University of Tsukuba, Kyoto  University, the Tokyo Metropolitan University and various other  places are attempting to synthesize super polymers of carbon-60  in the hopes of developing new types of plastics and electronic  materials. The work is still at the basic research stage, though.    It is not necessary to link fullerene into giant polymers to  exploit the material's electric properties. Toshiba Corp. has  fabricated a polymer film incorporating carbon-60 which can  convert light energy into electric energy. The company views  this as a step toward the development of new photographic and  memory storage media.    Meanwhile, a group at Shizuoka University is developing  equipment to mass-produce fullerenes. The standard method now is  to pass a current between two carbon electrodes, and then scrape  off the fullerenes which form as a result. But this method  cannot be run continuously, and produces only small quantities  of fullerenes. In the method being developed by the Shizuoka  University group, fine powdered carbon is supplied to a single  carbon electrode.</p>

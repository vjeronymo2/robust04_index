			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Tories face defeat - but not disaster For the Conservatives, it was a defeat, but not a disaster. By 2.15am, with 67 results declared, the Tories looked likely to hold 16 of their 32 seats - much less than party strategists had hoped, but many more than they feared. With about 27 per cent of the vote, Conservative support was running 8 percentage points behind the party's worst ever performance in a nationwide poll. The good news for the Tories was that the Liberal Democrat upsurge was less dramatic than many pundits had forecast, mainly because the Labour vote held up more strongly than expected. Tactical voting appeared to have been confined largely to Liberal Democrat supporters, who switched to Labour in large numbers in an attempt to kick out Tory MEPs. Labour voters stayed largely loyal. Among results declared, Labour had won 52 seats, the Conservatives 13, and the Liberal Democrats 2. The BBC forecast the final result as Labour 63 seats (up 18 on the last election in 1989), Conservatives 18 (down 16) and Liberal Democrats two. The BBC forecast that Labour would take 47 per cent of the final vote, up 7 percentage points on 1989, the Conservatives 27 per cent (down 8 percentage points), the Liberal Democrats 16 per cent (up 10 percentage points), and the Greens 5 per cent (down 10 percentage points). Among Labour gains were Essex South, Essex West and Hertfordshire East, Leicester, Norfolk, Northants and Blaby, London SE, London NW, Suffolk and SW Norfolk - all from the Conservatives. Sir Christopher Prout, the leader of the Conservative MEPs, lost to Labour by 2,000 votes after a recount in Hereford and Shropshire. It was a mixed night for the Liberal Democrats. The party took Somerset and Devon North, and Cornwall, but failed to gain Wight and Hampshire South, where the Conservatives held on narrowly. The Conservatives also held Buckinghamshire and Oxford East, Cambridgeshire, Essex North and Suffolk South, Hampshire North and Oxford, London South and Surrey East, Surrey, Wight and Hampshire South, Wiltshire North, The Cotswolds, and Thames Valley after a recount. The Liberal Democrats were making much of having won their first seats in Strasbourg. The party's failure to come near to victory in Surrey, and its defeat in Wight and Hampshire South - one of their best hopes - was a serious blow. The party was also disappointed by its fading performance in The Cotswolds, held by Lord Plumb, a former leader of the Conservative MEPs. However, it came close to victory in Wiltshire North and Bath. The enormous swings that gave Labour victory in Norfolk and Essex South appeared to represent a consolidation of the anti-Tory vote. But Labour was the real victor. The party gained every seat it could reasonably have hoped for. There was a 16 per cent swing to Labour in London, and the party forced recounts in Thames Valley, the Conservatives fourth safest seat, Sussex South and Crawley (9th), Kent East (11th safest), and Worcester and Warwickshire South (19th). The Liberal Democrats forced recounts in Dorset (24th), Hereford and Shropshire (21st) Devon and Plymouth W (30th). The Scottish National party was on course to win Scotland North East, in addition to the Highlands and Islands seat held since 1979 by Mrs Winnie Ewing. Votes in both seats will be counted today. The SNP appeared to have taken 31 per cent of the vote in Scotland, the party's best ever performance in a UK-wide election. It was running second in a number of seats, including Lothians and South of Scotland. There was also good news for Plaid Cymru in North Wales, where Mr Dafydd Wigley, the party leader, jumped into second place, raising the party's vote from 13 per cent to 33 per cent. Plaid also took second place in mid-Wales, but both seats were retained by Labour. In South Wales East, Mrs Glenys Kinnock, wife of the former Labour leader, was elected to the European parliament with a majority of more than 100,000. Contrary to early forecasts that the turnout would collapse, 35 per cent of the electorate turned out to vote, the same proportion that voted in 1989, and 2 percentage points ahead of the turnout in 1984. The Liberal Democrats appeared to have suffered from candidates standing for the continuing Liberal party - composed of members who refused to join the merger with the Social democrats. 'Other' candidates were taking around 11 per cent overall. The Green and UK Independence parties seemed unlikely to win any seats, but the parties' candidates came close in several seats to winning the 5 per cent of the vote necessary to save their deposits.</p>

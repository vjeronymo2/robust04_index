			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE PROJECTED TO LEAD IN JOBS GROWTH TO 2001  </P> <P> One out of every six jobs created through the year 2000 will be located in  California, according to a forecast published today by the Commerce Department.  </P> <P> California also will retain its rank as the most populous state, the projection  by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said, and will continue to have  the highest total personal income.  </P> <P> California is projected to gain 3.4 million of the 18.9 million new jobs  created nationally between 1988 and 2000. Its population will total 33.2  million.  </P> <P> California and three other states -- Florida, New York and Texas -- are  projected to account for one-third of the nation's $4.1 trillion total personal  income.  </P> <P> Personal income in California will be the highest in the nation at $568  billion. Incomes will total $330 billion in New York, $250 billion in Texas and  $226 billion in Florida.  </P> <P> But Arizona and Nevada will post the fastest growth rates in total personal  income, jobs and population, while Connecticut will continue to have the  highest per capita income at $20,503.  </P> <P> Total personal income is projected to grow 46.2% in Nevada, well above the  projected national income increase of 26.2%. Arizona income will increase by  40.6%.  </P> <P> The number of jobs will increase 31.5% in Nevada and 26.7% in Arizona, compared  to 14.3% nationally.  </P> <P> Population in Nevada will jump 29.8%, followed by Arizona and Florida, 21.4%  and 18.2% respectively. The national population is expected to grow 8.9%.  </P> <P> "The projected growth in Nevada and Arizona reflects rapid population growth  and strength in their economies, in part due to the continued shift in economic  activity toward the Sun Belt," the study said. "Florida, Utah, California and  Hawaii also are projected to show rapid growth."  </P> <P> Populations will increase in every state except Wyoming, Louisiana and West  Virginia, which will post declines of 1%, 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.  </P> <P> New England and BEA's Mideast region -- Delaware, Washington, D.C., Maryland,  New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania -- will have the lowest total personal  income growth, 21.6% and 21.3%, respectively, followed by the Great Lakes, with  22%.  </P> <P> According to the BEA, two-thirds of the states are projected to have per capita  incomes below the national average, and 11 states -- predominantly in the South  -- are projected to have per capita incomes that are 20% or more below the  national average.  </P></p>

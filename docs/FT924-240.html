			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / The FT Interview: Very image of an architect - Jean Nouvel, designer of La Tour Sans Fins in Paris, talks to Alice Rawsthorn If central casting was asked to rustle up an actor to play the role of a contemporary architect, no self-respecting movie mogul could complain if the chosen candidate looked like Jean Nouvel. Nouvel does, after all, have all the requisite accessories. He is invariably dressed in black, with close-cropped hair and a nice line in techno-toys, like the deep sea diver-style watch wrapped around his wrist. At 47, he has already made his name in architectural circles through his uncompromisingly modernist designs, such as the Arab cultural centre in Paris, now marked by an exhibition of his work at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. But his biggest and, possibly, his best building has yet to come. Early next year the builders will arrive at a plot of land beside the futuristic Grande Arche at the La Defense business district in western Paris, to start work on Nouvel's La Tour Sans Fins, the Tower of Infinity. This is the building that seems set to propel Jean Nouvel into the tiny band of contemporary architects, such as Richard Rogers and I M Pei, whose names are known beyond the cloistered world of architecture. It should also place him in the forefront of the new wave of modernists redefining architectural thinking in the 1990s. La Tour Sans Fins, at 1,400ft (425m), will be the tallest tower in Paris, easily dwarfing the Eiffel Tower's 984ft. It will be built in glass - black at the bottom, but gradually becoming paler until it is completely clear at the top. 'It's one of the projects where I've been given most freedom,' says Nouvel. 'It's an office block, a serious building, and the design reflects that, but it's also fun. I want people to enjoy it.' The sci-fi style and scale of La Tour Sans Fins seem set to cause as much controversy as other modern Paris monuments, notably the Pompidou arts centre, the building that brought Rogers into the limelight, and Pei's glacial glass pyramid in the Louvre museum. Nouvel sees his tower as 'a metaphysical object' and an exercise in 'urban poetry'. One of the judges of the architectural competition that chose it was more prosaic. He described Nouvel's design as 'a pure object of capitalism'. If Nouvel cares about such quips, he is far too shrewd to show it. La Tour Sans Fins is typical of his style. It is a witty building, which twists the traditional tenets of 1920s modernism - the geometric lines and emphasis on function - into new forms for today. 'I'm a true modernist, a man of my time,' he says. 'The role of the architect is to reflect the age they live in.' Jean Nouvel looks like his buildings, thoroughly modern and larger than life. He is a big, burly man with a diabolic face, who punctuates his conversation with rumbustious chuckles. He works from a rambling open-plan studio in an old warehouse in the dowdy 11th arrondissement of Paris. He moved there a few years ago when he outgrew his old studio on Rue Beaubourg opposite the Pompidou centre. The Beaubourg studio is now his home. 'It's pretty basic,' he says. 'I spend 12 or 14 hours a day designing buildings, so I don't want to do that in my spare time. Lots of architects dream about building their own homes. Not me.' He was born, the son of teachers, at Fumel in the Lot valley in southern France. He ended his education at the prestigious Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris where he began by studying painting, but soon switched to architecture. 'At the time I didn't have any money, so architecture seemed like a better bet,' he recalls. 'I always planned to go back to painting but after two years of architecture I was hooked.' Nouvel quickly became a notorious figure in French architectural circles, initially because of the unusual vehemence of his attacks on other people's work. His vitriolic views, coupled with a penchant for publicity (he recently featured in a Swiss Air advertising campaign), have saddled him with a reputation for megalomania. He was one of the most vociferous opponents of the Forum des Halles development in Paris during the late 1970s, when the old fruit and vegetable market was pulled down to make way for a shopping centre - 'the indescribable architectural catastrophe'. He then emerged as a critic of post-modernism, the trend for reinterpreting historical images that dominated in the 1980s, producing buildings such as Robert Venturi's National Gallery extension in London. But he has been equally critical of the bastions of early modernism such as Le Corbusier - 'he was a genius, but he also wrote some really stupid things' - and of contemporary architects who continue to copy them. 'I don't want to perpetuate the legacy of the architecture of another age,' he says. 'Just because something was modern 50 years ago doesn't make it modern today.' The architects he does admire - Alvar Aalto, the Finnish modernist who emerged in the 1920s, Tado Ando, the grand old man of contemporary Japanese architecture, and Richard Rogers - all share his passion for reinterpreting modernist principles in his own way. 'They all have their own idiosyncratic styles,' he says. 'A building by Rogers just couldn't have been designed by anyone else.' Nouvel made his mark in the 1980s through the grands projets, the architectural schemes initiated by President Francois Mitterrand to celebrate the 1989 bicentennial of the French Revolution and to raise awareness of modern architecture. The grands projets, such as the Louvre pyramid and the new finance ministry, were accompanied by a reform of public sector building in France, which included introducing architectural competitions and encouraging local authorities to launch their own petits projets. Nouvel was lucky. He came to maturity as an architect at a time when an unprecedented number of major buildings were being commissioned in France, and there were relatively few French architects with enough experience to handle them. But luck was not enough. The architects for the grands projets were chosen by international competitions. Being in the right place (and of the right nationality) at the right time probably helped Nouvel to get on to the shortlists, but after that he was on his own. He lost the competitions for the finance ministry and national library, but won the commission for L'Institut du Monde Arabe, the Arab centre on the banks of the river Seine in Paris. The FFr500m (Pounds 61m) Arab centre combines all his favourite themes. It is a futuristic building made in modern materials, steel and glass. Nouvel broke it down into sections so that it looks different from each angle. He also indulged his love of technology in the computerised blinds, designed in traditional Arab patterns, which regulate the flow of light through the windows. The result is a building which is superficially stunning and becomes increasingly complex the closer you look. 'It's not enough just to make something that looks amazing, or to show how clever you can be with technology,' he says. 'The building must work as a whole.' L'Institut du Monde Arabe established Jean Nouvel in the international arena and garnered the Grand Prix d'Architecture, France's most prestigious architectural prize usually given for a lifetime's work. He now faces the challenge of developing his ideas in his new projects - the Opera house in Lyons, a factory for Cartier in Switzerland and La Tour Sans Fins. 'It's easy to get complacent and to become mediocre by doing the same thing again and again,' he says. 'You have to know exactly what you want and how to get there. But I'm lucky. I'm an optimist. I always look for the positive side in everything.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1945 Born at Fumel, Lot-et-Garonne. 1963 Attended Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. 1978 First major building, a medical centre, Bezons. 1985 Started Nemausus housing projects, Nimes. 1987 Arab cultural centre, Paris, won Grand Prix de l'Architecture. 1992 Completed design of La Tour Sans Fins.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUSH FOREIGN POLICY EMERGES MORE CLEARLY  </P> <P> While there have been loud lamentings in the United States that the Bush  Administration has been indecisive, such criticism has not been echoed here in  the crucial Middle East.  </P> <P> In its first 100 days the Administration, quietly but swiftly, brought about  changes in U.S. Middle East policy that are beginning to look like a U-turn.  Instead of automatic U.S. acquiescence with everything Israel says and does,  there are now a dozen issues on which the George Bush and Yitzhak Shamir  administrations openly differ. These are both long-term and strategic,  short-term and tactical.  </P> <P> For the United States, the status quo is unacceptable; the objective of the  peace process, which it strives to keep going, is a final, global settlement of  the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Shamir government, under pressure from the  continuing Palestinian intifada, or uprising, probably agrees that the current  situation is unacceptable but is not planning for anything more than an interim  settlement -- within a time-frame of five years, no more.  </P> <P> The United States says that the underlying principle for the final settlement  must be "land for peace," which Shamir rejects. He argues that Israel has  already handed back all the occupied Arab territory demanded in U.N.  resolutions 242 and 338. Bush disagrees: The provisions in 242 and 338 for  Israeli withdrawal have not been fulfilled and his Administration "will hold  the parties, as best the U.S. can, to a full implementation of the resolutions  . . . the territory (Sinai) that has been ceded for peace (with Egypt) is not  the end." Sooner or later, according to Washington, Israel must vacate the  occupied territories.  </P> <P> Therefore, Washington insists, there must not be any further Israeli annexation  of occupied Arab territory nor any extension of Israeli sovereignty over it. In  flat contradiction to this position, Shamir, who strives for Greater Israel,  has said repeatedly and openly that Israel will never withdraw, not even an  inch, from what the Israelis refer to as the biblical lands of Judea and  Samaria.  </P> <P> The objective of the peace process is variously interpreted by the three  parties now involved. The Palestine Liberation Organization demands the right  to self-determination according to its "legitimate national rights," leading,  ineluctably, to an independent Palestinian state -- already proclaimed, and  recognized by more than 35 governments. That independent state could and should  have a linkage with Jordan.  </P> <P> The United States and Israel are agreed in not wanting any such state, but  beyond that they part company. The United States concedes "Palestinian  political rights," which could lead to some sort of Palestinian authority or  entity on the West Bank in federation with Jordan. Shamir is not prepared to  think of anything more than local self-government -- municipal autonomy. The  Palestinians insist that their state must control the land and water resources  of its territory. Israel, by contrast, says that the land has been promised to  it for use in perpetuity.  </P> <P> The single most emotional territorial issue is the control of Jerusalem,  specifically Arab East Jerusalem, where the Holy Places are situated. Israel  claims that in 1967 East Jerusalem became, forever, the reunited capital of the  Jewish state. Washington has never officially recognized that claim, a current  point of difference.  </P> <P> In a strategic sense, the Bush and Shamir governments differ on the basic  nature of the Palestinian struggle. Shamir condemns the intifada and any armed  attack on Israel from outside as "terrorism." Even former Secretary of State  George P. Shultz, a devoted friend of Israel, said that the intifada was not  terrorism; so does Secretary of State James A. Baker III. The State Department  further says that attacks from outside Israel on military targets are unhelpful  but not terroristic in nature.  </P> <P> There was a split between the United States and Israel on tactics and  modalities of the peace process even under the Reagan Administration which  began direct, if low-level, talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization in  the teeth of fierce opposition from Israel. In the last three months, Israel  has tried unsuccessfully to badger Washington into breaking off these talks,  but the U.S.-PLO contacts in Tunis continue and have, in effect, become an  indirect dialogue between Israel and the PLO.  </P> <P> Washington has cautiously come round to saying that, if carefully structured,  an international conference could be useful in helping to bring about a Middle  East peace settlement; Shamir is adamantly opposed to any such international  "interference."  </P> <P> Most of the numerous short-term, tactical differences between the Bush and  Shamir administrations spring from the Israeli leader's offer of "free and  democratic elections" in the occupied territories. Until a couple of months  ago, Shamir opposed elections.  </P> <P> Shamir insists that violence, the intifada, must stop before the elections can  be held; Baker has said this need not be necessary, though a diminution of  violence would be helpful.  </P> <P> On the issue of supervising the elections and providing for security, the  United States has suggested a partial, temporary concentration of the Israeli  army in locations away from the main centers of Arab population, along with the  participation of foreign observers, as in the Philippines elections. Shamir has  said that he cannot accept any change in the disposition of the army before the  elections, nor any foreign overseeing of the process.  </P> <P> Last month Washington sent two pointed questions about the elections to the  Shamir government. Would the Arab citizens of Jerusalem participate in the  elections, and would the elections be considered elections at the municipal or  at the national level? These questions had to be posed and answered because of  differences between the United States and Israel. For Washington, Jerusalem  remains occupied territory and therefore should participate in the electoral  process. For Israel this is heresy.  </P> <P> Further, since the United States sees the elections as only the first step  toward a global settlement, the voting should be national, not municipal in  scope. For Israel the opposite is the case -- elections must be municipal  because the context is an interim arrangement.  </P> <P> Middle East observers, pleasantly surprised and cautiously pleased at the new  U.S. positions, are trying to understand why the Bush Administration, in so  short a time, should have overhauled its policy. The reason is that it has now  become "safe" to do so, since Israel itself and the powerful pro-Israeli lobby  in Washington are divided.  </P> <P> Two events have produced the divisions. One is the intifada and the brutal  methods used to suppress it, as seen nightly on television. The other is the  controversy over the "who is a Jew" issue, which the ultra-orthodox in Israel  have been trying to push to a conclusion. These splits have given Washington  the opportunity to work out a truly national policy, and that opportunity has  been seized.  </P></p>

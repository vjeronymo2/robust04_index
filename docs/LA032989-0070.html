			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A South Korean dissident's unauthorized visit to North Korea turned more  controversial with word that he met North Korean President Kim Il Sung and  discussed reunification of the two Koreas. North Korean news reports said the  Rev. Moon Ik Hwan, 71, and three others traveling with him attended a luncheon  given by President Kim. Moon, a Presbyterian minister who has been jailed  often, is a leading figure in South Korea's dissident movement. Officials in  Seoul said he will be prosecuted for aiding the north, and his visit fueled  demands from hard-liners for a crackdown on dissident groups.  </P></p>

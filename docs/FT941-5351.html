			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke goes back to casinos after 14 years Increased demand for gambling has prompted Ladbroke, the hotels, betting and home improvement group, to consider relaunching its casino business for the first time in more than 14 years. The company, which last week reported a 21 per cent fall in pre-exceptional profits to Pounds 117.5m, hinted yesterday that it was keen to exploit the success of the gaming industry, particularly in the US where it earns more than Dollars 10bn a year. Plans to revive the division would mark Ladbroke's first return to casino operations in Britain since 1979, when it was ordered to surrender three licences following legal action about the way it tried to win business from rival companies. 'We are looking at expanding our interests in gaming around the world, and that includes the UK,' the company said. A return to casino operations is expected to begin in the US where Ladbroke has been awarded gaming licences in four states: California, Texas, Pennsylvania and Michigan. 'The US is the biggest growth market, and we'd like to see significant growth out of casino and gaming operations there,' the company added. The proposals are thought to have been encouraged by Mr Peter George, Ladbroke's recently-promoted chief executive, and Mr Mike Smith, the former head of bookmaking at William Hill - who is joining the group shortly as head of gaming operations. Mr George, a former managing director of the company's racing operations, is said to have sanctioned the move following his appointment in January and the retirement of Ladbroke founder Mr Cyril Stein. The company's renewed interest in casinos has emerged within days of it admitting that trading conditions at its Hilton International hotels subsidiary remained difficult and that product cutbacks were necessary at Texas Homecare, the DIY chain.</p>

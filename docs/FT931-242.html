			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Company fleet tax regime welcomed NEW company car taxation rules to be introduced in April next year, based on a percentage of car list prices, were welcomed as more fair than the present system by two thirds of companies questioned at last week's Company Car Business Show. Even the Budget's 8 per cent increase in road tax charges - well in excess of inflation - was regarded as 'realistic' by 41 per cent of the respondents, undertaken by the car leasing subsidiary of BRS, the fleet-management group. The main criticism of the new system was its retention of the present system of business mileage bands under which high business mileage drivers pay substantially less tax on their company car benefit than drivers for whom their car is mainly a perk. More than three quarters of the 76 companies questioned said that would encourage drivers to continue running up unnecessary business mileage to achieve the lower tax thresholds. Fifty nine per cent of companies said they felt the new system would lead to more employees opting for a cash alternative to their company cars. Management, Page 17</p>

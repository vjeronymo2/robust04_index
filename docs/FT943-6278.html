			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Comalco profits tumble to ADollars 26m at midway Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer controlled by CRA, unveiled after-tax profits of ADollars 26.9m (USDollars 20m) for the half-year to end-June, sharply reduced from the ADollars 42.8m in the same period of 1993, writes Nikki Tait. The figures, calculated on the statutory basis (rather than on a joint-venture basis which includes Comalco's equity in the results of consortium companies) contained no abnormal items for 1994, but a ADollars 11.4m charge the previous year. Revenues were ADollars 1.13bn, compared with ADollars 1.14bn. The company said gains in prices had been partly offset by a less favourable USDollars /ADollars exchange rate, and its smelting business operated at a loss in the first half. 'However, at present metal prices this business could return to modest profitability', it added. Comalco said the metal market remained 'fragile'and LME stocks were still at high levels. 'Overhanging the market is a substantial amount of unused smelting capacity. However, in the important Japanese and European markets, the economic outlook is brightening and metal consumption is expected to increase,' it said.</p>

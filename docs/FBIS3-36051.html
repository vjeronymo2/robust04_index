			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature:] </F>   [Text] [Tajikistan's] Prime Minister Abduljalil Samadov  says attempts to try to maintain the command system of economic  management are hopeless.    In a published appeal to the people, Samadov said that all  official talks were now focused on mutual sales and payments but  not on former obligatory sale to the state. He says the  existing realities place the need for program correctives and  the arrangement of normal market relations in domestic and  foreign trade.    Samadov called on Tajik citizens to come up with coherent  proposals on how to improve the functioning of economic  mechanisms and effectively utilize the country's natural and  human resources. He hopes that the system of accounting for as  diversity of views will work on a permanent basis rather than  being a short-lived time campaign. [sentence as received]    Many say the Prime Minister's call is intended to arrange  close cooperation between the government and private sector in  the effort to embrace economic reforms.</p>

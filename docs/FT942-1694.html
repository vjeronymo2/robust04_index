			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / 'Bias' in Labour authority slammed Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate in the Monklands East by-election caused by the death of John Smith, said yesterday she would fight to rectify bias in the allocation of spending by the district council. She confronted the most explosive issue of the campaign for Labour - the long-standing allegation that Labour-controlled Monklands district council favours the town of Coatbridge at the expense of next-door Airdrie in its capital spending. Airdrie is at the centre of Monklands East constituency, near Glasgow, where polling takes place next Thursday. The issue, sometimes known as Monklandsgate, has been simmering since 1992. Newspapers and dissident Labour councillors allege that a clique on the council favours predominantly Roman Catholic Coatbridge over Protestant Airdrie. It is also alleged that over several years a dominant group of Labour councillors, who are mainly Catholic, allocated 40 council jobs to their relatives. Mrs Liddell, having initially tried to stay aloof from the issue, wrote to the council on Tuesday asking for a breakdown of capital spending between Coatbridge and Airdrie, which are of similar size. After receiving the figures she said they proved that spending on major projects was concentrated on Coatbridge. She said: 'I'm determined to make sure that Airdrie, the outlying villages and the Coatbridge parts of the constituency are receiving their fair share of spending.' Mrs Kay Ullrich, the Scottish National party candidate, said the electorate would not be duped by Mrs Liddell's 'amazing conversion'. Mrs Susan Bell, the Conservative candidate, said Mrs Liddell's words vindicated what the Tories had been saying.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Katsuhiro Kuroda] </F>   [Text] Seoul, 18 Jun -- On 18 June, a ROK Government  source disclosed that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and President  Kim Yong-sam are scheduled to hold Japan-ROK summit talks from 2  to 3 July at Cheju Island, a resort in southern Korea.    This will be the first Japan-ROK summit talks since  President  Kim's visit to Japan last March. However, it will be the first  such talks held in the ROK since the last talks were held in  Kyongju between former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Kim Yong-sam last November.    Cheju Island has been designated as the site for talks  because diplomatic authorities from the two countries expect  that in promoting Japan-ROK summit diplomacy, it will be  desirable to follow the Western style -- holding frequent  meetings in an informal atmosphere. The last talks held in  Japan were between [former Prime Minister] Kiichi Miyazawa and  [former ROK President) No Tae-u in Kyoto, in November 1992.    The upcoming summit talks will be held over the weekend.  With the Naples summit scheduled for 8 July, Japan intends to  exchange views with the ROK on such issues as the North Korean  nuclear program and the Korean peninsula situation.</p>

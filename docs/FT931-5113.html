			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE HEADLINE pre-tax profits from BTR, the industrial conglomerate, should have increased from Pounds 917m in 1991 to comfortably exceed Pounds 1bn last year, although about Pounds 50m will come from profits on disposals. Analysts at Thursday's meeting will be interested in what benefits have come from the integration of Hawker Siddeley, taken over for Pounds 1.55bn at the end of 1991, and current trading conditions in the US. BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is expected to report annual pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1.55bn, up from Pounds 1.05bn, on Wednesday. Interest will centre on whether recent strong growth in cigarette sales can be maintained, and how Eagle Star is recovering from the heavy losses it has incurred on mortgage indemnity policies. Full year results from RTZ, the world's largest mining company, due on Thursday were foreshadowed last month when the group said there would be an exceptional charge of Pounds 52m, compared to a Pounds 74m charge in 1991. RTZ plans to adopt FRS 3. Net income, the line RTZ prefers to focus on, is expected to rise from Pounds 308m to around Pounds 330m, after interim net income was up from Pounds 154m to Pounds 158m. A maintained final is likely. On Wednesday, Cadbury Schweppes is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 325m for the full year, up from Pounds 316.4m last time. Trading profits in Britain and the US are thought to have finished the year on a strong note. TI, the specialist engineering group, is expected to produce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 109m, up from Pounds 105.2m, and earings of 18p, when it reports results for 1992 on Thursday. The company has underperformed since its acquisition last year of Dowty, which has suffered from the sharp deterioration in sentiment in the aerospace industry. Both GKN and T&amp;N, the motor components groups, saw profits bounce back in the first half of last year as they reaped the benefits of cost-cutting and overseas investment. While full-year increases - to be announced on Wednesday - are expected to top 30 per cent in both cases, questions will be raised about the state of the German car market and other parts of the continent. As a counterweight, the news should be good on US demand. GKN is expected to report Pounds 125m, compared with Pounds 95m, while the consensus for T&amp;N is Pounds 65m, against Pounds 49m. The former's dividend should be roughly covered, but T&amp;N's will not be yet again. The betting is that T&amp;N will nevertheless hold the payment.

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Property is still the problem for Japanese banks - The continuing trouble with bad debts WHEN Japanese banks established the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company to clear the industry's problem loans, they housed it in a half-empty Tokyo office building. It was an apt reminder of the property market collapse that is blamed for the banks' woes. Almost a year later, the CCPC is still occupying one floor in a half-empty building, and the banks' non-performing loans continue to increase. The collapse this week of Muramoto Construction, a provincial contractor, has added to the total; its outstanding debt is estimated at a record Y590bn (Dollars 5.45bn). The aim of the CCPC, established in January, was to buy the banks' non-performing loans and oversee the sale of property collateral, enabling them to write off the resulting losses. The banks hoped its valuations would put a floor under property prices, which have fallen by as much as 70 per cent over the past three years. But the Muramoto collapse, which will leave deep scars at a few regional banks, raises doubts over the CCPC's ability to assist those most in need. One problem is that the CCPC buys bad loans with money injected by the bank selling the loan, which means that weaker banks cannot afford to confront their portfolios. Mr Akira Miyagawa, managing director of the CCPC, said public concerns about the heath of the banking system have eased over the past year. 'We had as our objective a vehicle to handle the problem stage by stage, and I think we are doing that,' he said. However, the unexpected Muramoto failure has rekindled concerns. Doubt remains over the extent of the damage caused by reckless lending during the late 1980s, when banks competed fiercely and pumped money into speculative property developments. At the end of March, Japan's 21 leading banks declared that they had non-performing loans of Y12,700bn, just over 3 per cent of total lending. That figure is thought to have risen to about Y14,000bn by the end of September. Actual exposure is widely estimated at Y30,000bn or more, if lending by affiliates is included, but even that figure does not measure the burden of loan repayments frozen by many troubled clients. The Muramoto case highlights the 'hidden' liabilities carried by many Japanese companies, some of which routinely exaggerated the value of their land collateral and provided loan guarantees not reported in accounts. Muramoto is said to have guaranteed loans worth Y150bn, leaving it more vulnerable than the banks had realised. Taking the official figure of non-performing loans, the CCPC has made little impression on the total. Until the end of October, loans with a face value of Y1,919bn had been purchased through the company for Y1,084bn - the price is calculated by a valuation panel which assesses the property collateral and other relevant assets. However, the company has been able to recover only Y4.43bn of the Y1,084bn, meaning that most banks are unable to find buyers for property collateral. At least the banks can claim the loss on their sale to the CCPC as a tax deduction; previously, they were virtually forced to wait until their client was declared bankrupt before tax authorities would accept the write-off. But the CCPC has not fulfilled its stated aim of stimulating the property market. Mr Miyagawa said the unexpected weakness of the economy, partly caused by the yen's sharp appreciation, has worked against a recovery in property prices - in all, 755 loans have been bought by the CCPC but property assets have been sold in only 19 cases. Nor are the banks helping the CCPC's cause. They have insisted on secrecy for more than half their sales, defeating the aim of providing information on property trends. And the pattern of sales, with a rush in the weeks just before the interim and annual book closing, works against the desired image of the CCPC presiding over an orderly resolution of problem loans. In the period from April to September, 510 loans were purchased by the company; 414 were bought in September, just before the close of the first half. In October, banks brought only 16 loans to the CCPC - suggesting that most institutions see it merely as a vehicle to speed write-offs for tax purposes. Japanese banks, which will announce their first-half profits later this month, are able to afford write-offs because of falling interest rates, which have created a favourable spread. The official discount rate is now at a record low of 1.75 per cent; without the good fortune of an interest rate fall, the CCPC would be under more pressure and the banks in greater pain. But the sudden failure of Muramoto Construction is a warning that Japanese banks' bad loan hangover from the late 1980s is far from over. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander of the Central Command decided to  extend the administrative detention of Kakh activists No'am  Federman and Ben-Tziyon Gubstein by another three months, our  correspondent Aviv Bushinsky has learned. The two were  scheduled to be released in two days, but the Hasharon prison  authorities received an order to remand them in custody. Our  correspondent has learned that both the detainees and the police  were surprised by the news, and the detainees intend to appeal  it.    The High Court of Justice rejected the appeal of Gil'on Ben-  Sa'id, a Qiryat Arba' settler and a major in the reserves, whose  weapon was confiscated after the massacre in Hebron. Our  correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that the judges ruled that  the commander of the Central Command's decision to confiscate  his weapon was appropriate and was based on reliable information  whereby Ben-Sa'id had previously been involved in violent  activities. Our correspondent points out that a restraining  order has been in effect against Ben-Sa'id banning him from the  boundaries of Hebron.</p>

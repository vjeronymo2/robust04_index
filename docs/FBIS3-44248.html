Ajello said the Mozambique National  Resistance has used more than 70 percent of its assembly areas,  while the government has used 30 to 35 percent. At its meeting  in Maputo on 27 January, the Supervision and Control Commission  recommended that the government speed up the confinement of its  troops and pledged the necessary logistical assistance to speed  up the process.    Minister Armando Guebuza said the government has not sent  sufficient troops to specific assembly areas because the latter  lack the technical capacity to accommodate people. He said  several areas face food problems, adding that a number of  technical units cannot register more than 50 people.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong dollar is the centre of attention AFTER the weekend devaluation in Ireland, a surge in the US dollar pushed up equities in dollar-sensitive countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and, selectively, Germany, while others like Italy and Spain got less of a boost, writes Our Markets Staff. However, Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, was not convinced that the bourses had their thinking mechanisms engaged. 'In the 1980s,' he said, 'industrial demand in Europe was good, and a rise in the dollar gave exports an added attraction; now, Europe is in recession and it is questionable whether the US recovery will be big enough to bail it out.' ZURICH was higher in moderately active trade as the strong dollar and lower Swiss interest rates led banks, insurers and chemicals higher. The SMI index gained 29.6 to 2,120.7, having peaked during the session at a high for the year of 2,132.6. UBS bearers added SFr13 to SFr917 while insurers took their lead from Swiss Re certificates, SFr11 higher at SFr553. Zurich Insurance bearers put on SFr10 to SFr2,230. Among dollar-sensitive issues, Roche certificates were SFr30 higher at SFr4,130 and Sandoz certificates added SFr60 to SFr3,160. Swissair rose SFr18 to SFr543 on further consideration of its co-operation talks with KLM. AMSTERDAM had another firm session, the CBS Tendency index rising 0.8 to 98.4. Royal Dutch led the gains, up Fl 1.90 to Fl 149.90, helped by the Opec output cuts. Philips shrugged off the postponement of its high definition television project to add 20 cents to Fl 23.70. The truckmaker, Daf, hit a new all-time closing low of Fl 4.55, down Fl 1.45 in active but small-lot retail trade, with investors worried at the lack of a long-term refinancing agreement. STOCKHOLM saw the Affarsvarlden General index rise 17.2 to 912.2 in turnover of SKr673m. Forestry companies were among the main beneficiaries, MoDo B adding SKr20 to SKr230 Astra A rose SFr15 to SKr701, supported by the dollar, renewed interest after upbeat analysts' reports and hopes for its annual results, due in three weeks. Electrolux B rose SKr11 to SKr228 ahead of its results this week. FRANKFURT ended off its highs with the DAX index up 13.31 at 1,585.16, but standard dollar-sensitive plays like the carmakers did better than that, with Daimler DM12.70 higher at DM584.50 and Volkswagen up DM6.20 at DM284.50. Both Daimler and VW have been distinctly out of favour with industry analysts this year, but since the end of 1992 they have risen by DM47.50, and DM41.50 respectively. Turnover rose from DM4.3bn to DM4.5bn. Equities were also supported by firmer German bond prices on revitalised hopes that key interest rates might be cut at Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. This speculation coincided with market talk that unions in Germany's public sector would agree to 1993 pay rises of below 4 per cent in negotiations with employers this week. PARIS focused on Paribas and the oil majors as the CAC 40 index rose 13.69 to 1,785.90 in relatively subdued turnover of FFr1.86bn. The banking group's shares, hit hard on Friday before the release of better than expected 1992 results, recovered FFr16.60 to FFr379.80. In oils, strong on higher oil prices, Elf Acquitaine put on FFr4.20 to FFr328.50 and Total, due to release its results a week today, rose by FFr5.90 tp 227.50. MILAN was clouded by the troubles plaguing Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's Socialist Party, and doubts about the prospects for any further Italian interest rate cut. The Comit index rose 0.49 to 487.40. Fiat fixed L70 higher at L4,410 and rallied to L4,500 after hours after managing director Mr Cesare Romiti was quoted as saying he expected a profit for 1993. Ready mixed concrete company Calcestruzzi, part of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group, dropped L460 to L7,690 after reports that its chairman was questioned by police about contributions to political parties. Gaic, which controls insurer La Fondaria, was L240 higher at L1,430 amid speculation over future control following the death at the weekend Mr Camillo De Benedetti. DUBLIN ignored reservations about the recent progress of the sterling/punt relationship, and reflected the weekend devaluation of the punt in an ISEQ overall index up by 76.47, or 6 per cent to 1,347.50. Sceptics were saying, however, that equities will begin to struggle again unless sterling shows signs of strengthening, or the punt leaves the ERM altogether.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 1                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open       10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1085.44     1085.46     1085.51    1085.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1159.62     1158.45     1159.62    1156.19  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00       14.00       15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1086.47     1086.53     1088.18    1088.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1157.94     1158.16     1159.04    1158.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 29    Jan 28    Jan 27    Jan 26    Jan 25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1079.18   1072.70   1072.28   1084.24   1077.68 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1148.15   1148.06   1147.45   1156.52   1146.87  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1089.16; 200 - 1164.09 Low/day: 100 - 1084.23  200 - 1152.77.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

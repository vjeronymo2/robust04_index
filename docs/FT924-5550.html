			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Boothroyd named Parlimentarian of the Year MISS Betty Boothroyd, first woman speaker of the House of Commons, was named Parliamentarian of the Year in the awards sponsored by The Spectator and Highland Park whisky. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Tory MP for Batley and Spen, a doughty opponent of the pit closures, was named Campaigner of the Year. Judges at the awards lunch in London praised Miss Boothroyd as 'the right man for the job' for the way she had imposed her authority on sometimes rowdy MPs in less than a year in office. Mr Michael Forsyth, chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, was named the Member to Watch. A double-edged Special Award was made to Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, but tensions were apparent as he received the award from Mr Kenneth Baker, former Tory chairman.

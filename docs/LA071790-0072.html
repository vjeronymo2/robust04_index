			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT HELD IN HOLDUP OF CABBIE  </P> <P> Police have arrested a man who they believe attacked and robbed a cabdriver  Friday night, but the person who killed another cabdriver Saturday night is  still at large, a police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police arrested Lester McGibbon, 33, of Plattsburg, N.Y., in  connection with the armed robbery of a Yellow Cab Co. driver Saturday morning,  San Diego Police Department spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> Police found McGibbon lying injured near a Yellow Cab at the intersection of  Brannick Avenue and Hammel Street in Los Angeles about 9:30 a.m. Saturday,  Robinson said.  </P> <P> McGibbon told police that he had been beaten and robbed by several people  carrying clubs and sticks, and he was taken to a local hospital, Robinson said.  </P> <P> "The doctor there said that his femur was fractured because he had been shot in  the leg," Robinson said.  </P> <P> In the incident Friday night, driver William Joseph Tufford struggled with a  gun-wielding attacker before the man stole his cab and escaped. McGibbon may  have shot himself during that struggle, Robinson said.  </P> <P> A license plate check on the cab found in Los Angeles showed that it had been  stolen from San Diego, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Police are still looking for a suspect in the murder of Leonard Brumlow,  another Yellow Cab driver who was shot and killed Saturday night.  </P> <P> McGibbon was in police custody at the time of Brumlow's death, Robinson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST  </P> <P> For a team that seemed to have all the answers, UC Irvine staggered out of  Thursday night's loss to Cal State Long Beach with a lot of questions.  </P> <P> The Anteaters (11-13, 8-7 in the Big West) had just one day to regroup. They  will play New Mexico State (17-8, 10-5) at 5 p.m. today at the Bren Center.  </P> <P> New Mexico State dominated Irvine in the teams' first meeting, 90-69. The  Aggies' front line of Johnny Roberson, Willie Joseph and center James Anderson  made a combined 23 of 37 shots and scored 54 points in that game. JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

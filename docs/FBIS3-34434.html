The Majles held an open session with Hojjat ol-Eslam  Nateq-Nuri presiding, and the deputies of the Zoroastrian  minority, Ardabil, Taft, Ahvaz, and Qom made speeches. Then the  Majles went into session. We call to your attention the detailed  discussions.  <H5>  Parviz Ravani, Deputy of the Zoroastrian Minority </H5> <H3>  I Condemn the Publication of Incorrect News Regarding the  Observance of the Rights of Religious Minorities in Iran </H3>   The first pre-agenda speaker of yesterday's session of the  Majles was Ravani, the deputy of the Zoroastrians, who offered  his condolences on the death of Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani and  said: We Zoroastrians during our prayers stand towards the  light, that is, the light is our Kaaba. But we also have another  light, which is the light of science and knowledge. Referring to  the establishment of more than 30 schools by Zoroastrians in the  country, addressing the minister of education, he said: These  schools, which one day were the banner carriers of fighting  illiteracy, are about to lose their true efficiency. In my  recent visit to Yazd, I realized that some of these schools that  are endowed in the villages are engaged in noneducational  matters. Referring to the Zoroastrian schools in Tehran, Ravani  said: Despite the fact that Zoroastrians have numerous buildings  for elementary and high schools, they still do not have a middle  school for girls. Certainly, the education officials will help  in establishing this educational institution next year.  Requesting that the mayor of Tehran pay attention to Zoroastrian  religious places, some of which are in the green areas, he  pointed out: The history of Iran in the past 100 years,  especially since the Constitutional revolution, shows to what  extent spreading rumors and creating skepticism has worked and  does not allow the creation of an atmosphere of understanding  for necessary government decisions. If history shows a picture  of how Amir Kabir was the victim of injustice in the face of all  domestic and foreign conspiracies, which indicates the plans  that have always put pressure on our political figures, we would  not have made an exaggerated remark. Today, under conditions  much harsher than that period, the administration of the country  is faced with similar conspiracies. The present approach is to  avoid the scrutiny that can be seen in action and superficial  reactions and finding fault. We must follow the recommendations  of the grand leader and in our judgment and expression of  opinion respect all the strata of the nation. We must accept the  fact that in all cases, the implementation of great projects can  only be achieved through the perseverance and courage of the  faithful and self-sacrificing implementors, and is coupled with  intentional or unintentional shortcomings.    He added: We must never judge on the basis of the standards  of those who are always standing outside and awaiting an  opportunity for their own personal interests. What is noteworthy  and praiseworthy during this period is the prescription of the  Constitution and attention by the officials of the regime to  preserving national unity and the hopefulness of people of  different religions in the preservation of their basic rights in  their place of birth, Iran.    Stating that we must protect the manifestations of our  national culture, literature, and language, he said: In  conclusion, I condemn the publication of incorrect news  concerning the observance of the rights of the religious  minorities in Iran and ask God for the prosperity and glory of  the Iranian nation and the success and victory of the officials  of the regime of the Islamic Republic.  <H5>  'Ali Mohammad Gharibani, Deputy From Ardabil </H5> <H3>  One of the Effective Factors in the Fight Against Cultural  Invasion Is the Fight Against Poverty </H3>   The next speaker was 'Ali Mohammad Gharibani, from Ardabil,  who offered his condolences on the death of the revered Shi'ite  source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and said:  [passages omitted on world arrogance and anti-American rhetoric]    In continuation, he asked the speaker of the Majles, because  the content of the letters of Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani in connection  with relations with the United States has been reported widely  in the newspapers and on the radio, in order to clarify it for  the honorable colleagues and the noble people of Iran, to grant  permission to use the legal authority in the bylaws to state his  explanations concerning this matter. The deputy from Ardabil  considered one of the effective steps in fighting cultural  invasion to be fighting poverty and said: This will not be  possible except through adequate economic planning and decisive  dealing with hoarders and economic terrorists, those who in  coordination with the West and taking advantage of the chaos in  the market and accumulating large wealth want to bring about  poverty and misery, and facilitate the spread of deviation  resulting from poverty and destitution throughout the country,  and allow financial corruption and bribery once again to become  widespread. We all know that one of the most important  consequences of the victory of the Islamic revolution was the  elimination of usury and decisive dealing with the belligerent  against God. In this connection, a number of judges were  assigned by the Imam to put usurers on trial and investigate  their corruption. But now, unfortunately, we witness the  mushroom-like growth of usurers in various parts of our Islamic  country. He added: One of the important factors in the  reappearance of this ugly and ignoble phenomenon is the  imposition of economic policies without any control and lowering  the value of the national currency and making it dependent on  the dollar.    The other part of my speech is addressed to that group, some  of whom are said not to have severed ties to the organization  that was hated by the Imam and to not have repented and who are  the cause of all the economic and social misfortunes. In  connection with one of them, the Imam, addressing one of the  high-ranking officials of the country, wrote: Be careful lest  suddenly you realize that the Hojjatiyeh Society members have  destroyed all you have. Considering these statements, the  officials of the regime, God willing, will not allow the key  positions to fall to these sorts of people and not allow them to  infiltrate the important national organizations.    Gharibani then referred to some of the characteristics of  this group and said: On 28/05/1360 [19 August 1981], on the  order of the Imam, in a session in the presence of the  representative of his honor and the representatives of  revolutionary institutions and members of the Central Council of  the Hojjatiyyeh Society, a meeting was held and discussions  continued for several hours. The leaders of the Hojjatiyyeh  Society, in defending the ceremonies and trying to prove  themselves to be revolutionary, made certain statements, and in  rejecting their statements, one of those who had repented said:  In the course of the Islamic studies lessons that the society  teaches to its members, such as theology, etc., nothing has been  said about a God who fights injustice and corruption. This is an  ideological deviation by the society. He continues that he  himself has heard the opposition of so and so, that is, the  leader of the Hojjatiyyeh, to religious guardianship. When you  say that he accepts religious guardianship it is a pure lie. He  then states: Another issue is the categorization of individuals  as political and religious figures. The deviation of the Society  is this very separation of religion and politics. And the  relations of the Society with SAVAK were not bad, and the  seminar in Mashhad was carried out with SAVAK's permission.    He says: The leader of the Society, after being  disrespectful  towards the Imam, had such opinions about the revolution: "The  buzzing of the baby mosquito of the phantom"; "It is like  pounding the fist on an anvil"; "We cannot be rid of the rule of  the tyrant." And in justifying the shah, he said, "The shah is  more chaste than all the other kings."    He then continues: The first action by one of the leaders of  the Society after the victory of the revolution was to raid  SAVAK throughout the country to destroy the files of the  Society. After the victory of the revolution, when there were  many members of the Society, the leader of the Society said: The  Imam must become desperate enough to write me a letter for me to  place my forces at his disposal. Also, the tapes of the speeches  of the leader of the Society over 55 years are available.    He continued: By the way, why do the true forces of the  Islamic revolution and the values of the revolution gradually  leave the scene? Why should such revered persons, such as the  honorable wife of Martyr Raja'i, be forgotten and should we not  see them on the political scene? Gharibani referred to the many  shortages in the province of Ardabil and asked the president to  issue the necessary instructions in connection with conformity  to the ratifications of the government with the law and the  procedures for their implementation.    Mr. Speaker, after being elected speaker of the Majles, you  said that you would not change the employees of the Majles. You  said that some officials during the change will get on the bus,  I will not even go on a minibus. Apparently, the board of  directors, on the basis of these statements, chose a train and  not a bus or a minibus. After the speech of the deputy from  Ardabil, the speaker of the Majles said: We must make use of  Article 77 and say something.  <H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Taqi Mohassel-Hamadani, Deputy From Taft </H5> <H3>  One of the Grave Duties of the Majles and the Government Is  To Create a Safe Climate for Investment and Fundamental Work </H3>   Mohassel Hamadani was the third pre-agenda speaker of the  Majles yesterday. He offered his condolences on the occasion of  the spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, to the Imam  of the Age, the grand leader, and all the Muslims and expressed  hope that our seminaries continue to be the cradle to nurture  religious figures.    He continued: The First Five-Year Plan is about to end and  the Second Five-Year Plan is about to be devised and ratified.  It was expected that before the ratification of the Second Plan,  a full report on the quality and quantity of the implementations  of the First Plan would be given to the Majles and its weak and  strong points would be examined to make the necessary  precautions in the implementation of the Second Plan.    1) It seems that implementation of the economic  modifications  made the implementation of the Five-Year Plan face stagnation,  and the related results were not achieved. It is necessary to  specify the reasons and eliminate them. Perhaps this important  task is the duty of the Majles, which in not doing it will  commit a dangerous act of negligence.    2) The problems due to the modification in economic affairs  and the conspiratorial acts of the East and the West in reducing  the price of oil and the occurrence of unexpected events, such  as floods and earthquakes, require consideration for the  condition of the people, especially the vulnerable stratum of  the society. After determining the actual resources, except for  fundamental affairs and observing priorities, the Majles should  budget expenditures.    3) The action of the government in regards to purchasing  transfers [as published] of the shares of government companies  to the private sector is successful and beneficial. But this  action must be carried out properly and devoid of any misuse and  the supervision of the government can be effective in this  regard.    4) Attention of the Majles and the honorable Cabinet to  achieve administrative discipline is a necessary issue and has  first priority, and lack of attention to it will increase the  problems and anger the people. It is necessary to act as soon as  possible.    5) One of the problems of the country is the existence of  several prices for the necessary goods and public needs. It was  hoped that the Ministry of Economy and other honorable officials  would find a solution for this social problem, to which some of  the business people have been accustomed, but, unfortunately,  there is no sign of it.    6) One of the grave duties of the Majles, the government,  and  all the officials is to create a safe climate for investment in  commercial, industrial, and agricultural affairs and fundamental  work, for there is no other way to transfer the capital of  Iranians living abroad, which is not insignificant.    In conclusion, he made reminders to the Ministry of  Education  concerning the problem of elementary and middle school teachers  and asked the president to attend to the executive affairs and  planning for the cities and villages in his constituency.  <H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Reza Mavalizadeh, Deputy From Ahvaz </H5>   Mavalizadeh was the fourth pre-agenda speaker of the Majles  yesterday. He offered his condolences on the death of the  Shi'ite source of emulation of the world, Grand Ayatollah  Golpayegani, and said: Last week, the noble and  always-present-on-the-scene people in the blood-stained province  of Khuzestan were the hosts of a very dear guest, the loyal  friend of the late Imam and a trustee of the leader, Mr.  Nateq-Nuri, who truly is one of the valuable pillars of the  sacred Islamic regime. In his five-day visit to the province of  Khuzestan, he brought hope to the martyr-nurturing people of the  province.    Despite the intensity of the programs, the significant point  that the deputies of the province of Khuzestan in the Majles  observed during this visit was his pleasant attitude, patience,  humility, modesty, interest in the people, precision, care, and  proper moral behavior.    Continuating, while thanking the speaker of the Majles and  the accompanying delegation, he said: I request that the  honorable Cabinet help approve six of the villages of Ahvaz as  deprived areas, which have also been approved by the Office of  Deprived Regions.    He also made reminders to the Ministry of Education in  connection with the shortage of educational cadre and space and  the shortage of other educational aid in his constituency.  <H5>  Hoseyn Irani, Deputy From Qom </H5> <H3>  Sources of Emulation and Leadership Are Two Wings Flying  Together and a Single Hand </H3>   The last pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Mr.  Irani from Qom, who offered his condolences on the death of the  revered Shi'ite source of emulation and continued: [passages  omitted on Golpayegani's praises]    The presence of the people increased the responsibility of  the officials of the country lest we be negligent in serving the  resistant people and the untiring forces supporting the regime,  particularly the vulnerable stratum. It was once again the  covenant of the people with the leadership and source of  emulation and the fact that the source of emulation and  leadership are two wings flying together and a single hand. This  vast movement was a response to those unaware people who look to  the West with awe, who consider the religious source of  emulation and religious jurisprudential management incapable and  question it, and who consider Western rule and compromise with  the Great Satan and criminal United States the solution. It was  also a deadly response to global oppressors and deceptive  international assemblies who everyday threaten great Iran with a  new accusation or warn with the old weapon of the violation of  human rights. They must know that if they want to stand against  the ideology and the country of this brave nation, we shall  stand with all of our power against their empty and hollow  world, as they learned about the sacred defense and numerous  conspiracies.    In conclusion, he also added: Has the time not come to  attend  to the needs of Qom, which has been left out, and eliminate the  administrative and resource shortcomings of this city?  <H5>  Ratifications </H5>   The first item on the agenda of the open session of the  Majles yesterday was a report on the second round of discussions  of the Health Committee concerning the bill on calculating the  service of medical students (interns), which according to the  related ratifications have served in the war-stricken regions as  a part of their outside-the-capital service or the service of  physicians and paramedics, for which the single article and the  note were ratified.    Single article. The period of service of that group of  medical students (interns) who, based on the ratifications  related to the time of the imposed war, have served in the  war-stricken regions, provided that period has not been  calculated as a part of their military service and internship,  may be calculated at the same ratio as part of their service  outside the capital or the law of the service of physicians and  paramedics (as the case may be), and the above-mentioned period  shall not be deducted from the rural emergency period of those  subject to this law.    Note. The implemental bylaws of this law shall be prepared  by  the Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education.    The second item on the agenda was a report on the first  round  of discussions by the Commerce Committee regarding the proposal  to amend certain articles of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries  and Mines of the Islamic Republic of Iran, ratified in 1369 [21  March 1990-20 March 1991], the general points of which were  ratified.    In this proposal, the establishment of the Chambers of  Commerce in cities with at least 50 members was announced as  permissible.    Efforts to establish export and import unions and production  syndicates in regards to mining, industry, commerce, and service  activities in accordance with the regulations are among other  instances that have been projected in this amendment proposal.    In the continuation of the open session of today,  examination  of the urgent proposal for the procedures of the examination by  the Majles of the annual budget and Five-Year Plan bills of the  country continued and received final ratification.    According to this ratification, parts of Articles 76 and  106-118 of the internal bylaws of the Majles were amended.    For ratifying the proposals related to the internal bylaws  of  the Majles, the vote of two-thirds of the deputies present in  the session is necessary.    According to one of the paragraphs of this ratification, for  discussions about the general points of the annual national  budget, 10 hours, including three and a half hours for opponents  and three and a half hours for supporters, one hour for the  spokesman of the committee, two hours for the representative of  the government, and 15 minutes for every speaker, have been  allocated.    The examination of the national budget bill and the  amendments and attachments shall take place in the committee.    Also, during the discussion of the first and second rounds  of  discussion of the budget bill in the Majles, the sessions must  be held continuously on all days of the week except Fridays and  official holidays for at least six hours per day.    Continuing this session, the examination of the proposal to  attach the National Library to the Ministry of Islamic Culture  and Guidance in the first round of discussions began and after  the speeches of a number of supporting and opposing deputies,  the continuation of the examination was postponed to the next  session.  <H5>  Deputies of Khuzestan Thank the Speaker of the Majles </H5>   The deputies of the cities of the province of Khuzestan in a  letter to the honorable speaker of the Majles thanked him as  follows for his visit to that province. [passages omitted on  words of appreciation]  <H5>  Five Days With the Warm People of Khuzestan </H5> <H5>  Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. Part I </H5>   It was decided that the speaker of the Majles would make a  five-day visit to Ahvaz to meet with the brave and untiring  people of Khuzestan and to open and visit the developmental  projects of the province and examine the process of the  reconstruction of Ahvaz. After the passage of one and a half  years in the Fourth Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri came to the province  of Khuzestan, a province that according to the Imam has "paid  its debt to Islam." In the course of the "eight years of sacred  defense," Khuzestan created glory and heroism in such a way that  the tongue and the pen fail to describe. Could anyone forget  "brave and heroic Khuzestan"? Is there anyone who does not know  "what Khuzestan did"?    In this meeting, first Engineer Moqimi, the governor-general  of the resistant and hard-working people, presented to him a  report about the conditions of the provinces and then several  officials reported on their work. Jadari, the concerned deputy  of Dasht-e Azadegan, said in this meeting: The resources of the  province of Khuzestan are known to everyone. One-third of the  water in the country is provided from this province. Such  resources exist in few provinces in the country. In the course  of the war, the resources of the province stopped, and lack of  development of the province during the war was quite apparent.    Also, the director general of the Construction Jihad of the  province of Khuzestan said: "The villages of the province five  years after the war have a desirable growth, so that from 3,863  villages throughout the province, 1,796 villages have  electricity and 1,350 villages have safe drinking water. But,  unfortunately, 35 percent of the people of these villages do not  have safe drinking water, and it is hoped that by the end of the  Second Plan it will reach 95 percent. [sentence as published]  Also, by the end of the Second Plan, all the villages will have  electricity."    When the speeches ended, the speaker of the Majles made a  speech and explained internal and external issues and the  problems and pressures that our country is facing.    After the session, Mr. Nateq-Nuri visited the implemental  operations of the Mirza Kuchek Khan industrial and agricultural  project, with the development of sugar cane and its secondary  industries. In this visit, the minister of agriculture and the  deputy ministers of that ministry were also present. For two  hours, the speaker of the Majles familiarized himself with the  work of this great project, which is an exemplary effort by the  government. This project has been implemented on 84,000 hectares  of barren and low-return land of Khuzestan and will produce  700,000 tons of sugar, 700,000 tons of animal feed, 350,000 tons  of paper pulp, 20,000 tons of animal husbandry protein, and  100,000 tons of semilight fiber. The cost of the implementation  of this project has been estimated at more than 400 billion  tomans. A noteworthy point of this project is that in 10 years  it will gain more than $1 billion in additional revenues.    Also, with the implementation of the above-mentioned  project,  the import of red meat and sugar will gradually stop, and 50,000  direct and indirect jobs will be created. It is noteworthy that  the operation of the project has been projected for 1376 [21  March 1997-20 March 1998]. Some of the plains of Khuzestan are  barren, low return, and nonarable. The implementation of these  projects will make the province prosper. This example of  fundamental work will certainly reach fruition in the  self-sufficiency of the country, given the fact that in the  future countries will face severe crisis in terms of food.</p>

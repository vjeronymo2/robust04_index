			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a new provocation yesterday by fanatic  Islamists against the Ecumenical Patriarchate at Fanari,  Istanbul, on the eve of the conquest of Constantinople. An  Islamic organization placed three powerful time-bomb devices,  which fortunately were discovered in time and dismantled. The  Greek Government reacted strongly through its spokesman.    Commenting on the placement of the three bombs at the  Ecumenical Patriarchate and Ankara's claims about the so-called  training of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members in Greece,  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said that the  Greek Government is following the continuing Turkish tension and  provocations with self-restraint. Especially on the latter  issue, Venizelos stressed that Turkey's claims are close to  being ridiculous, and called on the Turkish Government to stop  exporting, has he put it, its political problems and respect the  rules of Western civilization and international law.    New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert, who is touring  Pieria, said that he does not consider the planting of bombs at  the Ecumenical Patriarchate a serious issue, but described the  statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman that Greece  is training PKK members as suspicious.    Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras today said that  the Turkish Government has an obligation to take all necessary  measures for the protection of the Orthodox Ecumenical  Patriarchate at Fanari. The knowledge that the Orthodoxy's  unity is symbolized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate leads to  extremist statements, along with the Kurdish issue which is  dividing Turkey, Samaras stressed.</p>

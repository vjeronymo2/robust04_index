			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Surprise as Rudloff leaves chair at Credit Suisse First Boston MR Hans-Jorg Rudloff, the prominent investment banker who made Credit Suisse First Boston one of the most successful investment banks in London during the 1980s, is leaving the firm to take up a position on the executive board of CS Holding, its majority shareholder. He will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive officer by Mr David Mulford, the former under-secretary of the US Treasury, who joined the investment banking group last November following President Clinton's election victory. The move was greeted with surprise by other senior bankers, since Mr Rudloff, at 52, was expected to remain at the helm for some years. Mr Rudloff played down the move as 'a totally normal rotation' for a Swiss organisation. 'It was clear that this would happen, at some time,' he said. Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding, denied the move would involve Mr Rudloff losing direct involvement in the group's operations. 'He will not be outside the loop - on the contrary, he will be inside the loop. He will be working closely with me in formulating a five-year plan,' he said. He added that Mr Rudloff's appointment to oversee the group's future strategy indicated CS Holding's intention to 'pay more attention' to structural changes in the financial markets. However, there was speculation that the move resulted from long-standing strife between Mr Rudloff and senior executives at other parts of the group, although such rivalries were supposed to have been quashed by merging operations in 1988. 'For an investment banker who has flown at such altitude, its not a full-time job, it's an assignment,' said the head of one foreign bank's London operations. Mr Mulford, while confirming no change of strategy was planned for CSFB, said there was a need to 'maintain and strengthen' the global nature of the group. Mr Gut, 61, has until recently suggested he would like to stay in the chair until retirement at 68. But last month he indicated he could go sooner, if he felt the timing was right. As a German national, however, it would be difficult for Mr Rudloff to rise to the top of one of Switzerland's largest financial groups. Observer, Page 15</p>

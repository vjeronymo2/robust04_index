			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Oil write-down batters results at Elf Aquitaine ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil and gas group and one of the companies that will spearhead the government's privatisation campaign, yesterday announced a drop of almost 60 per cent in first-half profits. The fall follows a write-down of oil assets. Net profits fell to FFr1.4bn (Dollars 240.5m), against FFr3.3bn in the first half of 1992, after a FFr2.3bn write-down of oil assets. Total sales rose to FFr102.7bn from FFr98.9bn. However analysts said underlying profits had performed in line with expectations, with operating income falling 24 per cent to FFr3.69bn, excluding the write-down. Elf's shares slipped by FFr2.7 to FFr445.9. Elf said the decision to revalue its oil assets, principally in the North Sea, was 'a cautious response' to the prospects of continued weakness in the international oil price. It said the 'one-off' move would not affect its dividend policy, or future production volumes. Analysts said the write-down represented an attempt by Elf to clarify its prospects before the sale of all or part of the government's 50.8 per cent stake by early next year. The French government yesterday confirmed that the state was likely to retain a 'golden share' of between 10 and 15 per cent in Elf, which has a total estimated market value of more than FFr100bn. Like other companies at the top of France's privatisation list, Elf is experiencing difficult market conditions. Its core oil and gas exploration and production activities suffered a 22 per cent fall in operating profits, to FFr1.64bn, reflecting the fall in oil and gas prices. The group's chemicals and minerals division suffered from continued pressure on petrochemicals prices and reduced demand for fertilisers. Although specialty chemicals enjoyed strong sales, particularly in the US, operating profits for the whole division fell sharply to FFr176m from FFr1.3bn. The refining and marketing division was boosted by the acquisitions of Minol in eastern Germany and the African distribution network of British Petroleum. As a result, operating income rose 35 per cent to FFr782m. Elf Sanofi, the healthcare and pharmaceuticals arm, kept net profits at about FFr456m. Elf's stake in the unit was reduced from more than 60 per cent to 51 per cent following the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent, the cosmetics and luxury goods company.</p>

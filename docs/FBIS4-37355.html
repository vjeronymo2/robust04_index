			<p>BFN     [Text] Jericho, West Bank, June 20 (AFP) -- The Israeli  army denied passage for a few hours to senior Palestinian  official Nabil Sha'th at a checkpoint in the self-rule enclave  of Jericho on Monday [20 June].    Sha'th, who carries the portfolio of minister of  international cooperation in the new Palestinian Authority, was  let through later in the day after he contacted Amnon Shahaq,  Israel's deputy chief of staff.    "Someone irresponsible thought of stopping me," Sha'th told  reporters after meeting Palestinian security officials and  foreign diplomats at police headquarters here.    "This is totally unacceptable to Palestinians and to the  (Israeli-Palestinian) agreement.    "They have no right to stop us between Jericho and al-'Awja  or between Jericho and the West Bank. This is against the  agreement, how can they do that in peace time?"    Sha'th was stopped at a checkpoint on the edge of Jericho,  heading for the Arab village of al-'Awja, at the northern edge  of the Palestinian self-rule enclave. He returned to the town.    The main road between the checkpoint and al-'Awja is not  part  of the autonomous territory and crosses a Jewish settlement.  However, it is patrolled by joint Israeli and Palestinian  forces.    Sha'th echoed a complaint voiced by other Palestinian  officials that the Israeli army regularly bars entry to tourist  buses.    Around midday, Sha'th headed back from police HQ for  al-'Awja  and drove through the checkpoint in a convoy headed by an  Israeli security van, part of a joint force with two Palestinian  security vehicles.    At al-'Awja, the Israeli van pulled up outside the village  as  Sha'th went in to visit a youth center.</p>

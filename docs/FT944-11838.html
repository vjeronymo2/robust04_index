			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Business optimism declines World businessmen have become less optimistic about their sales and profits in the fourth quarter, despite the strength of the world economy, according to the latest survey of business expectations from Dun and Bradstreet. The business information group's index of sales fell from 57 to 55 between the third and fourth quarters, while the profits index fell from 45 to 42. In the sales area, the countries which experienced the biggest declines in optimism were Switzerland, New Zealand, the US and Mexico; the greatest increases came in Brazil, France, Japan and the Netherlands. Despite the quarter-on-quarter decline, levels of optimism were higher than they were in the fourth quarter of 1993. 'The worldwide business climate continues to be in very good shape as the survey shows optimism indices at pre-recession levels,' said Mr Joseph Duncan, vice-president and chief economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. The employment index also fell between the third and fourth quarters, from 20 to 18. 'The employment index is at a respectable level, but is not as high as it could be,' said Mr Duncan. 'We should see some hiring in the next few quarters.' Employment optimism is at its lowest in Japan and Belgium, and at its highest in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, US and Canada.</p>

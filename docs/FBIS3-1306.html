Reports reaching Dar es Salaam from  Kigoma say the soldiers have defied a call by President  Ntaryamira to return to barracks, and instead they have been  killing innocent civilians and children and burning their  houses. The reports said the president is still in Bujumbura  and that no government minister was killed in the Army mutiny.    In Dar es Salaam, Burundians living in exile in Tanzania  have  called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to  Burundi to contain the situation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The level of protein in milk does have a measurable affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the value of milk used for manufacturing. This value varies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among the diverse manufactured products because of differences in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the market values of manufactured dairy products and in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribution made by protein to various finished products. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instance, testimony at the hearing showed that for a one-pound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in protein in the manufacture of cheddar cheese there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.32 pound change in the quantity of cheese produced, whereas in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production of milk powder a one-pound change in the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein would change the amount of powder produced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately one pound. Since the vast majority of milk in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five orders included in this hearing is used to manufacture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese, the protein price will be based on the contribution made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by protein in the manufacture of cheese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1.32 factor used in both methods proposed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computation of the protein price for these five orders is derived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a modified Van Slyke cheese yield formula, where the casein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is assumed to be 75 percent of the protein and the moisture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of the cheese is 38 percent. Assuming the butterfat is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant, a change of protein by one pound in this formula will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change cheese yield by 1.32 pounds. Therefore, the 1.32 factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is appropriate for determining the order protein price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the level of the protein price, the question  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of whether to use the average block price versus the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrel price is a lesser issue than the question of whether or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not whey protein should be included in the computation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein price, as proposed by NAJ. The average difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the Green Bay Cheese Exchange average block price and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average barrel price during 1992 and 1993 was $.0388 per pound.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Multiplying this difference by the 1.32 factor results in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average difference of $.05 per pound of protein between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein prices derived from the barrel and the block cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices. Over the same 2 years the inclusion of whey protein in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the computation of the protein price would have increased the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein price by an average of $.4265.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal issues that must be addressed in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the computation of the protein price are the factors that must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included to arrive at a price that most accurately reflects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of protein in milk. In addition, the effect of the level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the protein price on the other nonfat solids price must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered. Since the other nonfat solids price is computed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price, the other nonfat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids price is inversely related to the protein price. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining an appropriate protein price and other nonfat solids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price, the effects of both prices on payments to producers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margins to handlers buying milk must be determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inclusion of a protein price and an other solids price in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining payments to producers gives producers an incentive to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase their production of nonfat solids, especially protein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was no evidence in the hearing record to indicate the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to producers of increasing the protein content of milk. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore difficult to determine what the absolute level of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein price, or its relative level to the butterfat and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids prices, must be to encourage producers to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein content of milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Observer: Under fire Hard luck, Tony. Blair is going to have to wait until the autumn before he gets his first go at outshining Britain's prime minister at the Commons dispatch box. The government has decided that MPs will start their modest 12-week summer holidays at lunchtime on July 21 - just hours after Blair's expected coronation as Labour leader. Normal service at the dispatch box won't be resumed until October 18. That gives John Major plenty of time to master his Blair-bashing technique. However, the parliamentary timetablers have not been able to delay one long-overdue showdown. Next Thursday sees health secretary Virginia Bottomley being grilled by an all-party group on parenting. Peter Bottomley will lead the questioning. If anyone knows just how far he can go with Virginia, it should be her husband.</p>

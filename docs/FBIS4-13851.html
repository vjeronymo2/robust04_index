			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Velayati, our foreign minister, who went to  Romania to participate in the World Forum Foundation, returned  to Tehran at midnight. He said that Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Serbs' atrocities against the Muslims of that country,  especially in Gorazde, were the main topics of his discussions  with the Croatian parliamentary speaker and the foreign  ministers of Albania, Romania, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In an exclusive interview with our correspondent on the  World  Forum Foundation, Dr. Velayati said:    [Begin Velayati recording] The forum, which was established  five years ago, is a nongovernmental international center that  usually meets once a year in the month of Tir [22 June-22 July]  at Crans-Montana in Switzerland. In some countries, an  emergency session is held on request to discuss specific issues  between the annual sessions. Therefore, this is a new form of  international gathering that is, as I mentioned, a  nongovernmental one and is progressing alongside the United  Nations and other affiliated organizations.    The first session of this kind was held in Davos,  Switzerland  and the second one was convened in Crans-Montana [as heard]. In  other parts of the world, similar organizations are being  established. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Two-way trade keeps Nikkei below 17,000 SHARE prices fluctuated amid margin selling, and bargain hunting by investment trusts, and the Nikkei average finally closed flat, ending below the 17,000 level for the second consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index closed a slight 0.30 up at 16,953.53 after a day's low of 16,864.91 and high of 17,132.58. Margin and index-linked selling depressed the Nikkei in the morning, prompting bargain hunting which lifted the index temporarily above the 17,000 mark. However, rumours of a bankruptcy at a leading real estate developer caused another sell-off. Volume improved modestly from 210m shares to 230m. Declines led advances by 506 to 380, with 222 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 1.74 better at 1,307.21, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.81 to 1,016.80. Prices moved on short-term activity, while most investors remained inactive; analysts said the Nikkei index was fluctuating on technical signals. Dealers once again accumulated positions in bio-technology related issues. Morinaga Milk Industry, the most active stock of the day, advanced Y24 to Y898 on reports that it had started joint clinical tests on an Aids drug with a US pharmaceuticals group. Meiji Milk Products rose Y17 to Y988 and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, the paper company, put on Y6 to Y544. Steel issues with large, long margin positions were sold. Nippon Steel retreated Y4 to Y279, Kobe Steel eased Y1 to Y300 and NKK relinquished Y5 to Y255. Road construction companies advanced in the afternoon following comments by Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the Liberal Democratic Party, calling for a need to boost government road construction spending. Maeda Road Construction appreciated Y110 to Y2,820 and Nippon Road moved forward Y50 to Y1,360. Electronic shares put on a mixed performance. Sony moved ahead Y20 to Y4,070 on buying by pension funds and investment trusts. NEC, previously sold heavily on concern about weak profits, recovered Y2 to Y863 on bargain hunting. Fujitsu receded Y5 to Y615. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 38.21 to 19,919.21 in volume of 10.3m shares. Roundup IT WAS a mixed day for the Pacific Rim region, with Hong Kong, closed on Monday, strengthening after last week's disappointing performance. HONG KONG responded to domestic bargain hunting and the Hang Seng index rose 27.68 to 5,846.75 in turnover of HKDollars 2.5bn. Analysts said the rise was helped by demand for selected blue chips. HSBC gained HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 45.50, Jardine Matheson HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 65 and Swire Pacific 'A' HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 34.75. AUSTRALIA weakened further, with industrial stocks and banks registering the biggest losses. The All Ordinaries index slipped 7.6 to 1,639.4 in turnover of ADollars 237m. Among banks, Westpac lost 6 cents to ADollars 3.26 and Commonwealth dipped 3 cents to ADollars 7.25. Foster's Brewing, which on Monday rejected SA Brewing's merger proposal, fell 7 cents to ADollars 1.99. MANILA rose to a new intraday record high before slipping back and the composite index was finally 2.92 up at 1,578.48 in combined turnover of 804m pesos. Dealers said investors had been switching out of selected industrial shares and into oil and mining issues. Oils have shown gains since commercial production began two weeks ago at an oilfield north east of Borneo island. SEOUL saw selective buying of financial issues matched by profit-taking in other sectors. The composite index closed just 0.14 higher at 579.95 in turnover of Won293.5bn. KUALA LUMPUR finished firmer after trading in a narrow range. The composite index gained 1.98 to 602.15. Telekom climbed 20 cents to MDollars 13.80 in volume of 838,000 shares, having scored a 40-cent rise on Monday. TAIWAN's financial sector led the market down on profit-taking. The weighted index shed 34.71 to 4,637.78 in turnover of TDollars 38.6bn. BOMBAY's brokers boycotted trading for a second day over the government's refusal to allow share transfers linked to the current scandal.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASS SIZES TO INCREASE DUE TO SHORTFALL  </P> <P> The La Canada Board of Education on Tuesday adopted a $17.3 -- million budget  for the 1990-91 school year, after slashing $900,000 and increasing class sizes  because of shortfalls in state funding.  </P> <P> The budget, up about 8% from last year, includes a 6% salary raise for  teachers.  </P> <P> But average class size is expected to grow from 27.5 to 29 students in  kindergarten through sixth grade and from 30 to 32.5 in grades 7-12.  </P> <P> The increases in class size will save about $270,000, said Andrew Meyer,  assistant district superintendent.  </P> <P> One administrative and at least four teaching positions were not filled, and  several custodial and secretarial jobs were scaled back as part of the cuts,  said Carole Siegler, a Board of Education member.  </P> <P> District officials are projecting a budget deficit of at least $730,000 in  1991-92. The Committee for Quality Education, a La Canada Flintridge citizens  group formed last spring, is trying to augment the budget by pushing for a  school parcel tax next year, Siegler said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Siti Rahil] </F>   [Text] Singapore, May 7 KYODO -- In a rare meeting with a  U.S. congressman at her home last February, Myanmar's [Burma's]  detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said she would never  leave her homeland even if the ruling State Law and Order  Restoration Council (SLORC) releases her.    In a full transcript obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, the  48-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate told Congressman Bill  Richardson, "they tried to pressure me to leave the country with  ways no self- respecting government should employ."    Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for more than four  years since July 1989, added, "there was no such move to have a  dialogue with me. They only wanted to talk about the terms of  my departure from the country."    Richardson had pressed hard for the meeting when he met  Myanmar's political and military strongman Khin Nyunt in Yangon  [Rangoon] in August.    During the three-hour interview, Richardson said, "I want  you  to know that in my meeting this morning with Khin Nyunt, I  pushed for the unconditional release of you and all political  prisoners. I also pushed for a transition to democracy."    He added, "I plan to ask the SLORC to release political  prisoners to me. I want to give them a chance to leave Burma  with me if they so choose."    Suu Kyi, however, firmly insisted that political dissidents  should stay put in Myanmar.    "The only thing I have refused is to discuss leaving the  country," she said. "I am needed here. Moreover, the principle  of trying to drive someone out of their own country is totally  unacceptable."    She also said, "please keep making demands on the (ruling)  SLORC. International pressure does have an effect."    On four years of her house arrest, Suu Kyi said, "I do not  recognize the legitimacy of the law under which I'm being held  -- it is totally unjust."    She recounted that when she was first put under house  arrest,  she was not allowed to even offer food to monks, a deed expected  of devout Buddhists.    But, she said, "isolation is not difficult for me. Maybe  it's because of my Buddhist upbringing. I have books to read  and a radio to listen to."    She sticks to a rigid routine, waking up just before dawn to  meditate, exercise and do household chores, and goes to bed  before 10 P.M. She keeps in touch with the outside world mainly  through the BBC and has read hundreds of books and biographies  on politics, philosophy, religion and international affairs.    Regarding her financial situation she said, "I get part of  the royalties from my book. They come in foreign currency,  which I can change into foreign exchange certificates," she said.    THE NEW YORK TIMES has earlier reported the main points of  the interview because its reporter was allowed to accompany  Richardson.</p>

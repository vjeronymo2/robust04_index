			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 4: Cuts bring home the bacon  -Profile / Tulip International Four years ago, Tulip International, Denmark's large processed meat exporter, was losing DKr1m a day. Today, following a programme of severe rationalisation, the company is back in the black and looking to increase its markets overseas. During that period, Tulip has been transformed from a collection of competing farmers' co-operatives into a limited company which is 44 per cent owned by Danish financial institutions. 'These co-operatives had been competing for 50 years and we had to change from a slaughterhouse culture to develop marketing and advertising strategy,' explains Mr Flemming Lindelov, group managing director. Tulip was formed in 1990 by the merger of the processed meat divisions of three slaughterhouses and Danepak, a Danish-owned UK bacon company. The slaughterhouses, which have since completed their own merger, still own a 56 per cent stake in the company. A group of bankers injected DKr625m into the company to enable it to rationalise production capacity. This meant closing four factories to concentrate production in three centres. The restructuring involved a 34 per cent cut in the workforce from 4,039 employees in 1990 to 2,728 last year, while the company continues to produce the same amount of processed meat: 150,000 tonnes a year. The rationalisation cost roughly DKr600m, with DKr400m being spent on closing facilities and boosting production capacity at other plants to take up the output. The company has now managed to turn a loss of DKr270m in the 1991-1992 financial year ending in October to a net profit of DKr151m in the last financial year. Tulip will continue to invest in efficiency improvements by spending DKr123m this year and DKr140m in 1995 on equipment for increasing productivity. 'We've done all you can read in management books by turning ourselves into a company with high volume and low costs; now we must concentrate on being customer and market-led,' Mr Lindelov says. Tulip has put a lot of effort into product development which is vital for its growing export trade. About 95 per cent of its production is exported and the company has slicing, packaging and processing plants in the UK and Germany. Tulip receives 37 per cent of its DKr5bn turnover from the UK market where it has 1,200 employees. Around 35 per cent of its sales come from the rest of Europe and 11 per cent from the US. It is a leading supplier of bacon and ham products to Marks and Spencer, the UK retail group, for which it manufactures 30 to 40 new products a year. 'Marks and Spencer is really keen on new products; for the rest of our markets we bring out 10 to 15 new products,' Mr Lindelov explains. The company has 15 employees working on product innovation in the UK and 15 in Denmark. It is looking to Russia as a big new export market where the company is supplying canned ham. Sales in Russia now represent DKr250m and Mr Lindelov is confident this level could double within a couple of years. Tulip recently opened its own warehouse in Russia and hopes to start a sales office in Moscow. Its canned meat division also plans to increase sales in eastern Europe and central America. At the same time, Tulip is looking to boost its market share in the German and Scandinavian markets where tastes are similar and the same products can be sold. However, last year the company drew back from the US market where it was suffering from currency fluctuations and halved its market share in the US. It is trying to differentiate itself in the US market by selling higher value, low-fat ham products to delicatessen shops. Mr Lindelov has tried to foster a culture where the company is responsive to the needs of its customers and employees remain flexible. For example, the head of Tulip's ham division, who was in charge of 600 people with a turnover of DKr1.1bn, has now been moved to head a sales office in Germany with 50 employees. 'We want to try and show that a product development manager is as important as leading a sales division,' Mr Lindelov explains.</p>

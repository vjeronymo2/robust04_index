			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by An Mu (1344 2606): "Military Exercises Targeted </F> at Taiwan"]    [Text] Military Exercises Aimed at "Liberating  Taiwan" Have Abruptly Increased    The relations between the two sides have become tense  because  of the Qiandao Hu incident.    In the previous issue of CHENG MING, I reported that Li  Teng-hui's description of the mainland government as "a bandit  government" infuriated the mainland high-level military  leadership; they were so infuriated that Deng Xiaoping had to  come out to calm them down. But this did not remove the tense  atmosphere of "liberating Taiwan." In April the mainland armed  forces frequently conducted military exercises and the purpose  of many of these military exercises was to deal with  "contingencies" caused by Taiwan. We can see that although Deng  Xiaoping has supreme authority, he is physically weak. Whereas  Jiang Zemin, the nominal chairman of the Central Military  Commission, has no significant position at all in the military.  As a matter of fact, these military exercises had been proposed  by hard-liners in the military. This is a trend which merits our  attention.  <H5>  The Beijing Military Region's Air Units and Armored Troops </H5> Cooperated With Each Other in Combat Exercises    Let me relate these large-scale military exercises:    Time: From 2 to 5 April.    Place: Border areas between Hebei Province and Inner  Mongolia, including Yanghe, Xilugahe, and Xibohe.    Participating armed forces units: The Beijing Military  Region's air units and armored troops.    Code of exercises: "Conquest 96." The figure refers to 96  hours, that is, four days. But some people said it indicated  the conquest and liberation of the enemy-occupied  territory--Taiwan--in 1996. I believe the former is more  accurate.    Scale of exercises: Two helicopter regiments, one armored  division, and one amphibious armored regiment (also called a  special armored regiment). The helicopters used were Type-8 and  Type-9 Chinese-made helicopters. The missiles launched by these  helicopters against the enemy were antitank missiles made after  the "HOT [Haut subsonique Optiquement teleguide tire d'un  Tube]" pattern, temporarily called "Little Overlord Type-1."  These were helicopter-to-ground laser missiles. As learned,  their accuracy was over 95 percent, but their accuracy with  mobile targets was 70 percent.  <H5>  Zhang Wannian: "Proceed From Actual Combat To Crush Taiwan </H5> Independence" Technical experts from the Army Aviation  School, the Military Academy of the Second Artillery Corps, and  the No. 8641 Factory were invited to watch and draw experience  from these military exercises. Liu Huaqing, Zhang Wannian, Zhao  Nanqi, Li Laizhu, and Gu Shanqing were present to provide  guidance. Zhang Wannian said: In the current military  exercises, first, we will examine the armed forces' training  quality; second, we have proceeded from the possible outbreak of  antiaggressive war in the future and from the actual need to  liberate Taiwan and crush Taiwan independence; and third, we  will check the quality of new weapons through combat exercises.    As learned, the Type-8 helicopters were modeled on the  French  "Super Wasp" and the Type-9 helicopters were modeled on the  French "Dolphin." There are now 200 Type-8 helicopters and 300  Type-9 helicopters in service.    From Zhang Wannian's speech, we know that improving the  "actual combat" effectiveness is an urgent task of the mainland  armed forces. Apart from Taiwan, what other imaginary enemies  does the CPC have? Let us take a look at the following military  exercises.  <H5>  The Jinan and Nanjing Military Regions Cooperated With Each </H5> Other in Combat Exercises    Time: From 8 to 12 April.    Place: Xiaoqinghe in the north Shandong plains.    Participating armed forces units: Armed forces units from  the Jinan and Nanjing Military Regions.    Code of exercises: "Train of the Era," internally called  "Spirit of the Era."    Scale of exercises: The 87th and 116th Divisions of the 54th  Group Army under the Jinan Military Regional Command--two crack  infantry units which performed meritorious service during the  Korean war; one ground-to-air mobile missile regiment belonging  to the 28th Regiment.    The Nanjing Military Region dispatched one airborne division  and one mechanized division; the airborne division was formed in  September last year and some of its officers and soldiers were  transferred from the Jinan Military Region's Air Force School;  Yun-12 and BHE [preceding three letters published in Roman  alphabet]-Type [as published] transportation planes were used to  transport airborne troops.    Military Exercises Were Conducted Out of  Consideration For Changes in the World and Taiwan Situations    Zhang Zhen, Li Desheng, Gu Hui, and Zhang Taiji watched  these  military exercises. Gu Hui made a concluding speech at the end  of the exercises, saying: These actual combat exercises were  planned according to changes in the world and Taiwan political  situations. For a period to come, the main basis for us to  strengthen the armed forces buildup and do a good job in combat  readiness is the existence of hegemonism, the restoration of  Japanese militarism, and the growth of Li Teng-hui's Taiwan  independence force.    This was quite rare that a Chinese leader had formally  mentioned the "restoration of Japanese militarism." This was,  possibly, because the Japanese Government said that the CPC was  behind North Korea's nuclear threat and a member of the newly  formed Tsutomo Hata cabinet denied the massacre in Nanjing.  Apart from this, for historical and geographical reasons, Japan  is opposed to the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan. All  this has put the CPC on the alert.  <H5>  Joint Maneuvers by the Chengdu and Guangzhou Military Regions </H5>   What is noteworthy is that the "idea of war preparedness" is  beginning to spread among the mainland armed forces units. The  reappearance of this obsolete slogan indicates the CPC's firmer  determination to "liberate Taiwan."    The actual combat exercises listed below suggest how the CPC  focuses on training which is aimed at "scoring a victory in a  new war confrontation."    Time: From 25 to 28 April.    Place: Jiangkou and Jinjiang in Tongren Prefecture, Guizhou  Province; and the lower reaches of the Yuan Jiang, Hunan  Province.    Participating armed forces units: Armed forces units from  the Guangzhou and Chengdu Military Regions, which carried out  joint air and land offensives.    Code of exercises: "Doomsday of the Aircraft Carrier." "The  aircraft carrier," reportedly, referred to Taiwan Province.    Scale of exercises: The Chengdu Military Region dispatched  two mechanized infantry divisions, which, covered by an air  force unit, attacked and occupied an enemy position. The  Guangzhou Military Region dispatched two infantry divisions,  which speedily occupied a "city" in Chenshui in the Yuan Jiang's  lower reaches under bombers' attacks. Troops dispatched by the  two military regions successfully joined forces. Bombers  launched laser-guided bombs at their "targets." This was the  first time laser-guided bombs were used.  <H5>  Laser Missiles Were Used For the First Time </H5>   As learned, these laser missiles can be launched against a  target 15 km away and have high precision and a strong striking  power.    But whether or not the design could meet the requirements of  "actual combat" had drawn the military's attention. The  Operational Section of the General Staff Department held an  on-site meeting to analyze the combat exercises and experts from  the Military Equipment Department came to inspect how the  weapons were used.    Among those present on the scene were Li Xilin, commander of  the Guangzhou Military Region; Li Jiulong, commander of the  Chengdu Military Region; Zhang Xusan, adviser to the Academy of  Military Sciences; as well as Li Jijun and He Pengfei from the  Central Military Commission Office.    Li Xilin made these remarks: The present-day world is not  tranquil, hegemonists are acting as international police and are  threatening world and regional peace, and Li Teng-hui's Taiwan  independence force is becoming increasingly arrogant. To  safeguard the motherland's territorial integrity and our  socialist construction, to liberate our sacred territory Taiwan,  and to realize the motherland's reunification, we must speed up  the armed forces' modernization through self-reliance.  <H5>  "The Military Exercises Have Met the First-Rate Standards of </H5> Actual Combat" At the conclusion of the military exercises,  Li Jijun commended the participating troops on behalf of the  Central Military Commission. He said that the military  exercises had met the first- rate standards of actual combat;  the role of new tactics and new equipment had been brought into  play; and the Chinese armed forces' ability to score a victory  in the new war confrontation had been demonstrated.    These military exercises conducted by the mainland armed  forces suggest that the possibility of armed attacks against  Taiwan cannot be ruled out. Superficially, the two sides of the  strait have conducted more exchanges than in the past, but their  relations are fragile and will not withstand a test. It was  hard to imagine that an incident in tourism had triggered an  anticommunist sentiment on the entire Taiwan island and had also  touched off clamors in the mainland military for armed  occupation of Taiwan. If Deng Xiaoping cannot control the  situation, will this irreconcilable ideological conflict be  resolved by military action?</p>

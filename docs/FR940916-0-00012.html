The classifications are Class Free, Class A, Class B, and Class C. States or areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C are required to be placed under Federal quarantine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no known brucellosis in cattle for the 12 months preceding classification as Class Free. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highest rate of brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes. Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become less stringent as a State approaches or achieves Class Free status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entail: (1) Maintaining a cattle herd infection rate not to exceed a stated level during 12 consecutive months; (2) tracing back and successfully closing (investigating and resolving) a certain percentage of cases of brucellosis infection detected by the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) program, a program of testing at stockyards, farms, ranches, and slaughter establishments; (3) maintaining a surveillance system that includes testing of dairy herds, participation of all recognized slaughtering establishments in the MCI program, identification and monitoring of herds at high risk of infection (including herds adjacent to infected herds and herds from which infected animals have been sold or received), and having an individual herd plan in effect within a stated number of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosis in a herd he or she owns; and (4) maintaining minimum procedural standards for administering the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of its herd infection rate, California was classified as a Class Free State on April 4, 1994, in an interim rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 15612&hyph;15613, Docket No. 94&hyph;009&hyph;1); there had been no known brucellosis in cattle in California for 12 consecutive months. Since then, however, two cattle herds in California have been found to be infected with brucellosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To attain and maintain Class A status, a State or area must: (1) Not exceed a cattle herd infection rate, due to field strain Brucella abortus, of 0.25 percent or 2.5 herds per 1,000 based on the number of reactors found within the State during any 12 consecutive months, except in States with 10,000 or fewer herds; (2) trace to the farm of origin 90 percent of all brucellosis reactors found in the course of MCI testing; (3) successfully close at least 95 percent of the MCI reactor cases traced to the farm of origin during the 12-consecutive-month period immediately prior to the most recent anniversary of the date the State or area was classified Class A; and (4) have a specified surveillance system, as described above, including an approved individual herd plan in effect within 15 days of locating the source herd or recipient herd.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing California's brucellosis program records, we have concluded that California meets the standards for Class A status. Therefore, we are removing California from the list of Class Free States or areas in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;78.41(a) and adding it to the list of Class A States or areas in &sect;78.41(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action will place certain restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Immediate Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . We will consider comments that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cattle moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breeding stock, or for feeding. Changing the brucellosis status of California from Class Free to Class A increases testing requirements governing the interstate movement of cattle. However, testing requirements for cattle moved interstate for immediate slaughter or to quarantined feedlots are not affected by this change. Cattle from certified brucellosis-free herds moving interstate are not affected by this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The groups affected by this action will be herd owners in California, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as buyers and importers of cattle from the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are an estimated 28,000 cattle herds in California that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by this rule. Ninety-eight percent of these are owned by small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities. Most of these herds are not certified brucellosis-free. Test-eligible cattle offered for sale from other than certified brucellosis-free herds must have a negative test under Class A status regulations, but not under regulations concerning Class Free status. This testing costs approximately $3.25 per head. If such testing were distributed equally among all herds affected by this rule, the change to Class A status would cost approximately $16 per herd.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we believe that changing the brucellosis status of California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Class A would not have a significant economic impact on the small entities affected by this interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

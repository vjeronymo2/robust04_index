			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov and Feliks Babitskiy report under the </F> "Opposition" rubric: "`Pray for the Freedom of Palestine!'  AL-QUDS appeals to Russians"]    [Text] The opposition's "second echelon," having found an  attentive audience at the festivities of AL-QUDS newspaper held  in Moscow 3-5 June, has yet again called on Russians to unite to  fight "Yeltsin's hateful regime." The appeals from A. Nevzorov,  S. Terekhov, S. Umalatova, and Ye. Ligachev have by no means  facilitated stabilization. "Thanks to our rulers, the people  are being destroyed, both morally and physically," Umalatova  stated. "They are like vampires, in need of blood," she  continued. "We have had enough of demagogues, we have had  enough of philosophers!" S. Terekhov has called on people not  to believe in the "clannish struggle" inside the ruling camp.  "They are preparing," he warned, and advised people to do  everything to see that they do not take "patriots" unawares.  Yegor Ligachev proposed a plan for the restoration of the USSR.    Events with the participation of opposition leaders take  place constantly. However, let us ask ourselves the question:  Why is a newspaper with an Arabic name, published by Dr.  Sha'ban Hafiz Sha'ban, and committed to the liberation of  Palestine from Israel, attracting the Russian opposition to its  pages and its parties? Why (as S. Umalatova has admitted) did  Mr. Sha'ban fund the extraordinary congress of USSR people's  deputies?    The motives by which Dr. Sha'ban is guided are obvious.  First, he is committed to changing Russia's foreign policy in  the Near East, to redirecting it from supporting Y. 'Arafat to  helping the leaders of the Palestine opposition. Obviously, a  further aim of AL-QUDS is to destabilize the Russian  Federation's relations with Israel. Second, in the event of the  hardline opposition coming to power, the network of commercial  enterprises headed by Mr. Sha'ban would obviously receive  most-favored status from the Russian leadership.    However, even if our assumptions are incorrect, one thing is  clear -- the main aim of AL-QUDS and its publisher is the  destabilization of the situation in Russia, Which, in our view,  by no means does them credit.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Withdrawal from pipelines puts Galliford Pounds 5.9m in red Shares in Galliford fell by 7p to 27p as the Midlands-based contractor and housebuilder revealed pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.88m for the year to June 30, against profits of Pounds 412,000 last time. Losses per share emerged at 5.04p (earnings of 0.33p) and the unchanged final dividend of 0.5p maintains the total as 1p. This is the third year running that the dividend has been paid from reserves. The pre-tax losses can be blamed on the now discontinued pipeline rehabilitation business. The group said that losses on the withdrawal from this activity were in line with those anticipated in April, when it decided to discontinue the business. Pipeline operating losses were Pounds 2.92m, on turnover of Pounds 10.8m. There was, in the words of Mr Richard Miles, chairman, a full provision of Pounds 3.08m against losses on contracts still being run out. In addition costs of Pounds 339,000 were carried for redundancies and closure costs. Mr Miles stressed that, stripping out the discontinued operations, profits would have been Pounds 116,000, against losses of Pounds 516,000. Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 219.8m (Pounds 215.7m). The construction division incurred losses of Pounds 2.41m (profits Pounds 408,000) on turnover of Pounds 129m (Pounds 126m). The division is following industry trends in seeking better margins from low-speculation development joint ventures, partnership projects in the private sector and securing land for housing associations. Housebuilding lifted profits to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.58m) on increased turnover of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9.03m). Margins were maintained at 17 per cent and completions totalled 223, up 31 per cent. The average sale price was Pounds 53,400 (Pounds 53,135). The landbank was increased with the acquisition of 385 plots. The cost was undisclosed, but the group said it would not buy at prices from which it could not make margins of 18 per cent. Merchanting achieved profits of Pounds 447,000 (losses Pounds 717,000) as turnover rose to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds 44.9m).</p>

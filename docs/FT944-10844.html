			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Blair pledges union reforms will be kept Mr Tony Blair yesterday promised business leaders that Labour would retain the government's central trade union reforms and would consult industrialists before introducing a minimum wage. Speaking to senior executives at the Per Cent Club, which organises charitable activity, Mr Blair said: 'We are not in the business of sweeping away the trade union and labour relations laws of the 1980s.' His comments coincided with a blunt warning by Mr Roy Hattersley, a former Labour deputy leader, that the party must consider breaking its links with the trade union movement if it wants to win the next general election. Giving the George Orwell lecture at Birkbeck College, London, Mr Hattersley said victory was possible only if Labour became a party of ideas rather than vested interests. He said: 'It is difficult to pursue truth wherever it may lead if two or three mighty unions, which dominate the policy debate, have decided which way to vote before the discussion begins.' Mr Blair, setting out the framework for a working relationship between business and a Labour government, offered strong support for a dynamic market economy, and rejected the tax-and-spend approach of the last Labour government. He said strike ballots, union elections and curbs on mass picketing were 'here to stay', and ruled out any return to high marginal tax rates. Mr Blair said the minimum wage would be introduced 'so as to avoid any adverse impact on jobs', suggesting that the level would be lower than the rate of more than Pounds 4 an hour sought by influential union leaders. Mr Blair also spoke of the 'interdependence of business and the community'. The club, he said, was a recognition by business that it had a responsibility to wider society. Business involvement in the community was more than an act of charity. 'Our communities are your customers, and communities are your employees. The state of society beyond the factory gate, the shop window and the office entrance matters to business.' Mr Blair supported the idea of a national youth and community service scheme. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will today publish plans to reform the tax system by toughening inheritance tax rules, simplifying corpora-tion tax and collecting unpaid tax.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. fired the first round in what could be a new auto incentives  war, announcing that it was offering 4.9% financing programs on four small car  and truck models as well as rebates of up to $3,000 for some 1988 model cars.  Analysts said the action reflects growing buyer concern about rising interest  rates and could trigger other cut-rate financing programs. Ford said it is  offering the 4.9% rate on 24-month loans on its 1989 Ford Escort and Festiva  small cars, Mercury Tracer subcompact and the Ford Ranger small truck. It is  offering a 3.9% financing rate on Tracer models sold in California.  </P></p>

The program is continuing to develop. Unique packages of  shares of major enterprises, of interest to shareholders, will  be issued at check auctions in the near future. Check auctions  in the power and oil industries are now being developed. Shares  from the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant, the "Optoyuviler"  Joint-Stock Company, the Novorossiysk Shipping Company, and  dozens of other efficient enterprises will be issued at check  auctions in the near future. That, strictly speaking, was how  our program was structured.    Today the key issue for us is the question of the  postprivatization functioning of the enterprises. Therefore, to  a great extent, all of us are switching our activity and our  influence to everything that is connected with the creation of  sources of investment for the privatized enterprises. My  colleagues and I have recently been putting forward various  initiatives concerning the search for new sources of  investments. We are also actively supporting Western initiatives  in this sphere. A Russian-U.S. enterprise fund is now being  created in Russia, which will only be involved in investments in  privatized enterprises, and this means no less than $300  million. Dozens of funds like this will come into being in the  near future, and we are trying to help them as much as possible  in their practicable work.</p>

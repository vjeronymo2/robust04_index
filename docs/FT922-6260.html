			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: In-house points won in first round LUTON is a political weather-vane. Labour wrested control of its district council from the Tories in last year's local elections, but narrowly failed to unseat Luton South's Tory MP in the general election. Yet political gyrations have had virtually no impact on Luton council's approach to compulsory competitive tendering. The town's former Tory leaders were keen to use the tendering process to improve efficiency, but equally keen to see contracts remain in-house if possible. Mr Roy Davies, the council's Labour leader, insists that 'on its own, CCT has done nothing to improve services' - but the new Labour council's policy is a carbon copy of the former Tory administration's approach. With the first round of tendering almost complete, all the principal service contracts have been won by the council's direct labour force. But the refuse collection and street cleaning contract stayed in-house only after a conflict which casts a spotlight on one sensitive area of tendering - the right of councils to demand hefty performance bonds. UK Waste, now a subsidiary of Onyx UK, the French-owned group, bid Pounds 1.8m a year for the refuse and street-cleaning contract against a bid of Pounds 2.2m by the in-house team. The council included a performance bond of Pounds 1.1m as part of the contract terms. UK Waste, the only serious private bidder, made its offer on that condition, but argued afterwards that the bond was an unfair burden and failed to provide it, whereupon Luton withdrew the contract from it. The council then put the contract out to tender again and gave the services back to the direct labour force - the lowest bidder - subject to the same bond. Private-sector competition for contracts is growing tougher. The grounds-maintenance contract is split into three packages: the first, awarded in 1989, went to the direct-labour force with no serious challenge. The second, out in 1990, had one strong private contender, and the third, now out to tender, has attracted considerable private-sector interest.</p>

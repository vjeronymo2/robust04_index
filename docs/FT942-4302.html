			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The point of mutuality The British have always had an exaggerated view of the merits of home ownership. Have they a similarly over-respectful view of mutual ownership in the building society movement? It is tempting to think so after the High Court's decision to throw obstacles in the path of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn offer for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. The 1986 Building Societies Act makes it exceptionally difficult for such takeovers to proceed, even when agreed by the respective managements. In the case of Lloyds, the specific stumbling block was a provision that prohibited the payment of cash bonuses to investors of less than two years' standing. The purpose of the legislation was not to block bids, but to prevent speculative movements of funds from one society to another in anticipation of bids. Yet Vice Chancellor Sir David Nicholls ruled the bonuses promised to recent investors in Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester were unlawful. The question is whether this legal logic makes public policy sense when the Treasury is reviewing building society legislation. To answer that question requires some prior consideration of the point of mutuality. This form of ownership developed in the 19th century because it enabled people to achieve goals that were not attainable via the commercial banking system at the time. Today, with home ownership accounting for around two-thirds of the housing stock, the purpose of the building society movement is largely fulfilled. The larger building societies no longer behave like mutual undertakings in relation to their members. They are scarcely distinguishable in their motivation and goals from the clearing banks. Indeed, some societies have been harsher in their treatment of struggling mortgagors than the banks. And they sometimes appear more interested in offering attractive deals to new customers than looking after existing owners. This narrow pursuit of profit is at odds with the concept of mutuality; and it remains unclear precisely what the profits are for. In one sense the societies are obeying the logic of the product market in which they operate. Deregulation has given both societies and banks the opportunity to engage in licensed poaching on each others' territory. Yet if that is the case, why maintain an ownership and regulatory ring-fence around institutions whose activities are converging with the wider business of the banks? One answer might be that in a plural system the building societies have looked after their depositors with more imagination and flair than the clearing banks have looked after theirs. The banks' record does not inspire confidence in their ability to rejuvenate the more successful building society sector. Both operate in imperfect markets in corporate control. Yet below the very top level societies are subject to greater threat from takeover than any bank and they cannot, under the 1986 Act, take over a big clearing bank. On balance, it seems sensible to continue to make it difficult for banks to take over societies and to keep the societies from engaging in higher-risk lending business until they can demonstrate the requisite skills. Determined players with good lawyers will always find a way to consummate deals. What cannot make sense is for investors who are not entitled to receive bonuses to be given votes that enable them to block a bid that the majority desires. This calls for legislative change, as does the present over-restrictive approach to wholesale funding.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT FRIED CHICKEN;  </P> <P> BIRD IN A MELTING POT  </P> <P> Fried chicken may be as American as apple pie, but that doesn't mean other  cultures don't share our finger-lickin' obsession. Herewith, a survey of L.A.'s  ethnic fried chicken specialists.  </P> <P> When a place bills itself as "The House That Fried Chicken Built," as Max's of  Manila does, you expect extraordinary chicken. At least, I did. I was even  hoping to find my favorite Filipino snack, chicharrones de pollo -- crunchy  deep-fried chicken skin. I found neither.  </P> <P> Max's fried chicken is simple, almost unseasoned, lightly crusted and little  more than acceptable. You can dress up Max's chicken with the accompanying  banana catsup -- a sweet and sour condiment made from bananas, garlic and  vinegar that appears on every table in catsup-type bottles. But the chicken  here is certainly nothing that would entice anyone to take a midnight drive.  </P> <P>  Max's of Manila, 3575 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 384-3043. Open  Monday-Thursday 7:30 a.m.-10:30 p.m., Friday-Sunday 7:30 a.m.-11:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  I had better luck with Furaibo, a 60-restaurant Japanese chain with a branch  in Gardena. Furaibo serves teba saki chicken, which is based on a classic  Japanese recipe called toriniku tatsuta-age -- fried chicken that's been  marinated before cooking.  </P> <P> At Furaibo, the chicken parts are scored deeply to better absorb the marinade's  flavor. A faint mist of flour coats the chicken's exterior and forms a thin,  crackly surface as the chicken is cooked. Like most well-executed Japanese  fried dishes, this chicken seems as though it hasn't been cooked in oil at all.  </P> <P> Teba-saki chicken comes in a range of flavors, from sweet to extra spicy. And  you can be picky about which chicken parts you eat: Choose from Tarzan (half a  chicken), Jane (a chicken breast), Chita (the leg and thigh) or Teba (a whole  order of wings). The take-out orders are wrapped up like o-bento in colorful  printed paper, and they come with rice and pickles -- basics of any Japanese  meal -- plus a shredded cabbage salad.  </P> <P>  Furaibo, 1741 W. Redondo Beach Blvd. (in Tozai Plaza), Gardena. (213)  329-9441. Open Tuesday-Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., 5 p.m.-11 p.m.  </P> <P>  Only a few blocks away from Furaibo is Rokumeikan. This is probably Los  Angeles' only full-fledged "cutlet parlor" or tonkatsu-ya. All over Japan,  tonkatsu-ya are popular for quick lunches and inexpensive dinners. Pork,  breaded and deep-fried, is the big business at a tonkatsu-ya, but most serve a  wide variety of other cutlets, including shrimp, salmon, ground beef and, of  course, chicken.  </P> <P> Rokumeikan's chicken cutlet is, in fact, one of the best versions of fried  chicken I have tasted. Unlike the batter-fried tempura or the dry-fried  kara-age employed at Furaibo, the food is breaded with panko, irregularly  shaped bread crumbs that, when fried, give each item a flaky pastrylike  surface. A pitcher of Japanese Worcestershire sosu -- it looks like teriyaki  sauce but the taste is more piquant -- is always presented with the cutlets.  You can also munch on a devastatingly good appetizer of kara-age-style fried  chicken wings, and all of Rokumeikan's cutlet dinners include soup and rice.  </P> <P>  Rokumeikan Cutlet Parlor, 15607 S. Normandie Ave. (Inside the Travelodge  Motel), Gardena. (213) 324-4477. Open for lunch Monday -Friday 11 a.m.-2 p.m.;  dinner Monday-Friday 5:30 p.m.-9:45 p.m., Saturday-Sunday 5:30 p.m.-9:45 p.m.  </P> <P>  Don't be alarmed if the fried chicken you've ordered at Borobudur Garden comes  to your table looking quite black -- indeed almost burnt. It's the Ketjap  manis, a thick, sweet molasseslike soy sauce in Borobudur's marinade that gives  the chicken its dark ominous appearance -- and its addictive sweet-salty  flavor. The marinade is left clinging to the bird as it cooks; then it  caramelizes, resulting in a crispy exterior without any sort of batter or  coating.  </P> <P> I should explain that Borobudur Garden is an Indonesian restaurant specializing  in noodle dishes and, yes, fried chicken. This chicken is so good that most  people who order the quarter fried chicken with rice and salad ($2.75)  invariably wish they'd ordered the half chicken for $3.75 -- or perhaps two  halves since the chicken is sold to go and is just as appealing cold.  </P> <P> Borobudur's mie dishes (thin egg noodles) and ketoprak (rice noodles) with a  peanut-tamarind sauce, are sublime. But the restaurant's lackluster version of  the Indonesian salad gado gado, would be a good dish to miss.  </P> <P>  Borobudur Garden, 821 W. Las Tunas Drive, San Gabriel, (818) 281-6521. Open  Tuesday-Sunday 11 a.m.-9 p.m.  </P> <P> LINDA BURUM  </P></p>

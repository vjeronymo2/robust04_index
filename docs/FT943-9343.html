			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Standard weak The worst individual performance in the FT-SE 100 came from Standard Chartered, the banking group, whose shares fell almost 6 per cent in spite of top of the range half-year profits. The market was concerned about pressures on margins in the group's Hong Kong business, a factor which also took its toll of HSBC shares. The latter is scheduled to report interims on Monday. One dealer said Standard's underlying figures were 'OK but unspectacular; the lack of good news at the analysts' meeting put more pressure on the shares'. At the close Standard shares were 16 down at 259p, having touched a day's low of 255p. Turnover of 9.4m shares was the highest single day's business since mid-June. HSBC Holdings fell 16 1/2 to 778p on volume of 5.8m. Lloyds Bank rose 6 to 555p ahead of a press conference called for this morning at which Lloyds will give details of its revised offer for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Turnover in British Steel rose to 16m, making it the day's most active stock, and the shares firmed 2 1/2 to 164 1/2 p as sentiment was boosted by favourable results from Dutch steel group Hoogovens. Engineering concern GKN advanced 6 to 657p in trade of 3.2m as brokers upgraded full-year profits expectations after it reported interim figures ahead of the best market forecasts. Profits jumped 62 per cent to Pounds 97m, with analysts impressed by the rise given the small increase in sales and improvement in margins in the automotive division. The list of brokers upgrading included Mr Robert Speed at Henderson Crosthwaite, a long time bull of the stock. He raised his full-year forecast by Pounds 22m to Pounds 190m, while NatWest Securities lifted its estimate by Pounds 28m to Pounds 205m. A Smith New Court recommendation continued to support Rolls-Royce, which closed 5 ahead at 201p. Profit-taking in Transport Development Group left the shares 8 adrift at 227p, after the company reported improved first-half figures. Marketing services group WPP declined 3 1/2 to 119 1/2 p on profit-taking following figures at the high end of expectations. The market is awaiting an injection of 190m shares into the market as the banks which bailed out the group two years ago unwind the rest of their debt-for-equity swap. Positive comment on Courtaulds' fibre operations and talk of a recommendation by Robert Fleming Securities saw the shares add 10 at 548p. The soap detergent war between household products groups Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever hit Hickson International as it announced first-half figures. Hickson makes Accelerator, the bleach ingredient at the centre of the washing powder wrangle. The shares retreated 9 to 168p. International conglomerate Hanson added 3 1/4 at 266 3/4 p following a detailed analysis of the group in conjnunction with BTR, Williams Holdings and Tomkins from Credit Lyonnais Laing. The research looks at prospects for the groups in the US and highlights Hanson as offering the best value. BTR and Williams were flat at 387p and 370p respectively. Tomkins gained 1 1/2 at 236p. The recent strong showing by Bass prompted a couple of switch recommendations, with Whitbread being the chief beneficiary. Hoare Govett and James Capel were said to be recommending the move to clients. Bass declined 7 to 563p on 1.3m shares traded, while Whitbread managed a rise of 11 to 543p on turnover of 2.1m. Scottish &amp; Newcastle suffered from similar moves, the shares dipping 4 to 523p. The hot weather showed through to soft drink sales at JN Nicols (Vimto) and the shares gained 3 at 233p. Interim profits increased from Pounds 3.40m to Pounds 3.76m. Other statistics, Page 29</p>

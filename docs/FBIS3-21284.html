Red banners were ever so  popular in the early 1960s. Those were the days when socialism  was fashionable, the undivided Communist Party of India was the  second largest party in Parliament, and the mighty Soviet Union  was helping India set up massive public sector steel plants at  Bhilai and Bokaro.    Three decades and a plastic surgery on the eco-political  face  of the country later, market-driven capitalism has obliterated  the socialist goals of yesteryears, the public sector faces  phased privatisation and a lonely Left movement is looking for  committed allies to help put it back on the political road. This  is a time for soul-searching for the Left parties in India for  they know that unless they unite and re-adapt to the changing  times they will be left behind in the race for political control.    "Contrary to what the popular media would like to believe,  socialism is far from dead. It will survive. And nowhere is its  future as bright as it is in the Third World, the most exploited  part of human habitation," says the veteran CPI (Communist Party  of India) leader, Mr M. Farooqui.    "But to be effective, we need to be united," Mr Farooqui  acknowledges. It is this realisation that has brought the two  principal Left parties, the CPI and the CPM (Communist Party of  India-Marxist) closer to each other. Only recently, the general  secretaries of the two parties, Mr Indrajit Gupta and Mr  Harkishen Singh Surjeet, issued a joint circular, calling for  the setting up of inter-party coordination committees at the  state level.    For those who like to keep track of dates, it is significant  that the friendly vibes between the two parties have come in a  year that marks the 30th anniversary of the historic 1964 split  in the Communist Party of India. It is no less significant that  the CPI and the CPM have chosen Vijayawada as the venue of their  forthcoming joint rally in Andhra Pradesh, the first in a very  long time. It was in Vijayawada that the last party Congress of  the undivided CPI was held way back in 1961.    "We have recognised the vital importance of Left unity,"  says  the CPM politburo member, Mr Prakash Karat, "and are doing our  utmost to achieve it." The recent central committee meeting of  the CPM in Calcutta devoted considerable time to a discussion on  this issue. The meeting, at least informally, also discussed the  possibilities of identifying allies with whom the party could  have electoral adjustments.    As a senior Left leader put it, "The unity of the Left and  democratic forces is the only way to meet the threat from  right-wing, communal and fascist parties." During the last few  years, the Left has been holding on to the shirt tail of the  National Front led by Mr V.P. Singh's Janata Dal. But now that  the National Front has withered away and the Janata Dal is  nothing but a shadow of its past, the Left has no option but to  choose new partners for itself.    On the face of it, many consider Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav's  Samajwadi Party (SP) to be an ideal partner of the Left as Yadav  not only calls himself a socialist but, had once even described  his party as a "real Left party."    Though he still has a lot of respect and goodwill for the  Left, Mr Yadav is more than a bit miffed about the manner in  which the Left Front "ditched" him during the recent assembly  elections in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] "If the Left had stood by us  as we had expected it to do, we would have got an absolute  majority in the House," Mr Yadav says. Mr Yadav has another  reason to be cautious about any understanding with the Left. His  comrade-in-arms, Mr Kanshi Ram of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP),  has been involved in a bitter war of words with Communist  leaders over who really represents the poor and the downtrodden  in the country. And Mr Yadav, can ill afford to antagonise Mr  Kanshi Ram at this juncture.    Fundamental differences between the mainline Communist  parties like the CPI and the CPM on the one hand and the "Far  Left" represented by groups like the Indian People's Front (IPF)  have been stumbling blocks in the way of a broader Left unity.    The radical Left has made its presence felt among the  student  community. "With our string of successes in university elections  across the Hindi heartland, we are beginning to be noticed,"  says Mr Vinod Mishra, the firebrand Naxalite who came overground  sometime ago to head the Liberation group of the CPI  (Marxist-Leninist), a major constituent of the IPF.    The campuses that were won over by the All India Students'  Association (AISA), the students' wing of the IPF, include the  Benaras Hindu University, -- for long a stronghold of the Akhil  Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a BJP (Bharatiya Janata  Party) affiliate. Apart from storming the "saffron bastion" of  U.P., the AISA humbled the Students' Federation of India (SFI),  a CPM affiliate, in the Jawaharlal Nehru University students'  union elections.    "There are persisting differences among the various Left  groups but a functional unity is within our reach," feels Mr  Mishra. After all, he says, the SFI and AISA activists  cooperated with each other during the recent students' agitation  in Bihar.    For many Left watchers, the Communist movement in India can  survive only if the Left parties change gears to keep pace with  developments worldwide. Leaders like Mr Farooqui are already  beginning to look at China and Vietnam as role models. Both  these countries, he says, have pushed through economic reforms  while maintaining a tight leash on the political structure of  their countries. China, he points out, has opened up its economy  but has taken care to protect its national interests by refusing  to sign GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).    But, Left watchers point out that economic reforms is not  the  only aspect of "changing gears." They refer to the faint signs  of a schism within the principal Left parties on the ticklish  issue of internal democracy. The expulsion of Ms K.R. Gowri, a  Communist to the core and a pioneer in evolving progressive  agrarian reforms in Kerala, from the CPM for raising a voice of  dissent, is seen by many as "counter-productive" to the party's  interests. Mr Karat, however, disagrees. "The party is more  important than any individual. The individual is what he or she  is because of the party," he says.    Left leaders, however, agree that a certain amount of  flexibility is essential to bring about Left unity. Both Mr  Farooqui and Mr Karat are unanimous in the view that a joint  struggle against the economic policies of the government can be  an effective first step in uniting "Left and democratic forces."</p>

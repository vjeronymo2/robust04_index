			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> We are avid "Knots Landing" fans who have been watching for four years now. We  were extremely disappointed with this year's anticlimactic season finale. The  show's writers have left us with no reason to watch the season opener this  fall.  </P> <P> Rebecca Williams, Michelle Dessert Santa Barbara  </P></p>

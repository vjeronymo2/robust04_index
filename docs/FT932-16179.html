			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / People: Backhouse takes seat at Ipeco Now that Ipeco founder Allan Johnson has been elevated to the life presidency, his son Christopher, 45, is getting down to transforming a private family business, which specialises in making aircrew seats, into a successful public company. The recruitment of a new finance director, Chris Backhouse, 36, from Ernst &amp; Young, the company's auditors, is the latest in a number of moves to modernise the Ipeco boardroom. Backhouse replaces John Cook, who resigned in January after 12 years with the company. Although Ipeco's announcement of marginally lower 1992 pre-tax profits, of Pounds 3.3m, is regarded as a reasonable performance in a recession, Johnson acknowledges that his company has not lived up to expectations in the six years since it floated a minority of its shares on the stock market. Its profits have been on a plateau and its share price is still well below the 120p issue price. One of the problems has been the rather incestuous nature of Ipeco's board, and Johnson turned to Pro Ned, the Bank of England-backed body which helps find independent non-executive directors. Since the start of the year Ipeco has appointed two new non-executive directors - Julian Bell, former chairman of Rayner Coffee International, and Alan Hornsby, a retired finance director of Smiths Industries. Johnson is still looking for a new executive director to head the engineering side, the smaller of Ipeco's two core businesses, to complete his four-person executive team. Although he has no immediate plans to split the role of chairman and chief executive, he does not rule it out in a couple of years' time, if the business grows as quickly as he hopes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held its third  plenary meeting on the afternoon of 15 March to hear an  explanation on the draft budget law; an explanation on the draft  decision on authorizing the Xiamen City People's Congress, its  Standing Committee, and the Xiamen city people's government to  separately enact laws and regulations for implementation in the  Xiamen Special Economic Zone; and reports on the work of the NPC  Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme  People's Procuratorate. A few other topics were also discussed  at today's meeting.    The State Council submitted the draft budget law to the NPC  Standing Committee in October 1993 for examination. Based on  the examination opinions of members of NPC special committees  and of its Standing Committee, the State Council made another  revision to the draft law. Entrusted by the State Council, Liu  Zhongli gave an explanation at the meeting concerning some major  issues in the draft law.    Liu Zhongli said: Over the years, because China has not had  legal stipulations governing budgetary management, there have  been many problems in the preparation, examination, approval,  implementation, adjustment, final settlement, and supervision of  budget. For instance, the procedures for budget preparation  have not been clearly set out, the authority and responsibility  of budgetary management have not been clearly defined,  examination and approval of budgets have not been strictly  carried out, budgets have not been faithfully implemented, and  supervision over budget implementation has not been effective,  resulting in the budget's lack of legal effectiveness. The 14th  CPC National Congress laid down the goal of establishing a  socialist market economic system, stressing the need to give  full play to the financial work's macroeconomic regulation and  control role in establishing a socialist market economic system  and in refining it. In this situation, it has become a pressing  need to quicken the pace of financial reform to improve the  state's macroeconomic management. At the same time, we also  urgently need to clearly define in legal terms the budget  management authority of organs of power, government organs, and  finance departments at all levels, as well as of all departments  and units; and to improve management and strengthen supervision  over the preparation, examination, approval, and implementation  of budget, in order to ensure healthy economic and social  development. Therefore, enacting the Budget Law is very  necessary.    Liu Zhongli also gave an explanation on the guiding thought  for enacting the Budget Law and on some major issues in the  draft Budget Law.    Entrusted by the NPC Standing Committee, Xue Ju, chairman of  the NPC Law Committee, made an explanation on the "NPC Decision  on Authorizing the Xiamen City People's Congress, Its Standing  Committee, and the Xiamen City People's Government To Separately  Enact Laws and Regulations for Implementation in the Xiamen  Special Economic Zone (Draft)."    Xue Ju said: The Xiamen Special Economic Zone [SEZ] is one  of the country's earliest SEZ's, as well as a SEZ with the State  Council's approval to implement some free port policies and to  carry out comprehensive reform of the urban economic system.  Considering the Xiamen SEZ's development needs, the NPC Law  Committee suggests that the NPC Standing Committee table a  motion to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC to authorize the  Xiamen City People's Congress and its Standing Committee, taking  into consideration the SEZ's reality and needs, based on the  Constitution, and according to the basic principle of  established laws and administrative regulations, to enact laws  and regulations for implementation in the Xiamen SEZ; and to  submit the enacted laws and regulations to the NPC Standing  Committee, the State Council, and the Fujian Provincial People's  Congress Standing Committee for the record. It is also  suggested that the Second Session of the Eighth NPC authorize  the Xiamen city people's government to enact related regulations  for implementation in the Xiamen SEZ.    Entrusted by the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, Vice  Chairman Tian Jiyun delivered a report on the NPC Standing  Committee's work over the past year and the main tasks for the  coming year.    In the report, Tian Jiyun said: In the past year, the  Standing Committee conscientiously carried out the various  duties prescribed in the Constitution, strengthened economic  legislation, improved supervisory systems, promoted reform and  development, and safeguarded socialist stability, thereby making  headway in all fields: 1. giving economic legislation top  priority and scoring notable achievements in legislative work;  2. striving to improve and strengthen supervision and further  perfecting supervisory mechanisms; 3. earnestly handling  motions and suggestions of deputies and forging close ties with  the masses; 4. actively developing exchanges with foreign  parliaments and creating a favorable international environment  for China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; and 5.  intensifying efforts to build up its organizations and bringing  into play the role of its special committees.    Tian Jiyun pointed out: We must be aware of the shortcomings  and defects in our work. They are reflected mainly in the  incompatibility of legislative work with the needs of reform,  opening up, and economic expansion; in the weak links in  supervisory work, especially inadequate inspection and  supervision over law enforcement; and in the organizational  construction of the Standing Committee, which still cannot meet  the requirements under the new situation.    To this end, Tian Jiyun called for efforts in the work of  four areas: continuing to give economic legislation top priority  so as to establish a legal system that conforms with a socialist  market economy; paying close attention to the inspection and  supervision of law enforcement to facilitate the implementation  of various reform programs; enhancing the awareness of law in  all of society to create a sound legal environment for reform  and construction; and intensifying the Standing Committee's  organizational construction and training a strong contingent of  NPC cadres.    At the plenary meeting, Ren Jianxin, president of the  Supreme  People's Court, and Zhang Siqing, procurator general of the  Supreme People's Procuratorate, also delivered reports on the  work of the court and the procuratorate.    Ren Jianxin discussed the following aspects of the court's  work last year: persistently cracking down on crimes to  safeguard social stability; severely punishing serious economic  crimes to facilitate the deepening of the anticorruption drive;  using judicial means to regulate economic relations and promote  the development of a market economy; conducting trials to  protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens and  corporations; and strictly enforcing laws and stepping up  efforts to improve the quality of court personnel.    Ren Jianxin said: In 1994, the guiding ideology for the work  of courts throughout the country is to be guided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line; to earnestly  implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and  to adhere to the principle of "grasping two links at the same  time" in strictly enforcing laws, striving to improve judicial  quality, and reforming and perfecting the judicial system so as  to provide a strong judicial guarantee for maintaining social  stability, for accelerating the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure, and for maintaining a sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the economy.    Discussing the overall procuratorial work in 1993, Zhang  Siqing said: In the past year, the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, in the light of the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC,  carried out various procuratorial activities in line with the  principle of "strictly enforcing laws and relentlessly handling  criminal cases." People's procuratorates throughout the country  and military, railway, and other special tribunals reinforced  their legal supervision function. They devoted a lot of effort  to handling major embezzlement and bribery cases, severely  dealing with criminal cases, and cases involving infringement of  people's democratic rights and dereliction of duty were also  handled, thereby making positive contributions to maintaining  national and social stability, and safeguarding the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the  smooth progress of modernization construction.    Zhang Siqing said: The main tasks of the procuratorial work  at the present and for some time to come are: persisting in  taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as the guide, implementing the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, adhering to  the principle of "grasping two links at the same time,"  strengthening supervision over law enforcement, strictly  enforcing law and relentlessly handling criminal cases,  concentrating efforts on investigating and handling major and  serious cases of embezzlement and bribery, cracking down on  serious criminal offenses, safeguarding state interests from  being infringed upon, protecting lawful rights of citizens and  corporations, and ensuring political and social stability, so as  to create a sound legal environment for reform, opening up, and  modernization and to facilitate the establishment and  development of a socialist market economic structure.    The meeting voted to approve a decision to accept Yang  Yanyin's request to resign as a member of the NPC Standing  Committee, as well as the election procedures for the Second  Session of the Eighth NPC. According to the election procedures,  the number of candidates for additional members of the NPC  Standing Committee to be elected will be the same as that to be  elected; and they shall be elected through secret ballots.

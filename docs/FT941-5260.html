			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Rappers win copyright suit Rap music won out over country rock yesterday when the Supreme Court decided a landmark copyright lawsuit in favour of rappers 2 Live Crew. The Court ruled unanimously that 2 Live Crew's raucous version of the 1964 Roy Orbison hit 'Oh, Pretty Woman' was a fair parody that could not be blocked by Acuff-Rose Music, holders of the copyright. The case, which makes clear for the first time that commercial parody may constitute 'fair use' under the copyright laws, has pitted not just rappers, whose music often uses samples of well-known rock hits, but also satirists and free speech advocates against a galaxy of famous song writers. Mr Luther Campbell, 2 Live Crew's lead singer and song writer, had originally sought permission to use 'Oh, Pretty Woman' and offered to pay royalties to Acuff-Rose. That permission was refused. Justice David Souter, ruled that it made no difference whether the parody was in good or bad taste. 2 Live Crew used the bass riff of the Orbison original, as well as its first line: 'Pretty woman, walking down the street  .' It continues in a more bawdy vein, however. More than Dollars 13m in royalty payments was at stake in the case. The Supreme Court rejected the copyright holder's absolute right to refuse permission for the parody, but it sent the case back to a lower court for further evaluation of how much of the original song was used, and the extent to which the parody might harm the market for the original.</p>

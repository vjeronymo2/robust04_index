			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: Security that money schemes cannot buy Sir, Philip Chappell ('Time to unmask a pensions charade', March 13) correctly points out that money purchase pension schemes (of which personal pensions are an expensive variant) can produce splendid pensions - but only with luck. That is the fundamental weakness - the amount of pension depends on the investment returns over decades (unforecastable) and on interest rates at the very date of retirement (anybody's guess). Money purchase schemes produce princes and paupers, but the individual cannot know which he will be until he retires, by which time it will be too late to do anything about it. Final salary schemes have strengths and weaknesses. The latter can be removed if the next government acts in the spirit of the social security select committee's recent report. Those people fortunate enough to be members of final salary schemes can plan their retirement knowing what at least part of their retirement income will be in relation to prices at the time, ie what it will be in 'real terms'. That is something money purchase schemes cannot do. Money purchase schemes have already been discredited once as the result of inflation from the 1960s onwards. Does society have to learn that lesson all over again? V J Chambers, Watson House, London Road, Reigate, Surrey RH2 9PQ</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Lonely street Tory candidate Mr Rob Hayward (above) was expressing confidence yesterday as the people of Christchurch went to the polls amid a blaze of media publicity, Gillian Tett writes. In spite of blustery weather, business was brisk at the 46 polling stations in the Dorset seaside town to cast their votes for one of the 14 candidates. Mr Peter Coupland, a Conservative party teller, said: 'We have never seen it like this before in Christchurch. This by-election has attracted more activity than all the recent general elections put together.' Pensioners make up a third of the area's population and all parties arranged cars to take hundreds of elderly voters to the booths. The Liberal Democrats claimed record levels of volunteers to support their candidate, Mrs Diana Maddock. One organiser said yesterday: 'The Tories are bringing their supporters in from nursing homes, and we want to make sure none of our lot forgets what day it is.' The fact that it was pension day, the organiser added, might have tempted more elderly voters than usual to venture out. Pensioners Mr and Mrs Stride said they had switched their support from the Tories, who are defending a 23,000 majority, to the Liberal Democrats because they were fed up with 'VAT on fuel, crime and all those political shenanigans we've seen on telly'. Mrs Gay Peek said her entire family had decided to stay with the Conservatives 'because it would be very silly to have a hung parliament'. Mrs Bridget Gee, who had brought her grandchild to the poll, said she was deserting Labour and its candidate Mr Nigel Lickley on pragmatic grounds. 'I voted Labour before,' she said. 'But this time I'll vote Liberal because I think they have a chance.' Photograph by Ashley Ashwood</p>

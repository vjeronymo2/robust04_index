			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- Consumer markets in our  country have shown steady signs of brisk growth since the  beginning of this year. During the first quarter, the total  retail volume of consumer goods amounted to 352.24 billion yuan,  up 25.2 percent from last year's corresponding period. After  being adjusted for price increases, the sale volume rose 5  percent in real terms, thus maintaining the strong momentum of  steady growth.    Consumer markets in our country are well stocked this year.  According to a breakdown of consumer goods based on an analysis  of supply and demand by relevant departments, supply and demand  are basically balanced for 58.7 percent of the 726 major  commodities, whereas the supply of 29.7 percent of the  commodities outstrips demand. Sales of various brand-name,  special, and new products have increased sharply. In the food  category, brand-name foods and beverages, as well as fresh fruit  and aquatic products, have enjoyed extremely brisk sales. Among  clothing and accessories, brisk sales of cashmere and fur  clothing, underwear, and leather shoes have continued unabated.  Among daily necessities, the sale volume of home electrical  appliances has increased 30 percent or more in some areas when  compared to last year's corresponding year. Sales of cameras,  videocassette recorders, and some small home electrical  appliances have consistently been strong.    As urban and rural markets go, last year's vast disparity  between consumer markets in urban and rural areas has begun to  narrow as consumer markets in rural markets have grown more  rapidly. Increases in peasants' incomes have somewhat improved  purchasing power. During the first quarter, the retail sales  volume of consumer goods at or below the county level totaled  142.5 billion yuan, up 22.3 percent from last year's  corresponding period. The retail sales volume of consumer goods  in the cities was 209.8 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent from last  year's same period. Hainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and  Tianjin are among the regions which posted increases of 30  percent or more in their total retail sales volumes of consumer  goods.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will hold a second round of negotiations on financial services  under the "framework" trade talks in Washington next week, a  Japanese official said Wednesday.    Working-level negotiators are expected to meet on financial  services as they are scheduled to meet again for insurance  talks, the Finance Ministry official told reporters on condition  of anonymity. Financial service talks kicked off in Paris  earlier this month.    The U.S. is urging Japan to allow investment advisory firms  to enter the Japanese pension market and to ease regulations on  the securities business.    The official said, "It's still not a matter of making  progress" as the talks have just started.</p>

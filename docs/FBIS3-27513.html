			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Special dispatch: "Beijing Orders Reduction in </F> Outside-the-Border Activities To Invite Investment"]    [Text] Beijing, 16 February (LIEN HO PAO) -- This year,  the number of large-scale investment promotion exhibitions held  outside of China by various localities will be significantly  reduced.    The relevant department in the State Council has issued an  order that all the plans of provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities for holding investment attraction activities in  Hong Kong and other places abroad must be submitted to the  relevant authorities in the State Council for examination and  approval. Such examination will be even stricter with  applications filed by counties, cities (at the county level),  and individual enterprises. Besides reporting to the government  immediately above them for examination, they must also seek  approval from the relevant authorities in the State Council.  This injunction emphasizes that all kinds of investment  attraction activities must put practical results first.    In the meantime, the relevant authorities in the State  Council also stated that all forms of investment attraction  activities and all kinds of festivals that let "economic and  trade activities steal the show on the stage of cultural events"  conducted by various localities must be brought under overall  planning.    This measure is taken because the excessive amount of  investment attraction activities in the past have caused many  negative consequences.    One is that there are too many "sham foreign investors."  Many investments supposedly made by foreign investors and  foreign-funded enterprises are actually the funds of mainland  organizations that have returned after being taken outside the  border to get a different signature. The purpose is to avoid  profit delivery and to enjoy the preferential policies  applicable to foreign investments in such areas as taxation and  goods import and export. The other result is that the  percentage of foreign investments that were actually fed into  the projects when required is extremely low. The flooding  investment attraction activities have led to an unhealthy  tendency of boasting, exaggeration, and lying. As a result,  letters of intent and agreements involving huge investments that  cannot be materialized are all over the place. The third  consequence is the appalling waste of money in organizing such  activities.    At some investment attraction events outside the country (or  border), the size of the delegations is getting bigger and  bigger and they are going in for escalating ostentation and  extravagance. Some of them enjoy sightseeing abroad at public  expense under the pretext of inviting investments and even go so  far as to resort to fraud and deception.    In view of this, in order to put an end to the corrupt  tendencies in economic activities, the State Council, in good  time, issued to all localities in the country a "red-letterhead  document" containing stern measures, putting a firm check on  investment attraction activities held in Hong Kong and other  places abroad. Whoever disobeys the order will be prosecuted.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: Mikhail Baryshnikov - Ballet The saddest words in ballet are 'But you should have seen him (or her) when . . .' When the muscles were resilient, the style uncorrupted, the dance fresh. On Saturday night Mikhail Baryshnikov danced at Sadler's Wells with his White Oaks Project, on the second evening of a two-day visit, and ah] you should have seen him then. At an age - he is in his 46th year - when most male dancers have retired, or should have retired, Baryshnikov is dancing with sublimest grace, artistry, physical resource. He has, for several years, eschewed the classic repertory which he illuminated permanently for us with his physical genius. Instead, he has found and inspired roles - notably from Twyla Tharp and Mark Morris - which examine his still dazzling prowess. And he remains what he was when we first saw him in the Kirov season of 1970, a uniquely gifted and uniquely satisfying dancer. In this White Oaks programme he danced Mark Morris's Three Preludes, a solo set to Gershwin's piano studies; Twyla Tharp's Pergolesi, an extended and bravura exercise using six movements from Pergolesi string concerti; and he was a member of the ensemble in Morris's Mosaic and United, which realises two string quartets by Henry Cowell. The programme was completed by Hanya Holm's gruesome Jocose, in which the other White Oaks dancers were called upon to be oh-so-roguish to the Ravel violin sonata. Someone had better get the sonata to a dry cleaner quickly: such choreography is dangerous. A distinguishing quality of Baryshnikov's dancing has ever been its clarity. The classicist's ideal of movement pure, sharply-drawn and impeccably shaped, is always realised in his art. This was what Leningrad training brought to a God-given physical instrument. And this is still a glorious constant of his art, allied to that other, and intensely personal, gift of seamless, huge-spanned phrasing. We see the dance as an essence, unalloyed and potent, set in long lines of beautiful and subtly-conceived activity. Baryshnikov now is, miraculously, Baryshnikov then. In Three Preludes (in black trousers and top; white socks, vest, gloves) Mark Morris sets him exploring Gershwin's relaxed and jazzy writing. Baryshnikov is insouciantly brilliant, deep inside the syncopations, playing with rhythm, phenomenally exact in line and accent. He takes on the shape of the music - and of its historical period. In Pergolesi, Twyla Tharp offers a culmination of her long association with Baryshnikov's dancing, which dates back to Push Comes to Shove in 1976, and encompasses such varied pieces as The Little Ballet and Sinatra Songs. Baryshnikov, in white, dances tirelessly in a sequence of numbers that show him, as always in Tharp choreography, riding on waves of energy and rhythm, cutting classic steps into fresh and off-beat shapes, whipping into a movement and suddenly holding it in suspension. Mercurial in its physical aspects, light in touch as in execution, the piece is by turns mocking - Baryshnikov sends up with sharpest wit his own repertory, Giselle's wilis, Nijinsky's roles - and shot with intense feeling. It is about Baryshnikov in several ways - as virtuoso, as repository of a great tradition, as balletic icon. It is a magnificent study, sublimely danced by an artist whose greatness we recognised when we saw him dance Jacobson's Vestris solo in 1970 - and in an odd way Pergolesi recalls that earlier exercise, too - and whose greatness is undiminished, and even more rewarding, today. Mark Morris's Mosaic and Untitled is new this year, and very fine. Henry Cowell's string quartets are mysterious, introspective music, haunted by glissandi and shimmering sonorities, with dark shifts of mood. Morris fleshes them out with movement no less questioning, because firmly rooted in the scores. Baryshnikov and the White Oaks troupe are caught up in unexplained meetings, secrets, and a stunningly clever burst of fake folk dance (clearly dictated by Cowell's writing). It is a stimulating work - like a Paul Klee come to life - and is admirably danced. Baryshnikov and White Oaks must return soon.</p>

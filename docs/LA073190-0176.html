			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VINCENT SPELLS OUT YANKEE RESTRICTIONS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: THE TEAM MUST SEEK AMERICAN LEAGUE APPROVAL FOR ITS MAJOR  FRONT-OFFICE MOVES.  </P> <P> The New York Yankees must seek American League approval for all major  front-office moves during the next five years and must certify every six months  that George Steinbrenner has not participated in team decisions.  </P> <P> On Monday, Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent forced Steinbrenner to give up  control of the team for paying a known gambler to get damaging information on  former Yankee Dave Winfield. (Story, C1.) In today's order, Vincent spelled out  his restrictions on the team and its dealings with Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> According to the four-page order, the Yankees must seek approval of "the  hiring, firing, promotion, demotion or reassignment of any officer of the  club." The order doesn't apply to the hiring and firing of managers.  </P> <P> In addition, the Yankees must get league approval to sue or file a grievance  against a player and to hire lawyers and investigators involved with player  dealings.  </P> <P> "Except as otherwise provided . . . no Yankees officials or employees shall  confer, consult, advise or otherwise communicate, either directly or  indirectly, with George M. Steinbrenner III on any matter involving the New  York Yankees or baseball until further order of the commissioner," Vincent  ordered. "If such communication, either direct or indirect, occurs, a  responsible club official shall immediately notify the American League  president."  </P> <P> Vincent said any violation of his order "shall be deemed conduct not in the  best interests of baseball" and will subject Yankee officials "to the  discipline of this office."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner co-signed the order and in a separate seven-page agreement  accepted that his conduct was not in the best interests of baseball.  </P> <P> Also, the Yankees must certify in writing to the AL president every six months  that Steinbrenner has had no involvement with the team.  </P> <P> In a scathing 11-page decision, Vincent chastised Steinbrenner for starting a  relationship with Howard Spira, a 31-year-old gambler from the Bronx, N.Y., and  then for giving Spira $40,000 in January.  </P></p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Shopping without tears, a food lover's armchair guide - Nicholas Lander sorts out the best British postal suppliers for your Christmas poultry and game, fish and meats, cheeses and oils, treats and sweetmeats for the Christmas and new year holiday season Three factors have led me to spend another lengthy period on the phone talking to Britain's most individualistic suppliers and retailers. The first was hearing from many readers how useful this guide has been not just in the hectic run-up to Christmas but during the rest of the year. Bulky boxes of food delivered to your door can save you time and backache. In talking to these suppliers I also realised how widely last year's guide was appreciated. One Lancashire supplier received a phone call and orders from a reader in Canada while another, based in London, was soon packing orders for Eire and Norway. Finally, there is the growing conviction among suppliers that they have weathered the worst - the recession and the costly imposition of new health regulations - and they can now concentrate on producing first class ingredients.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 12 January, Acting Ukrainian Prime  Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and Valeriy Remizov, first deputy  chairman of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, discussed  the preparation of an intergovernmental agreement on Russian  natural gas exports to Ukraine and its transit across Ukraine to  European countries. It was announced by DerzhKomNaftoHaz  [Ukraine State Oil and Gas Committee] that the duration of this  agreement would be until 2005, providing for annual gas  deliveries to the volume of 50-70 billion cubic meters. Ukraine  will pay for some of the gas by constructing housing and by  developing the social infrastructure in Russia, in particular in  Stavropol Kray, as well as selling housing in Ukraine to  Gazprom.    Plans have already been drawn up for 125,00 square meters of  housing at a price of $500 per square meter. A document will be  prepared on Russia's use of Ukrainian gas storage facilities  with a volume of 30 billion cubic meters. The possibility was  discussed of selling Ukrainian-made rail tankers, AN-74  aircraft, and fishing vessels to Russia. However, the issue of  their price was not settled.    In accordance with the intersectoral agreement, in 1994  Gazprom is to supply approximately 60 billion cubic meters of  gas at $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. The issue of a payments  procedure in respect of the gas was discussed. In order to pay  for the transit of gas across Ukraine, Gazprom accountants  pointed out, Russia must be paid for the gas supplied, rather  than paying irrespective of gas deliveries. Otherwise there  will be taxation problems. It was decided that payment for  transit would be offset by additional gas deliveries.    The date of signing the intergovernmental agreement is yet  to  be announced.</p>

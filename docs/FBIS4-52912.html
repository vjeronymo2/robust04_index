			<p>BFN     [Text] The subduing inter-party political bickering over  former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung's role has been rekindled  when he stressed the need for a summit meeting between the  United States and North Korea Thursday.    The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) yesterday came up  with criticism of Kim's remarks while the main opposition  Democratic Party (DP) quickly refuted the charges.    "Kim made inappropriate remarks at an improper time," said  DLP chief policy-maker Yi Se-ki in a meeting of party leaders.    Kim, chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the  Asia- Pacific Region, asserted at the National Press Club in  Washington that President Bill Clinton has to send former  President Jimmy Carter to North Korea as an envoy and invite  North Korean leader Kim Il-song to the United States in an  effort to resolve the North's nuclear issue.    "Worries are that the remarks, in the long run, could  trigger  chaos in our government's policy toward North Korea," Yi, former  head of unification policy, noted.    Party spokesman Pak Pom-chin saw Kim's comment as  nonfulfillment of his promise to stay away from political  affairs for good.    "Although Chairman Kim referred to an international  political  issue, his remarks are affecting domestic politics," Pak said.    Party chief policy coordinator Pak Nam-chi said it doesn't  make sense to send a famous human rights campaigner (Carter) to  an inhumane country (North Korea) as an emissary.    Another DLP official said he can't but suspect that there is  a political purpose behind Kim's proposal for the Clinton-Kim  meeting, given that Chairman Kim knows Kim Il-song has  "acrophobia."    "Chairman Kim should clarify his position on whether he will  come back to the center stage of politics or will leave the  political community," the official said.    The DLP criticism, however, immediately met with a backlash  from opposition DP lawmakers, most of whom are followers of Kim,  the former presidential candidate of the DP.    DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said in a statement that Chairman  Kim's remarks on the nuclear issue have drawn favorable  responses from international communities as well as from  domestic media. "But it is regretful that only the DLP has  responded emotionally and overreacted to the comments," Pak  said. The spokesman also said unification matters should be  handled by the government as the DLP has pointed out, but the  government should guarantee free research activities and  announcements on the issue by individuals or groups.    DP lawmaker Namkung Chin expressed displeasure with what he  said was the DLP's sensitive reaction, saying that Chairman Kim  made such a proposal with a true desire to serve the people  after he inaugurated the foundation for world peace and national  unification.    The inter-party confrontation was sparked amid subduing  tensions after the DLP dismissed the chief party spokesman last  week with regard to his criticism of Kim. The former spokesman  charged that Kim was behind the political deadlock between the  ruling and opposition parties over the controversial Sangmudae  political fund scandal, creating an outcry from opposition  lawmakers.</p>

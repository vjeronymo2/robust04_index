			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Bomb blast damages tourist buses in Egypt A BOMB explosion damaged seven empty tour buses parked yards away from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo's busiest square yesterday, one of a series of attacks a week after Egyptian security forces launched a tough crackdown on suspected Islamic militants. Tourists had left the buses for the Egyptian Museum, one of Cairo's most popular attractions, just 100 yards away. No one claimed responsibility. But it appeared a defiant gesture from Islamic militants who have waged sporadic attacks on tourist targets for much of the past year - considerably hurting Egypt's precious tourism earnings. The explosion took place during the midday rush in Tahrir Square, scene last month of a coffee-shop bombing which killed three. It came in the teeth of tightened security at all Egypt's tourist centres and intensified operations against suspected members of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the underground Islamic group behind most recent attacks. Bus drivers in Tahrir Square said their vehicles had been searched for bombs just 30 minutes before the blast. An explosive device was also defused in a building housing 'foreign experts' in a Cairo suburb, according to the semi-official al-Ahram news agency. The US embassy on Monday called in around 40 members of the US business community to discuss security, following a threat earlier this month by Gama'a al-Islamiyya to attack foreign investments. The embassy stressed only that businesses should step up routine precautions.</p>

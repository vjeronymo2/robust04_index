			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Swedish budget deficit up Sweden's centre-right government yesterday admitted the budget deficit would exceed forecasts, rising to almost 15 per cent of gross domestic product and remaining among the highest in western Europe, writes Hugh Carnegy from Stockholm. Mrs Anne Wibble, finance minister, said the deficit for the 1993-1994 year was now forecast to rise to SKr215bn (Pounds 17.8bn), from an estimated SKr205bn when the budget was passed by parliament. The government's borrowing requirement was forecast to hit SKr270bn, SKr15bn more than previously estimated.</p>

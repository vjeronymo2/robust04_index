			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT SEEKS $5-MILLION FINE AGAINST ROCKWELL  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that they will seek a $5-million fine against  Rockwell International Corp. for overbilling the government on a sophisticated  satellite navigation contract.  </P> <P> In a sentencing report filed in Los Angeles federal court, the U.S. attorney's  office said the stiff fine is intended "to send a message of unparalleled  clarity to all defense contractors that fraud on the government -- and the lies  and deception that go with it -- will not be tolerated as simply a cost of  doing business."  </P> <P> One of the two employees indicted in the case, Robert L. Zavodnik of Fountain  Valley, was sentenced Tuesday to a year's probation.  </P> <P> Prosecutors did not seek a jail term in the case, citing Zavodnik's cooperation  in the investigation after his guilty plea and the fact that his boss, Donald  Carter, was acquitted at trial in December. Zavodnik claimed that Carter told  him to cover up the overbilling.  </P> <P> Rockwell entered a conditional guilty plea last month to two felony charges in  an indictment charging the company and the two employees with overbilling the  Air Force by nearly $450,000 on contracts for the $1.2-billion NAVSTAR global  positioning system.  </P> <P> As part of the plea agreement, Rockwell admitted that it was in contempt of an  earlier court order stemming from a previous overbilling case but reserved its  right to appeal the present conviction by arguing that it had uncovered the new  fraud itself and sought to correct it.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Attys. George B. Newhouse Jr. and Stephen A. Mansfield urged  U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall to impose a fine commensurate with  Rockwell's profits on the NAVSTAR project, which are projected at $176 million  through the nearly 10-year life of the production contract. A hearing is  scheduled for Friday.  </P> <P> Rockwell's overall net profits last year totaled $812 million.  </P> <P> "The point is, if the government is going to have an impact in cases like this,  dealing with multimillion-dollar projects, you're going to have to have  multimillion-dollar fines," Newhouse said.  </P> <P> Government prosecutors said an earlier admission in which Rockwell acknowledged  shifting costs from the NAVSTAR project to the space shuttle project also  warrants a substantial fine.  </P> <P> "These sanctions will ensure that limited investigatory resources and court  time need never again be used to prosecute the conduct of this large, publicly  held corporation, which has no business now or ever standing as a convict  before the bar of this court," the government said in its sentencing report.  </P> <P> Rockwell has maintained that top-level corporate officials had no knowledge of  the double-billing scheme, which occurred at the company's Satellite Systems  Division in Downey and Seal Beach. When evidence of wrongdoing on the part of  employees at the division came to light, they said, Rockwell corrected it and  reported it to the federal authorities under the government's voluntary  disclosure program.  </P> <P> Stung by the subsequent indictment, Rockwell reserved the right to appeal the  guilty plea on the basis of allegations that the government acted improperly by  indicting the company for conduct the company had voluntarily disclosed.  </P> <P> Government prosecutors say the company reported the overbilling long after  government auditors began asking questions about it. Prosecutors also said in  their sentencing report that there is evidence that at least some higher-level  employees at Rockwell, including Global Positioning System program manager  James R. Eyman, knew about either the overbilling or the cover-up. Eyman, who  has not been charged, has denied any knowledge or participation in the scheme.  </P> <P> "If the cover-up were truly hatched by Carter and Zavodnik acting alone, to  serve some unarticulated interest of their own," the government's report said,  "why would they tell their superiors exactly what they were doing, both in oral  reports and written memoranda?  </P> <P> "The only rational conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence is that  corporate officials at Rockwell knew about the deception, knew that the  auditors were being told lies and approved, if not directed, that course of  action. There simply is no other credible explanation."  </P></p>

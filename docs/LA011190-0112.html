			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO HOLDS OFF PASADENA'S SECOND-HALF SURGE TO WIN, 85-74  </P> <P> El Camino lost its South Coast Conference basketball opener to a mediocre team  on Saturday, but last night the Warriors got revenge with an 85-74 victory over  Pasadena at the Lancer gym.  </P> <P> For one half the seventh-ranked Warriors (15-5, 1-1) took it out on the  Lancers, who made an incredible second-half effort to save their SCC opener.  </P> <P> Pasadena (10-11, 0-1) found it difficult to keep up with El Camino's intense  defense and fast-paced offense. The Warriors scored 12 unanswered points early  in the game, which put them ahead 18-5 with 13:35 left in the half.  </P> <P> Less than a minute later El Camino went on a nine-point run capped by freshman  Michael Houck's three-point play that gave the Warriors a 27-11 lead.  </P> <P> Pasadena's virtually non-existant shooting and an array of turnovers in the  first half assisted El Camino which held a 41-28 halftime edge.  </P> <P> The Warriors kept the streak going for the first part of the second half. With  14:34 left to play El Camino had a comfortable 21-point lead.  </P> <P> Perhaps El Camino got too comfortable because Pasadena shaved the lead to six  after David Phillips' three-point shot with 1:01 remaining in the game.  </P> <P> El Camino will travel to Cerritos for Saturday's SCC game at 7:30 p.m. IRENE  GARCIA  </P></p>

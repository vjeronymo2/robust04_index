			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ihor Hrushko: "Five Questions for the President"] </F>   [Text] Last Friday [25 Feb], speaking with journalists,  [Ukrainian President] L. Kravchuk confirmed he would not take  part in the June presidential elections. Because he believes  that an extremely complicated situation may take shape, when,  even after a second round of parliamentary elections, the  parliament will not be plenipotentiary due to the election of an  incomplete Supreme Council. As a result, it will not be able to  form a government. If, at the same time, the acting head of  state starts an election campaign and also elections to local  organs of executive power are conducted, then a total collapse  of power in the country may become imminent with unpredictable  consequences. Thus, out of the two possible variants -- to  abandon everything and proceed to presidential elections, or,  showing responsibility for the situation in the country, not to  do so -- L. Kravchuk opted for the latter.    Even though Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] stated that  political considerations had been the main ones in his decision,  one should not rule out moral aspects either. "In no other  country of the world will you hear such dirty slander, remarks  unworthy of cultured people, and provocations with regard to the  person of president, as I hear both within the walls of our  parliament and outside it," said L. Kravchuk.    Is it possible that he will revise his decision? Even though  the president did not give a straightforward answer, he remarked  that the decision depends upon many factors. In particular, it  depends on the election of a plenipotentiary parliament and the  formation by the latter of a new government. It is also  necessary, stressed L. Kravchuk, to determine what president  will be elected and with what powers. Unless we do this, there  again will be a power struggle between the legislative and  executive power structures. In Leonid Makarovych's opinion, the  same must be done with regard to the heads of local power  structures. Even prior to elections, the candidates must know  their rights and duties. For this, it is necessary to adopt a  special law.    "Many of your political opponents see Ukraine's economic  difficulties in its course toward independence and demand that  all ties with Russia be restored and that the `Belarusian  variant' be introduced in our country. What do you think of  this?," a HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent asked L. Kravchuk.    The restoration of all ties, believes the president, will  mean the return to or restoration of the Soviet Union, because  the old structure of industry will remain unchanged. Today,  this is absurd. Even [Russian President] B. Yeltsin pointed out  in a recent speech before parliament that Russia must produce  everything the Russians need. The same applies to Ukraine and  the whole of the CIS. In other words, while building states and  new economic structures, it is necessary to create a common  market of the CIS countries and to resolve, in a coordinated  manner, both economic and political questions. L. Kravchuk did  not support the idea of introducing the "Belarusian variant" in  Ukraine. Even if Russia had agreed to introduce a ruble zone in  our country, stressed Kravchuk, it would have demanded such  concessions as would totally eliminate our political and  economic independence.    What is the president's attitude toward the idea of  Ukraine's  federalization? In answering this question, L. Kravchuk pointed  out that, historically, a unitary state took shape in our  country. That is why, there is no sense in deliberately  dividing it into federative lands. On the other hand, he  stressed, Ukrainian regions must have extensive independence in  questions of budget, administration of state property, and so  on. Speaking about the Crimea, the president considers the 1990  decision on granting the peninsula the status of autonomy was  correct.    "If that had not been done," said L. Kravchuk, emphasizing  that it was the first time that he had spoken so openly about  it, "in 1990, there existed a real threat that the Supreme  Council of the former USSR would adopt a decision on separating  the Crimea from Ukraine. Today, the situation is different.  Especially after signing the Tripartite Statement, in  accordance with which both the United States and Russia made a  commitment to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity. As  regards relations with the present Crimean leadership, it is  necessary, believes Leonid Makarovych, to proceed along the road  of mutual understanding, and not confrontation. At the same  time, he stated, any actions aimed at separating the Crimea will  be regarded as illegal with corresponding consequences. This  crucial political issue must be taken into account by the  Crimean authorities.    At the journalists' request, the president also expressed  his  opinion on problems of privatization in Ukraine and our  society's emergence from the crisis.    At the end of the meeting, L. Kravchuk called upon all  citizens of Ukraine to take part in elections. In his opinion,  we must not allow chaos to prevail. Because it is a road toward  conflicts and confrontations.</p>

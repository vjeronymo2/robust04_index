			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report on talks between Croatian Prime Minister Nikica </F> Valentic and Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in Otocec ob  Krki on 14 May: "Positions Concerning Border Crossings  Coordinated"]    [Text] On Saturday Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic  and Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek met in Otocec ob Krki  to discuss the relations between the two countries and certain  contentious issues.    After the talks, Prime Minister Valentic told the reporters  that in the informal talks with Slovene Prime Minister Drnovsek  all the bilateral relations and problems between Croatia and  Slovenia were tackled. "We established that many operative  problems have been solved since the last time the Slovene prime  minister officially visited Croatia. These problems involve the  issue concerning Krsko, the signing of bilateral agreements, and  the verifications of these agreements by the Croatian Parliament.    We openly discussed other unsolved issues, such as the issue  of agreements concerning the property-rights relations, that is,  the regulation according to which it is still not possible in  Croatia to privatize companies owned by other republics, and we  believe that the Croatian Government will resolve that within a  short period.    We also discussed the well-known problem of Ljubljanska  Banka, and agreed that within 30 days the ministers of finance  will get in touch and propose an agreement acceptable to both  sides. We have also arranged an official visit of the Croatian  Government to Ljubljana in late June," said Nikica Valentic.    The Croatian prime minister also remarked that there was  talk  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees accommodated in the housing  owned by Slovene companies in Pineta, which, as he pointed out,  the Croatian Government considers a very complex problem. The  Croatian Government will fulfill its obligations regarding the  moving of the refugees from Pineta. The problem is that the  refugees are in such a psychological and physical state that  they are refusing to leave the facilities, and the Government  would not like to throw them out, although they have already  provided other accommodation for them.  <H5>  Commercial Prices for Pineta </H5>   We believe that we will be able to solve that problem within  a short period also, and the Croatian Government is prepared to  compensate for damages and all the costs that have arisen with  the refugees staying in the Slovenian companies' housing. We  are prepared to buy these facilities from all the Slovenian  companies, at commercial prices, and we will propose this to the  owners next week. Naturally, those who do not accept the offer  will remain owners, and retain all their rights, said prime  minister Valentic.    He also said that during the conversation with Slovene Prime  Minister Janez Drnovsek the border crossings were discussed.  "We believe we have coordinated our positions concerning all  the crossings," said Valentic, remarking that Plovanija is a  great problem for Croatia, since it is the main road entrance to  Croatia from the west and through Slovenia.    "The coming tourist season is very important for us, and  this  crossing, which is still an untidy building-site, represents a  great problem. Next week we will send a letter to the Slovene  Government and the public concerning this problem, and try to  find a temporary solution for this tourist season, and the  Croatian Government will provide guarantees that this does not  prejudice any solution for the border lines," said Valentic.    "We discussed the Piran Bay and supported the work of the  committees. The Slovene Government stayed by their demand, and  I believe that a solution acceptable to both sides will be  found. It is important that there have been no incidents and  that the cooperation between the police of the two countries is  very good," said Prime Minister Valentic. He stated that the  positions concerning the Yugoslav debts have been fully  coordinated, and "we have made a joint demand that the  succession process be speeded up. We have also agreed that  solidaristic guarantees of the former Yugoslav debts by  individual republics are out of the question. Instead, we want  to take our debts after the succession and regularly service  them, especially as Croatia and Slovenia can settle this debt.  We will have the succession process speeded up, as this is in  the interest of both countries," said the Croatian prime  minister.  <H5>  Friendly Relations With Italy </H5>   Speaking about the relations between the Republic of Croatia  and Italy, Valentic said that the joint position of the two  governments is that relations should be friendly, "because Italy  is one of the most important European countries, and one of the  most important neighbors must receive friendly treatment. We  also established that no country can accept any discussion, let  alone certain demands for the revision of the Osimo Accords, as  it would mean changing the borders with all the negative  consequences possible," said Prime Minister Nikica Valentic.    Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek said that a revision  of  relations and open issues was made. He stated that the last  meeting in Zagreb, held in February, was successful, saying that  "some of the difficult issues remained open then, such as the  Krsko nuclear power plant. The agreements concerning the plant  are being implemented, the financing is going well, and the  talks related to property issues are under way."    With regard to Ljubljanska Banka in Zagreb, the positions  are  different. Drnovsek said that Slovenia wants the problem to be  resolved within the succession of the former Yugoslavia, while  Croatia has a different proposal. Both sides have been  reviewing this problem, and some new solutions have been  proposed. The next meeting of the representatives of the two  countries is expected in June, which is when, as Drnovsek  believes, there will be changes concerning the issue of  Ljubljanska Banka.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Israelis ponder limited choice as poll nears: Despite the election, there is rapport between Rabin and Shamir WHEN Israel goes to the polls a week today, they will face a choice for prime minister between two men whose combined age is not far off 150, who have little natural affinity for the business of politics and whose respective parties harbour significant dissent over their leadership. One party - Labour - has made its septuagenarian, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the main focus of its campaign to unseat the ruling Likud party which it accuses of squandering a priceless opportunity for Israel through a foot-dragging approach to the Middle East peace negotiations launched last October in Madrid. Likud has by contrast given the lowest possible profile to Mr Yitzhak Shamir, party leader since 1983, prime minister since 1987 and now 76 years of age, in its effort to extend a 15-year run in government. Tonight Mr Rabin and Mr Shamir meet in their only television debate of the campaign. It will afford voters the opportunity to judge whether the two offer genuinely divergent paths for the country or whether their own preferred outcome to the election would be a coalition with each other. When Labour chose Mr Rabin to replace Mr Shimon Peres as its leader in February, it looked like a case of 'back to the future' for the party. Mr Rabin had been party leader and prime minister more than 15 years previously. He did not shine as prime minister and resigned over a minor financial scandal when his wife was revealed to hold illegal bank accounts in the US. He is a plodding orator who, like Mr Shamir, looks distinctly uncomfortable on the campaign trail. With a week to go to polling, he is already flushed and exhausted, his voice cracked and nagged by a smoker's cough. Both he and the prime minister must be glad that election broadcast rules forbid news coverage of their rallies and speeches. But Mr Rabin is trading on his genuine popularity as a former military hero and uncompromising defence minister. As the Labour party has hammered home over this month's 25th anniversary celebrations, he was chief of staff during the 1967 Six Day War. His whole election pitch is based on winning over Likud voters who traditionally regard Labour as too soft on security issues and ace talks. Mr Rabin undoubtedly differs sharply from Mr Shamir in his belief that Israel must give up some of the occupied territories captured in 1967 in exchange for peace. But in his campaign, this is hardly mentioned. In the town of Shelomi near the Lebanese border recently, Mr Rabin was hosted at a 'house call' by a family of former Likud supporters who are now backing Labour. Mr Rabin spent most of his address to a 150-strong crowd implying that it was he, not Mr Shamir and his colleagues in the Likud, who was more in the tradition of Mr Menachem Begin, the hardline Likud prime minister and darling of the party who died earlier this year. 'It is the Likud that has deserted you, not you that are deserting the Likud when you vote for us,' said Mr Rabin. The Likud rebuttal is that, far from stamping his authority on Labour, Mr Rabin's leadership is a front behind which the party's 'doves' are hiding. Supporters of a more radical approach to the peace process than Mr Rabin occupy a string of top positions in the party. A vote for Rabin, goes the Likud message in their nightly television broadcasts, is a vote for capitulation to the PLO. Likud's problem is the lack of a figurehead to rise above its chronic internal squabbles and overcome an image of corruption and economic incompetence born of having been so long in office. Nobody accuses Mr Shamir of being anything but a tough man of principle. But he lacks utterly the charisma of Mr Begin that Likud needs to inspire its increasingly cynical supporters. At Shamir rallies, when typically the prime minister he shakes a few hands then disappears by helicopter as fast as he can, pictures of Mr Begin are more prominent than his own, particularly among the majority Sephardim (Oriental Jews) who form such a vital segment of Likud support. 'The Sephardim looked for a father figure and found him in Begin. Shamir is a leader, but he's not a father figure,' says Mr Shaul Amor, a senior Likud MP and mayor of the largely Sephardi Galilee town of Migdal Haemek. Mr Amor thinks Labour will have the edge over Likud next week. If the gap is as much as eight seats, as the polls have suggested, Mr Rabin will be in a powerful position. But Mr Amor doubts a swing sufficient to allow Mr Rabin to form a majority coalition with Labour's small-party allies. Equally, he doubts Mr Shamir could form a workable coalition with extreme right-wing parties opposed to the peace talks which, he says, 'the majority of Likud voters really, really want.' He therefore attaches great significance to the rapport that exists between Mr Rabin and Mr Shamir. It was they who together formulated the 1989 Likud-Labour peace plan designed to set a process in motion without compromising their different ideologies. 'Shamir and Rabin always got along,' says Mr Amor. 'I assume there is going to be a Rabin-Shamir government.'</p>

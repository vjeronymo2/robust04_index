			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Solid Action Must Be Taken To Put </F> Things in Practice"]    [Text] Since the 14th party congress, according to Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's idea about building the armed forces in the new  period, the Central Military Commission has made a series of  important policy decisions on various aspects of troop building.  Now, as the major principles and concrete requirements have all  been explicitly formulated, the key lies in the earnest work of  putting them into effect.    Putting what has been decided into effect is the key link of  our work in all fields. The policy decisions and principles  laid down by the Central Military Commission, which were  formulated on the basis of the practical experience, incorporate  the wisdom of the masses and give expression to the objective  laws governing the work of troop building in the new period.  They are derived from practice, and should be returned to  practice and be implemented in our work in all fields. Only  thus can they play a guiding role and eventually enable us to  achieve the purpose of our work. If the policies, principles,  and guidelines only exist at meetings, in documents, and  people's remarks, then they may not play any guiding role as  they should no matter how good they are. In general, the  situation of ensuring effective implementation of policies and  principles is good in various units; however, formalism and red  tape still exist in a small number of units, where routine  ideological work and troop management are not effective enough.  One phenomenon is particularly noteworthy. That is, some  comrades only pay lip service to the necessity of putting what  has been decided into effect, but their deeds vary from their  words. Actually putting what has been decided into effect is a  pressing task of the moment in order to strengthen troop  building in all aspects under the new situation.    This is no easy matter, and requires painstaking efforts in  many aspects. It is necessary, first of all, to adopt a correct  guiding principle for our work. Is our work in troop building  only aimed at showing something nice to upper leaders and thus  seeking fame, or at actually enhancing the combat effectiveness  of troops? The answer should be self-evident. However, some  comrades did not adopt a correct approach to it in their  practical work. The correct attitude is to work in a  down-to-earth manner of being responsible to the party and the  troops without evading problems and difficulties and without  seeking fame for oneself and thus make painstaking efforts to  achieve solid results every step of the way.    It is necessary to actually transform the style of work. We  should work in a down-to-earth manner and advance steadily step  by step to achieve solid results. We should actually go among  the troops, do earnest work, speak honestly, and achieve real  results. The window-dressing practice must not be continued, and  there should be no more lip-service. The activities of courtesy  should be substantially reduced, and unnecessary paperwork and  red tape should be resolutely removed. No unrealistic slogans  should be created, no unfeasible targets should be formulated,  and no meetings irrelevant to implementation of the set policies  and measures should be held.    It is necessary to keep a healthy state of mind. All cadres,  especially leading cadres, should have a strong sense of  responsibility for the cause of revolution and really  concentrate their attention on troop building. They should be  so absorbed in the work of troop building as to forget food and  sleep while expected results are not achieved, and should be  firmly resolved to achieve successful results and never give up  halfway. They must seek no comfort and fear no hardships in  their work, and must give no consideration to personal gains and  losses while working perfunctorily. They must adhere to the  high standards for troop building, and must bring their  initiative and creativity into full play.    It is necessary to improve working methods. Attention should  be paid to coordination, and priority should be given to the  settlement of the principal contradiction. It is inadvisable to  deal with all problems at the same time, because this will just  make the troops work in a rush and get into a muddle. It is  necessary to explicitly affix responsibilities to each level  from top to bottom so that all people may perform their duties  in an orderly manner. Effective measures for troop management  should be maintained. For example, superficial activities among  leaders [shang ceng huo dong 0006 1461 3172 0520] should be  reduced, guidance should be given to various units according to  their specific conditions. The practice of assigning leading  cadres to various responsible positions in subordinate units in  order to acquire work experience should be continued, and  concrete guidance and assistance should be given to grass-roots  cadres so that they may continue to improve their ability to put  what is decided into effect and create more favorable conditions  for fulfilling the tasks.    An important factor for putting what is decided into  effect is the condition of grass-roots units. A good condition  of the grass-roots units is the foundation for achieving good  results in all aspects of troop building. At present, efforts  should be made to ensure the implementation of the "Program for  Building Grass-Roots Military Units." Since the promulgation of  the revised program, all units have earnestly studied and  implemented the document according to the spirit of the all-Army  discussion meeting on political work at the grass-roots level,  and the overall situation in this regard is quite good.  However, this is just a beginning, and many issues have yet to  be considered and solved. We must never think that we have  almost completed everything in the implementation of the program  after holding a meeting, issuing documents, and relaying the  instructions of the upper leaders. We should be fully aware  that in order to meet the general requirements of "measuring up  to standard politically, mastering military skills proficiently,  maintaining a fine style of work, enforcing discipline strictly,  and guaranteeing effective logistics support" set forth by  Chairman Jiang Zemin, the grass-roots party branches must be  really "enhancing their quality and playing their role," and the  leading organs should actually give guidance to the grass-roots  units according to the requirements of the program while the  grass-roots units are making self-enhancement. Thus, all people  from top to bottom will have to do a great deal of work, and  will have to make great efforts to put what has been decided  into effect. According to instructions of the Central Military  Commission leaders and the actual conditions of the troops, the  leading comrade of the General Political Department reiterated  the 10 requirements for the leading organs to serve grass-roots  units. Leading organs at all levels must act in light of the 10  requirements and promote better implementation of all tasks in  grass-roots units through their earnest and wholehearted work of  serving them.    When talking about the implementation of the program,  Chairman Jiang Zemin pointed out: "All units must ensure the  implementation and must make comprehensive progress in troop  building at the grass-roots level." This is also the  requirement for the implementation of the program and for troop  work in all fields. We must positively respond to Chairman  Jiang's call, take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as the fundamental  guideline, really create a healthy atmosphere for putting what  has been decided into effect in the whole Army, actually  guarantee implementation of the important policy decisions of  the Central Military Commission, and continuously advance troop  building in all aspects.</p>

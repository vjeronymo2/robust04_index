			<p>BFN     [Text] Prishtina, May 19 (ATA) -- Mirko Cupioi, chairman  of the regional council of criminal Arkan's party, based in  Prishtina, declared in the newspaper JEDINSTVO that "one can not  even think of dialogue with the Albanians." According to him,  the Kosova status will be negotiated with no one, less so "with  those residing in the foreign land," alluding to the ethnic  Albanians of Kosova. Further on, he reveals that the Serb Unity  Party has a wide and detailed program on Kosova, which predicts  the fast establishment of national parity with the settling of  500 thousand Serbs in Kosova and the expulsion of 465 thousand  Albanians to Albania.    On the other hand, the leaders of Seselj's radicals in  Kosova, Miodrag Jevric, declares in the newspaper BORBA that the  participants of national minorities should not be provided with  weapons during military service, whereas those who do not  respond to the order for military service "can buy the military  term" at 5,000 U.S. dollars.</p>

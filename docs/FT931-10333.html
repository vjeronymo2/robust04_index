			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Lautro fines life group Pounds 80,000 LIBERTY LIFE, the life assurance group, has been fined Pounds 80,000 by Lautro, the industry regulator, for failing to screen its direct sales staff adequately before recruiting them, John Authers writes. Lautro also said Liberty Life failed to control its internal affairs responsibly, and that it did not ensure its sales force was properly supervised. Liberty Life stopped recruiting sales staff for three months in mid 1992 to demonstrate to Lautro that its screening procedures had been reviewed. It has paid Pounds 5,000 compensation to 46 investors who were sold the wrong products. Mr David Pritchard, sales director, said that previously the company had not checked the financial background of its recruits as thoroughly as it should have done. The fine follows a series of penalties imposed on life groups for inadequate control of separately managed tied agents. London &amp; Manchester was fined Pounds 80,000, Guardian Royal Exchange had to pay Pounds 100,000 and Scottish Widows was fined Pounds 120,000.</p>

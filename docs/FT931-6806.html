			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Writs issued by BCCI liquidator THE LIQUIDATOR to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International yesterday issued new writs against accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young in connection with their audits of the bank. The writs cover Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, for the audits of the bank in 1986, and PW for its audit in 1987. They follow writs issued last March against both firms for their 1985 BCCI audits, and a statement of claim in October believed to be for damages against losses in the bank in the range of Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn. It is believed the sums involved for the latest writs will amount to about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) for each of the two years listed. But the numbers associated with the claim will not be provided unless or until a detailed statement of claim is filed with the courts. The writs seek interest, costs, further relief, damages and compensation for alleged negligence, and/or breach of duty, statutory duty and breach of contract. The Bank of England faced fresh criticism of its handling of BCCI yesterday when 43 MPs called for a review of Mr Eddie George's appointment as governor-designate. The MPs called in a early day motion for Mr George's appointment to be reviewed by the Treasury and Civil Service committee. The motion urged the appointment of an outsider 'untainted by the soiled and over-cosy ethos' at the Bank.</p>

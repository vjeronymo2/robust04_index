			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Fall in days lost to strikes BRITAIN is still midway in the OECD league table of strikes, the latest issue of the Employment Gazette says - even though 1991 shows the lowest domestic strike figures for nearly a century. From 1987 to 1991 the number of days lost through strikes in the UK was 70 per cent lower than in the previous five years. That was substantially better that the OECD average of a 30 per cent reduction.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Personal View: Experiment in democracy - The explosive growth of US mutual funds In the modern era, industrial countries have typically organised their financial systems around either a universal banking model encompassing many financial services or a hybrid structure that separates commercial and investment banking. The US is now creating a new system, in which mutual funds are overtaking banks as the main repositories of household wealth and suppliers of capital to small and medium-sized companies. The US mutual fund industry now has about Dollars 2,000bn in assets, equal to about 85 per cent of bank deposits, against barely 10 per cent in the early 1980s. The industry has about Dollars 670bn in equities and Dollars 760bn in taxable and non-taxable bonds, plus Dollars 580bn in money market funds. This asset growth has been matched by a large expansion in mutual fund shareholding - 28 per cent of US households own a mutual fund, against 6 per cent in 1980. Behind this expansion has lain an accommodating monetary policy designed to rescue American banks from a sharp rise in non-performing real estate loans. This policy has enabled banks to bolster lending margins, earn healthy profits from long-term government bonds and restore their equity/asset ratios to the highest level since the early 1960s. But low money market yields and a positive yield curve have also encouraged households to shift savings from banks into higher-yielding instruments, such as mutual funds. So far the consequences have been benign. First, mutual fund growth has provided a new channel for monetary policy to buoy the economy by broadening the number of households able to benefit from rising bond and equity prices. Appreciation of financial asset prices has been one of the main transmission mechanisms employed by the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to revive the economy. Second, the mutual fund boom has helped facilitate an expansion of securitised forms of credit at a time when commercial banks have pursued more conservative lending policies. During 1993, there were 571 non-financial initial public offerings in the US stock market, raising about Dollars 25bn, against 447 worth Dollars 19.4bn in 1992, 330 (Dollars 13.8bn) in 1991, and 150 (Dollars 4.2bn) in 1990. The search for higher yields has also revitalised the so-called 'junk bond market'. In 1993, Wall Street sold about Dollars 57bn of non-investment grade bonds, against Dollars 42bn in 1992, Dollars 17bn in 1991 and Dollars 2.9bn in 1990. These developments have improved access to equity and debt finance for small and medium-sized companies, helping to spur faster employment growth. Although the mutual fund boom had positive economic side-effects in 1993, the extent of current changes in US household savings flows raises questions about regulatory policy and stability in the financial markets. The first concern is: what will happen to retail savings flows and household wealth when interest rates rise and share prices fall? The household sector is vulnerable to losses from declining asset prices if interest rates rise sharply. In 1993, bond and equity mutual fund assets were equal to 15.6 per cent of discretionary household financial assets, against 3.8 per cent in 1985. This growth in bond and mutual fund portfolios has been partially offset by a large fall in direct household holdings of equities - from 46 per cent of discretionary financial assets in the early 1970s to 27 per cent last year. As a result, the household sector's total holdings of financial assets, potentially subject to sharp price fluctuations, has not risen to new highs but returned to levels close to the early 1970s peak. The second set of issues raised by the mutual fund boom centres on government supervision of the financial system. The government has traditionally required the commercial banking sector to ensure capital adequacy and promote various social objectives. But in mutual fund regulation, its main aim has been to promote adequate disclosure so consumers can decide if a product suits them; it has not tried to impose social investment guidelines or capital adequacy rules. Hence, bankers complain the government is pursuing asymmetrical regulatory policies just as there is shrinkage in some traditional areas of their business. This problem may resolve itself via banks entering the mutual funds business and the creation of a two-tier government deposit insurance system. It would provide guarantees for only a core of low-yield deposits invested in safe assets, such as Treasury securities, while deposits in riskier assets would be uninsured. US banks already have nearly Dollars 180bn of mutual fund assets under their control. The final consequence of the mutual fund boom could be a change in the ownership of corporate America and in popular perceptions of capitalism. The main factor driving recent mutual fund growth has been low interest rates. But the industry has also benefited from changes in the way Americans save for retirement. While defined benefit pension plans used to dominate these savings, there is a shift now to defined contribution plans. These enable participants to allocate savings between a variety of mutual funds. Defined contribution plans are already equal to 90 per cent of defined benefit plans, up from 52 per cent in 1985. Peter Drucker, writer and economic consultant, argued in his book The Unseen Revolution in 1976 that the US was evolving towards a pension fund form of socialism, in which retirement plans would own most US industry and alter worker attitudes towards business. But his argument was misdirected because defined benefit plans, which then prevailed, offered workers guaranteed returns, not the right to choose between funds with divergent returns. Today, retirement plans are expanding their ownership of the stock market but not producing a form of pension fund socialism. The US is, instead, embarking upon a new experiment in the democratisation of bond and equity ownership through a mixture of mutual funds, defined contribution pension plans and direct ownership of securities. US politicians have not yet fully grasped the significance of this development because financial markets have been in a bull mode for the past three years. But by the next presidential election in 1996, the performance of the bond and stock markets could be important political variables than ever before. Ironically the great economic risk facing the Clinton administration is not that real annual GDP growth will return to a sluggish pace which leaves unemployment unchanged. Rather it is that the US now experiences an economic upturn so robust thatinterest rates have to rise sharply, puncturing the post-1991 bull market in stocks and bonds. How can Clinton avoid this danger? The best option would be to engineer a mid-term stock market correction via higher interest rates in late 1994 or 1995, setting the stage for a new bull market in 1996.

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / The woman to do business with: Bush's nominee for commerce secretary PRESIDENT George Bush has good reason to be grateful to Mrs Barbara Franklin. An activist Republican, she co-chaired a recent dinner in Washington which raised Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 670m) for his 1992 re-election campaign. Mrs Franklin's work impressed Mr Robert Mosbacher, the commerce secretary - no mean fund-raiser himself  - who is departing to head the president's campaign. Her gender impressed White House operatives who were looking for 'political bounce' out of the appointment of Mr Mosbacher's successor. Thus Mrs Franklin, at 51, finds herself commerce secretary nominee, poised to take the helm of an unwieldy government bureaucracy of 13 agencies with responsibilities ranging from weather prediction, aerospace, oceans, the census, economic statistics, to tourism and trade. It is a department seen as having lost influence in policy-making under Mr Mosbacher. But it is also viewed by some, including Ambassador Linn Williams, former deputy trade representative, as having a vital role in helping US industry regain its competitiveness. If confirmed, as expected, Mrs Franklin will be the third woman in the Bush cabinet, along with Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mrs Lynn Martin, the labour secretary. The prominence of women in the Bush administration is a point of pride among feminists who chose difficult careers in male-dominated arenas such as business and politics. (It is also a counterweight among Republican moderates who dislike the president's 'born-again' opposition to abortion.) Mrs Franklin has broad experience in business and government, but there are sceptics who belittle her qualifications. 'What has she ever done?' says one long-time trade lobbyist. 'Why didn't they choose some chief executive who knows how to role up his sleeves and save a company?' The nominee launched her government career two decades ago. To a young reporter covering the White House for the first time, she seemed 'glamorous, peppy, vibrant'. But, says Ms Sonja Hillgren, now Washington editor of Farm Journal, 'she was Miss Establishment. 'While everyone else was doing outrageous things, she was working for the Nixon White House to recruit women for government jobs.' She is still considered 'establishment' and still known for her stamina  - and her commitment to high-impact aerobics. Her curriculum vitae runs for pages. Married to another activist Republican - Mr Wallace Barnes, a wealthy Connecticut businessman - Mrs Franklin (who retains her first married name) could have served in almost any job in a Bush cabinet. In the Nixon White House Mrs Franklin recruited dozens of women for top government jobs. She also crossed paths there with Mrs Hills, who had joined the Justice Department. 'I always liked her,' says Mrs Hills. 'She is an articulate, well-organised, dedicated person.' These qualities appeal to Mrs Hills, whose legalistic style tries to impose orderliness on trade negotiations with action plans and deadlines. The question of how the two will get along heading agencies renowned for their turf fights occupies the minds of many. 'I don't believe we couldn't sit down and talk about issues,' says Mrs Hills, who sees the two agencies as interactive. 'We are opening doors for business; Commerce helps business drive through open doors.' The Commerce Department used to push doors open under the late secretary Malcolm Baldrige, launching negotiations for sectoral openings in Japan. Mr Mosbacher all but abandoned that role in favour of trade promotion; provided Mrs Franklin agrees to continue on that path, she and Mrs Hills are likely to get on. But she will be urged by her bureaucracy to represent business interests and regain the policy-making role it has lost. She will have to decide whether to pursue the debilitating turf battles, which even the veteran Mrs Hills does not like. She would have enough to do without them. Mr Williams, who has been close to Mrs Hills, argues that Mrs Franklin would do better to focus the department's 'intellectual energy' on developing its role as 'an organiser, a think-tank, and a catalyst'. The professional women who have known Mrs Franklin over the years have no doubt she can handle the job. Ms Felice Schwartz, president of Catalyst, an organisation which promotes women in business, says women who began their careers 20 years ago and succeeded are astute and tough because they have had to overcome so many more obstacles than have men. Mrs Franklin, in a recent speech to a girls' club, described the slights and prejudices she encountered. At Harvard Business School, where she graduated in one of the first classes containing woman, she found her opinions dismissed 'as if no one had heard a word I'd said'. On her first job she was underpaid and criticised both for being 'too aggressive' and not assertive enough. It took her years to understand that her first husband 'would be proud of my career as long as it didn't interfere with something he wanted me to do or somewhere he wanted me to be'. That Mrs Hills and Mrs Franklin will now hold the top business jobs in the Bush administration is 'mind-blowingly exciting for women', says Ms Schwartz. The 'gutsy, very responsible' Mrs Franklin will bring to the administration the 'fresh perspective' of a feminist who did things 'the right way' and made it to the top.'</p>

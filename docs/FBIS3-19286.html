Specifying that he was speaking on a personal  basis, Spini, who chaired a summit of G-7 environment ministers  here this weekend, said an enlargement of the group to eight  nations would be "positive" for environmental issues.    Spini said the summit decided to add nuclear safety in East  and Central Europe to the six-point agenda on environmental  issues already sketched in for Naples. "We wanted to underscore  a sense of alarm, without going into detail about possible  interventions," explained Spini.    One consideration was that the region in question has scarce  primary sources of energy whence an option for nuclear power is  more probable.    The latest figures indicate that, even Russia, which is a  major oil and natural gas producer, already has 27 working  reactors for an installed power of 5,800 megawatt and plans to  increase nuclear power's contribution to its total energy needs  from 14 to 34 percent by 2000, bringing three new reactors on  stream by 1995 and developing a further eight for 2005.    Spini told reporters that a major demand from the summit  here  is that the G-7 nations should supply greater technical and  financial assistance to the Central and East European nations in  this field.    He added that a major obstacle for making Russia the eighth  nation in a Group of Eight was its economic problems, but he  said that direct Russian involvement in the debate on the  environment planned at the end of the Naples summit could be a  first step to the group's enlargement.</p>

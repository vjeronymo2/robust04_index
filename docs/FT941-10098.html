			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Banks try to quit Thai project A group of 23 international banks have told the Thai government they want to withdraw from a controversial Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) elevated motorway project for Bangkok and have their loans and interest worth some Dollars 250m repaid in full. The demand by the banks - which sent a stern letter to the Thai authorities 10 days ago and met Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, this week - could hinder Thailand's efforts to secure foreign funding for other big transport, communications and power projects. Bangkok Expressway (BECL), the construction consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan and financed by Thai and foreign banks, is locked in a bitter dispute with the state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) over revenue-sharing and other aspects of the toll road contract. The ETA forced open the 20-km stretch of new road in September by obtaining an emergency court order and bypassing agreed dispute procedures, prompting foreign bankers to accuse the Thais of 'nationalising' the scheme, one of the first major build-operate-transfer projects in Thailand. Kumagai Gumi has been negotiating for months to recoup its costs by selling its 65 per cent share in BECL to a Thai consortium led by construction company Charoen Karnchang, but the two sides have been unable to agree on a price. The foreign banks, including National Westminster, Credit Lyonnais and several Japanese banks, said their loan facilities to BECL had been non-performing since March 1993. They put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the ETA. 'In the circumstances,' the banks wrote in their letter, 'the offshore banks' desire is for their facilities/loans to BECL plus full accrued interest plus all other fees and expenses to be repaid in full by the onshore Thai bank lenders, the Thai government, Ch Karnchang, or another third party as soon as possible. 'The offshore banks wish to be totally removed from their involvement in the BEP (Bangkok Expressway Project).' Eight Japanese banks - out of the original 31 foreign commercial bank lenders - did not sign the letter, possibly for fear of damaging their other interests in Thailand. The ETA, now profiting from the substantial toll revenues provided by the new motorway above Bangkok's congested streets, replied with a scathing, eight-page letter attacking BECL.</p>

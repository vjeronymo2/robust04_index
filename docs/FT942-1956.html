			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Japan foreign minister for US trade talks Japan's foreign minister, Mr Koji Kakizawa, plans to visit the US this weekend for talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, on the two countries' framework trade negotiations. The announcement, which came as US and Japanese trade negotiators continue efforts to agree on trade issues before a Group of Seven summit in Naples next month, heightened hopes that an accord was near. Mr Kakizawa's plans, however, are subject to the volatile political situation in Japan, where the minority government may face a vote of no confidence as early as Friday. Japanese trade officials were also unwilling to place much hope in the possibility that Mr Kakizawa's visit will achieve the breakthrough the two sides have been seeking since the framework talks were resumed last month. 'It is not yet time for a political decision,' one Japanese trade official said yesterday. Mr Kakizawa has been keen to meet Mr Kantor, who expressed a desire to meet the Japanese minister as soon as the latter was appointed. The two sides have not yet held talks below cabinet level. Also, no discussions have been held on quantitative indicators, the most difficult obstacle, the official said. Considerable progress has been made towards agreement on government procurement, which with insurance and trade in vehicles and auto parts makes up the three priority areas on the agenda. However, there was still much work to be done before the summit. 'It may be difficult to reach an agreement before then,' the official said. The US embassy in Tokyo yesterday issued a statement welcoming Japan's efforts to deregulate its economy.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kalamazoo chief to sell shares Kalamazoo Holdings' chairman and biggest shareholder, Mr Fred Street, said he planned to sell his 40.2 per cent stake in the Australian office supplies group to Avatar Industries, a Perth-based investment group, which has bid ADollars 2.05 a share for the company, Reuter reports from Sydney. Although Kalamazoo directors described Avatar's ADollars 103m (USDollars 79m) bid as neither fair nor reasonable, Mr Street said he intended to accept the offer in the interests of his family and related parties. On the Australian stock exchange, Kalamazoo shares closed at ADollars 2.10, down 10 cents, and Avatar's unchanged at ADollars 1.14. Kalamazoo said it was advising shareholders not to accept the offer.</p>

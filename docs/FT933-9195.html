			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Directors' pay-offs fuel fears of overcompensation TWO YEARS' salary is the normal lump-sum pay-off to executives on the standard three-year rolling contract who are sacked from their jobs, figures published yesterday by Incomes Data Services show. This will add weight to shareholders' fears that directors are overcompensated for leaving companies, even in circumstances where they have performed poorly. The survey looked at 20 large companies which have recently made severance payments to top executives. It found that in most cases the sum was arrived at after careful consultation with lawyers. Companies frequently made awards generous enough to discourage directors from suing for breach of contract. The pay-offs surveyed range from Pounds 785,000 to Pounds 55,000, although the latter payment did not take account of up to Pounds 240,000 in consultancy payments. Some companies also gave compensation for loss of expected bonus payments, pensions and mortgage subsidies, the survey found. In most cases compensation was based on an assessment of the damages that a court might award, taking into account the term of the service agreement, the age of the director, the chances of that director finding a new job, and a discount for immediate payment. The Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the few companies in the survey that had the same terms of severance pay for executives and other employees, based on a simple calculation relating to years of service. Earlier this year Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, wrote to the FTSE 100 companies criticising three-year rolling contracts, and proposing instead rolling contracts of no more than one year. Responding to this and other attacks from the press and shareholders, companies in the survey said that in future severance payments would probably become more modest. One company said that its contracts would include a statement saying that no director would get more than one year's salary as a pay-off, especially if the reasons for leaving were associated with poor performance.</p>

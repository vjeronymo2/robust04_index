			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT given permission to lift some position limits THE Chicago Board of Trade says the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, will permit it to lift speculative position limits on three of the exchange's most important financial contracts. The rule change aims to accommodate large traders, particularly managed futures funds. Position limits are caps on the trading positions held by non-commercial participants in a market. They have traditionally been used to prevent price manipulations or excess volatility. The CBOT's limits on trading the 30-year US Treasury bond, and five and 10-year Treasury notes will be removed. Position limits on the related option contracts will remain in effect. The CFTC's move follows its approval at the start of the year of eliminating positions limits on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's largest currency futures and its Eurodollar contract. The CBOT is also proposing to the CFTC that its member firms be allowed to provide average prices and order quantities for large customers, when an order or series of orders representing multiple accounts is executed. Again, the rule change is designed to respond to managed fund traders.</p>

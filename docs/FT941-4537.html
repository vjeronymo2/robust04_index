			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drug hint unsettles Glaxo Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fell sharply as word leaked into the market that arch rival Astra had announced good news on its anti-ulcer product, offsetting recent worries about Losec's German prospects. The news hit sentiment over Zantac, Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer drug, already suffering a slowdown in sales growth. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, held a conference call late on Tuesday between Astra executives and Lehman clients. Astra said it expected approval in the first half of this year for using Losec with an antibiotic to combat h-pylori, the agent that causes ulcers. The combination treatment is expected to cure, rather than merely suppress, ulcers and analysts believe that as much as a quarter of Zantac sales could be threatened. Astra did not say where approval would come from, but analysts expect it to be the UK. Last week, worries over Losec gave a fillip to Glaxo shares, which jumped to 712p. Since then, however, they have lost all their gain and yesterday closed 14 1/2 off at 663 1/2 p.</p>

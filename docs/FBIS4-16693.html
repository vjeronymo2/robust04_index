On the eve of  his visit, Yasir 'Arafat gave an exclusive interview to a  correspondent for our information agency at the PLO headquarters  in Tunis:    [Begin 'Arafat recording in Arabic with superimposed Russian  translation] Russia has played an active role in the Near East  peace process ever since it started. The Russian foreign  minister and the U.S. secretary of state stood alongside myself  and the Israeli prime minister when the Washington agreement on  the principles of a settlement was signed.    It was precisely thanks to the recent increase in Russian  diplomatic activity, Yasir 'Arafat continues, that certain  difficulties which arose in the negotiating process were  overcome, allowing it to resume in Cairo. The peace talks are  being held not just in the interests of the Palestinians or the  Israelis. They are in the interests of all mankind. Realizing  this, and undertaking efforts in this direction, we have  achieved those results which only became possible because of the  peace talks. [end recording]    [Correspondent] To conclude his short interview, Yasir  'Arafat noted that there has been a durable and friendly  relationship between Palestinians and Russia for many years now.  But in looking ahead he would like to point out that in future  there could be new developments in this relationship because of  the possibility of cooperation in the repair of infrastructure  in the Palestinian autonomous areas, the training of personnel,  and other spheres.    He takes this opportunity to pass on the warmest and most  sincere greetings to the peoples of Russia.</p>

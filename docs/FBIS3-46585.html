The Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai  Doyukai) urged financial institutions to quit their uniform  management strategies and rather emphasize their differences.    In the banking sector, follow-the-leader psychology has long  been the norm.    The Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said an  income tax cut is necessary this year, while stabilizing the  financial system en route to lifting Japan out of the slumbering  economy.    Analysts say such comments reflect concerns by the business  community over Japan's financial system and may touch off debate  about the possible injection of public funds to stabilize  banking and securities systems.    Keizai Doyukai called on business leaders to acknowledge the  fact that Japan's economy has shifted to one that is led by  domestic demand and from an export-led economy as seen in the  era of high growth.    The organization went on to say Japan will now have to face  employment issues and the traditional lifelong employment system  should be revised to improve labor efficiency.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prishtina, June 27 (ATA) -- The interrogation of 14  Albanians accused of allegedly forming the Ministry of Defence  of the Republic of Kosova ended after eight sittings in the  Prishtina Court. In the last sittings, all the accused rejected  as a whole the indictment brought against them. They explained  in detail that they were severely treated by the State Security,  saying that the accusation was based on slanders and statements  made in the Investigation Office under pressure.    The other sitting of this framed trial will be held on June  27 with the interrogation of the witnesses.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, Jan 10, IRNA -- The meeting of foreign  ministers of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council (PGCC) and  those of Egypt and Syria ended here today without any concrete  results.    In the two-day meeting, members of the PGCC did not reach an  agreement for implementing of an article of Damascus Agreement  which calls for cooperation with Syria and Egypt. The Damascus  Agreement which was signed in the aftermath of the occupation of  Kuwait by Iraq envisaged economic, political and military  cooperation between the PGCC member states with Syria and Egypt.    The agreement provided for the deployment of Egyptian and  Syrian forces in the Persian Gulf for maintaining the security  of the region. However, some of the PGCC members, having signed  bilateral pacts with the U.S.A. and some of the western  countries, are no longer inclined to see the Egyptian and Syrian  forces in the region.    The failure of the meeting is viewed by some political  observers here to have stricken a serious blow to the Damascus  Agreement.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> MORATORIUM PLACED ON NEW DANCE HALLS  </P> <P> Concerned about an increasing amount of violence and noise at local dance  halls, the City Council has put a temporary freeze on the opening of any new  dance halls.  </P> <P> During the 45-day moratorium, city officials will be considering ways to  improve regulation of establishments classified as dance halls, including dance  clubs where members dance with hostesses, "go-go" dance bars and dance clubs  for juveniles.  </P> <P> This week's moratorium follows a Jan. 9 workshop in which police and planning  officials told the City Council about problems at the dance halls, including  parking, traffic, noise, litter, and violence involving gang clashes and  gunshots.  </P> <P> In some cases, according to city staff, piano bars have become dance halls  without proper permits. Under the moratorium, anyone who opened a new dance  hall during the 45-day period would be subject to a $35-a-day fine. JAMES  TORTOLANO  </P></p>

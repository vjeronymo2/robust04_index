			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN LINDSAY  </P> <P> This is a tribute to Gil Lindsay.  </P> <P> When various humane organizations in 1969 urged the Los Angeles City Council to  establish a public spay and neuter clinic, Gil Lindsay was the outstanding city  councilman who led us to victory.  </P> <P> As a result, we now have three spay and neuter clinics in Los Angeles, together  with four in the county. Millions of dollars have been saved by the public and  countless animals lives which would be destroyed by our city and county  shelters at considerable public expense have been prevented.  </P> <P> We are saddened by Councilman Lindsay's condition and fervently hope for his  recovery.  </P> <P> EDWARD NEWMAN, Woodland Hills  </P></p>

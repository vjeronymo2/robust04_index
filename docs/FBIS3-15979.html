Trade unions want the government and the parliament to  ensure  the payment of wages detained in state-operated enterprises.  The payments should be performed by May 1, the appeal said.    Unionists also suggest that the minimum monthly wages should  be fixed at 58 lats to comply with the actual subsistence  minimum. The crisis minimum should be 33 lats per month.    Deputies, however, said it was impossible to increase the  minimum wages in the near future because the motion would  require revision of the entire state budget.    Saeima is also unable to guarantee the payment of the  detained wages by the required date.    The issue of wages is closely linked to the bankruptcy and  liquidation of state sector businesses, said committee member  Anna Seile. Saeima has passed two legislations ruling that  payroll payments are priority obligations when an enterprise is  liquidated.</p>

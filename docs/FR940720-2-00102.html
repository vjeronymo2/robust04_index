Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, Wayne County, New York <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 13, 1994, as supplemented June 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would revise the Ginna Station Technical Specifications (TSs) Section 6.0 ``Administrative Controls,'' to be consistent with the criteria contained in the NRC Final Policy Statement of Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors, and NUREG&hyph;1431 ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants,'' September 1993. The proposed amendment would also relocate to other programs and documents, several TS requirements in accordance with this criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The May 13, 1994, request supersedes the request of March 23, 1992, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55589). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The changes are consistent with the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and NUREG&hyph;1431 and have therefore, been previously evaluated by the NRC. Implementation of these changes is expected to result in a significant human factors improvement and enable RG&amp;E [Rochester Gas &amp; Electric] and the NRC to focus on the most important requirements without any reduction in safety. The changes which do not duplicate NRC guidance in NUREG&hyph;1431 are currently addressed by existing technical specifications and regulations, the Ginna Station license, plant procedures, or the QA [Quality Assurance] program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The Administrative Controls section contains those requirements that are not covered by other technical specifications which are considered necessary to assure safe operation of the facility. The majority of changes are consistent with the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and NUREG&hyph;1431 and have therefore, been previously evaluated by the NRC. [*&blank;*&blank;*]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. All requirements removed from technical specifications are relocated to other programs and documents. These alternative programs and documents are controlled by existing regulations which provide a more appropriate vehicle for addressing changes and compliance. There were no administrative control requirements which were removed from technical specifications and not addressed by other regulations. Therefore, there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rochester Public Library, 115 South Avenue, Rochester, New York 14610. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nicholas S.

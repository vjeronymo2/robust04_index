			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dollars 105m US buy for Bowater BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films group, has acquired the Tower Packaging business from Baxter Healthcare of the US, in a deal worth Dollars 105m (Pounds 68m) over five years. Tower, based in Mundelein, Illinois, makes medical packaging and film products, including surgical drapes, steriliseable bags and pouches, supplying 85 per cent of its products to Baxter. Bowater has acquired both its manufacturing licences and patents, and a long-term supply contract to Baxter. Bowater said the acquisition would strengthen its position in the world healthcare market and complement its existing DRG medical packaging business, which it acquired in 1992. 'This is bulls eye where we want to expand,' said Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director. 'This is a high quality company with some good technology.' Baxter decided to sell as part of its policy of reducing vertical integration. Of the consideration Dollars 65m is payable on completion and Dollars 10m in each of the next four years. Although Tower's assets have a book value of Dollars 27m, Mr Hartnall said the premium was accounted for by goodwill and Tower's licences and patents, and he believed the price was a fair one. It will be financed through debt, increasing gearing from 56 to just above 60 per cent, Mr Hartnall said. Tower, which used to supply Baxter at or below cost, incurred an operating loss of Dollars 2.6m last year. But Bowater said that had all of its 1992 sales been conducted on the new terms agreed with Baxter, turnover would have been about Dollars 60m, with an operating profit of some Dollars 9m. The deal is Bowater's second in three months. In February it announced the Dollars 434m purchase of Specialty Coatings International, the US coatings company, funded by a Pounds 295m rights issue. Last year it acquired DRG and Cope Allman, the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals packaging group, largely funded by a Pounds 333.5m rights issue.</p>

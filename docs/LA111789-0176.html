			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH INFLATION TAKES SLIGHT DIP  </P> <P> British inflation dipped slightly to 7.3% in October, but the fall was lower  than expected and the underlying trend was still upward, the government said  today.  </P> <P> Economists had forecast the yearly rate would fall to 6.9% from 7.6% in  September as a rise in mortgage rates in October, 1988, dropped out of the  reckoning.  </P> <P> But the Central Statistical Office said this was offset by increases in the  cost of food, clothing and footwear.  </P> <P> The Treasury said the underlying rate of inflation, excluding home loan  repayments from the index, showed a rise to 6.1% in October against 5.8% the  previous month. That rise was the biggest in 6 1/2 years.  </P></p>

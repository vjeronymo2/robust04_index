			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses flat as Buba lowers the floor 'An unchanged Lombard rate means nothing. It's the floor that matters,' said Mr Marcus Grubb, a strategist at Salomon Brothers in London yesterday, after the Bundesbank cut the German discount rate by half a percentage point, and left the Lombard at 9 per cent. Money market rates, he expected, should continue their decline on this basis, and bourses should be underpinned by the prospect of consistent interest rate cuts in Germany filtering through elsewhere, writes Our Markets Staff, Unfortunately, for the short term, markets had been discounting a cut of up to 100 basis points, rather than 50, said Mr Grubb. In London, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index moved from a moderate rise in midsession to a minuscule one in the post bourse. FRANKFURT recovered ahead of the Buba cut, the DAX index closing 11.11 higher at 1,696.19. It dipped a little in the aftermarket, with the DAX future indicating a 4 point fall. Turnover rose from DM6.0bn to DM6.2bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, noted that the post-bourse decline was limited, with some falls in financials but industrials more or less steady. He said that the caution behind the cut, as well as a fall of 0.1 per cent in February's M3 against the January figure, should be good for the D-Mark and the long term strength of the market. However, he said, some German equities had risen by 20 to 25 per cent since last October, and it was likely that the recent consolidation would continue as investors balanced the interest rate prospect, and strong investor liquidity against the effects of recession. PARIS was unmoved by events elsewhere on the Continent and, with no prospect of an easing in its own interest rates while the franc remains under pressure in the money markets, the CAC-40 index closed 3.76 lower at 1,963.52. Turnover was strong at FFr3.5bn. Domestic issues were uppermost in traders' minds as LVMH came in with solid results, and declared that prospects for 1993 were favourable. The shares gathered momentum during the day before finishing FFr73 higher at FFr3,442. However, some analysts remained cautious about the group's prospects, and maintained a hold recommendation. Valeo fell FFr32 or 4 per cent to FFr763 following an analysts' meeting earlier in the week, after which James Capel reiterated its sell note. Michelin lost FFr5 to FFr171 as the group asked its French managers to take pay cuts, and Peugeot was down FFr6 at FFr559. AMSTERDAM cut its own discount rate and the CBS Tendency index climbed 1.4 to 107.6. Ahold went against the trend, falling Fl 2.50 to Fl 95.40, after surprising many analysts by announcing a 1 for 10 rights issue. Elsevier improved Fl 2.80 to Fl 129.30 on slightly better than expected results and Nedlloyd climbed Fl 2.60 to Fl 28.40 on changes to its management structure. MILAN paused for breath after the turbulence of the last few days, with a modest rise in the Comit index of 4.48 to 497.22. Some analysts remarked that Italy was unlikely to follow the Bundesbank's move in the short-term, partly because of continuing political instability. Fiat was among the day's gainers, managing to recoup some of its recent losses with a gain of L76 to L5,426 before adding another L54 in the after market. Olivetti, similarly, benefited from the brighter mood with a rise of L58 to L1,839, while Generali fixed up L320 at L34,900. ZURICH expected the Buba cut, but the SMI index rose 15.6 to 2,154.1 after the Swiss National Bank followed with an identical discount rate move. Financials reacted with Swiss Re and Winterthur certificates both up SFr11, to SFr595 and SFr695 respectively, and SBC bearers up SFr7 to SFr351. Among strong industrials, Rieter registered rose SFr30 to SFr1,390 on news that its textile machinery rival, Saurer, wanted to boost its Rieter stake, although the latter said it intended to remain independent, while Saurer said its move was not a takeover attempt. In retailing, Interdiscount bearers fell SFr85 to SFr1,310 on a slump in profits. DUBLIN came back from St Patrick's Day in celebratory form, the ISEQ overall index climbing 28.28, or 2 per cent to 1,421.90 with the financial sector 3 per cent ahead.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 18                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1148.26    1149.20     1150.46     1152.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1216.68    1216.67     1218.42     1223.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1151.54    1148.26     1148.47     1148.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1224.15    1221.87     1220.45     1222.53  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 17    Mar 16    Mar 15    Mar 12    Mar 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1146.10   1151.53   1153.62   1145.86   1163.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1214.92   1222.33   1219.52   1212.44   1232.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1153.44 ; 200 -  1227.03 Low/day: 100 -  1147.35  200 -  1215.75 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

It must be ensured that borders do not come down for  criminals while they remain in place for the prosecuting  authorities, says a program of action drafted by Federal  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther for the period of the German  EU presidency in the second half of 1994.    WELT AM SONNTAG adds that according to Kanther, cross-border  crime, which is increasingly being organized on an international  basis, must be combated more effectively, and illegal  immigration in the European region -- and especially in Germany  -- must be halted. The interior minister told the paper that he  wants to ensure "an improvement in cooperation between all the  security authorities." The German Government also wants to step  up the expansion of "Europol" in The Hague and ensure that the  European police organization is "fully operational" by October  1994.    According to information from the news agency DDP/ADN, the  Europol organization will take up work officially on 16  February. Narcotics agents from the 12 EU states based in The  Hague will then cooperate in order to better organize the  combating of internationally active drug gangs and other serious  cross-border international crime. [passage omitted]    Cooperation between the German and Polish border police will  also be the focus of talks tomorrow between Kanther and his  Polish counterpart Andrzej Milczanowski. The talks in Warsaw  will also center on police cooperation, the Federal Interior  Ministry announced in Bonn today.</p>

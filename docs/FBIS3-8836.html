Meksi said that with the canceling of the  contract with the Italian firm Frascino, the responsibility  rests on those who have signed the irregular agreement in  circumstances which perhaps need to be investigated. Due to the  cancellation of the contract, the International Arbitrage Court  decided that Albania must pay a fine worth 48 billion and 289  million lira. "With the price for the compensation of the site,  the value of the site referred to in the contract amounts to  nearly 100 million dollars. We could not allow that someone  become owner of a site through an irregular agreement reached  with the Albanian Government of that time," Mr. Meksi said,  adding that the task of the governments is to put right  irregular actions.    Regarding different comments in the press about the fine  that  the Albanian Government has to pay, Mr. Meksi said that he could  not realise why the press treats the present government which is  restituting an ownership to the Albanian people and not those  who caused these damage to the Albanian economy. With regard to  the prospective of the issue, Mr. Meksi said: "Our jurists and  other experts will consider the best legal solutions for Albania  concerning this unjust question which has damaged the country's  interests. We hope that a positive solution will be found."</p>

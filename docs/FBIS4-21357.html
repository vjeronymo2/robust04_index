			<p>BFN     [Text] Papua New Guinea's [PNG] Minister for Forest Tim  Neville says foreign logging companies smuggled about $120  million worth of tropical timber out of the country during 1992.  He made the claim at a seminar in Lae for visiting Queensland  businessmen, while outlining his plans to ban tropical log  exports from PNG by the year 2000. Sean Dorney reports that Mr.  Neville said these plans will include paying up to about $6  million a year for monitoring of exports.    [Begin recording] Dorney: The forest minister  said Papua New Guinea was about to engage the Swedish  surveillance company, SGS, to monitor all PNG's log exports.  Mr. Neville said SGS did similar work in 27 other countries and  the cost would be more than covered by the revenue that he said  was being currently stolen by unscrupulous foreign logging  companies. He said the officials figured the log exports in  1992 accounted for only about two-thirds of what his department  estimated was felled and shipped away.    Neville: So in 1992 alone, we lost in the order  of about 700,000 cubic meters of timber, which if we work that  out on current log exports price, they are averaging 170 kina  [PNG currency] per cubic meter.    Dorney: That amounted to about US $120 million.  [End recording]</p>

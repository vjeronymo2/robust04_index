			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BELGIUM;  </P> <P> LIBYA DENIES PACT TO FREE 4 CAPTIVES  </P> <P> Libya denied reports that it reached agreement with Belgium over the release of  four Belgians held hostage by Libyan-influenced, radical Palestinians.  </P> <P> The Libyan Embassy in Brussels said Tripoli has "no link with the ongoing  negotiations." The reports had said Brussels agreed to sign trade pacts with  Libya and to free a jailed Palestinian. The Belgian hostages -- Emmanuel  Houtekins, his wife, Godelieve Kets, and their two teen-age children -- were on  a yacht in the Mediterranean in 1987 when they were seized by the Revolutionary  Council of Fatah.  </P></p>

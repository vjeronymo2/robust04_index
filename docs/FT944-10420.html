			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Share surrogate that is easy to trade and settle Depositary receipts have enjoyed such success because they can make buying and selling equity in a company easier for international investors than buying and selling the shares on a local stock exchange, writes Martin Brice. The depositary receipt represents ownership of shares which remain in safe-keeping with a bank in the issuer's home market, often either Bank of New York or Citibank. The receipt itself may be traded elsewhere. Dividend payments are usually in US dollars, and voting rights are usually the same as for the underlying stock. There is little technical difference between a global depositary receipt (GDR) and an American depositary receipt (ADR), although depositary receipts listed in the US tend to be called ADRs while GDRs are often listed elsewhere - for instance in Luxembourg and increasingly in London. The first ADR was issued in 1927, but the first GDR came only four years ago. The forthcoming listing by TeleWest, the UK cable television and tele-communications company, on the US exchange Nasdaq will be called an ADR, but may be bought by any international investor; the recent issue by Bajaj Auto, the Indian scooter maker, was listed in London and called a GDR. When investors buy and sell GDRs, settlement may be through Cedel, Euroclear or DTC, the US settlement system. The documents for issuing a GDR would cost a company around Dollars 100,000, plus fees to the arranging bank of around 3 1/2 per cent of the total raised. An ADR offered and listed in the US would cost a company up to Dollars 1m, of which about half would go on lawyers' fees and much of the rest on printing and accountants' fees, in addition to the bank's fee. Where there are barriers to international investors gaining access to the local stock market, the GDR may fetch a lower or higher price than the shares in the home market. Citibank, the US bank, pioneered GDRs in 1990 with a Dollars 40m issue for the Korean company Samsung. Much of the business is now sourced from investment banks in London, with Goldman Sachs and Jardine Fleming the leaders. About 90 GDRs are traded via Seaq International and listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange. Around 275 ADRs are listed in the US.</p>

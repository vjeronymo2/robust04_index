			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Low price prompts LCH to pull float The Pounds 150m flotation of London Capital Holdings, the property investment company, was pulled yesterday in the face of a weak stock market and investor indigestion at the Pounds 930m of capital raised in the listed property sector this year. The issue was to be launched this morning, but Citibank was not prepared to accept the price at which advisers said its shares would have to be sold. They had planned to raise more than Pounds 100m from the combined sale of up to 70 per cent of Citibank's holding and Pounds 15m of new shares. However, it is believed that Warburg Securities recommended the share offer should be made at a 10 to 15 per cent discount to the company's Pounds 160m net asset value, in line with other recent issues. The property sector was the star performer of the stock market last year, sparking a proliferation of flotation candidates. Capital Shopping Centres, the first property flotation of the year, was offered at a 13 per cent premium to its asset value, but it received an unenthusiastic response. Since then, values have fallen, while competition has intensified, with CLS Holdings, Pillar Properties and Argent Group all launching offers in the past fortnight. Mr Jeffrey Heintz, Citibank's representative on the LCH board, said: 'We weren't prepared to chase the market down for the sake of doing a deal.' LCH has Pounds 245m of gross assets, and is wholly owned by Citibank. Mr Heintz said the bank would review its options. These include relaunching the issue later this year, selling the property portfolio directly, or a private placement with institutions. The offer was being sponsored by Baring Brothers, with Warburg as brokers. LCH was formed from the remnants of Randsworth Trust, which was taken private in 1989 at the peak of the market, but subsequently had to be rescued by its banker - Citibank. The company has a portfolio of West End of London properties, but the management has suffered from the fact that Citibank was restricted from putting new capital into the business. This left the joint managing directors, Mr Nigel Kempner and Mr Stephen Musgrave, with little scope in the rising market, other than to improve the quality of existing properties.</p>

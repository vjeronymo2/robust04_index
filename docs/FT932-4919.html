			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: Inquest of Love - Opera Jonathan Harvey's Inquest of Love, latest premiere in the English National Opera annual series, is an arresting piece of modern music-drama. In its conjoining of old and new, tradition and innovation, it proves to be that rare achievement in the modern opera house, a new opera realised with equal amounts of artistic idealism and practicality. In its two acts a 'whole world' is created in which one spends an unflaggingly concentrated two-and-a-half hours. Rarest achievement of all, it is a new opera whose whole raison d'etre, and command of music-theatre, is reposed in its music. This is possible only because Harvey - librettist (in collaboration with David Rudkin) as well as composer - is an artist of visionary temperament disciplined by a craftsman's precise skills. In this case, and providing the climax to a string of concert and theatre works of similar substance, Harvey has convoked the full resources of a modern opera house to revive there a peculiarly English strain of mysticism. Most of the action unfolds in the afterlife. A spiritual pilgrimage underpins the opera's narrative - passing from violent death (the shooting of a young couple at their moment of wedding vows) through intermediary stages of learning and healing to the final ecstatic carollings of 'O Love-filled Light] O healing Love]'. All of this might suggest that Vaughan Williams's Bunyan opera, Pilgrim's Progress, has found its successor. Or, since at the start the central couple, Ann and John, are about to embark on their wedding ceremony (and a Druidical ancient comes to warn of impending disaster), that Tippett's Midsummer Marriage has been particularly well-remembered by Harvey. (In advance libretto perusal the Tippett-ish Josh, one of three spirit messengers, raises fears of whimsy that the full experience comprehensively allays.) Other influences are no less easily cited: Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, for its tale of a soul in passage (last Saturday Andrew Clements quoted in these columns Harvey's acknowledgement of just such an influence); Parsifal, for the scenes of liturgical ceremony musically structured on the awesome sound of tolling bells; Stockhausen's epic conceptions, for their awakening through electronic-music apparatus of (in Harvey's own words) 'a new reality, a different world'; Britten's Church Parables; medieval church drama; Anglican chant. And much else. This being so, it is remarkable how completely itself the new opera feels to be. Its three functional levels are musically interlocked - by the electronic element (breath-sounds, church-choirs, bells), keeping in contact with the spiritual universe beyond the narrative foreground; by infusions of a consciously archaic liturgical idiom (modal chanting and exquisite hymnic concords for the 'otherworld' characters); and by jagged vocal and orchestral characterisation for the three central figures - John, Ann, the rejected, vengeful sister Elspeth - to develop on their journey. The sense that Harvey's opera is not just a unity of all its parts but that all those parts are expertly co-ordinated in the libretto informs the whole experience. It is an experience welling out of the balance between light and dark, slow and fast movement, between the disintegrative style of the first act (with its Rashomon-like re-viewings of the murder-act from different angles) and the regenerative forms and impulses of the second. No criticism? Well, word-singing is unclear much of time - but that, like the many passing mystifications of the staging, should perhaps be laid at the door of the producer, David Pountney, With his designer, Nigel Lowery, he treats the libretto with characteristic freedom. As always with Pountney the staging is richly resourceful, full of energy, irony, and an individual stamp of imagery (much of the latter provided by the dance troupe Second Stride). The emotional and psychological charge is strong. Nevertheless, advance reading of the libretto (published by Faber) may waken hunger for the 'old-fashioned' numinous atmosphere that Harvey imagined and Pountney then elected to excise. What is surely beyond criticism is the impassioned commitment of the musical forces under Mark Elder, who closes his period of ENO office with a tremendous feat of sustained sympathy with a composer's vision. The principals, alert with dramatic involvement and musical confidence, must all be named: Peter Coleman-Wright (John), Linda McLeod (Ann), Helen Field (a thrilling Elspeth), Richard Van Allan (the Abbot), and Ethna Nan Christie, Ethna Robinson and Barry Banks as the three spirit-messengers. In description Inquest of Love may sound to the general opera-goer off-puttingly like a neo-Buddhist or New Age tract gone operatic; in the theatre it proves anything but simple-minded, or Instant-Ecstasy-inducing in the manner of Part or Gorecki. Of the ENO new-opera commissions this is, I believe, the outstanding achievement so far, the one built to last.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Halle -- The leadership of the Bundestag group of  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has sharply  criticized the behavior of the police and judicial organs in  connection with the bloody riots in Magdeburg last Thursday [12  May]. SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse stated today at the  end of a two-day visit to Saxony-Anhalt that it is unacceptable  that the impression is being created that the perpetrators have  been released again. This is an invitation for more acts of  violence. The Magdeburg policy apparently did react resolutely  enough. It is the state's duty to react to violence with all  instruments that are available.</p>

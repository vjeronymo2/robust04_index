			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Something rotten in the state of Italy: Corruption scandals involving MPs and businessmen could lead to a reform of the electoral system Like the passengers on the Titanic, Italy's politicians have tended to assume that they operate in an unsinkable environment. But the resignation this week of Mr Bettino Craxi, forced to step down after 16 years' leadership of the Socialist party because of alleged corruption, is proof that the postwar political ship is sinking. The departure of Mr Craxi marks the end of an era, and will accelerate the extraordinary and confused process of political change that is now sweeping Italy. The country is lurching towards reform of the unstable system of proportional representation that has produced 51 coalition governments in the last 47 years. Reform in turn will produce early elections, perhaps by October; and these elections are likely to redraw the political map. Change has come from an unexpected quarter - the magistrature. Since the second world war, the Italian judicial system has been weak, easily subverted by political interference or the tangle of conflicting laws. But over the past year, an investigation, begun by Milan magistrates into corruption on public works contracts has brought into its net 47 members of parliament and several leading businessmen. 'It's as if we are putting parking fines on cars in a city which has had no parking laws: no matter how many fines you impose there are always more cars  -it's an indictment of an entire regime,' observed one television commentator this week. Each day a new set of arrests is announced, producing a 'who-is-next?' hysteria among much of the public. On Thursday, Milan stock prices tumbled and treasury bills were sold in panic, as rumours spread that more top businessmen and members of the government were in line for investigation. These reactions underscored the way in which the scandals have touched the core of the system. For more than a decade Mr Craxi has been a central figure, guiding the Christian Democrat-Socialist alliance which has dominated every aspect of state. The 59-year-old autocrat, along with his Christian Democrat colleagues, Mr Giulio Andreotti and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, symbolised the permanence of the status quo. This time last year, there was an understanding among Italy's political leaders that Mr Andreotti would move from the premiership after the April general elections to become the next president. Mr Craxi was to become prime minister and Mr Forlani was to retain control of the Christian Democrats. Of this trio, dubbed the 'CAF' from their surnames, the veteran Mr Andreotti has withdrawn discreetly to the sidelines and Mr Forlani has reluctantly accepted responsibility for mismanagement of the elections by stepping down last autumn from the leadership of the Christian Democrat party. Mr Craxi, however, refused to recognise that the Socialist party's poor election results were a consequence of of his arrogant style of leadership and of the public's identification of his party with a corrupt power structure. Then President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (chosen because Mr Andreotti was too identified with the corrupt system) rejected him as an unacceptable candidate for the premiership and chose Mr Craxi's deputy, Prof Giuliano Amato. But it took a revolt within the party and six separate warrants from Milan magistrates to force his resignation. The warrants advised Mr Craxi he was under investigation for alleged illicit party financing through kickbacks on public contracts and deals. By protesting his innocence and clinging to power, Mr Craxi merely accumulated more public odium. Lately he has been insulted in the street with a venom not seen since the days of fascism. In contrast, Mr Antonio di Pietro, the Milan magistrate leading the inquiry, has become a national hero, emblazoned on t-shirts and praised in graffiti. The exit of such an unpopular figure as Mr Craxi could assuage some of the public's appetite for justice over what they regard as a monstrous robbery perpetrated on the electorate by a corrupt political class. Mr Di Pietro, for his part, raised the question this week of whether it was feasible to bring an entire regime to justice in a democracy without undermining the fabric of democracy itself. Evidence leaks out daily from the magistrates of the scale on which the main political parties subverted the state apparatus to their own profit. More than 105 politicians, businessmen and civil servants have so far confessed to taking part in a system whereby public works contracts were awarded on the basis of illicit payments to fund party organisations. The proceeds were then split on the basis of the importance of the various parties in a particular city or their share of the national vote. The current scandals were revealed almost accidentally last February, when Mr Mario Chiesa, a Socialist apparatchik in Milan, was caught red-handed taking a L7m (Pounds 3,200) bribe for a hospital contract. Mr Chiesa proved a small cog in a much larger wheel. Magistrates have since been on the trail. The latest line of investigation centres on the electricity industry. Political leaders are alleged to have placed their representatives on the board of ENEL, the state electricity authority, to win a share of some L22,800bn (Pounds 10.4bn) in contracts at five power stations. Under the Italian judicial system, the magistrate plays the accusatory role, amassing evidence which must then pass through a lengthy court process. More than 70 per cent of prosecutions fail. However, whatever the outcome of the court cases, stories in the press mean that the reputations of a large number of politicians have been damaged, many irretrievably. For instance Mr Claudio Martelli, one-time heir to Mr Craxi, was forced to resign from the justice portfolio on Wednesday, following an announcement he was under investigation for alleged corruption. Mr Martelli was seen as one of the few people capable of rejuvenating a demoralised Socialist party and perhaps forging an alliance of the left with the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The series of corruption scandals has left Mr Amato in an increasingly anomalous position as prime minister. The legitimacy of his coalition has been undermined because its two principal components, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, have become so tainted by the corruption scandal. But no one denies his achievements, such as introducing a tough budget and reforming the state pension scheme in the past eight months, and he has the backing of President Scalfaro. Mr Amato is expected to seek ways to broaden support for his government and carry out a cabinet reshuffle. This week he said his priority was to ensure approval for electoral reform as quickly as possible. Parliament has a scheme before it, prepared by a joint commission, which proposes the majority of seats in both houses be filled on a first-past-the-post basis. The proposal is in line with the ideas for electoral reform put forward by the Referendum Movement. The cross-party group's proposals have already been accepted as the subject of a referendum due to be held between April and June. In any event, legislation changing the existing system of proportional representation should be ready before the summer recess. However, the current system's crisis is affecting Mr Amato's authority. From now on, he will find it more difficult to govern. In particular, it will be hard to keep the budget on target, implement the government's privatisation programme and ease the impact of growing unemployment. He recently likened his government to a hydrofoil riding on a cushion of air  -capable of lasting, as long as no one realises the support was merely air. With luck, and in the absence of an alternative, this cushion of air will last until early elections. In the present climate, these cannot be put off much later than the autumn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A YEAR OF LIVING ANXIOUSLY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 17, 1992 Mario Chiesa, Socialist party member running Italy's oldest charitable institution arrested while receiving a lire 7m kick-back.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- April 5 Day after general elections in which Christian Democrats and Socialists lose votes, first important local politicians investigated.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 29 Giuliano Amato forms government.

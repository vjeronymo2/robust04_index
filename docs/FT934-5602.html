			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Ulster peace efforts in turmoil: Government accused of lying over IRA dialogue - PM backs Mayhew Mr John Major's government was last night struggling to salvage efforts to restore peace to Northern Ireland after a damaging admission that it had been in prolonged contact with the IRA. Amid a storm of criticism from hard-line Unionists and accusations of duplicity from opposition parties, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he would make a full House of Commons statement later today on the contacts. The dialogue, stretching back to February and including an exchange as late as November 5, marks the most intensive dealings between the British government and the IRA for at least a decade. But its disclosure cast a shadow over prospects for Mr Major's forthcoming summit meeting with Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minister. The summit is still pencilled in for this Friday but there were doubts in Whitehall last night about whether, in the wake of the disclosures, the two leaders could make a breakthrough in their search for a political settlement. Mr Major gave firm backing to Sir Patrick's insistence that a series of messages passed through an intermediary to Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, had not amounted to negotiating with terrorists. Downing Street said there was no question of the Northern Ireland secretary being forced to resign in the wake of the meetings - at least three, in March, August and November - between the unnamed intermediary and Sinn Fein representatives. It would have been 'irresponsible' not to respond to such overtures. But ministers admitted privately that the weekend disclosures sat uneasily with the repeated and vigorous denials in recent weeks from Mr Major and Sir Patrick that there had been negotiations or 'talks' with the IRA. There was also acknowledgment that the affair might have severely damaged hopes of bringing the provinces's Unionists into talks on a new political settlement. The Reverend William McCrea, the Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, who made public documents confirming the contacts, said that Mr Major had been telling direct lies at a meeting last week between the two of them and the Reverend Ian Paisley, the DUP leader. Reaction from the Ulster Unionists, however, was significantly more restrained, with the party's MPs saying they would wait for Sir Patrick's full statement before taking a definite position. Sir Patrick said yesterday no civil servants had been involved in 'authorised' contacts with Sinn Fein through a 'chain' established several years ago when Baroness Thatcher was prime minister. The latest process had begun in February with an approach from the IRA suggesting it wanted advice on ending its armed campaign, he said. Sir Patrick told a hastily-convened press conference in Belfast that: 'I do not believe had I made no response, had the government made no response, that if subsequent bombs were exploded and life taken and people injured - as indeed was the case - I would have been readily forgiven by the people of Northern Ireland.' That version of events was flatly denied by Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, who accused Sir Patrick of 'lying'. Mr Adams said there had been no communication from the IRA saying that the conflict had ended. Mr Martin McGuinness, the prominent Sinn Fein leader with whom the messages were exchanged, said high-level contacts were continuing with the full knowledge of the prime minister. As the government embarked on a desperate damage limitation exercise, Sir Patrick said it would publish in full both the documents sent to Sinn Fein and those transmitted by the IRA to London. In an attempt to reassure the mainstream Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux, Sir Patrick insisted that at no time had the government dropped its condition that there could be no negotiations until the IRA brought its terrorist campaign to a permanent end. It is understood, however, that the documents include an explicit offer of a place in negotiations for Sinn Fein if the IRA ceases its campaign  - an offer made public by Mr Major when he met Mr Reynolds in Brussels last month. They also carried the suggestion that a dialogue could begin even if an end to the conflict was not publicly declared. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's credibility was at stake after what had been at best 'stupidity' and at worst 'duplicity'.

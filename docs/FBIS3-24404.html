			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ignatenko under the heading: "American </F> Diplomacy Steps Up Its Activity on Russia's Southern Borders:  The Consequences of This Could Be Ambiguous, Including for the  United States Itself"]    [Text]    The United States is increasing its penetration of the  region  of the post-Soviet South--the Caucasus and Central Asia. The  local states here are being drawn into the NATO Partnership for  Peace program. The news media are carrying reports each more  sensational than the last: The Americans are studying the  question of safeguarding Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea coast with the  American Coastguard; NATO emissaries are proposing the formation  in Kyrgyzstan of a mountain division; the American State  Department (sic) is working out a plan for the commitment of UN  "blue helmets" to the zone of the Georgia-Abkhaz conflict with  the obligatory withdrawal of Russian troops beyond the River  Psou, that is, beyond the Georgian-Russian border; the United  States is offering to assist Georgia in the creation of a  Georgian regular army.    These and other facts compel the assumption that the United  States (directly in places, under the "roof" of NATO and the  United Nations in others) has made an emphatic turn toward the  post-Soviet South, methodically supplanting the Russians in this  region. Not all the enumerated facts and assessments lend  themselves to swift verification, and it could be that I am  mistaken in some respects, but I do not want to be overtaken by  events and would like, before it is too late, to address to  those who make the decisions in Washington (may they believe  me!) some well-meant thoughts.    Were I an American "hawk," I also, most likely, would be  drawn toward the post-Soviet South. Why?    The United States could peacefully or with the minimum use  of  military force score an unprecedented strategic win. Having  penetrated the region of the post-Soviet South, it would have  moved into the rear of a whole number of states against which  the United States has or could have complaints of various kinds  (Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, China, Pakistan, India, and, of  course, Russia).    Test ranges of the former Ministry of Defense of the USSR  (nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological and missile and space  research centers on the territory of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan)  are located in the region. It cannot be ruled out that there are  some in the United States who are interpreting the slogan of the  Nevada-Semipalatinsk antinuclear movement as an itinerary for  the transfer of test ranges. But exclusion of the possibility of  use of the Baykonur complex by the Russian military and space  forces (and, possibly, its use by NATO and the United States)  would be of the greatest importance to the United States in a  military-strategic respect.    The United States could also control the raw material  resources of the post-Soviet South. The detachment of Russia  from the strategically important types of raw material of  Central Asia which Russia either lacks, virtually, or of which  it has insufficient quantities--uranium, copper-porphyritic,  pyrite, and stratiform ores, manganese, chromites, strontium  ores, germanium, and so forth--is possible. Naturally, use of  these stocks by the United States itself and/or its allies  cannot be ruled out either.    And what is most important, perhaps: OIL. This requires a  separate paragraph. The priority interests of the United States  include control of the Caspian hydrocarbon mega-field, just  about the most important in the world, whose oil and gas beds  can be developed not only in Iran but also in the post-Soviet  South--Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.    The United States also needs to ensure its control of the  shipment of raw material and other resources both in the Central  Asia-Caucasus-Europe direction and in the Central Asia-Indian  Ocean direction.    And, finally, stability. The United States needs  this to realize the listed and other of its interests.  Naturally, the stability must correspond to American criteria.  To this end the United States must do its utmost to establish in  the region of the post-Soviet South pro-America regimes of a  liberal-democratic persuasion.    It is possible that I have not mentioned everything. But  even  the considerations that have been noted are sufficient for  recognizing the charted aims as being to the advantage of the  United States.    I would like to call Americans' attention to the problems  that would threaten the United States in the event of their  forced penetration of the post-Soviet South. The threats and  dangers would grow in the proportion to the number and scale of  America's successes, what is more.    First, what is most obvious. Russia could not fail  to respond to attempts to make it a passive observer of the  processes, extremely dangerous for its very future, that are  already under way on its southern borders. The specter of a new  "cold war" already looms in Russian-American relations. It is  obvious also that a development of events in the contemplated  direction would signify a growth of the anti-American mood in  Russia, the corresponding evolution of the regime (if not its  replacement), and an even greater exacerbation of  Russian-American relations.    Second, the intrusion of a foreign element into  the region and an aspiration to isolate and weaken Russia and  the other regional powers with traditional interests here--all  this could disrupt the stable geopolitical balance, which would  inevitably lead to the unpredictable and dangerous fragmentation  of the geopolitical space. In a search for military-political  allies, Russia could turn to Iran, Iraq....    Third, in the Americans' place I would think long  and hard before undertaking a concentrated military-political  penetration of the region of the post-Soviet South. The region  is characterized by an extremely high degree of conflict  potential. A listing of the conflicts that have flared up and  those that are ready to erupt (even more numerous and serious)  could have taken up the whole of this article. The introduction  into this zone of a foreign element and internationalization of  the conflicts with regard to the United States would necessarily  signify a growth of the conflict potential. And, naturally,  destabilization--regional and, possibly, global.    Fourth, were I an American, I would beware of an  outbreak of Islamic fundamentalism--not that which is attributed  to Iran but that which would flourish independently, without  outside influence even, as a luxuriant bloom in all Muslim  states of the post-Soviet South to which the United States came.  Imagine, in addition, a combination of different streams of  Islamic fundamentalism here--Near East and Middle East, Central  Asian and Caucasian.... Imagine also a combination of Islamic  fundamentalism and Russian nationalism (there have been such  theoretical and practical attempts)....    Fifth, no one has yet calculated what the  corresponding expenditure would cost the American taxpayer. And  how many American soldiers would, God forbid, lay down their  lives in the mountains of the Caucasus and the deserts of  Central Asia.    American penetration of the post-Soviet South would be  dangerous primarily for the United States itself, not to mention  the likelihood of regional and global destabilization. I see the  Americans in this region in the role of torch-bearers who have  blundered into the powder magazine. God bless America!</p>

A further rise of 8.2 per cent is expected by 1994, bringing the total increase between 1991 and 1994 to 24 per cent. Growth in the supply of graduates is not being matched by the demand from employers, the service says. The graduate unemployment figure has been held down by the numbers going on to teacher training and further academic study. Graduates 1992-94, Volume I.

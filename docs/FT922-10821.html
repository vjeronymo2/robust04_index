			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minnova outlines its plans for Izok Lake project CANADA'S Minnova mining company hopes to build up reserves at its Izok Lake copper-zinc-lead project in northern Canada to justify a 1993 construction go-ahead and a production start late in 1996, according to Mr David Watkins, Minnova's president. The company, controlled by Noranda, bought Izok Lake from Falconbridge last year for CDollars 20m (Pounds 9.5m) and recently sold 40 per cent to the German-controlled Metall Mining for CDollars 17m. Minnova is the operator and puts development costs at CDollars 250m or more for the open pit mine and port near Coppermine, Northwest Territories, 2,000 miles north of Calgary. The company has three drills working at Izok Lake. It will also add reserves from two other properties it owns in the area. Estimated reserves are 13.5m tonnes grading an average 3.2 per cent of copper, 14.4 per cent of zinc, 1.3 per cent of lead and 74 grammes a tonne of silver. 'We're thinking in terms of a mine life of 25-30 years,' said Mr Watkins. Speaking after Minnova's annual meeting, he called Izok lake 'one of the world's major high-grade base metal properties'. Other companies with mines or undeveloped properties nearby may want to invest in it, he added. Minnova planned a mill at the mine site and would truck the concentrates 150 miles to port, Mr Watkins said. They would be stockpiled and pulled out during an eight-month shipping season in a 50,000 tonnes Class IV ice-breaking bulk carrier, via the Northwest Passage. The Point Barrow route around the northern tip of Alaska would have a two months season only, Mr Watkins said. The vessel would also pull nickel concentrates from northern Quebec. The high-grade Raglan mines have been awaiting development for 25 years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ From the "Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel" </F> program]    [Text] We are in 1994. The present state of the Angolan  industry is truly gloomy and worrisome because of an almost  total paralyzation of productive activity during 1993, reducing  production levels to less than 30 percent. This situation,  created by the destruction of infrastructure, lack of raw  materials, and the obsolete state of equipment, caused major  imbalances in the present economy, which is characterized by an  ever increasing inflation.    The occupation of some industrial areas by the warmongering  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA],  such as Huambo, the second biggest industrial province in the  country, influenced to a large extent the low level of  production registered during 1993, particularly in the fields of  food, beverages, and confection.    In financial terms, the industrial sector received $35.4  million for operational programs on a quarterly basis, but the  Angolan industrial sector needs $700 million for its  rehabilitation. Of the $35.4 million, more than $8 million were  used to obtain raw materials, mainly wheat and corn flour,  yeast, and wheat grain. The remaining amount was given to  companies that had raw materials but needed other essentials to  produce commodities.    Importing raw materials served as a foundation for the  Angolan Industrial Association to hold trade fairs to exhibit  products produced in the country. Strategies and priorities to  reorganize and develop Angolan entrepreneurship and  privatizations were defined in 1993, although the process has  been moving slowly. Measures liberalizing prices and giving  management autonomy where possible, were also implemented.  Thus, work is under way to transform state units into  commercial elements. There are still some difficulties. These  include the fact that an adequate economic atmosphere does not  exist, the need for a consolidated and experienced  entrepreneurship, as well as shortage of equipment, financial  resources, technology, and management.    In the very short-term, the fundamental objective is to be  able to increase the utilization of available resources in the  fields of industry, capital, and labor, thus guaranteeing  minimum levels of efficiency. Accordingly, the government's  strategy in 1994 should be to make use of good points and  eliminate weak points. Good points are an abundance of natural  resources, excellent conditions to obtain energy at low prices,  the geopolitical situation, and the agricultural, livestock, and  fishery [word indistinct]. Weak points would be the war  situation, the destroyed industrial sector, excessive  bureaucracy and restrictions to free initiative, the shortage of  modern and trained national entrepreneurs to carry out  productive activities, and restrictions to foreign investment,  among other things.    The prevalence of restrictions and limitations, viewed as  weak points, must have evidently affected the rate of the  utilization of productive capacity, which was less than 30  percent during 1993. The manufaturing industry was one of the  sectors with serious reductions. Thus, its production, after  suffering a 75 percent decline from 1975 to 1976, experienced an  increase from 1977 to 1983, and once again a decline from 1985  to 1994.    Employment in the manufacturing industry decreased from  200,000 in 1970's to less than 70,000 in 1993. To reduce the  high rate of unemployment, the government must define some  strategic parameters to formulate a re-industrialization plan.  Hence, there is a need to draw up a program with general and  specific actions, such as guaranteeing a minimum production  program for viable food industries. There is also a need to  encourage production in heavy industry, which is currently  experiencing a small injection of fresh money to advance forward  and to adopt measures aimed at improving the efficiency of the  enterprise sector and developing Angolan entrepreneurship and  privatization.    In the mining sector, the 1993 production results were below  the planned levels because the vast and rich diamond-producing  areas were paralyzed, following their occupation by UNITA  warmongering forces led by Dr. Jonas Malheiro. In view of this  situation, the production by the Angola National Diamond  Enterprise [Endiama] totalled 20,000 monthly [words indistinct],  50 percent of normal activity at Lucapa and Zage, presently  known as Andrada.    During the first six months of this year [as heard], Endiama  saw its production reduced $300 million, because the Cuango  diamond area in Lunda Norte Province was paralyzed. Illegal  diamond trafficking reached alarming proportions, to the value  of $500 million, forcing the government to adopt urgent measures  to halt it. These measures included restricting people's  movement in areas with the most diamond activity. What is more,  proposals by foreign investors to exploit other minerals, such  as granite, marble, and lime, particularly in southern Angola,  cannot be realized because of the war imposed on us by UNITA's  warmongering wing, led by Dr. Jonas Savimbi.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Joe Joyce report: "Takeover Bid for Irish TSB Puts </F> Coalition in Jeopardy"]    [Text] Dublin -- An attempted takeover of Ireland's  Trustee Savings Bank [TSB] by the smallest of the Irish retail  banks has threatened a serious split in the coalition government  and prompted charges by other bankers of secret deals.    National Australia Bank, through its National Irish  subsidiary, is believed to have offered the government about  IR100 million [Irish pounds] (97 million pounds) for the  slightly larger TSB. The merger would give the new group about  10 percent of the Irish market with combined assets of IR2.3  billion.    The deal, approved by the TSB's trustees, would spell the  end  of a government policy to establish a third banking force  through the merger of the TSB and two small state-owned banks,  the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit  Corporation.    It has also prompted anger among other banks who are  interested in the TSB. The main alternative bidder is Ulster  Bank, the local subsidiary of National Westminster, which made  an unsuccessful bid for the Dublin TSB three years ago.    Ulster's chief executive, David Went, has said it would be  extraordinary if other banks were not now allowed to bid. The  TSB can be valued properly only if it is exposed to the market,  he said.    But the main obstacle is the opposition of the Labour Party,  the junior partner in the coalition government. A third force  to take on the two dominant Irish banks, AIB and Bank of  Ireland, is close to its heart.    Several Labour backbenchers have condemned the proposed  deal.  Dick Spring, party leader and deputy prime minister, insisted  yesterday that proposals would be considered only in the context  of existing government policy. "We're not going to be rushed by  any banker or any person directing his own banking interest," he  said.    The deal is more attractive to Fianna Fail, the main  government party, especially if it can be presented as creating  a new force in Irish banking. National Irish and the TSB say  their merger would provide significant competition by targeting  the small business and personal customers in whom AIB and Bank  of Ireland are perceived to have little interest.</p>

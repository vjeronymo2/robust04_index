			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Press Group of Kiev's Procurator's Office; </F> "The Boychyshyn Affair: The Search Continues"]    [Text] As already reported, on 18 January 1994, the Kiev  Procurator's Office initiated a criminal case to investigate the  fact of disappearance of Ukraine's People's Rukh [Movement for  Perestroyka] Deputy Chairman Mykhaylo Boychyshyn.    A day earlier, the Internal Affairs Administration of Kiev's  Radyanskyy Rayon initiated a criminal case to investigate the  acts of hooliganism committed by two unknown persons on 15  January 1994 in the building occupied by Rukh.    In the capital, as well as in Lvov and Odessa Oblasts,  operational investigation groups were created to study all the  circumstances of the incident. The groups include officials of  the Procurator's Office, Security Service, and the Militia.    The search continues: In Kiev, tens of thousands of  facilities, in particular, railroads, wooded areas, and water  reservoirs, were examined. Similar work was conducted in Lvov,  where the victim previously lived and worked. There, M.I.  Boychyshyn's [internal] passport was found in a mail-box. The  investigators' group appeals to those who have found the  passport with a request to give their particulars to the  militia. We also ask the person who telephoned Boychyshyn on 15  January 1994 at 19:40 [local time] to respond.    The search is based upon several versions. In particular, in  connection with his participation in the election campaign,  financial relations with representatives of business circles,  possible unlawful acts on the part of criminal groupings, and  also assumptions made by Stanislav Husak from Minsk (such  information was spread by RUKH-PRESS on 13 April) on the  involvement of Russian special services in Boychyshyn's  disappearance, in view of the fact that the latter intended to  hold, in Kiev, an international conference on the Balto-Black  Sea oil reservoir.    We once again appeal to all those citizens, who can provide  any information on the circumstances of Mykhaylo Illyarovych  Boychyshyn's disappearance, with a request to turn to the  nearest militia department.</p>

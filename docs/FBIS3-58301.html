			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirella Kalostipi from </F> Brussels--live]    [Excerpt] Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening from Brussels.  A short while ago Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou concluded  his news conference following the end of the first day of the  NATO summit. The 16 NATO leaders will shortly begin the  traditional working dinner during which they will discuss  details of vital problems. The prime minister said that during  this dinner he plans to raise both the issue of Skopje and that  of Cyprus. When asked if the issue of Cyprus was raised during  the summit meeting thus far, since we had a proposal by Cypriot  President Glavkos Kliridhis regarding demilitarization of  Cyprus, Prime Minister Papandreou said that it was neither the  appropriate time nor the proper climate to raise the issue at  that time. Prime Minister Papandreou said that he will raise  the Cyprus issue during the dinner that will begin shortly.    It is also certain that during the dinner there will be a  discussion of the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. Responding to a  question during the news conference on whether Greece's views  are different from those of the United States regarding the  Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, Prime Minister Papandreou said that  it is an issue that is subject to interpretation. He also said  that there is no plan for military intervention but there is a  warning message to the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs that the time  limit has expired and that this tragic game must end. The prime  minister repeated that military intervention would be a  dangerous adventure and questioned what would happen to the  peacekeeping forces that are already stationed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prime minister said that every  opportunity will be given to the opposing factions to avoid  military intervention and added that even the issue of a gradual  lifting of sanctions imposed should be added to this difficult  dialogue among the involved parties.    At this point, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias intervened  and added that sanctions should be lifted to help the  peacemaking process. Papoulias said that there are new facts  and added that it is not only the Serbs that should be blamed  but the other involved parties, too. However, at this point we  should stress what has been reported earlier, that in tomorrow's  final communique on the Yugoslav problem, and specifically on  the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, the 16 leaders will indeed warn  that increased sanctions could be imposed against any side that  supports violence and force.    Responding to another question regarding the Franco-German  plan, the prime minister said that he believes the positions he  took during the summit express a united Europe. At this point,  Prime Minister Papandreou said that French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe will pay an official visit to Athens next month. He  added that most allies have a certain reservation regarding the  use of force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the other issues,  Papandreou described the NATO meeting as a very important one  during which significant decisions were made. One of these  decisions, the prime minister said, is the cooperation for  peace, which is an attempt to accept the cooperation of  countries that were members of the former Warsaw Pact and other  CSCE member countries. He added that this is very important for  Greece because this possibility includes Cyprus as well.  [passage omitted]</p>

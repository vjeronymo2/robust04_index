			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson buys Canadian malls Hammerson, the revamped property company which last year came under new management, yesterday announced its second large purchase this year. It is acquiring three Canadian shopping malls in a deal worth CDollars 160m (Pounds 75m). The developments in south-west Ontario provide net rents of CDollars 15.5m, providing an initial yield of 9.7 per cent. The company, which last year raised Pounds 199m in a right issue, acquired a Pounds 143.3m property portfolio from Postel in March. The deal left the pension fund with a 12.3 per cent stake in Hammerson. The latest acquisition will provide the group with 1.2m sq ft of prime retail space at Westmount shopping centre, London; Stone Road Mall, Guelph and Tillsonburg Town Centre. The overall vacancy rate of the three centres is below 3 per cent. Mr Ronald Spinney, chief executive, said that about 50 per cent of the purchase cost will be provided from cash resources. For the balance, Hammerson will take on long term mortgages with a weighted average life of 10 years and an average interest rate of 9.3 per cent. Hammerson is seeking to rebalance its portfolio which last year declined in value to Pounds 1.46bn, after a 14 per cent decline in the company's properties in continental Europe, North America and Australasia was only partially offset by a 9.1 per cent increase in UK properties. Mr Spinney said yesterday: 'This is an excellent acquisition in line with our strategy of increasing the retail content within our overall portfolio. In the light of the continuing improvement in the Canadian economy we believe this is an opportune time to be adding to our retail portfolio.'</p>

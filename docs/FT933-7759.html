			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts hit by profit-taking as rate cut hopes recede UK GOVERNMENT bonds weakened across the board as the prospect of an interest rate cut appeared to recede and some investors took profits. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said in a TV interview that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, was 'satisfied with the present level of interest rates'. The news dampened hopes of a cut in the base rate, currently at 6 per cent, and short-dated gilts fell around 3/16 on the day. The inflation and retail sales figures released yesterday did not make much impact on the market, dealers said, as they were in line with expectations. The annual inflation rate edged up in July to 1.4 per cent, from 1.2 per cent in June, while underlying inflation (which strips out the effects of mortgage interest payments) inched up from 2.8 per cent to 2.9 per cent, which is still well within the government's target of 1 to 4 per cent. Trading was mainly futures-driven, and the Liffe gilt future ended at 113.11, against the previous close of 113.21, having moved in a range of 113.07 to 113.31. ANOTHER bout of rate-cut speculation invigorated some European government bond markets yesterday, with Spain and Italy seeing some early buying interest, although initial enthusiasm appeared to wane in the course of the day. The French government bond market closed higher, buoyed by the strength of the franc and hopes of further easings by the central bank. There was some speculation that the overnight rate may be lowered again as early as today at the repo, following Tuesday's 50 basis point cut to 8.75 per cent. Meanwhile, trading in German government bonds was lacklustre as the market awaited the release of M3 money supply figures. The Liffe bund future opened at 97.36 and traded at 97.22 by late afternoon. TRADING in Australian government bonds was volatile in the wake of the country's federal budget, announced late on Tuesday. Traders initially sold off Australian bonds, focusing on a budget forecast of an increase in Australia's headline inflation rate from the current 1.9 per cent to 3.5 per cent by the end of 1994. This saw yields on 10-year Commonwealth bonds jump from 6.8 per cent before the budget to over 7 per cent in offshore trading, eventually peaking at 7.1 per cent in early Australian trading yesterday. But the sell-off was reversed in late trade, with yields easing to 6.9 per cent as traders refocused on the likelihood of another official interest rate cut before the year-end. Among shorter-dated securities, the Reserve Bank's treasury note auction yesterday saw yields ease from 4.790 per cent to 4.595 per cent on 13-week notes. PORTUGAL will issue up to Es750bn of fixed-rate treasury bonds this year, Es150bn more than originally planned, Reuter reports. The government is to reduce its planned issue of family savings certificates by Es150bn to Es50bn so there would be no increase in the overall volume of debt issued. 'Raising the limit of Treasury bond issues was foreseeable, particularly if we wanted to increase the depth of the market and its liquidity, so this should be viewed simply as a routine measure,' Treasury director Mr Manuel Pinho said. IN THE US, the yield curve continued to flatten yesterday as the long end posted strong gains while the short end slumbered. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  23/32 at 99 7/8 , yielding 6.255 per cent, yet another new record low for the issue. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up only 1/16 at 100 17/32 , to yield 3.946 per cent. Traders put the early gains among longer-dated securities down to a follow-through from overnight demand on foreign markets, especially in Japapn, and to some futures-related buying. Volume was light throughout the day, which magnified the impact of early buying. Continued speculation that the Federal Reserve would buy securities outright via a coupon pass also fuelled demand at the long end. Bonds have risen to new highs mainly because economic fundamentals are still positive - the economy continues to grow slowly, and inflation remains low - and supply pressures are no longer a concern now that the final 30-year issue of 1993 is out of the way.</p>

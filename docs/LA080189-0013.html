			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FACES/PLACES  </P> <P> John Cougar Mellencamp has had it. The artist says he needs a break from rock  'n' roll and will not tour to promote his recently released album, "Big Daddy."  "I need to get out of this business for a while," he said. "I've been beating  my head against the wall since I was 23. I've got no family, no self-respect --  I've put everything into the rock 'n' roll business. And I don't think they're  going to give me a crown for it in heaven, either." DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

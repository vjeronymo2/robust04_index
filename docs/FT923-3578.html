			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television One's heart scarcely lifts at the thought of yet another police series, but the opening episode of Between The Lines last week was extremely impressive. Perhaps the time is ripe for a series which looks specifically at those internal units intended to police the police themselves, in this instance London's CIB: Complaints Investigation Bureau. In today's episode (9.30 BBC1) policemen shoot dead an armed man who is trying to force his way into his girl friend's flat and are accused of operating a 'shoot to kill' policy. Rumour has it that Paul Merton is planning to have a night's sleep some time in 1996. Meanwhile he continues to participate in every series which has any connection with new comedy. He is credited as co-writer on C4's new vehicle for Julian Clary, Terry And Julian (10.30), which is followed by a repeat of Paul Merton: The Series (11.00). The Fall Of The House Of Usher (12.10 BBC1) is that rarity, a rather good horror movie. It remains fairly faithful to the book, stars Vincent Price at the top of his form in 1960, and achieves an effective atmosphere without straining to terrify the life out of you as today's shockers do.</p>

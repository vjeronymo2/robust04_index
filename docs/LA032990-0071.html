			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAMSTRING SIDELINES SCHOFIELD FOR MINIMUM OF THREE WEEKS  </P> <P> Angel shortstop Dick Schofield, who reinjured his right hamstring Tuesday, went  to Los Angeles Wednesday to be examined by team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum. The  preliminary word is that Schofield could be out a minimum of three weeks, but  Manager Doug Rader said that could change.  </P> <P> Schofield said the injury "crept up on me," after he did the initial damage  while running a week before spring training opened.  </P> <P> In the interim, Rader said Mark McLemore and Kent Anderson will share time at  shortstop.  </P> <P> "McLemore has more speed, but the bottom line on Anderson is that he played a  half-season for us at shortstop, and for a great number of those days we were  in first place," Rader said. "That's very much in his favor. You have to weigh  the athleticism of McLemore against what the kid has done for you on a  pennant-contending club." HELENE ELLIOTT  </P></p>

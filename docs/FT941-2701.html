			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Brussels agitates against American regulatory charges on foreign banks The European Union is to step up pressure on the US to reverse plans to introduce charges for the regulatory supervision of non-US banks operating in the US. A meeting of European finance ministers on Monday will authorise a strongly worded protest to the US Federal Reserve and the Senate banking committee, insisting that the new regulations contravene the Gatt agreement, European Commission officials said yesterday. The issue is likely to make further difficulty in trade relations as the EU and US wrangle over their final offers for market access before a Gatt meeting next month. Commission officials in Brussels said the proposed audit charges were 'grossly discriminatory' because they would only affect non-US banks. 'The fact that this is going to the economics ministers' council shows how seriously we take this,' a commission official said. The Federal Reserve has so far refrained from indicating how high the charges would be. However, the development has prompted anger among European banks and governments, which say that the charges would impose an unfair burden on European and other banks operating in the US and contravene the principle of national treatment. One European diplomat yesterday said: 'In money terms, this might not necessarily be very much but the principle is extremely important. This is blatant discrimination against the non-US banks.' However, one of the three US federal regulatory authorities, the Comptroller of the Currency, does levy charges on domestic banks. The proposed new charges emerged as part of the foreign banking supervision act, which was passed by the US Congress during the Bush administration but is not yet implemented. The relevant provision states that foreign banks shall meet the 'cost of any examination' required under the regulatory framework. The requirement, aimed at strengthening supervision of foreign banks in the US, was prompted by the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. This has provoked much unease within the Federal Reserve, already in a tussle with the Treasury and the Senate banking committee over proposals to reform the US banking regulatory framework. With the Senate pressing for the relevant provision to be implemented, the Federal Reserve has called for public consulation before the new charges are introduced.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / How Kinnock gets it wrong The Tories are on the verge of political bankruptcy, but they have an ace up their sleeves. 'Vote for us,' they are saying, 'because we are not the Labour party'. This proposition lacks nobility. It does not speak of national regeneration, or enhanced prosperity, or a more competitive stance in an ever-tougher world. Yet it worked in 1979, 1983 and 1987, when an overwhelming majority of the electorate rejected Labour. In those years, the kernel of the matter - that the Labour party could not be trusted - was contained within a respectable shell of policy. Mrs Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives did have something definite to say. She may have won three times simply because most voters are anti-socialist, but once in office she could defend her policies against the small print of her election statements. She could tell herself that she was a conviction politician and that the nation favoured those convictions. This time it may be different. I am open to correction when the Tory manifesto appears, but on the basis of what is known today the shell of policy is likely to be so thin as to be transparent. A Citizen's Charter and a bit of rail privatisation will be welcome, but even taken with other bits and bobs, such as reform of inheritance tax, the package that is expected is unlikely to be described as conviction-driven or intellectually coherent. This does not mean that the government's strategy will fail. In modern democracies challengers tend to lose elections if they promise extra spending without extra taxation, or, worse, threaten to raise taxes. As Adlai Stevenson and Michael Dukakis in the US and Hugh Gaitskell in Britain discovered in contests now long forgotten, arousing suspicions about tax can seriously damage your electoral health. This year nobody doubts that Labour is the party of higher personal taxation. The fuzzy area is how far down the income-scale it will reach. The Conservatives can exploit this. They have only to frighten a small number of people in relatively few marginal seats in the south-east to deprive Mr Neil Kinnock of victory and thus terminate his career. That is why Wednesday night's crude election broadcast, with its absurd allegations about Labour's tax proposals, may pay undeserved dividends. These observations on Conservative strategy should not be regarded as an endorsement for Labour. Nuts to that. Mr Kinnock did produce a structured argument during an FT interview with him on Wednesday, but it begins to unravel under close examination. The advice he has been getting from his staff is, in essence, that the old-style socialism thrice rejected in the past decade was a peculiarly British response to the Conservatives' adoption of the US model of the market economy. On this view, the Labour party was right to turn to European social democracy. So far, so good. There is some coherence to the accompanying exposition. As whispered in the Labour leader's ear, Labour's policy reviews can be allied to debate about the differences between the 'Anglo-American' theory that competitive markets are an efficient method of allocating a given quantity of resources and the supposed 'European' view that markets are dynamic forces that stimulate accumulation but that can be destructive as well as constructive. On the latter supposition, Mr Kinnock is advised, a regulatory framework and state intervention become necessary adjuncts of economic strategy. But this interventionism does not mean direct involvement. (The Labour leader spoke of 'enabling'.) His advisers also place an emphasis on stability. The thrust of investment, they say, should be in education and training, research, design, and infrastructure. In most areas of economic policy there should be a move away from discretionary instruments and towards institutional rules. This would apply, for example, to competition policy. A simpler way of putting what is a more complex case than I could properly expound in such a small space is 'the German economy has succeeded while Britain and America have run into trouble, so let's copy the Germans'. This seems to be the unspoken proposition behind many of Mr Kinnock's pronouncements. Put thus, his argument contains serious flaws. First, the closer we get to an election the more the Labour party hedges. It is straightforward about what it has dropped - nationalisation, anti-Europeanism, unilateralism - but increasingly defensive about precisely what it would do if elected. Thus Mr Kinnock spoke at length about Labour's supply-side economics (see advice, above) but avoided spending commitments that would make more than a small portion of it a reality. He spoke eloquently about his framework for taxation, but dodged being pinned down on detail. Second, Labour is trying to pick up what suits it from Germany, leaving the rest alone. Mr Kinnock was at his most wary on constitutional reform, and evasive on proportional representation for the House of Commons. But Germany's constitutional arrangements are a part of its method of managing its affairs. Federation and a propensity to coalition are essential ingredients of the entire polity. Third, it is not the social democrats who have been the principal architects of German success, but the Christian democrats. They do differ from Thatcherite Tories in wholeheartedly accepting a 'social dimension' and a rule-based framework of laws, but they are not models for Labour. This is where the Tories could come in, if they had the wit to do so. They could offer a positive set of policies to the British electorate, based on a coherent 'one-nation' philosophy. The trouble is that they are not yet ready. Mr Christopher Patten, the chairman of the Conservative party, has recognised that a conversion of Britain's Tories to the basic tenets of Christian democracy would benefit the party. For all I know this view might one day become acceptable to Mr John Major. The trouble is that the prime minister has not been in office for long enough to convert his party to a what would be a dramatically different way of thinking. To achieve that he needs to convince himself that such a change is right. Then he needs to win his own mandate.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While Congress has specifically defined the term ``homeless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual'' for the WIC Program, section 17 of the Child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nutrition Act of 1966 does not contain a definition for the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``migrant'' or ``migrancy.'' However, section 17 uses the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``migrant'' (e.g. section 17(f)(1)(c)(iv)) and ``migrant farmworker''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g. section 17(d)(4)(B)). The Department has interpreted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress' references to migrants in section 17 to mean only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant farmworkers and the latter term is currently defined at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 246.2. However, before assuming that its migrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> farmworker definition was sufficient to apply to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional references to the term migrant, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined the definition of migrant(s) as used by other public and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private organizations and agencies concerned with migrants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant services. In each case, some reference was made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural or seasonal nature of migrancy and movement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals for agricultural employment purposes. Based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparative analysis, the Department considered its current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of migrant farmworker adequate to accommodate all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress' references and uses of the term migrancy as set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> WIC Priority System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current WIC nutritional risk priority system was designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that persons at greatest health and nutritional risk are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> served first with available program funds. The priority system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore follows a logical order of progression to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority for service. Applicants with documented nutritionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related medical conditions are served first, followed by those at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional risk due to inadequate dietary patterns. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and as a State agency option, previously certified participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose nutritional status might regress without continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of supplemental foods are certified in Priority VII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, State agencies would be required to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Priority VII pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants, and children who are certified at nutritional risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely because of their homelessness or migrancy. State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may also continue to use Priority VII to identify certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants who might regress in nutritional status without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued provision of supplemental foods. The placement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Priority VII of individuals certified solely due to homelessness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or migrancy should not be viewed as diminished concern for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals. Rather, such a placement reflects the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to serve persons with the greatest medical and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional needs first. Priority VII will only be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classify those individuals who are homeless or migrants and have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no other documented medical or nutritional risk. These are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals who previously would not have otherwise qualified for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WIC Program benefits due to lack of nutritional risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the facts revealed in the aforementioned studies, there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a high likelihood that homeless and migrant individuals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already being served by the WIC Program by virtue of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional risk(s). Proposed Priority VII will serve as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety net for homeless or migrant individuals who are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise eligible due to a lack of documented nutritional or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical risk conditions. However, like any other eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant, a homeless or migrant individual may be placed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher priority if her/his nutritional/health assessment by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competent professional warrants a higher placement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority system. For example, a homeless or migrant individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose nutritional risk assessment reveals the presence of anemia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be placed in a higher priority category than a homeless or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant person with no other documented nutritional risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition who would be placed in Priority VII. This is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keeping with the aforementioned system of prioritizing WIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service based on documented nutritionally or medically related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. Priority VII is the logical placement for homeless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and migrant individuals with no documented nutritional risks who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for the program due solely to homelessness or migrancy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not intend for Priority VII to be used by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States as an administrative shortcut in certifying homeless and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant individuals. The Department expects that homeless and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant applicants will receive all the normal and necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health assessments that are routinely performed to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of a medical or nutritional risk which would determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their proper priority placement, and assist in identifying other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and social services to which such individuals may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that this proposed regulation might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require some States to modify their current reporting systems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate the revised Priority VII. As such, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends to provide an implementation period adequate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate the necessary system modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / German post sell-off passes A plan to sell off Germany's postal service, including the state telecommunications company, was approved by the lower house of the German parliament yesterday. The postal service is Germany's largest state-owned employer. Its three components - mail delivery, a banking system, and the telecommunications monopoly, Telekom - have 670,000 employees. The privatisation plans could still run into trouble. The opposition Social Democrats voted for the sell-off but vowed to block it in the upper house when it comes up for a final vote on July 8 if the government does not give adequate assurances to save jobs and benefits. Under the law, as of January 1 private investors could start buying stock in all three branches of the postal service. The government would hold a majority of shares in mail delivery for at least five years.</p>

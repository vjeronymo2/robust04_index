			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 22 (CTK) -- Doubts about  Slovakia's orientation towards the West, which surfaced during  Vladimir Meciar's premiership, are unsubstantiated, Slovak  Premier Jozef Moravcik told CTK today.    He said Slovakia's place in Europe was illustrated by the  agreements the country had signed, for instance the Association  Agreement with the European Union (EU). He reiterated that  Slovakia was seeking EU membership.    Asked whether Meciar's premiership had led the West to  rather  overlook Slovakia in assessing countries most fit for  integration, Moravcik said: "It's more a question of the style  of politics and the creation of guarantees for the development  of the institutions of parliamentary democracy. It is a  domestic policy question, which in my view will have less and  less importance. I wouldn't overestimate that."    He confirmed that cooperation within the Visegrad Group --  Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary -- remained  attractive for Slovakia. Its importance resided principally in  accelerating admission to the EU. If the Group did not achieve  that it would become senseless, he said. "I, however, am  convinced it still is meaningful," Moravcik said.</p>

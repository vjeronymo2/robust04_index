			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Mideast talks move on slowly Israel and Palestinians yesterday made good but slow progress towards drafting a long-delayed agreement on security issues to implement Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the mediator, for several hours of talks which broke up early today. Mr Peres said progress had been achieved and that both sides hoped to reach a deal at a meeting today, when both he and Mr Arafat are due to leave Cairo. Israeli officials confirmed the two sides were seeking to 'clarify' a draft agreement reached between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat in Switzerland 10 days ago. The talks mainly focused on details of a Palestinian presence at border crossings; Israeli security arrangements at the borders and the operational role of the Israeli army in protecting Jewish settlers remaining in Gaza once Israeli forces have completed a troop redeployment.</p>

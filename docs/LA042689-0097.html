			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: HIS NEXT GLOBAL JOURNEY WILL BE EASIER ON HIS FEET  </P> <P> David Kunst, 49, figures there's only one great adventure left for him, since  he has already walked around the world.  </P> <P> "Now I'd like to sail around the world," said the Costa Mesa apartment manager,  who took 4 years, 3 months and 16 days to complete his 14,500-mile walk, which  started from his home in Waseca, Minn. He doesn't plan to take that long to  complete his voyage.  </P> <P> "To be honest, the voyage may be years away. But if Dave Kunst can walk around  the world, he can do anything," he said. "If you have good health, you can do  anything. And I have good health."  </P> <P> Kunst is listed in the latest edition of the Guiness World Book of Records,  which also printed a picture of him and his Portuguese mule, Willie-Make-It II,  the animal that carried his equipment during much of the trip.  </P> <P> Kunst started the global walk with his younger brother, John Kunst, who was  shot and killed by bandits in Afghanistan. David was also shot, but after  recuperating in the United States, he went back to the scene of the shooting to  continue his walk.  </P> <P> Ever since he finished the walk in 1974, Kunst has been talking about the trip  to anyone who will pay him or listen to him. His biggest audiences are usually  at school assemblies. He charges $190 for a two-part talk.  </P> <P> "I deliver an upbeat, motivational, goal-setting talk to stimulate all those  things in kids," said Kunst, who now wakes up at 3:30 a.m. to deliver  newspapers. "That's how I stay in shape."  </P> <P> Kunst said he could talk for hours about why he took the walk and how he set  goals to do it. "I wanted to do something different," he said. "I wanted to be  adventurous, just like a lot of people."  </P> <P> In virtually every town he passed through, Kunst was interviewed, partly  because of his authorization to use the walk to raise money pledges for UNICEF,  the U.N. emergency fund for children. At one point, a Newsweek correspondent  walked along.  </P> <P> Kunst said his talk has "adventure, tragedy, romance and intrigue." The romance  comes in the story of his marriage to Jenni Samuel, whom he met at a party in  Australia. "She helped me with the walk by driving a car 1,000 miles in low  gear while I walked beside it," he recalled.  </P> <P> Samuel is now a teacher at El Camino Real Elementary School in Irvine.  </P> <P> To reach his new goal, Kunst and another brother, Peter Kunst, 45, of Newport  Beach, bought a sailboat and are taking sailing lessons.  </P> <P> "After we get some sailing experience and raise some money, we're going to take  off," he said. "We even have the route picked out."  </P> <P> When David Kunst delivers his talk to more mature groups, such as senior  citizens or fraternal organizations, he tells them: "I never want to go back to  an 8-to-5 job, and I've never been one to go out and bust my butt for money."  </P> <P> And getting older shouldn't be an obstacle, Kunst said. "I tell senior citizens  we both may have to go slower, but we can do it. When my time is up, I would  rather it happen while I was sailing than when I was sitting in a rocking  chair."  </P> <P> It's a good thing Jennifer Toth, 37, has a degree in psychology, because she  spends her days listening to complaints.  </P> <P> "The first thing I had to understand was that the complaints were not directed  at me," said Toth, who heads the new consumer affairs department for the Irvine  Chamber of Commerce. "I had to get beyond the point where I felt people were  picking on me."  </P> <P> Toth, the mother of two children, said the chamber's pilot program "was meant  for me," noting that she has worked as a store manager and has a consumer  background.  </P> <P> She said her office got 71 complaints the first 2 weeks after it was  established recently on a 16-month trial basis. "But most of them were about  one company. Most businesses are legitimate, but every so often, we get some  fly-by-nighters that move into town and create a problem."  </P> <P> Toth, who lives in Irvine, said other consumer people advised her to "get a  thick skin." Still, there are rewards, she said.  </P> <P> "Every so often someone will call or write a letter and say thank you."  </P> <P> Acknowledgment -- Huntington Beach resident Heather Church has won the R.  Dudley Royce Outstanding Student Award, which is given annually by the  Associated Students at Golden West College to the student who most exemplifies  the qualities of scholarship and leadership. The award is named after the  college's founding president and includes a $1,000 scholarship.  </P></p>

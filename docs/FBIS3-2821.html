Anhui deputation head Meng Fulin introduced Qiao Shi to  other  responsible persons of the deputation as well as worker,  peasant, and intellectual deputies. Qiao Shi cordially shook  their hands, nodding to and smiling at them in greeting.  Cameras never stopped clicking in the well-illuminated  conference room, capturing this memorable moment on film. The  deputies vied with one another to brief Qiao Shi on the various  work achievements in Anhui last year.    Meng Fulin said: Last year saw the Anhui economy growing at  the fastest pace and in the best manner since reform and opening  up to the outside world. Qiao Shi asked with concern: How  large was the share of village and town enterprises? Fu Xishou  answered: They accounted for one third of the province's gross  national product, turning out a total output of 36 billion yuan  in 1991, 58 billion yuan in 1992, and 110 billion yuan in 1993.    Comrade Qiao Shi has all along concerned himself with  Anhui's  development. In 1990 and 1991, he inspected Anhui several times  and gave work directions. Some deputies still have fresh memory  of these. Deputy (Fang Yiben), mayor of Huaibei, said: The  chairman called on the vast number of workers and staff members  at the Huaibei Yanggang Coal Mine in 1991, giving them much  inspiration. At that time the mine was still running at a loss.  However, since coal prices were decontrolled in 1993, it has  returned to the black. On hearing this, Qiao Shi repeatedly  said: "Good!" He added: I talked with model and advanced  workers at the mine. I still remember this.    While Meng Fulin was briefing Qiao Shi on Anhui's strategy  of  "one line, two points" for opening up to the outside world, a  deputy from Wuhu chimed in, saying: Chairman, do you still  remember the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone?  Qiao Shi laughed and said: I won't forget, I won't forget!  His remarks provoked a hearty burst of laughter in the room.    As the clock ticked away the time, Qiao Shi finally stood up  and said goodbye to the deputies. A woman deputy requested the  chairman pose for a group photograph with all women deputies  present. Qiao Shi gladly granted their wish. Soon afterwards  he went to the lobby on the ground floor to pose for a group  photo with all members of the Anhui deputation as well as hotel  workers.</p>

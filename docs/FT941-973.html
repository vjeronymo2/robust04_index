			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Australian challenger wins seat Ms Bronwyn Bishop, the former New South Wales senator who is considered a potential challenger for the opposition Liberal party leadership, won the Mackellar by-election comfortably at the weekend, writes Niki Tait in Sydney. The victory allows her to move from the Senate to the House of Representatives, an essential precondition to mounting any leadership bid. The by-election, in a safe Liberal seat, was not contested by the governing Labor party. Nevertheless, several independents and representatives of minor parties stood against Ms Bishop, and the result was a swing of just over 5 per cent against the Liberal party.</p>

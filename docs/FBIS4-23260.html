			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Congo's President Lissouba seems to have an  unfortunate facility in putting people's back up. Not only has  he had a virtual civil war in Brazzaville with the hostile  opposition but now has apparently upset some of the young men  who fought the opposition militias on the president's side. In  January, President Lissouba made some promises, he hasn't kept  them and yesterday there was gunfire around the president's  residence. From Brazzaville, Antoine Muyumbala telexed this  report:    Members of the Presidential Guard fired shots into the air  yesterday afternoon to disperse a crowd of young supporters of  President Lissouba who were marching toward his official  residence to demand that they be recruited into the regular  Army. To continue their protest, these young men fired guns all  night long into Brazzaville's southern district of Diata. The  districts of Diata Mfilou are controlled by Lissouba supporters  while the zones of Bacongo and Makelekele are in the hands of  the opposition.    There was also some fire in the opposition districts last  night. Brazzaville was calm this morning. For some months now,  young presidential supporters have been asking to be included  into the Army following Pascal Lissouba's promise in January to  recruit members of all private militias into the Army.</p>

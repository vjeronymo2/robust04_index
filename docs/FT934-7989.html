			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt speculates as AMB shares soar  -David Waller questions whether the insurer's popularity is based on facts, or rumour One of the curiosities of the sharply rising German stock market in recent months has been the performance of shares in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second biggest insurance group after Allianz. Over the course of the current year AMB's shares have nearly doubled, rising from about DM750 at the beginning of the year to DM1,430 yesterday, thus significantly outperforming the blue chip DAX index and the more broadly based FAZ, which have both climbed by around a third since January. Although Allianz has also outperformed the market, reflecting investors' liking for insurance companies at a time of declining interest rates, AMB's spectacular rise has more to do with the fact that the Aachen-based insurer has become a 'special situation'. In short, AMB is at the centre of an unresolved takeover battle which has persisted, through a multitude of baroque twists and turns and varying degrees of intensity, since 1991, when Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French state-owned insurance group, bought a stake in the German company. After much mutual hostility, the tensions between the two groups appeared to dissolve at the end of last year. Shareholders in AMB endorsed a 'cease-fire' which gave AGF the right to votes on its entire 25 per cent stake plus representation on the AMB board. In return, AGF delivered Credit Lyonnais as a buyer for a majority stake in BfG Bank, AMB's banking subsidiary which had cost it billions since it bought it years ago as an ill-judged foray into 'allfinanz'. The deal was struck hours before the European single market programme came into force, engendering images of peaceful Franco-Teutonic co-operation in the German insurance market, the largest in Europe. But just as romantic visions of European union have turned sour during the course of 1993, the harmony between the French and the German camps proved illusory. Relations between AGF and AMB have not degenerated into the outright hostility of yesteryear. But following two transactions earlier this year, a question mark hangs over the fate of Germany's second largest insurer. The first took place in early May when Fondiaria, a troubled Italian insurer, sold its 21 per cent shareholding in AMB to a group of German institutions (including Deutsche Bank, which took 10 per cent, and Allianz , which took 5 per cent). Although the purchase was presented disingenuously as a friendly move on the part of the German financial establishment, designed as an amicable counterbalance to AGF's position in the AMB boardroom, one does not have to be too Machiavellian to see the purchase as an attempt to block the French. 'This was a deliberate attempt to keep a second French competitor out of the German market,' commented the chief executive of another German insurer. The single French-controlled company in the German insurance market is Colonia. The second transaction followed in July when AGF announced that it had lifted its stake in AMB to 33.5 per cent via purchases in the market. AGF's public comments at the time were far from bellicose - but the move was seen by investors as a move to tighten control over its German target. In the absence of any rules governing takeovers and disclosure requirements in Germany, it is impossible to know with certainty what has happened since July, when AGF is thought to have paid DM1,000 a share for its extra holding. Has AGF increased its stake still further? Or have other investors been spreading such rumours in order to boost the price of their own holdings? Analysts note that in the highly illiquid market for AMB shares, small share purchases trigger sharp price rises, making it easy for the unscrupulous to manipulate prices. None of the main parties were willing to comment yesterday. One thing is certain: the shares are overvalued on fundamental grounds, trading on around 100 times 1993 earnings with no spectacular earnings growth in sight, and at a substantial premium to net assets, based on outside estimates, of DM1,100 a share.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Solicitors' appeal against SIB action fails A RENEWED attempt to stop the Securities and Investments Board suing London solicitors alleged to have been involved in unlawful share-pushing in the UK by an offshore company has failed. The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld the High Court's refusal to strike out SIB's action seeking restitution from Shoosmith &amp; Morrison and two members of the firm. SIB alleges the solicitors were 'knowingly concerned' in the share-pushing operations of Pantell, a Swiss company that carried on un-authorised investment business in the UK in 1988-89 in breach of the Financial Services Act. As a result of Pantell's operations, UK investors bought 1.4m valueless shares in European American Corporation, Euramco, for more than Dollars 2m. Individual investors have no right to sue third parties 'knowingly concerned' in contraventions of the act. The solicitors deny the allegation. Lord Justice Steyn said the investor protection provisions in the act had been prompted by the widespread belief that the operations of share-pushers damaged the market's integrity and were contrary to the public interest. He said share-pushers were often beyond the reach of English law, but it was clear that their operations were often made possible only because of the assistance of third parties, such as bankers, accountants and solicitors. Lord Justice Scott said Pantell's misleading advertisements, and its salesmen making unsolicited phone calls, had tried to persuade people to buy shares in Euramco, a company incorporated in Utah in the US. SIB alleged that the solicitors had acted for Pantell and for Swiss Atlantic Holdings, which authorised Pantell to sell Euramco shares in the UK on a commission basis. Lord Justice Scott said the act provided for restitution orders designed to restore the parties to the transactions to their former positions. Restitution, the repayment of an investor's money in return for the shares being returned to the vendor, could be ordered against the share-pusher and 'any other person . . . knowingly concerned' in breach of the act. Lord Justice Scott dismissed the objection to SIB's claim that the solicitors had not received any of the money paid by investors that it was proposed they should be ordered to repay.</p>

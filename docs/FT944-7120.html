			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Maastricht speech adds to EU row Mr Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for external political affairs, has risked inflaming divisions in the ruling Conservative party in Britain with a call for weakening national veto powers in the European Union. Mr van den Broek, who will assume wider authority in external relations in the incoming Commission of Mr Jacques Santer of Luxembourg - successor to Mr Jacques Delors, who leaves the presidency of the European Commission in January - said it was time to consider new constitutional arrangements to allow a vanguard of integrationist-minded states to move ahead in a multi-speed Europe. He suggested that changes in the Maastricht, Rome or other EU treaties should enter into force when four-fifths of the EU's population and member states have ratified - a challenge to the 36-year-old principle that treaty changes must be unanimous. Mr van den Broek's speech, in the Hague on Thursday night, came at the end of a turbulent week in British politics, with the UK government threatening to call an election if it loses a parliamentary vote next Monday on raising UK contributions to the EU budget. His thoughts reflect broad but by no means overwhelming sentiment among governments in Germany, the Benelux countries, and, to a degree, France, in favour of a multi-speed Europe built around an inner core of committed integrationists. Aides said the speech would serve as a marker ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty, but British officials noted that the Dutch commissioner had touched 'the most neuralgic point' of the Rome treaty. Others warned that forcing the pace of integration by diluting national veto powers could 'break the Union'. According to a text distributed in Brussels yesterday, Mr van den Broek said: 'I believe that the majority view in the Union is that all members should move ahead together wherever possible - but if a smaller group wish to push ahead towards closer integration then they should be allowed to do so.' In a side-swipe at Britain and Denmark, who won opt-outs in the 1991 Maastricht treaty on monetary union, Mr van den Broek said: 'A few years ago some member states were competing for opt-outs. Now, the competition should be for opt-ins.' Last month, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, called for an extension of majority voting, declaring that the need for unanimity and the exercise of national vetoes could lead only to blocking effective action. Mr Dehaene proposed that the Commission should decide which countries met the conditions for a multi-speed approach, with a final decision made by a qualified majority of member states. Despite these interventions, senior British officials remain confident that the 1996 conference will not lead to wholesale revisions in the Maastricht treaty and a substantial weakening of veto powers. In the UK government's view, France remains the swing country in 1996. Official predictions assume that a sovereignty-conscious French government will resist German pressure to form a genuine European political union with the Commission as the new executive government of Europe. However, there is some concern about the possibility that Mr Delors may enter and win next year's presidential race in France. The prospect of Mr Delors joining Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in a reinvigorated Franco-German axis is not viewed with relish in London.</p>

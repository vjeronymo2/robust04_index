			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / West German jobless total grows THE combined effects of harsh winter weather and recession pushed 150,000 west Germans out of work last month, raising the jobless total to more than 2m. Numbers on short time surged by 180,000, the federal labour office said yesterday. Mr Heinrich Franke, labour office president, who recently forecast average unemployment this year of 2.1m, blamed the weather for the sharp increase. The seasonally-adjusted total for December was 1.97m, up just 20,000, he said. However, the critical underlying trend in the labour market was highlighted by the jump in short-time working and figures from the federal statistics office which showed that numbers employed in the west fell during November for the first time since the mid-1980s. German industry's capacity to create jobs faded markedly during the year as economic decline accelerated and companies unveiled medium-term plans to slash tens of thousands of jobs. Some 650,000 people were effectively laid off during the month compared with 478,000 in November and 173,000 in December, 1991. The figure was swollen by leading vehicle makers which sent workers home before Christmas for extended breaks. According to the labour office, the average unemployment rate in west Germany last year was 6.4 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent in 1991. In the former East Germany the number unemployed in December was 1.1m, barely changed on the month, although a little below the year's average of 1.17m. Mr Franke pointed out that a further 355,000 easterners were still occupied in state-funded work-creation schemes during the month. The labour market was 'stagnant,' he said, and there was still no sign of any improvement.</p>

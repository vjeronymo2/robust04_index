			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Car stocks feature in quiet trading CAR-RELATED stocks feat-ured in quiet Continental trading, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw some activity in Volkswagen but otherwise trading was dull as traders extended their Easter holidays. The DAX index gained 6.80 to 1,753.30 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 2.4 to 713.88. Turnover increased to DM5.5bn from DM3.8bn. Volkswagen advanced DM8.10 to DM381.80 on strong US interest following a positive report by Morgan Stanley, which was published just before Easter. Other car shares were mixed, with BMW putting on DM2 to DM586 while Porsche eased DM1 to DM548. Banks remained firm. Deutsche Bank appreciated DM5.60 to DM722.90, while Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank moved up DM1 apiece to DM267.80 and DM358 respectively. James Capel recommended switching out of Dresdner into the other two banks, because it did not expect Dresdner's earnings performance for this year to be above-average. PARIS was quietly firmer ahead of the close of the April trading account today. The CAC-40 index closed 3.32 higher at 1,983.68, down from the day's peak of 1,993.77, in modest turnover of FFr2.4bn. The auto sector was active, with Peugeot gaining FFr19 to FFr730, while Michelin rose FFr4.70 to FFr193.70 in heavy volume of 1.2m shares. Both issued 1991 results last week. Pechiney CIPs jumped FFr11.90 or 3.3 per cent to FFr377.90 while Pechiney International rose FFr1.80 to FFr205.20 ahead of its 1991 results due this morning. The company is also expected to give details of its restructuring, whereby the aluminium and trade activities will be transfered to the parent. MILAN got some support from Fiat and Pirelli but official trading was over by 12.30 pm due to a lack of interest. Dealers were depressed by the fall in daily volume on Tuesday to its lowest level since April 1985, which they blamed on the delay in forming a new government. The Comit index added 0.81 at 507.14 in turnover estimated at L40bn, after Tuesday's L36.7bn. Fiat eased L16 to L4,800 at the official fixing but rose to L4,875 after Mr Paolo Canterella, Fiat Auto's managing director, said the subsidiary would make a profit this year and that the model range would be completely renewed by 1996. Pirelli attracted interest from London, rising L21 to L1,296 at the fixing and reaching L1,318 after hours. STOCKHOLM closed broadly lower in heavy trade. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 2.6 to 980.0 as turnover rose to SKr491m from SKr239m. The decline was led by Astra, whose B free share tumbled SKr13 or 2.4 per cent to SKr527. Some analysts attributed the fall to a general switching out of pharmaceutical into cyclical stocks, as well as the company's recent decision not to open up more of Astra's share capital to foreigners. BRUSSELS rose on the last day of the forward market account. The Bel-20 index advanced 3.76 to 1,199.19 in high turnover of BFr1.10bn. Petrofina and Electrabel were the most heavily traded stocks, with the former rising BFr50 to BFr10,700 and the latter dipping BFr10 to BFr4,905. ZURICH was firmer, the SMI index gaining 14.2 to 1,874.7. The chemical sector improved after Ciba-Geigy forecast strong growth in 1992. Its registered shares put on SFr30 to SFr3,520 and its bearers were SFr20 stronger at SFr3,480. Roche certificates were up SFr20 at SFr3,170. AMSTERDAM rose in moderate volume. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.7 at 126.9 in turnover of Fl 572.4m. Nedlloyd was the main feature after reporting a return to profit in 1991, although some analysts noted that the results were boosted by sales of non-core divisions. The stock closed 60 cents down at Fl 54.60. Pakhoed and Daf both improved Fl 1 to Fl 42.90 and Fl 24.70 respectively. MADRID's general index receded 1.43 to 251.41. Telefonica lost Pta35 to Pta1,090 after delaying a planned increase in domestic tariffs. OSLO slipped, although the shipping index remained firm. The all-share index fell 2.49 to 421.03 in NKr273.59m turnover.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1173.10  1173.07  1172.43  1172.47  1172.07  1172.18  1171.03  1171.34  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1173.29          Day's Low  1170.84  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Apr 21       Apr 16       Apr 15       Apr 14        Apr 13        1166.73      1169.83      1167.06      1157.52       1153.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

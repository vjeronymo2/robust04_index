			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Leading Article: All hands to the dollar Markets are bearish on the dollar. Equally, US policy-makers are unwilling to see the dollar fall further. Both pieces of information are subject to alteration at any moment. But at least the dollar weakness offers a good opportunity to push policy faster in the direction it is - and should be - moving: towards tighter monetary policy in the US and looser policies in Germany and Japan. It is not impossible to explain why the dollar has been so weak. The problem is, as usual, that there are far too many explanations. This is so even though some explanations can be eliminated quite quickly. Investors are not moving into the yen because of the strength of the Japanese government or, for that matter, the vigour of its recovery. The same is true, if to a lesser degree, for Germany. Short term interest rate differentials are also not moving in favour of the yen and D-Mark. On the contrary, interest rate differentials on three month money have moved consistently in favour of dollar-denominated securities: by four percentage points vis-a-vis the yen, since the cyclical trough reached in April 1991, and by six percentage points vis-a-vis the D-Mark since September 1992. These shifts in relative interest rates have been widely expected. It is hardly surprising therefore that conventional wisdom expected the dollar to be strong. Conventional wisdom has been disappointed. Current accounts Three explanations for dollar weakness remain: first, that the current account surplus of Japan and deficit of the US are a permanent, if intermittent, source of upward pressure on the yen; second, that the dawn of recovery, however faint, in Japan and continental Europe heralds relatively high returns on real assets; and, finally, that expectations of inflation, even though they have deteriorated everywhere, have deteriorated rather more in the US than in the other major countries. What is important to note is that the US currency has fallen by 11 per cent against the yen since the beginning of the year, but also by more than 7 per cent against the D-Mark just since February. Dollar weakness is a general, rather than just a bilateral, phenomenon. At the same time, while bond rates have risen everywhere, they have risen more in US dollars than in yen or D-Marks. Since last autumn, the differential against 10-year D-Mark bonds has moved from almost minus one percentage point to plus half a percentage point and against the yen it has moved, over the same period, from one percentage point to more than three percentage points. These shifts imply not only a marked relative worsening in expectations of US inflation, but also a parallel shift in views about the long term performance of the US dollar. The currency must be expected to move to offset changes in relative long term interest rates. Some of that shift has occurred right now. US policy It would be foolish for US policy makers to ignore the pessimism. Fortunately Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, in justifying recent intervention, announced that the administration 'sees no advantage in an undervalued currency'. Unfortunately, the administration does not seem to recognise that the very same logic applies to the internal purchasing power of the dollar. What it needs to do is to support the action of the Federal Reserve in raising short term interest rates and so help preserve the credibility of US counter-inflationary policy. Indeed, failing such action, it may be impossible to stabilise the exchange rate. Yet the unexpected weakness of the dollar has its good side. It has encouraged senior Bundesbank officials, including the president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, to admit that D-Mark strength is unwelcome. With luck, that will bring forward further needed declines in German short term interest rates. Equally, without a government, the sole policy-maker able to act in Japan is its central bank. Here too aggressive monetary loosening, via exchange market intervention, is justified. It would be helpful if short term interest rates were lowered too. US dollar weakness may be a surprise. It may be unwelcome to most policy makers. But at least it should force the US, Germany and Japan to accelerate the changes they need to make in their monetary policies.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / End in sight for Angolan civil war: Rebel leader outlines agreement on ceasefire followed by elections AN END is in sight to the 15-year civil war in Angola, which has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and has devastated a country rich in oil, diamonds and coffee. Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita rebel movement, said in London yesterday that agreements leading to an internationally monitored ceasefire and multi-party elections were due to be initialled in Lisbon today. A formal signing ceremony will take place at the end of May, probably in Lisbon, where officials from Unita and the Angolan government are meeting. Western diplomats last night confirmed that an end was in sight to a conflict which, from the start, was fuelled by superpower rivalries. The factors that combined to push both parties to the negotiating table include war-weariness, the rapprochement between Washington and Moscow, and the Namibian settlement, which ended South African military support for Unita, and saw the withdrawal of a 50,000 strong pro-government Cuban force from Angola. Diplomats stressed that implementation of the agreements, which include the integration of rival armies during an 18-month transition period before elections, would be fraught with difficulties. The apparent breakthrough follows protracted talks co-ordinated by Portugal, the former colonial power, and attended by officials from the US, the main supporter of Unita, and the Soviet Union, once a staunch ally of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola's ruling MPLA party. The Unita leader, speaking on the eve of a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said he expected Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, UN secretary general, Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, Soviet foreign minister, would attend the formal signing. In giving his outline of the agreements to journalists in London, Mr Savimbi said the US, the Soviet Union and the UN would be helping to monitor the transition process. During the transition, which would end with elections in September, October or November next year, the MPLA government 'will continue to deal with normal affairs', he said. But a 'joint political and military committee', comprising equal numbers of MPLA and Unita officials, would 'deal with the whole process leading to the ceasefire, elections, stability, and internal security,' said Mr Savimbi, adding that he expected to arrive in Luanda, the capital, in early July. Up to now he has been based in Jamba, the rebel headquarters in southern Angola. He said the commission would also during the transition oversee the creation 'of one national army', preferably no larger than 50,000, in which Unita and MPLA would be equally represented. The air force and navy would remain in MPLA hands, under close independent monitoring. Responsibility for day-to-day law and order would lie with the existing police force. 'We will also have a joint committee for verification of ceasefire,' said Mr Savimbi. A post-war Angola would have an independent judiciary, a free press, regular elections and a 'market orientated economy', he said. Angola struggles for a fresh start Page 5</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Support for Maastricht melts away in French sun: The prospects for next month's referendum, where a No vote could kill European union THE cover of Paris-Match, usually emblazoned with headlines about ageing actors and their latest romances or the melodramas of the Monegasque princesses, this week carries the more sober message 'Maastricht: le non grignote' - 'Maastricht: the no vote gnaws away'. For weeks French support for the Maastricht treaty on European union has been falling steadily. This week's Paris-Match magazine confirms just how far it has gone by publishing a poll, compiled by the BVA consultancy, which shows that the proportion of the electorate planning to vote Yes in next month's Maastricht referendum has fallen from 63 to 56 per cent in a month. If France does vote No to Maastricht in the referendum on September 20, the treaty will be dead. This would be an ironic end for the treaty because the French have historically been strong supporters of European unity, and because President Francois Mitterrand has styled himself, at home and abroad, as the treaty's champion. The president, bruised by a slide in popularity this year, has so far adopted a conspicuously low profile in the referendum campaign. But the depth of his past involvement, and that of the ruling Socialist party, means a No vote would at the very least also be a serious blow to the party's prospects in next spring's National Assembly elections. What is the risk of the French voting against Maastricht? Until recently such a prospect would have seemed inconceivable. The pro-Europe faction in the French electorate has rarely fallen below 60 per cent since the 1950s. In a 1989 poll European unity emerged as the top priority of the French, ahead of disarmament and helping the third world. There has since been a slow but steady decline in support for Europe. But it is only in the past four weeks, since Mr Mitterrand announced the date of the referendum and the political campaigning began in earnest, that opposition to Maastricht has accelerated, particularly among older voters. The Paris-Match poll simply reinforced the message from other recent polls. A similar study conducted by the IFOP consultancy published in Liberation on Tuesday showed that the No vote had risen from 38 per cent in early June to 44 per cent by the end of July. Most of the French say they have already decided which way to vote. However, 29 per cent of the Yes voters and 34 per cent of the No voters in the BVA poll said they might change their minds. This means that, in theory, the Yes vote could fall as low as 40 per cent, or rise as high as 71 per cent. In practice, the switch in sentiment in the remaining 6 1/2 weeks before the referendum is unlikely to be nearly so dramatic. Although the trend is clearly towards rejection, it seems more probable that the French will say Yes. Privately, however, even the Socialists accept that they could do so by an embarrassingly slender majority. The situation is complicated by the referendum's timing, just after the long French summer holidays. August is scarcely the time for political discussion in France, which helps to explain the absence of any serious intellectual debate over Europe's future in the approach to the referendum. So far the referendum campaign has been notable only for its scrappiness. The government was last week forced to abandon its proposed television campaign after objections by the broadcasting authority. The centre right parties, the RPR and the UDF, are hopelessly split over Maastricht. Their campaign has consisted of a motley assortment of personal statements by their more outspoken members. The only concerted campaign against the treaty has come from Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme-right National Front, which has this week been hauling an anti-Maastricht caravan from beach to beach on the south coast, although some hard-left Socialists, and the Communists, have also come out against Maastricht. The critical question is how far the growth of the No vote should be interpreted less as a sea-change in sentiment towards European union than as direct criticism of the Socialists, who have come under criticism for rising unemployment and a series of scandals. These range from next month's corruption trial for Mr Henri Emanuelli, president of the National Assembly, to the involvement of senior Socialists, including Mr Laurent Fabius, party chairman, in the HIV-contaminated blood case, which resumes in October. So far no one knows the answer. Asked why they oppose Maastricht, people tend to cite the threat to France's identity or the risk of damaging the economy. Meanwhile, Mr Mitterrand and his fellow Socialists are bracing themselves for the effect of the next set of unemployment figures on the Maastricht polls, as France snoozes through the summer holiday.</p>

General Viljoen was speaking at a Volksfront meeting in  Lydenburg in the eastern Transvaal. He said this capability,  with the political power of the Afrikaner, had led to the  Afrikaner becoming a factor that could not be ignored by even  the president of the ANC [African National Congress], Mr. Nelson  Mandela. According to General Viljoen the Afrikaner was  enjoying increasing foreign support, which was putting pressure  on the government and the ANC to accommodate the Afrikaner in a  future constitutional dispensation. General Viljoen also said  that certain intelligence services were attempting to cause  division in right-wing Afrikaner ranks. He said right-wing  organizations were vulnerable to infiltration and that it was a  technique of intelligence services to infiltrate and sow  division. After the gathering he told our political news staff  that it was possible that the government's intelligence service  was involved.    General Viljoen would not give examples of the alleged  infiltration but said that certain things were happening which  had caused him to draw this conclusion.</p>

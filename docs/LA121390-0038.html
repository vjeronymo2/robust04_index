			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOUNDED SALVATION ARMY WORKER DIES  </P> <P> A 61-year-old Salvation Army supervisor who was accidentally shot in the head  with a gun left in a bag of donations has died, and El Cajon police said they  will go through receipts given out by workers in an effort to determine who  might have dropped off the pistol.  </P> <P> James Irwin Brower, 61, of Alpine died Tuesday evening at UC San Diego Medical  Center, several hours after being shot by co-worker Connie (C. W.) Wayne  Overby, 51.  </P> <P> Overby was looking at the gun at a Salvation Army collection center after  picking it up off the ground, where it had fallen from donated goods. He  accidentally discharged it, firing one round and hitting Brower in the head,  police said.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Bob Lein said the results of his department's investigation will be  turned over to the San Diego County district attorney's office, which will  determine whether any charges, such as negligence, will be filed against  Overby. The Police Department is "not actively pursuing criminal charges," he  said.  </P> <P> Investigators believe the pistol, a .22-caliber Derringer that holds two  rounds, was either dropped by someone or fell out of a bag of donated items at  the center operated by Brower and Overby. The two men received clothes,  appliances and furniture at the back of a trailer in the parking lot of  Kaelin's Market on Main Street.  </P> <P> "The gun was not turned in as a separate item," Lein said. "The person (who  left the gun) did not tell them or did not know to tell them that the gun was  among the property being dropped off."  </P> <P> Police will also seek to find the owner of the gun through its registration.  </P> <P> Russ Russell, director of community relations with the Salvation Army in San  Diego County, said organization officials are reviewing their policy involving  donations. He said the group does not accept firearms and that, had the men  known the gun was being donated, they would not have accepted it.  </P> <P> The incident is a first for the group, Russell said. He said it is being  reviewed in an attempt to assure that nothing like it happens again.  </P> <P> All employees and volunteers are being asked to be careful when receiving  anything in a bag or box, he said.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine it happening again, and I pray to God it doesn't happen  again," Russell said. "It is just something you don't expect to happen, but  again, we are going to take every precaution and inform our employees and  volunteers to be very careful."  </P> <P> Brower had worked for the Salvation Army for several years.  </P></p>

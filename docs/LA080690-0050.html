			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITERS GUILD URGES CHANGE IN MPAA RATING SYSTEM  </P> <P> While acknowledging that the current movie ratings system has "served the  public interest and the (film industry) for years," the Writers Guild of  America on Friday added its voice to the chorus of critics calling for changes.  </P> <P> "Our feeling is that there is something wrong (with the ratings system)," said  WGA West President George Kirgo, adding his personal view that the ratings have  not "kept up with the times."  </P> <P> Kirgo said he is not sure the answer is an A rating, a new category designating  non-pornographic adults-only films, which has been suggested by some film  critics, independent distributors and several high-profile directors. But he  said there are sufficient inequities in the system to warrant "serious  dialogue" on the subject.  </P> <P> Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, has agreed to  meet with representatives from both the Directors Guild of America and the  Writers Guild this week, with the meetings expected to take place Wednesday or  Thursday in Los Angeles. The discussions may also be attended by several of the  directors who signed a recent petition requesting a modification of the  ratings.  </P> <P> The petition was circulated by Silverlight Entertainment, a small New  York-based independent distributor that is about to release Wayne Wang's "Life  Is Cheap . . . but Toilet Paper Is Expensive." The film received an X from the  MPAA's ratings board, and such well-known directors as Francis Coppola, Sydney  Pollack, Blake Edwards and David Lynch signed the petition asking the MPAA to  create a category for non-pornographic films intended for adult audiences.  </P> <P> The X rating has become almost exclusively identified with hard-core sex films.  The result is that makers of legitimate mature-themed movies tagged with the  rating are unable to book their films with many theater chains or advertise  them in many media outlets.  </P> <P> Silverlight intends to release "Life Is Cheap . . . " with a self-administered  A rating. In advertising copy that has been submitted to newspapers, a  disclaimer explains there is no MPAA rating because "many leading filmmakers  believe the MPAA's current rating system promotes censorship and does not serve  the best interests of the viewing public."  </P></p>

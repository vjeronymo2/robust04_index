			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Both values must be explained Sir, The initiative of Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, in establishing a review of valuation procedures is laudable (Letters, November 10). The Queens Moat valuation controversy is, however, current and should not await the outcome of Michael Mallinson's review. I would urge Clive Lewis to ensure that the assets valuation standards committee fully reviews both Queens Moat valuations and that its report carries a clear explanation of the differences and is made public. If this does not occur then the surveying profession will lose credibility in the business environment where it is striving to obtain better recognition. M F Creamer, Hillier Parker May &amp; Rowden, 77 Grosvenor Street, London W1A 2BT</p>

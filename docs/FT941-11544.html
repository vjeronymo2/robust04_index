			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: German farm incomes down 6% in 1992-93 German farmers called for urgent support after a Bonn ministry report detailed income losses in the former West Germany of more than 6 per cent in 1992-93, reports Reuter from Hamburg. The ministry said a further decline in 1993-94 could reach between 10 and 15 per cent. A statement from the DBV farmers' union said its members were not participating in the country's general pay advances. Their average incomes were lagging those in comparable sectors by 35 per cent, and much of their earnings would have to be reinvested to secure the survival of farms. The union called for the reversal of farm budget cuts in Bonn and the federal states and for a nationwide compensation scheme for currency losses totalling Dm520m (Pounds 20m). The union demanded that existing trade opportunities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be fully explored and trade distortions disadvantaging German farmers eliminated. DBV representatives are to meet Mr Jochen Borchert, the farm minister, on February 8.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese electronics groups forced to slice profit forecasts RICOH, the office equipment and camera company, and Omron, the electronic control equipment maker, have sharply lowered profits forecasts for the fiscal year ending next month. The two companies are joining a growing list of Japanese electronics-makers facing a sudden decline in demand for electronic goods at home and abroad. Although most companies are reporting higher sales than a year ago, margins are collapsing rapidly as sales on a scale originally planned for have failed to materialise. As a result, electronics companies are having to slash prices to move inventories, while making efforts to cut factory output. Ricoh, a leading maker of small copiers and facsimile machines, said it expected consolidated pre-tax profits to plunge 90 per cent to Y3.7bn (Dollars 28.8m). Four months ago, it said profits would reach Y27bn. Ricoh expects to slip into the red by Y1.6bn after paying taxes. Sales are still expected to rise compared to last year, by 1.6 per cent to Y1,020bn. Omron said its consolidated pre-tax profits would decline by 54.1 per cent to Y20bn, while net profits would be off 62.7 per cent to Y8bn. Sales would rise by 3.4 per cent to Y480bn. Omron blamed the decline in profits on a decrease in investment in plant and equipment, as well as a drop in demand for durable consumer goods. Other leading Japanese companies also lowered their forecast profits yesterday: Nippondenso, Japan's biggest producer of automotive electrical goods and a leading supplier to Toyota Motor, reported a 24.6 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y83.05bn in 1991. The decline mirrors the weak results of automotive companies, which have been reporting slow car sales at home and abroad. Nippondenso's sales fell by 2.4 per cent during the year, to Y1,345.8bn. Sales of air-conditioning equipment were off by 3.9 per cent to Y472.2bn, while radiator sales rose by 5.4 per cent to Y88bn. The company forecast that sales would rise to Y1,400bn in the current year, but that net profits would recover only marginally to Y46.5bn. After-tax profits declined by 11.2 per cent to Y45.5bn. The full-year dividend was unchanged at Y14 a share. Victor Company of Japan (JVC), the audio equipment maker, expects group pre-tax losses of Y4.4bn and parent pre-tax losses of Y2.8bn for the year to March, Reuter reports. As recently as last October the company forecast group pre-tax profits of Y27.5bn and parent pre-tax profits of Y17bn. JVC blamed the lower projections on poor sales of audio-visual equipment and a rise in sales costs as well as a stronger yen. Kyocera, the big electronic components maker, lowered its forecast of parent pre-tax profits to Y40.70bn for the year to March, down 27 per cent from the Y56.09bn earned a year ago, Reuter reports. This compares with a November forecast of Y44.10bn. The downward revision is based on poor domestic sales of its products, including semiconductor components, and a foreign exchange loss. Komatsu, a leading maker of construction machinery, forecast group pre-tax profit for the year to March of Y40bn, down 37 per cent from its estimate of Y64bn made in November, AP-DJ reports. It forecast group net profits at Y11bn, down 52 per cent on its earlier forecast, and consolidated sales of Y930bn, down 5.1 per cent on its initial estimate. Komatsu blamed poor market conditions, notably in the US, with a rapid fall-off in worldwide demand for construction machinery. It said it would be hit by carmakers' moves to hold off investment in plant and equipment.</p>

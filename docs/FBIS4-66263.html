			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Quan Pengfei (2938 7720 7378): "Children at the </F> Junction"]    [Text] In some areas in southern Xinjiang, runaway school  children has long been a problem without a solution. I went to  Pishan County's Keketiereke Township and saw the silhouette of a  small child herding sheep on the Gobi sands and witnessed other  children selling food and drinks in the restaurants. I became  very depressed.    On a fiercely hot day last September, the township party  committee vice secretary Yang Yaorong [2799 5069 2837] and two  of the village cadres spent almost a day "grabbing" 12 students  and taking them back to the schools; they were all hot and  sweaty. When they got to the section of the village road where  corn grew tall and dense on both sides, suddenly there was a  whistle, and the naughty children scattered. The quick and agile  ones disappeared among the bushes; only three scared little  girls did not run off. They just sat there and cried. They would  rather die than go back to school.    Since 1981, the township's 19 schools have yet to complete  their enrollment plans. The middle school enrollment rate is  below 50 percent. Where are the children who should be attending  school?    In the bazha [1572 2089], one often hears the young voices  of  children in the restaurants and shops selling goods and calling  out. They look only 12-13 years old. On the road to town, those  driving the mule carts selling kindling and livestock are almost  all children.    Why aren't these children attending school? What are their  parents thinking?    Most peasants believe that so long as their children can  read  a few words and do some simple arithmetic, it is good enough. As  for going to school to become workers and cadres, they don't  even dare to dream. As a result, young people who should be  keeping company with books and knowledge are keeping company  with sheep and mules. At one time, poverty brought nothing but  misery and sorrow to the people around here. People long to be  rich. Their desire to make money keep them very busy, so busy  that they drag their little boys and little girls, who have no  interest in learning anyway, down with them.    It is difficult to recruit students and even more difficult  to reinforce them and keep them there. The township recruited a  class of 30 first-year middle school students last year; 11 did  not show up after registration, and 12 dropped out later for  various reasons. The township tried a new measure to counter the  recruitment problem a couple years ago: Each household had to  guarantee sending one student to school; they were rewarded with  one year of free service plus 30 yuan; those who did not comply  would be fined one year's free service plus 30 yuan. When that  measure was first implemented, it helped, but it did not take  long for the peasants to figure things out: One child could  raise five sheep in a year, and if they fined me one sheep, I  would still have four, not to mention their dung for fertilizer;  I would still come out ahead work even with the fine. Later, as  the voice of "easing the peasants' burdens" grew louder and  louder, the village had no choice but to abolish its "local  policy," and enrollment dropped again.    The ultimate goal of education is to improve the nation's  overall quality so that people can escape ignorance and poverty  and embark on the road to civilization and wealth. But to an  ordinary peasant who is so sick and tired of being poor and who  does not even have the most basic guarantees of survival, what  good is education? In my opinion, to keep education from  slipping away in these backward regions, besides continuing to  strengthen guidance and increase input, perhaps we should change  the area's existing mold of "pure education" to "quality  education" that is more compatible with the realistic local  conditions, so that the students can directly serve the village  economy and social development as soon as they leave school.</p>

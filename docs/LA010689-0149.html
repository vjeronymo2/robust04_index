			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRICE CUTTING, COST CONTROL MEASURES BLAMED;  </P> <P> AST FORECASTS LOSS OF $7 MILLION TO $9 MILLION FOR SECOND QUARTER  </P> <P> AST Research Inc., an Irvine technology firm that has expanded rapidly in the  personal computer market, said Thursday that it expects to report a loss of $7  million to $9 million for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31.  </P> <P> The company attributed the anticipated red ink to aggressive price cutting by  AST's competitors as well as internal cost-cutting measures and an accounting  charge related to the anticipated sale of one of its businesses.  </P> <P> AST also said it expects to report sales of $110 million for the quarter. The  quarterly results will be released in about 3 weeks.  </P> <P> For the year-earlier quarter, AST reported earnings of $2 million on sales of  $92.6 million.  </P> <P> The expected loss reflects heated competition within the personal computer  market. AST entered that market in 1987 with the introduction of a line of  IBM-compatible machines, and its rapid sales gains surprised many industry  observers.  </P> <P> Analysts had been forecasting a weak second quarter for the firm, but the  magnitude of AST's expected losses caught some by surprise.  </P> <P> Lawrence Harris, a securities analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in  Los Angeles, said he had been projecting a loss of about $1 million for the  quarter.  </P> <P> Harris said that AST has been under pressure to cut prices on its Premium/286  line of personal computers in the wake of earlier price cuts by competitors  such as Wyse Technology. In December, the San Jose company slashed prices by  10% to 15% on many competing products, Harris said.  </P> <P> In addition, sales of AST's Premium/286 computers have been hurt by the  introduction in September of a competing IBM product.  </P> <P> But the bulk of the losses would come from the accounting charge that AST would  incur if it decides to sell off its Camintonn division, which makes products  for systems compatible with Digital Equipment Corp. computers.  </P> <P> AST said the sale of Camintonn and other cost-cutting steps would probably  result in a charge to earnings of as much as $6 million.  </P> <P> Revenue generated by the Camintonn unit accounted for about 2.5% of AST's $413  million in sales last year, said Bruce Edwards, AST chief financial officer.  </P> <P> Edwards said AST is considering selling the unit because "it no longer fits  with our core business of IBM compatible systems."  </P> <P> AST's earnings projection was made after the close of stock market trading  Thursday. The company's stock closed at $8.50 per share, down 37.5 cents.  </P></p>

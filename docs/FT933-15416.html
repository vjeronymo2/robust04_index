			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Owners Abroad warns of steep profits fall OWNERS ABROAD, the holiday company which narrowly escaped being taken over by rival Airtours less than four months ago, yesterday caused concern in the City with the forecast that profits this year would be half market expectations. Mr Howard Klein is to resign as chairman and Mr Roger Allard will step down as director in charge of tour operations. The profit warning cut a third off the company's market value. Shares fell 32 1/2 p to 66p, less than half the 149p price at which Airtours was buying shares at the end of the fiercely contested Pounds 294m bid. Mr Klein said the profits collapse had two immediate causes. One was severe pressure on margins. The other was that Lunn Poly, the travel agency chain which is one of Owners Abroad's largest outlets, had sharply increased its sales of holidays provided by Thomson, the UK's largest tour operator and Lunn Poly's owner. The Office of Fair Trading last month began an investigation into whether ties between travel agents and tour operators limit the choice of holidays to consumers. Shareholders and corporate financiers said they could not remember when a successful defence against a hostile bid had been followed so suddenly by such a profit warning. The turnround is likely to lead to an inquiry by the Takeover Panel and raises questions about representations made by advisers at the time of the bid. Samuel Montagu, adviser to Owners Abroad, said its client had not issued a profits forecast as part of its defence. 'The trading results continued to be in line with budget up to the end of April and substantiated the extensive due diligence we did in the bid defence,' the merchant bank said. While some of the UK institutions that supported Owners Abroad were embarrassed yesterday by the collapse in share price, the group's largest shareholder - Thomas Cook, the travel agency which, with its German sister company LTU, is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank  -was more sanguine. Owners Abroad said its first-half loss, including the cost of the defence had been Pounds 38.6m, up from Pounds 27.1m in the same period last year. Many holiday companies lose money in the first half and try to offset this with bigger profits in the summer months of the second half. Lex, Page 22 Too close for Owners' comfort, Page 24</p>

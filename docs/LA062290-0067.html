			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY DROPS PLAN FOR DEPARTMENT HEARINGS  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley is planning a major shake-up in the commissions that oversee  the City Hall bureaucracy, but has abandoned plans to hold unprecedented  hearings on the performance of individual departments, a spokesman disclosed  Thursday.  </P> <P> Bradley had announced his intent to hold the performance hearings for each of  21 city departments Feb. 2.  </P> <P> Beginning in March, he said, a department selected by his office would be the  subject of a two-day hearing during which the public would be able to offer  their pet peeves about the bureaucracy. The hearings were to have continued on  a monthly basis until all 21 departments had been held up to public scrutiny.  </P> <P> The plan, which he had proclaimed would have a major impact on city  departments, never got off the ground and has been abandoned, his press  secretary, Bill Chandler, said Thursday.  </P></p>

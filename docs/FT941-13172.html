			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Czech capital pressure Rising inflows of foreign capital are increasing pressures on the Czech authorities to speed moves to make the crown fully convertible, reports Patrick Blum in Vienna. Provisional estimates put capital inflows in the Czech Republic at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 939m) last year, more than the Dollars 1.2bn recorded in 1992 for Czechoslovakia. Of last year's total, about Dollars 600m was in direct investment and about Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m in portfolio investment, with the rest in loans and credits. The completion this year of the first round of voucher privatisation, with shares in about 1,000 companies sold to the public, and the start of trading on the Prague stock exchange in June, have encouraged foreign investment in Czech stocks and securities.</p>

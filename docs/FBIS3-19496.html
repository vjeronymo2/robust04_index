			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "The Twelve Ignored"] </F>   [Text] Andrey Kozyrev met with Warren Christopher at  Vladivostok airport. After two hours of discussions, the  ministers held a joint press conference to announce, among other  things, that they had "reached agreement on the need to end the  conflict" in Bosnia. The Russian head of diplomacy even dotted  the "i's": "Our two countries want the three (warring) parties  to reach a compromise."    It could not be clearer that Washington and Moscow have  decided to settle the matter together, without the help of the  Twelve. The latter, who serve as labor on the ground, are being  sent back to their diplomatic sandbox where they will continue  to play until they have built a real common foreign policy.  Make no mistake: The turn of events clearly shows the failure  of the European Union on an issue which George Bush and Bill  Clinton, at the beginning of his mandate, scarcely wanted to  touch.    The French-German disagreements on the issue of diplomatic  recognition of Croatia and Slovenia at a time when Belgrade  started to lose control of them, and the British rejection of a  WEU [Western European Union] operation against the Yugoslav  fleet and air force deprived the Twelve of the possibility of  exerting the influence and pressure without which restoring  peace is an illusion. Of course, one has scruples about  criticizing them: They have made praiseworthy efforts to bring  the warring sides to reason; but they jeopardized them because  some countries tried to assert their interests in a extensive  negotiations in which they had no place. For the Europeans, who  have just been told to go sit in the corner, the turn of events  will continue to be a disaster unless the lesson in humility  prompts them, big and small, to make the concessions without  which their union will continue to yield mediocre results on the  world political stage.</p>

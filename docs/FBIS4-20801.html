			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yasmine Jellal: "Could There Be Hope?"] </F>   [Text] Hopes and expectations inspired by the national  conference, the dialogue, and the naming of Zeroual continue to  get wide press coverage. The FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] is  getting more coverage than ever in the columns of the  Arab-language weeklies. Except for an interview with Tourabi, it  was the lead topic this week.  <H5>  RISSALAT EL-ATLAS (No. 46) </H5>   This weekly marks the ascension of Liamine Zeroual with an  article entitled: "How Far Will Algeria's Sixth President Go in  Implementing His Ideas?" The weekly asks, "Will he be able to  steer the ship of state to a safe port through this violent  tempest? And will Algerians who were holding their breath after  the conference finally be able to breathe again?"    The weekly's editorial page focuses on the national  conference. "Under the headline: `President...and Hostage,' the  editorialist writes that what happened at the conference "was as  terrifying as expected."    "The national conference failed. What was most distressing  about the meeting is the fact that the de facto authorities made  it a forum for reiterating their determination to pursue  exclusion, eradication, and defiance of the will of the people.  This is apparent," the editorialist continues, "in the inflamed  speeches of Ali Kafi and Salim Saadi, in the maintenance by the  HCE [Higher State Council] of its unconstitutional prerogatives,  and in the platform of the CDN [Natioanal Dialogue Commission],  which was tailored to the advantage of the government by  allowing it to continue to control everything, from the  `president of the republic' to the planned `transition council'  and all other institutions, constitutional or otherwise."    The weekly also points to an even more serious insult to the  feelings of the nation, "namely the meeting held between what  was called civilian society and the so-called helpful sectors of  society, the majority of which were associations, coalitions,  and committees. Among the latter was the Committee To Safeguard  Algeria, which ever since its creation has been responsible, as  we know, for so many wrongs and injuries in its efforts to  destroy democracy, elections, and the people's right to choose."    Very pessimistically, the weekly opines that, "this is the  road back to where we started, using the same methods and  following in the steps of the former transition phase, filled  with so many tragedies and painful events." "For a glimmer of  hope to persist and grow stronger, Mr. Liamine Zeroual should  not have been named to the presidency on the basis of the  conditions set by the HCE and rejected by Bouteflika, because  these conditions make the position strictly honorary. And also  for hope to persist one could wish that it had not been  Benhamouda and Benmansour proposing Zeroual's candidacy, as the  French-language press reported. Because that would mean that the  president would be, just like his predecessors, a hostage of the  mafia and the ghosts that have ruled Algeria up to now,"  concludes RISSALAT EL-ATLAS. The weekly devotes another article,  equally acerbic, to the same question. For example: "While those  who spoke at the national conference regretted the loss of the  chance for harmony and condemned the boycott of the major  parties, those words were only for `popular' consumption,  because what really happened at Club des Pins is what the regime  had planned and wanted to make happen.    "The regime does not want consensus, for it knows that would  work against it. The El-Khatib commission played precisely the  role that had been scripted for it." RISSALAT EL-ATLAS also  published an interview with Hassan Tourabi, reprinted from  EVENEMENT DU JEUDI and translated into Arabic. In the interview  Tourabi says, regarding the assassination of Algerian  intellectuals and foreigners living in Algeria, that "everything  depends on what name we give the battle..."    "In Western philosophy, it is considered legal to resist  repression and oppression, and this is called `resistance' or  `revolution'; and in any case all revolutions have their  victims, and the Algerians are of a revolutionary nature.  Remember the price they paid to drive out the French: more than  a million martyrs," said Tourabi.  <H5>  EL-HADETH (No. 8) </H5>   In an article entitled: "The FIS and the Regime: Movement  Toward The Negotiating Table?" this weekly raises the question:  "What happened behind the scenes that led Anwar Haddam to  publish his famous communique from Washington?" In answer to  this question, the weekly notes that: "analysts are divided into  two camps: One group believes the statement was simply a ploy  imposed by FIS overseas representatives in order to diffuse  pressures that Western circles were bringing to bear on FIS  political figures due to the intensification of activities by  armed Islamic groups. Other analysts," EL-HADETH continues,  "have seen behind the declaration an indicator pointing to real  detente, at least between the political wing of FIS and the  regime." Between these two contradictory theories, EL-HADETH  claims to describe what really happened behind the scenes.  "According to a very well-informed source, the naming of Liamine  Zeroual was a bid to put an end to the policy pursued by the  previous group since the advent of Boudiaf, a policy that  consisted of not entering into serious dialogue with the radical  Islamist opposition, banking instead, first of all, on the  weight of the security apparatus and second on moral and  material support from certain Western circles." The weekly  continues: "But that gamble, based mainly on a security  solution, has failed, and its repercussions at the social and  political levels were not just serious--they were catastrophic."  "It seems that the military institution, which has been  implicated on more than one occasion since the events of October  1988, no longer trusts the civilians, who once in power find  themselves locked into narrow calculations, the strategy of  `wait-and-see,' and vacillation, instead of making hard  decisions," opines EL-HADETH; it cites the example of "the  previous team, which on the one hand announced its intention of  having a dialogue with the opposition but as soon as it started  to become a reality backpedaled from its declared position and  returned to its original stance, a move that obviously  exacerbated the political crisis and showed the opposition that  the government team had no serious intention of resolving the  crisis." EL-HADETH then quoted again from the above-mentioned  source to the effect that: "the previous government team labored  under many inhibitions, which turned into deep-seated anxieties  having to do with lack of faith in itself, doubts about its own  legality, and the fact it was running short of time... All these  misgivings engendered a feeling of frustration within the  regime, especially when it fell hostage to groups that were  beating the drums for the eradicationist line, albeit not  working as political groups to implement that line..."    "The regime found itself cut off from both camps--from the  majority of the people as well as from the opposition,"  EL-HADETH concludes.  <H5>  EL-WAJH EL-AKHAR (No. 42) </H5>   The weekly opines that our military leaders: "have been  fomenting one coup after another, of every conceivable variety.  There has been a tank behind every president ever installed as  head of state, and behind every president who resigned. Only the  military's votes count, when the issue is what constitutes  electoral legality or revolutionary or historical legitimacy. By  now, many people have seen through the `trick': The position of  the presidency in Algeria depends on meeting two basic  conditions: One must either have revolutionary or historical  legitimacy recognized by the military, or one must be a general  oneself," the weekly concludes.    On the last page is an article entitled: "Military  Government, Pending the Advent of `Madani' Government" (author's  play on words: "madani" means "civilian" in Arabic), in which  the author says that: "we do not really see any harm in the  military institution taking power. It is the only institution  still standing in our country... Throughout history, as El  Hachemi Cherif said, democratic revolutions have come to power  by force, not the ballot box; in the past, the army used to say  it kept its distance from politics and was not interested in  political power."    Later on in the same article, EL-WAJH EL-AKHAR discusses  what  it calls: "the shepherds of civilian society and village  political life." "When S. Sadi pays tribute to the military  regime for averting a "madani" regime (author's play on words),  and when Benhamouda marches alone to Club des Pins to demand  Zeroual's presidency, we can guess how the village `brains' in  civilian society are going to practice politics: with drum and  flute."    "We, the young," the weekly continues further down,  "remember  very clearly the oath taken by Kafi to bring to power young  technocrats who favor modernity and new ideas...but the reality  is quite different."  <H5>  ESSABIL (No. 39) </H5>   This weekly gives its lead story the headline: "Was the  Dialogue a Failure?" Yes, it answers: "If we judge the dialogue  on the basis of the results announced, the judgment must be  negative...and one can say that it failed...because neither of  the major interlocutors claimed it was a success, nor did the  public buy its `artificial' conclusion...even though its  architects called it an extraordinary achievement. And if we  gave an interpretation from the point of view of the method by  which it was organized, we would say it was a coup d'etat  against the most basic and elementary underlying principles of  dialogue."    On a more optimistic note, the weekly concludes: "While the  dialogue was not everything the big parties and everyone else  concerned with saving Algeria wanted it to be, does that mean  that those who opted for this form of communication were  deceiving themselves? This new failure of dialogue does not mean  dialogue is doomed to fail every time, and the heads of the most  important parties have said the boycott of the national  conference does not mean a boycott of dialogue per se."</p>

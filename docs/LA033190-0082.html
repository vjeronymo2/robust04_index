			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COALITION SAYS BORDER PATROL SWEEPS JEOPARDIZE COUNT;  </P> <P> CENSUS: LATINO RIGHTS ACTIVISTS CALL FOR MORATORIUM ON SOUTHLAND RAIDS. BUT INS  SAYS AGENTS HAVE JOB TO DO.  </P> <P> A national coalition of Latino rights activists on Friday called for a  moratorium on sweeps by the U.S. Border Patrol, arguing that such actions  jeopardize the accuracy of the U.S. Census Bureau's count.  </P> <P> In a letter to be sent this weekend to President Bush, the San Bernardino-based  group Impacto-2000 contends that Border Patrol raids around the Southland  hinder efforts to persuade legal and illegal immigrants to take part in the  ongoing national tally.  </P> <P> "Instead of promoting confidence in the census process, these disruptive  actions by the Border Patrol are fostering fear (and) skepticism and could very  well produce another substantial undercount among immigrants," Armando Navarro,  Impacto-2000's president, wrote in the letter asking Bush to halt the sweeps  until April 15.  </P> <P> In an interview, Navarro said "Gestapo-like tactics" used by the Border Patrol  have "created a sense of fear and hysteria among Latinos," making many  reluctant to obtain and fill out census forms.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said federal  agents will continue "to conduct enforcement activities, as we are required to  by federal statute.  </P> <P> "But we are going to be extremely sensitive and (limit) what type of publicity  accompanies our actions," said Ron Rogers, a spokesman in the INS western  regional office. "We don't want the public to sense that we're out there  disrupting the census process."  </P> <P> In San Bernardino, Navarro warned that an undercount of undocumented immigrants  would shortchange areas with large Latino populations, both in terms of federal  funding and political representation. High-profile Border Patrol raids, he  said, "increase the distrust Latinos already feel for the government."  </P> <P> John Reeder, the Census Bureau's regional director in Los Angeles, said the INS  had previously agreed to "kind of low-key it" during the count. Indeed, new INS  policy guidelines issued in mid-March require top-level agency clearance for  non-criminal, high-visibility operations that might affect census  participation.  </P> <P> "I know the Hispanic community is concerned that enforcement activity will make  undocumented people fearful," Reeder said. "If I were here illegally, I'm sure  I'd probably feel that way too. But the INS has their job to do."  </P> <P> Meantime, Impacto-2000 and another immigrant rights group said Friday that  toll-free telephone lines set up for Latinos to order Spanish-language copies  of the census questionnaire remain jammed.  </P> <P> Census officials have increased the number of lines but concede that demand has  exceeded capacity. Plans are under way to nearly double the 88 lines now  operating nationwide, said Ken Riccini, a spokesman at census headquarters in  Suitland, Md.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Eric Bailey contributed to this story.  </P></p>

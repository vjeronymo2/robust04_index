			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> STRATEGISTS DEBATE NATO'S MILITARY, POLITICAL FUTURE;  </P> <P> ALLIANCES: DESPITE U.S. SUPPORT, THE GROUP MUST PROVE IT CAN SERVE NEW EUROPEAN  SECURITY INTERESTS TO SURVIVE.  </P> <P> Military officers and diplomats at NATO headquarters here are clearly buoyed by  the firm support they have received from Secretary of State James A. Baker III  for a future role for the organization.  </P> <P> At a time of uncertainty, they heartily welcomed Baker's reassurance last week  that President Bush wants to enhance the political role of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization.  </P> <P> Many senior officials here worry that despite NATO's record as the most  successful defense alliance in modern European history, the Cold War's end may  force NATO into premature retirement -- a kind of yesterday's alliance.  </P> <P> Various political voices in Western Europe, particularly West German Social  Democrats and their foreign allies, suggest increasingly that NATO has outlived  its usefulness and ought to be scrapped.  </P> <P> These critics do not spell out exactly what should take the place of NATO, but  there is talk of a European Community with a security dimension, or, better  yet, a strengthening of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE), which includes East European countries.  </P> <P> This disturbs NATO officials, who believe that the alliance should not be  phased out but be praised and given new tasks.  </P> <P> "When you've just won the ball game, you don't retire the winning team," one  senior American military man said. "Yet that's just what some Europeans are  suggesting we do."  </P> <P> The military officers, diplomats, and strategic specialists who support a  continued NATO are not simply cold warriors who do not want to lose their jobs  or who stubbornly talk about potential threats from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> They agree that military forces in Western Europe will be sharply reduced in  the years ahead.  </P> <P> "We simply think that it is way too premature to disband NATO," said Simon  Lunn, a senior strategist with the North Atlantic Assembly, a group of  lawmakers in the member countries.  </P> <P> Another official said: "While nobody expects Soviet armored divisions to roll  across the north German plain, they are still a force to be considered -- with  16 divisions in East Germany alone. So there is a need for a Western military  force in being. Who knows what the Kremlin's policies will be a year from now."  </P> <P> As these people see it, there are still many military tasks for NATO, as well  as new and broader reasons for its continuing existence. NATO's role, they say,  should emphasize the political side of the 16-member alliance, which includes  the key countries of Western Europe plus the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> "We have always had a strong political component," Secretary General Manfred  Woerner said. "We have never been solely a military alliance."  </P> <P> Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany, adds: "NATO has never  been simply about soldiers and tanks and planes. It's also the seat of European  political connections, the center of European decision-making since World War  II."  </P> <P> Of the non-military potential of NATO, a senior U.S. diplomat here said: "With  Europe in the throes of change, NATO is more than ever needed. NATO is a  predictable factor. It is a structure that ties in the United States with  Europe. It gives a united Germany a home. It gives Eastern European countries  like Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary a sense of not being left in a void.  And it is in a position to dampen and quell local conflicts, particularly those  that might break out among ethnic regions in Central Europe and the Balkans.  </P> <P> "In short, it is an all-purpose organization that represents calm, certainty  and stability."  </P> <P> Few Western politicians want to scrap NATO overnight, but some have argued that  the CSCE, established in Helsinki in 1975, would be better suited to serve new  European political and security interests since it brings together all European  nations with the exception of Albania, plus the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> Supporters of this plan would strengthen the loosely organized CSCE, which is  an umbrella group for arms control and human rights, and give it a secretariat  and a wide range of responsibilities.  </P> <P> However, many NATO supporters argue that CSCE's very breadth is a drawback,  perhaps a fatal weakness in any effort to fulfill a realistic security role.  </P> <P> "CSCE operates on a consensus basis," a top NATO planner said, "and it doesn't  have any security apparatus. Can you imagine trying to get a unanimous decision  on an urgent military matter with countries as diverse as the United States and  the Soviet Union, San Marino and Malta? It would be like a mini-United Nations,  and it just wouldn't work."  </P> <P> But what could be NATO's most important new role, according to some Western  strategists who are hesitant about discussing the matter publicly, is the  containment of a unified Germany.  </P> <P> One leading NATO diplomat said: "Let's face it, whether the Germans like it or  not, they are feared by some nations and worry others. NATO can serve two  important purposes: reassuring the Germans that they are members of a strong  Western Alliance and reassuring Germany's neighbors that the alliance can  embrace Germany.  </P> <P> "Even the Russians are realizing, though they won't admit it publicly yet, the  advantage of NATO as a containing force for a united Germany."  </P> <P> Secretary General Woerner, a former West German defense minister, has even  warned that a powerful and neutralized Germany would be a "loose cannon."  </P> <P> In looking toward Europe's future, one NATO ambassador observed: "The veneer of  European integration is still very thin. The key to future harmony and  stability in Europe is a united Germany that is balanced and linked to friendly  powers, most particularly the United States. The only proven and existing  organization that can play that role is NATO."  </P></p>

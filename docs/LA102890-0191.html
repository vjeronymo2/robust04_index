			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH JANICE;  </P> <P> THE REMATCH  </P> <P> My handicapping consistency nearly helped me survive a spectacular finish by  SURELOCK in our competition based on the seven races at Belmont Park Saturday.  Our editors gave each of us an extra $500 for the bets, but we had to spend all  of it.  </P> <P> I had $50 win bets on Royal Academy ($9.80), Fly So Free ($5.40) and In The  Wings ($7), and finished with $555. SURELOCK was shut out until 38-1 shot Ibn  Bey returned $28 to place in the Classic, giving the computer $560. SURELOCK  got back $60 when one of his exacta bets scratched, for a total of $620.  </P> <P> In the regular segment of our betting, I lost $60 on the races at Oak Tree,  giving me a loss of $5 for the day. My bets for today are $25 to win and place  on Excellent Guest in the third race.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Sat. Bankroll: $2,237.50  </P> <P> Saturday's Loss : $5  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $2,232.50  </P> <P> SURELOCK made an $80 profit when Exbourne won the 10th race at Oak Tree, giving  him a $200 profit for the day. The computer's bets today are $100 to win on  Stylish Star in the eighth race and a $10 exacta box on Histrion, Ra Kish and  Reppus Tuolluf in the ninth race.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's Sat. Bankroll: $190  </P> <P> Saturday's Profit: $200  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $390  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.  SURELOCK does not own horses.  </P> <P> Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.  </P></p>

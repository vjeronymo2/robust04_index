			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFC PLAYOFF NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> EX-RAM YOUNG IS A CATCH FOR BRONCOS  </P> <P> Once again, the Rams and Raiders won't be meeting in the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> How about an ex-Raider vs. an ex-Ram?  </P> <P> OK, there's ex-Raider linebacker Matt Millen of the 49ers vs. ex-Ram and  ex-UCLA Bruin receiver Michael Young, who helped quarterback John Elway and the  Broncos break up Sunday's AFC championship game.  </P> <P> Young, left unprotected by the Rams last winter and signed by the Broncos as a  Plan B free agent, caught two passes -- one for 70 yards and a touchdown, the  other for 53, setting up another touchdown.  </P> <P> Was he surprised?  </P> <P> "Coming here, I thought that if I made the team, I'd have a chance to  participate and do some things," Young said. "But never to this extent. I never  would have dreamed of having a game like this."  </P> <P> Mad at the Rams?  </P> <P> "They just had a change in philosophy," Young said. "There was a new offensive  coordinator (Ernie Zampese) coming in and I wasn't his type of player. Hey,  everybody has their opinion. I'm not upset at all at them.  </P> <P> "I wish I could say I had animosity toward 'em but I'd be lying if I said that.  I almost stayed there because I knew I had a secure job as a backup receiver.  But I knew that being a backup receiver on the Rams was like being a tackle. I  mean, I knew I was never going to see any kind of action unless someone got  hurt.  </P> <P> "I almost didn't leave because I liked it so much. But I tell you what, I like  it a hell of a lot better here."  </P> <P> The Broncos played the second half without rookie running back Bobby Humphrey,  and it showed.  </P> <P> Veteran Sammy Winder took over and gained 37 yards -- in 21 carries.  </P> <P> Will Humphrey be ready for the Super Bowl?  </P> <P> Coach Dan Reeves said he has two broken ribs.  </P> <P> "Nah," said Humphrey, who will be X-rayed again today.  </P> <P> Eight different Denver receivers caught passes, but when asked if Cleveland's  secondary could have done anything differently to stop them, cornerback Frank  Minnifield failed to come up with answers.  </P> <P> "They don't pay me to make that evaluation," Minnifield said. "I'm the CB, not  the HC."  </P> <P> HC?  </P> <P> "Head coach."  </P> <P> OK. But what about . . . ?  </P> <P> "Don't even ask me," Minnifield said. "I didn't sit and watch the game. I  played it. There was no thought process. They just pay me to cover wide  receivers. You ask me to evaluate something, you ain't doing me no service  whatsoever."  </P> <P> It was Minnifield who slipped and fell, freeing Young for his 70-yard touchdown  catch.  </P> <P> Bud Carson, despite the loss, was satisfied with his first season coaching the  Browns.  </P> <P> "When we were down and out, everybody said we were finished," Carson said. "But  we came back, week by week, every day except today. I'd say we made a hell of a  run at it."  </P> <P> What did Elway think of the crowd noise that drowned out Cleveland counterpart  Bernie Kosar's signals?  </P> <P> "I had trouble hearing when we had the ball," Elway said. "I can only imagine  what it was like for Bernie."  </P> <P> Denver radio station KHOW played a new tune all week, sung to the tune of the  old Coasters hit, "Charlie Brown." It went:  </P> <P>  Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Browns.  </P> <P>  They're real clowns, those Cleveland Browns.  </P> <P>  They're gonna get beat, gonna miss the bus.  </P> <P>  Why the Denver Broncos always pickin' on us?  </P> <P> Times columnist Mike Downey contributed to this story.  </P></p>

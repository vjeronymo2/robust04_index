			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto </F> Robaina Gonzalez in Lima on 10 April]    [Text] [LA REPUBLICA] What results do you expect from this  official visit you are paying to Peru?    [Robaina] Our visit to Peru is part of a tour of other Latin  American countries where we will explain to our American  brothers and the entire international community to what extent  Cuba is determined to carry out its project, without straying  from the historic path it has chosen, in this time of crisis.    The idea is to tell everyone what aspects of our revolution  are not negotiable and what aspects of our socio-economic  program are. Our presence here is also our response to an  international campaign against Cuba. It is our duty to break up  this negative campaign.    [LA REPUBLICA] What are the aspects of socialist Cuba that  can be negotiated? How do you think Cuba should adapt to the new  international context that surrounds it?    [Robaina] This process will, precisely, allow a new type of  relationship with the world. We haven't asked anybody for a  correlation of political ideologies in order to establish an  economic relationship, and this is where we will have to adapt  to a completely new situation. In this regard there are national  interests that match the interests of foreign investors. What is  a need for Cuba might be an investment opportunity for many and,  modestly speaking, we also believe Cuba has a lot to offer the  world.    [LA REPUBLICA] What guarantees and incentives does Cuba  currently offer foreign capital?    [Robaina] Much is said about what Cuba can offer foreign  investors and facts have proven that Cuba, definitely, has a lot  to attract foreign investors. This is why we seek meetings, to  negotiate and get more acquainted, because only thus will we be  able to establish stable new rules. This is why we must point  out that Cuba has opened its doors to foreign capital with legal  and constitutional backing. This backing is clear and flexible  enough to avoid any suspicion.    [LA REPUBLICA] What Cuban sectors are more attractive to  foreign capital? What products does your country offer the  international markets aside from sugar, of course?    [Robaina] We are taking very positive steps in the tourism  field. There is also great potential in the iron and steel  industry, in the construction sector. We also have a wide range  of products in which the international market is interested such  as nickel, oil, and the production and processing of citrus  fruit.    [LA REPUBLICA] Is this new open door policy particularly  directed to a certain market?    [Robaina] The opening to the international market is a  priority issue for Cuba, but within this framework, we want to  give even greater preference to Latin American investors.    [LA REPUBLICA] How can potential foreign investors be  certain  they will enjoy full guarantees in Cuba?    [Robaina] Those investors from various parts of the world  who  already are investing in Cuba can say that better than us  because it is a fact. We have investors from Spain, Canada,  Italy, France, and also from Latin American countries such as  Colombia, Argentina, Brazil. They are not only looking into the  possibilities of investing but already have invested in our  country, and our relationship with them is excellent.    [LA REPUBLICA] This means that the future of foreign  investments in Cuba is quite promising.    [Robaina] It should be pointed out that Cuba's relationship  with foreign investors is not as smooth and easy as in other  countries. It must be taken into account that we are promoting  this opening with great opposition. In order to attract foreign  investors we have not only had to grant them a legal framework  that would give them guarantees, but we also have had to be  quite bold and brave. It is no secret that whoever tries to make  deals with Cuba is subject to great pressure. If the new  investors want legal guarantees, they already have them.  Moreover, there is the guarantee of the facts, there is the  testimony of those already investing in Cuba.    [LA REPUBLICA] What are the expectations regarding Cuba's  relationship with Peru in this new phase?    [Robaina] In all our commercial relationships, Cuba does not  go around the world only saying what it needs. We, modestly,  also offer what could be of help to friendly countries. In sum,  I believe that in Peru's case we have a lot to offer in the  sugar industry; we have a tourism market that may interest many  investors; we have significant technological development in the  medical and paramedical fields, in the production of medical  equipment, important developments in the biotechnology field; we  also have important experience in the sports field. We hope to  increase our relationship with Peru in the commercial and  investments fields, which will, in turn, strengthen our  traditional historic and cultural ties.    [LA REPUBLICA] Is the U.S. commercial blockade imposed more  than 30 years ago the only obstacle to Cuba's new political  opening being fully successful in the near future?    [Robaina] We have never said that the blockade is the only  cause of our problems. The problems Cuba has experienced lately  are the combination of a series of factors but, definitely, the  blockade is the greatest obstacle. Now, more than ever in this  crucial phase, we have to bear a tremendous pressure exerted not  only directly against Cuba but also against whoever deals with  or invests in Cuba.    [LA REPUBLICA] Is tourism the field in which Cuba has  attracted the most foreign investment?    [Robaina] Let us talk about priorities. Tourism is a market  with lots of possibilities for Cuba and important steps in this  area have been taken. Cuba's climate is very attractive to any  tourist in the world. This is why we have given tourism the same  level of development as other very promising fields for foreign  investors. However, we should bear in mind that we have resorted  to tourism out of need, due to the difficulties Cuba is facing.  But it is no secret to anybody that, aside from the capital,  tourism in countries such as ours have a very high political and  social cost.    [LA REPUBLICA] Does this mean that tourism for Cuba  represents more problems than solutions?    [Robaina] No. That is not so. If we have promoted tourism in  Cuba it is because we have no alternatives at this very  difficult moment. But, fortunately, tourism has developed at a  time when the Cuban people have reached a cultural,  technological, scientific, and political level that has allowed  us to face the opening to the tourism industry in a suitable  way. There is no doubt that tourism today is as important as any  of our harvests.    [LA REPUBLICA] On the domestic front, how does the Cuban  Government intend to face the black market's socio-economic  problem?    [Robaina] The so-called black market exists; we do not deny  nor try to conceal our problems. Everyone is aware that in times  of crisis and in the midst of such adverse circumstances as the  ones we are enduring, the surfacing of the black market is  something "natural" from the economic viewpoint. The black  market speculates with the peoples' needs. What we have to do  about this and other social problems is to normalize life in  Cuba, produce more to meet the peoples' needs. This challenge  requires the implementation of very special measures that adjust  to the new circumstances under which we live. This is the reason  for the great nationwide debate to get everyone to participate  in the decisionmaking on these new measures. These measures  will be assessed and adopted by the National Assembly of the  People's Government convened for 1 May.</p>

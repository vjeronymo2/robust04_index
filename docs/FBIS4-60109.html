			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO </F> Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, by Mikha'el Tuchfeld; place not given --  live]    [Text] [Tuchfeld] Today we heard additional comments made  by 'Arafat in Johannesburg, this time referring to an agreement  Muhammad made with the Quiraish Tribe and later violated. Does  this mean that Islam permits people to sign agreements and then,  when the circumstances change, to violate them?    [Al-Tibi] What you are saying now and what you have been  broadcasting since noon today is totally despicable. You  interviewed a self-appointed expert with a political bias, a  pseudo-orientalist who has distorted both Islam and the facts,  claiming that Muhammad was the one who violated the agreement  with the Quiraish Tribe.    I accompanied 'Arafat to Johannesburg. Upon entering the  mosque, he was immediately surrounded by radical fundamentalists  who charged that he had signed an agreement with Israel while  the latter violated it daily by murdering Palestinians,  confiscating land, etc. In this mosque, 'Arafat said -- and you  broadcast his remarks -- that if one side violates the  agreement, the other side can violate it, as happened in the  agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish. Now, what was this  agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish, which was distorted  by that self-appointed orientalist, Moshe Sharon?    [Tuchfeld] A nonbelligerency agreement.    [Al-Tibi] The agreement was called Hudaybah Sulh  [reconciliation]. In this agreement, which dictated tough terms  to Muhammad, the latter undertook to forgo the pilgrimage to  Mecca. He accepted this dictate, and he also agreed not to  accept any Quiraish member who wanted to become a Muslim and to  send him away. An important clause in the agreement stated that  if one side harms a member of the other side, the agreement is  thereby annulled. This clause, incidentally, was inserted at  the Quiraish's request. After two years, the Quiraish Tribe  massacred the followers of the Prophet Muhammad, thereby  violating the agreement. It was the Quiraish Tribe that  violated the agreement, as every elementary school student  knows. Now you come here and do something totally  unacceptable....    [Tuchfeld, interrupting] It is not unacceptable, because  Yasir 'Arafat's comments require clarification, and Professor  Moshe Sharon is a renowned orientalist. Now, returning to  'Arafat's call for jihad, he later explained it as a religious  jihad for peace. Not only Moshe Sharon, however, but other  orientalists claim that there is no such thing in Islam.    [Al-Tibi] I will not let this go unanswered. I agree with  you that 'Arafat referred to the agreement between Muhammad and  the Quiraish, but you were accomplices to an act of distortion.  Since noon today, you have been broadcasting that Yasir 'Arafat  meant....    [Tuchfeld, interrupting] Now we are giving you the  opportunity to clarify what he said, so why do you not use the  short time you have to explain things?    [Al-Tibi] Mikha'el, 'Arafat's comments should not have been  elucidated by a right-wing orientalist whom you pulled straight  out of a Gush Emunim conference. I can sympathize with your  sensitivity to the word jihad, because it has a militant  connotation for Jews, seeing that Arabs have always used it in  this sense. Yasir 'Arafat explained what he meant, but many  Israelis did not accept his explanation, while some did.  Someone is now trying to make unjustifiable use of this second  version of the tape. Incidentally, tapes are a special Israeli  political genre which I think we should not exploit in reference  to agreements between two nations....    [Tuchfeld, interrupting] Dr. al-Tibi, this is why we are  giving you the opportunity to explain 'Arafat's remarks, and  what you are claiming is that when one side violates an  agreement, the other side is entitled to launch a jihad.    [Al-Tibi] Absolutely not. Nobody said this, and now you are  again distorting what was said. Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres  themselves said that if Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  comes to power after the elections, the agreement is null and  void. Now, if somebody thinks of violating an agreement as a  result of political elections, what should be the fate of the  agreement in the case of an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] massacre  of Palestinians or a Palestinian massacre of Israelis? I think  in that case the agreement will be totally worthless. We are  dealing here with an agreement that must be honored. Yasir  'Arafat signed this agreement. Perhaps criticism regarding the  insensitive use of the jihad concept was justified, but this is  not the case concerning the new version and this theater of the  absurd which you are all participating in.</p>

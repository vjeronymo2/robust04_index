			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lagos, June 11 (AFP) -- Members of Nigeria's  opposition Saturday [11 June] moved to seek a compromise with  the country's military rulers after Moshood Abiola, the presumed  winner of Nigeria's presidential poll a year ago, was put under  house arrest before he could declare a rebel government.    Abiola, Nigeria's main opposition leader, had been  threatened  with arrest on charges of treason if he went ahead with a plan  to set up a "government of national unity" Sunday, anniversary  of the June 12, 1993 election that he was widely seen as having  won by a large majority. [passage omitted]    There were few signs of tension, however, in downtown Lagos,  48 hours before the start of a week of civil disobedience called  for by Campaign for Democracy militants in the opposition.    Last year's poll was declared free and fair by international  observers but annulled by then junta leader General Ibrahim  Babangida, who alleged irregularities. Babangida was succeeded  by an interim civilian administration, which gave way to General  Sani Abacha who seized power last November. Abacha meanwhile is  to make a national address on radio early Sunday, his office  said in Abuja. [passage omitted] According to Abacha's office,  the general was to give a broadcast address to the nation Sunday  on the situation.    On Friday, head of police Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie said the  security forces were ready to confront any eventuality.    Nigeria's Anglican archbishop, Abiodun Adetiloye, who  fronted  moves to persuade Abiola to delay naming a government for a few  days, called on the present leadership and the opposition to  engage in dialogue to resolve the crisis.    In a message to General Abacha, the fourth in recent weeks,  the archbishop called on the military leader to choose to adopt  an honourable transition of power to the "democratically  elected" government of Abiola and avoid a tragedy similar to the  one in Rwanda.    On Friday, Nigerian television broadcast powerful pictures  of  the Rwandan civil war and called on Nigerians to "help the  government preserve peace." [passage omitted]    Archbishop Aditiloye, who heads a church which has 10  million  followers in Nigeria, said prayers would be said Sunday for the  "peaceful restoration" of democracy.    The country's two most influential dailies, the DAILY TIMES  and THE GUARDIAN, both appealed to the government in editorials  to hold a dialogue with the opposition and also condemned the  arrest of leading public figures by the police, including chief  and former minister Anthony Enahoro, 71, one of the father's of  Nigerian independence.</p>

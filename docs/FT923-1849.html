			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Observer: Off and on Last-ditch defender Midland Bank has been given the boot by Tottenham Hotspur - a cynical reward, it might seem for seeing the north London football club through the dark years of heavy debt and suspended shares. Instead, back comes Barclays, the club stalwart banker until dropped in favour of Midland by Spurs' old management team headed by Paul Bobroff and Irving Scholar who floated the club a decade ago. By 1990, it owed Midland more than Pounds 10m after a disastrous diversification into clothing and a huge over-run of costs. But, though the debt could have been recalled at any time, it wasn't. Still, the defender departs to a grateful 'Well played' from Spurs' new management, consumer electronics millionaire Alan Sugar and football guru Terry Venables. Moreover, Midland did not fare too badly as a Spurs player. After all, the club kept up the interest payments which amounted to about Pounds 6.5m in the four years to last May. Sugar took over part of the loan a year ago, charging base rate for the interest, whereas the bank added 2 percentage points. And there will have been other bank charges related to some tense and prolonged negotiations. Now, having eliminated the debt through the sale of Paul Gascoigne, which netted Pounds 5.4m, Spurs is reputedly only 'dipping in and out of overdraft'. So, in the end, it may be Barclays that has missed out on the glory years.</p>

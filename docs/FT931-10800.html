			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / US duties on British steel plate attacked US ACTION to impose heavy anti-dumping duties on British exports of steel plate was 'unwarranted and wholly disproportionate,' Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said yesterday. He said the provisional 109.22 per cent levy was in addition to the earlier duties imposed on UK exports of plate and bar. Mr Needham told the Commons: 'To penalise genuinely privatised companies which have not received subsidies for over six years is unfair and economically unsound.' He said the action had been initiated by the 'highly protected US steel industry' and would not help efforts to secure an international settlement in the multi-lateral steel agreement negotiations.</p>

He also expressed doubt about President  Lissouba's ability to solve the crisis. Foreign Minister  Benjamin Bounkoulou, who is quite irritated, spoke to Monique  Mas:    [Begin Bounkoulou recording] The reasons that impelled Mr.  Roussin to react in this way -- the assessment he made about our  president -- are unacceptable. His remarks are discourteous  toward a president of a country that is a friend of France.  This assessment is not in line with the traditions of  friendship between Congo and France; it is not in line with the  elementary principles of diplomacy and international law for a  minister of a friendly country to judge a head of state in this  way. It is all the more serious since Mr. Roussin has very  friendly relations with President Pascal Lissouba. What is very  surprising about these remarks by Minister Roussin is that the  previous day a French Government statement issued by the Foreign  Ministry noted the search for a political solution under the  authority of President Lissouba. [end recording]    The French ambassador to Brazzaville was summoned to the  Congolese Foreign Ministry this morning.</p>

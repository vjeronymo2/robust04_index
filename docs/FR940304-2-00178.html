The proposed improvement would involve the reconstruction of Route 13 between the towns of Lexington and Richmond for a distance of approximately 13 miles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic demand. Also, included in this proposal is the replacement of an existing deficient bridge across the Missouri River and the construction of a new interchange with U.S. Route 24. Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) using alternate travel modes; (3) improvement of the existing two-lane roadway to four lanes; (4) constructing a four-lane limited access highway on new location, and (5) constructing a four-lane fully access controlled highway on new location. Incorporated into and studied with the various build alternatives will be design variations of grade and alignment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A scoping process has been initiated that is involving all appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal. A series of public meetings are being held to obtain comments from the local and regional community. The first meeting was held in Lexington in early January and was followed by a second meeting in early February, 1994. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearing. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments, and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or MHTD at the addresses provided above. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued: February 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald L.

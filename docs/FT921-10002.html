			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Promoters give hard sell to single company Peps - A new product THE single company personal equity plan (Pep) is one of the newest products on the financial market and it is being promoted heavily in advance of the end of the tax year and a possible Labour government. Investors can place up to Pounds 3,000 of one company's shares in a plan, in addition to any Pounds 6,000 Pep they might have taken out in the tax year. As with other Peps, returns in a single company plan are free of capital gains and income tax. But as David Rough, director of investments at Legal &amp; General, warned small investors this week: 'The tax advantages of single company Peps are more than outweighed by the increased risk of linking an investment to the fortunes of one company'. Single company Peps are most suitable for two groups. Employees who acquire shares through an approved options scheme can transfer them into a single company plan without the problem and cost of a bed-and-breakfast operation (where the shares are sold and then re-purchased). Then there are people who already have a diversified portfolio of investments. Those who own the shares will face transfer costs already; but others may simply have decided to buy the shares as a long-term investment, in any case, and use the Pep as a tax-efficient means of doing so. The choice is between Peps sponsored by the companies themselves and the general schemes of plan managers. One obvious factor is cost. Many of the companies which sponsor their own plans offer cut-rate deals. Scottish &amp; Newcastle's plan, for example, which is managed by the Bank of Scotland, makes no initial charge and a half-yearly management charge of 0.25 per cent. There are brokerage commissions of 0.25 per cent on dealings within the Pep. Normally, it will be cheaper to go for a company-sponsored Pep. There might, however, be good reasons for turning to a plan manager. Your chosen company might not have its own Pep arrangements. There is also the question of transferring your plan from one company to another. This could take considerable time if you have opted for a sponsored Pep - time in which the share price of the new company in which you wish to invest might move considerably. So those who expect to be reasonably active traders of shares should opt for a plan manager's Pep. Some of the cheaper single company Peps are being offered by plan managers as self-select Peps. The table, compiled by Chase de Vere, shows most of the deals on offer; but here are further details of some of the prominent offers. (Cost assumes buying Pounds 3,000 of shares, twice-yearly dividend collection unless indicated, and includes 0.5 per cent stamp duty). Lloyds Bank. No initial charge but there is an annual fee of Pounds 20 plus VAT. Lloyds puts purchases through as part of a bulk deal twice a month at a very low brokerage cost of 0.2 per cent. Dealing at other times will be at the standard 1.6 per cent, subject to a minimum of Pounds 25. No charge for collecting dividends. Choice is limited to 100 single-company Peps. Cost: Pounds 44.50. Pilling &amp; Co (061-832-6581). No initial or annual management fees. Brokerage is Pounds 1.65 per cent subject to a Pounds 30 minimum. It costs Pounds 6.75 for the tax reclaim per dividend. There is no charge for closure but Pilling reserves the right to levy Pounds 25 for a transfer to another plan manager. Cost: Pounds 78. Killik &amp; Co (071-589-1577). There are no initial charges or annual administration charges. There is a brokerage charge of 1.65 per cent to buy the shares, subject to a Pounds 40 minimum, and 0.5 per cent stamp duty. There is also a Pounds 7.50 charge for reclaiming tax on any dividends. Killik reserves the right to charge Pounds 10 for closure. If you invest the full Pounds 3,000 in a single company's stock you can, therefore, expect to pay Pounds 49.50 in brokerage, Pounds 15 in stamp duty and - if it is a company that pays twice-yearly - Pounds 15 for collecting dividends. Cost: Pounds 79.50. John Siddall &amp; Co (061-832-7471). You need Pounds 10 as an initial payment to open the Pep and there is an annual administration charge of 0.5 per cent and VAT. Commission rates are 1.25 per cent and there is no minimum rate. No charges for collecting dividends, nor for closing or transferring the Pep. Cost: Pounds 80.13. Yorkshire Bank. No initial fee but there is an annual administration charge of 1.5 per cent plus VAT. Brokerage charges are 1 per cent but you are subject to a minimum investment of Pounds 1,500. No dividend charges but closure will incur 0.75 per cent of the value of the Pep (half the annual fee). Choice limited to FTSE 100. Cost: Pounds 97.88. Bell Lawrie White (031-228-5777). No initial charge but there is a 1 per cent annual administration fee plus VAT. Dealing charges are 1.6 per cent, subject to a Pounds 30 minimum. One free withdrawal a year is permitted; otherwise, there is a Pounds 25 charge. The company encourages shareholders to let dividends accumulate within the Pep. Cost: Pounds 98.25 (excludes dividend collection). Reyker Securities (071-499-9097). There is an initial charge of Pounds 20 and an annual administration fee of 1 per cent plus VAT. Reyker does no brokerage itself but uses the broker of your choice or its recommended broker, charging 1.5 per cent commission. There is no charge for withdrawals or closure other than brokerage costs of selling the shares. No charge for closure, but transferring to another plan manager will cost 1 per cent of the value of the Pep. Cost: Pounds 115.75. Finally, a note on the choice of company. It must be a stock which you are prepared to hold for the long term. A good yield is preferable so as to take advantage of the income tax exemption. But shares with very high yields will be risky and could result in a capital loss (which will not be offsettable against CGT gains elsewhere in your portfolio). The trick is to find find a stock with the prospect of steady dividend and capital growth.</p>

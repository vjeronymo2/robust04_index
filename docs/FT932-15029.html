			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Qatari bank returns to black after BCCI loss a year ago QATAR'S Doha Bank, which lost Dollars 28.6m in 1991 mainly because of a deposit with the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), said it returned to profit in 1992, Reuter reports from Manama. Doha Bank, which is owned by Qatari shareholders, announced a QR38m (Dollars 10.5m) net profit for last year. It made a Dollars 65m deposit with BCCI in 1991 but expected to get back only 40 per cent of the sum. The bank, with branches in Pakistan and New York, plans to raise its paid-up capital by 50 per cent to QR78.5m by issuing shares worth QR26.25m. It said it had won approval from the Qatari authorities to increase its capital, and the issue would be put before a shareholders' meeting next week. New shares would be offered to shareholders at a face value of QR100. Assets rose to QR2.73bn in 1992 from QR2.64bn the previous year. Shareholders' equity rose to QR200m from QR172m. Earnings per share stood at QR72.42 in 1992. The bank has an 11.11 per cent capital adequacy ratio, higher than the 8 per cent required by the Bank of International Settlements.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: RPS continues advance to Pounds 388,000 RPS Group, the USM-traded environmental consultancy, continued to improve with an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 355,000 to Pounds 388,000 for the half year to June 30. Turnover was down from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 3.5m, giving an increase in margins from 9.5 per cent to 11.1 per cent. The company has just won a contract to advise the Department of Trade and Industry on the environmental issues relating to the privatisation of British Coal, and will continue its policy of concentrating on maintaining and improving margins rather than adding turnover. Earnings per share came out at 2.17p (1.99p) and there is an increased interim dividend of 1.1p (1p).</p>

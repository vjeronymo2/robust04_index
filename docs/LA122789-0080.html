			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA: THE DEATH OF A DICTATOR;  </P> <P> PRAGUE, BUCHAREST: TALE OF TWO CITIES AMID REVOLUTIONS;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: BOTH OVERTHREW REGIMES, BUT SIMILARITIES END THERE. CZECHS CELEBRATE  WHILE ROMANIANS MOURN.  </P> <P> In the gloomy dusk of this city without lights, candles along the boulevards  dance in the darkness.  </P> <P> The glow of the small flames is eerily similar to the memorial candles that  mark the main streets of another city several hundred miles north and west of  here, a city that also recently shook off a Communist dictatorship -- Prague.  </P> <P> But beyond the surface comparison, there are far more differences than  similarities between the candles of Bucharest and those of Prague, just as  there are more differences than similarities between the two cities and between  the Czechoslovak and Romanian revolutions.  </P> <P> Prague's candles are large, long-burning and multicolored, tended constantly by  the cheerful and dignified crowds that nightly fill the city streets.  </P> <P> Bucharest's candles are small, thin and yellow, a longer version of the sort of  candle one would place on a child's birthday cake. They burn quickly, and along  the deserted thoroughfares of this city, few people stop to replace them when  they expire.  </P> <P> Prague's candles are accompanied by bouquets of multicolored flowers. In  Bucharest, where flowers in winter are rare, the memorials are surrounded by  bread and fruit -- an Eastern Orthodox ritual offering of memoriam.  </P> <P> But the most obvious difference is also the most profound: Prague's candles  mark spots where anti-government demonstrators were beaten. In Bucharest, the  candles burn for the dead.  </P> <P> In Prague this past month, residents lined up in stores selling Christmas  presents. In Bucharest, residents routinely line up for essential food.  </P> <P> Ordinarily, that problem would have been severely worsened by the warfare of  the last four days. In almost any civil disturbance, particularly one as  massive as the fighting here, the food distribution system is the first  casualty.  </P> <P> It is, therefore, an astonishing measure of how badly Nicolae Ceausescu  squeezed his country that over the past four days of fighting, food supplies in  the city actually have improved.  </P> <P> "There is more food out in shops and stores than I've seen in a year and a  half," said a Western diplomat, explaining that Ceausescu had withheld huge  amounts of food from the domestic market to boost exports and earn hard  currency to finance his massive construction projects.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, with Ceausescu gone, grocers could be seen selling bottles of milk  and cartons of eggs from makeshift distribution points along major streets.  Both items in the past were scarce and sometimes unavailable.  </P> <P> Over the years of Ceausescu's rule, Romanians developed a saying -- "searching  for oranges" -- the rough equivalent of the American expression "wild goose  chase."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, oranges once again were for sale in Bucharest stores.  </P> <P> But, while food supplies here are improving, many other commodities -- from  antibiotics to gasoline -- remain in short supply.  </P> <P> The gasoline shortages contribute heavily to the emptiness of Bucharest after  darkness falls, about 4:30 on winter afternoons. And that emptiness, in turn,  reinforces the somberness of the city's mood.  </P> <P> In other East European capitals, the last months have been a time of joy,  allayed only slightly by concern about the future. Here, by contrast, the mood  has been tense. The celebration over the fall of Ceausescu's dictatorship has  been heavily dampened by the price in lives that Romanians have paid for their  freedom.  </P> <P> This is a city with virtually no street lights or night life. Only a few major  boulevards are lighted, and at night, the city takes on the look of a town  prepared for an air-raid blackout. People have few reasons to be out after  dark, even without the continued threat from snipers and the frequently  broadcast government warnings that civilians should remain indoors.  </P> <P> In contrast with the crowded traffic of other European capitals, there are few  cars on Bucharest streets. The price of an automobile is far beyond the means  of most Romanians. Also, gasoline has been strictly rationed here for years,  and in the last few days, the new authorities have appealed to residents to  restrict driving further to avoid fuel shortages.  </P> <P> With few lights and almost no cars on the street, and with shooting now largely  over, the quiet darkness makes Bucharest seem like a country town, belying the  statistics that show it to be a city of 2 million people.  </P> <P> But the many hours of winter darkness seem appropriate for the mood of  Romanians who have only now begun to emerge from a long spiritual night. People  here have broken some of the bonds of fear that long held them captive, but  many of the habits ingrained by decades of totalitarian rule remain intact.  </P> <P> Some Romanians are happy now to greet foreigners, with whom they were largely  forbidden to talk under the Ceausescu regime. But many eye all strangers  warily, stopping on the sidewalk briefly to stare -- but hastening quickly away  before a conversation can begin.  </P> <P> "There's such a level of paranoia and distrust that people have built up with  each other, it will be very difficult to overcome," a Western diplomat said.  </P> <P> Even those Romanians who have gone the furthest -- inviting foreigners to their  homes, for example -- are slow to abandon habits of wariness.  </P> <P> On one such recent visit, the hosts asked their visitors not to speak English  in the halls of their apartment building and quickly closed the windows and  drew the drapes when the foreigners arrived.  </P> <P> Romanians working as translators for American reporters often are reluctant to  enter the hotels where foreigners stay, explaining, when pressed, that the  hotels in the past have employed many informers for the secret police.  </P> <P> And, while many aspects of Ceausescu's dictatorship disappeared with him, other  parts of the repressive machinery remain. The government agency that controls  passports has told Western diplomats it has received no instructions to change  its policies. Until new instructions arrive, most Romanians still will be  forbidden to travel abroad.  </P></p>

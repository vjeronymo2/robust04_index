			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Arab and Druze Likud activists have denied that  they asked 'Arafat's aide Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi to arrange a visit  in Tunis. They were reacting to Dr. al-Tibi's remarks that a  delegation of Israeli Arab Likud supporters is not welcome in  Tunis, and that 'Arafat is not interested in meeting them. Ayub  Qara', a member of the Likud's secretariat, told our  correspondent Yo'el Dar that it was Dr. al-Tibi who approached  the Druze activists and asked them to hand him names of Likud  supporters in key positions who would be willing to travel to  Tunis and help promote the peace process. Qara' said that Arab  members of the Likud Central Committee want to be a bridge to  peace and contribute to the ongoing process.</p>

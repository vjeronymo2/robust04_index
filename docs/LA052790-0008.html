			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: GORE GALORE  </P> <P> Fangoria magazine has been sinking its teeth into horror films for 11 years --  with reviews, interviews and behind-the-scenes coverage. So "it seems only  natural," says publisher Norman Jacobs, for the magazine to try some  moviemaking of its own:  </P> <P> * "Mindwarp," the first title in Fangoria Films' three-pic deal with  RCA/Columbia ictures Home Video, is in post-production, due at Halloween.  </P> <P> Starring Bruce Campbell and Angus Scrimm, the post-apocalyptic pic was filmed  for under $1 million by longtime Roger Corman associate Steve Barnett.  </P> <P> * "Children of the Night," about vampires, starring Ami Dolenz, Karen Black and  Peter DeLuise, directed by Tony Randel ("Hellbound: Hellraiser II"), begins  shooting June 11.  </P> <P> * "Army," about a genetic formula that replicates body parts, resulting in an  "army" of menacing arms, is set to film in August with Damon Santostefano  making his directorial debut. Casting's not set.  </P> <P> Co-executive producer Steve Jacobs -- son of the publisher -- says there are  also plans for a fourth film to begin shooting in October. Actor Jackie Earle  Haley ("Breaking Away") will write/direct "The Restless Dead."  </P> <P> All Fangoria films will feature plenty of special effects, traditionally  covered with relish by the magazine.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Fangoria is preparing to shoot a pilot for a horror/sci-fi/fantasy  trivia game show set in a dungeon. Title: "Gore Zone." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Does UK industry speak the right language? Sir, Do the leaders of British industry and commerce really want to climb out of the recession? As part of my Politics and East Asian Studies course at Newcastle University I spent a year at Fukuoka University, Japan, acquiring fluency in Japanese. Equally valuably, I gained an understanding of Japanese society and culture. I am now in my final year and I accept that I have much still to learn. I do not dismiss the many graduate opportunities available, but the typical graduate recruitment programme does not recognise the particular merits of employing those who speak Japanese. Japan is a major economic power, with substantial investments in the UK, and it offers a vast potential market for UK business. However, something like three quarters of British companies trading with Japan employ no Japanese speakers. With one notable public sector exception, I have received no indication that Japanese is of immediate interest to prospective employers. Japanese speakers, like other modern language graduates, can make an immediate contribution to the company they join. The problem with languages is 'use it or lose it'; but do any captains of industry care? James Calvert, 5 Bramley Close, South Croydon, Surrey</p>

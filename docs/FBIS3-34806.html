			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 27 January  issue of Cairo AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH summarizes articles that  are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  University Board Now Islamically Run </H5>   Candidates from the "Islamic current" have reportedly won  all  the seats on the board of directors of the Suez Canal  University's Teaching Club. Names of the winning professors and  the number of votes they obtained are cited in a 400-word  front-page report. Dr. Muhammad Abazah, head of the Alexandria  University Teaching Club, said that the Ministry of Social  Affairs is stalling on setting a date for new elections at the  club because opinion polls tip in favor of the Islamic current  candidates.  <H5>  Anti-Islamic Books To Be "Confiscated" </H5>   A "responsible source" at al-Azhar Islamic Research Academy  reportedly stressed that "all publications on display at the  Cairo Book Fair will be scrutinized by the Academy's Composition  and Translation Committee and that any written works containing  ideas that conflict with our Islamic culture will be  confiscated." The source also emphasized that "the grand imam  of al-Azhar has ordered banning from the fair and confiscating  all books published by the Ministry of Culture, supervised by  the Book Authority, that contain ideas conflicting with Islam."  The source added that "all pavilions at the fair will be  supervised by the Composition and Translation Committee" and  pointed out that "the campaign against the Islamic Research  Academy launched by secular weekly magazines will not dissuade  al-Azhar from combating the stray ideas promoted by the  advocates of secularism and communism in Egypt."  <H5>  Ministry, Book Fair Literature Criticized </H5>   People's Assembly deputy Jalal Gharib has reportedly filed a  new request for a briefing by Culture Minister Faruq Husni on  the ministry's publications and periodicals, which he said  contain material "that defames the prophets and divine nature"  as well as "poetry that runs contrary to society's public  ethics." He also protested the festivals organized by the  Ministry of Culture, which he said include performances by  "nude" and "gay" actors and other shows that ridicule religious  symbols in violation of the Constitution, which names Islam as  the state's religion and the Islamic shari'ah as the "primary  source of legislation."  <H5>  West Accused of Attacking Islam </H5>   Reporter Taha Khattab cited Dr. Jamal 'Abd- al-Hadi, a  professor of Islamic history, saying that foreign experts, in  cooperation with the education minister and a U.S. center for  curricula development, are trying to "obliterate the Islamic  identity" of students by undermining their sense of patriotism,  distancing them from their creed, and making them loyal to the  West. Dr. 'Abd-al-Hadi noted: "Whoever defends the Islamic  identity is branded as extremist and a fanatic by the education  minister, who has reassigned thousands of teachers to  administrative positions without specific charges, only that  they are religious." He concluded, saying: "It seems that the  education minister is implementing the Protocols of Zion, which  want education in the Islamic countries to be theoretical only."  <H5>  ROSE AL-YUSUF "Practicing Terrorism" </H5>   Chief Editor Mahmud 'Atiyah criticized the weekly ROSE  AL-YUSUF, without naming it, for publishing secular and  political "garbage," such as extracts from the book by the  "apostate" Salman Rushdie (see nc1901121794). Addressing an  unnamed "communist" writer in charge of a literary publication  for his remarks on the writer Fahmi Huwaydi, 'Atiyah said: "You  are practicing the worst kind of terrorism, for you indeed are a  terrorist group of a dangerous type that must be eliminated by  being discarded from among the sons of the homeland and the body  of the nation, because your ideas belong in the garbage can."  'Atiyah then criticized Culture Minister Faruq Husni for  setting up a higher council for censorship, most of whose  members are "secularists and communists, whose slogan is no to  Islam, no to protecting religious and national ethics and  values, and yes to permissiveness."  <H5>  Islamic Shari'ah Advocated </H5>   Dr. al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji, secretary general of  the Scientists Association, in an article entitled "The Fatal  Error," contended that Third World governments are moving in a  vicious circle because of a fatal error, namely, separating  themselves from their people. Noting that Muslim people wish to  apply Islamic shari'ah, he pointed out that the "governments in  our countries mostly tend to follow a Western mentality, be it  American or Russian." He added that these governments are so  engrossed in this fatal error that they have become hostile to  the desires and the creed of the nation and have made plans to  fight religion and religious people. In conclusion, he noted  that no social or political change could be brought about unless  "free and fair elections" are held that could give real  legitimacy to all the winning quarters.  <H5>  Islamic Preacher's Ban Questioned </H5>   Writer Dr. Faruq 'Abd-al-Salam asked: Why is Shaykh  'Abd-al-Hamid Kishk, a famous Islamic preacher in a Cairo  mosque, prevented from giving religious lessons, delivering the  Friday prayers, and leading people to prayer. He claimed that  there isn't one reasonable explanation for the authority's  insistence on preventing Shaykh Kishk from doing his religious  duty, although he is one of the ulema of al-Azhar and an  articulate orator whose fame is known to Muslims worldwide. He  further asked: "On what constitutional and legal basis in  Egypt, the seat of al-Azhar, are people like Shaykh Kishk and  Shaykh al-Mahallawi denied the right to speak and deliver  sermons in God's house and public places, if, as you claim,  Egypt is democratic and the oasis of democracy in the region?"  He noteed that Shaykh Kishk's sermons are taped and broadcast  against the authority's will in public squares, such as  "Al-'Atabah Square."  <H5>  Islamic Thinkers on Islam, Extremism </H5>   Reporters Hani al-Mikkawi and Yasir al-Dukkan noted a recent  seminar held at the Islamic Thinking Institution of the Islamic  Education Society. Among the attendees were writer Fahmi  Huwaydi, Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, and  Islamic thinker Dr. Muhammad 'Imarah who spoke at the seminar on  local and international Islamic affairs. Huwaydi is quoted  referring to a cultural "crisis" in the country resulting from  Israeli, American, and Western "infiltration of Egyptian  universities and culture, while Islam is busy defending itself  against attacks by various quarters." He continued: "We are  living in a society the political orientation of which does not  specify the enemy or the friend." While admitting that the  "acts of violence" have harmed the "Islamic movement," Huwaydi  called for the need to revert to an Islamic "point of reference"  (marji'iyah) that truly expresses the requirements of the age.  Asked about the gap between Islamists and secularists, he  admitted that such a gap exists despite Egyptian society being  Islamic, adding that had this been properly highlighted, the  current dispute over Islamic shari'ah and Islamic penalties  would not have existed.    Asked how sincere is the call for national dialogue, Huwaydi  said: "The call for dialogue is a noble call and Muslims  advocate dialogue. The broader the dialogue the more serious it  is, since it will include all national forces that have a  presence in the Egyptian community." But Huwaydi cautions that  the dialogue may be a "trap" for the people or an opportunity  for the people to merely "vent" their misgivings. Huwaydi added  that although he sides with the Islamic movement, this does not  mean that he supports violence, noting that the problem of  violence is a "political, economic, and Islamic problem." He  pointed out: "The Islamists are ready for dialogue despite the  campaign of defamation waged against them in the press," adding:  "We want the Islamic current to acquire its due legitimacy; we  want Islam to enter various walks of life." He said the  Islamists are a "genuine" party in this country and are entitled  "to express themselves and their Islamic identity, which  everybody must defend." He also said: "Supposing some factions  of the Islamic trend have made mistakes, this does not justify  the attack against the Islamic movement and Islam. The Islamic  trend is not a group of angels, but human beings who react to  reality." He noted that communists and secularists have various  factions and asked: So why blame the Islamists for this?    Asked how violence could be handled, Huwaydi pointed out  that  the current "security" method is unsuitable. He asked that  instead of branding these youngsters gangs of outlaws, "Why  don't we say there is a political and economic problem that has  resulted in frustration leading to despair?" Huwaydi added that  some people are trying to widen the differences between the  Islamists and the government.    Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali attributed the disarray in the  Islamic world to the Islamic nation having abandoned the "book  the teachings of which it was ordered to comply with." In harsh  remarks against secularists, al-Ghazali claimed: "Cockroaches  are filling the press with their secularism and lies." He adds:  "These frogs and cockroaches, from the secular and leftist  writers, are the reason for the defeat of this nation; they  represent the ugly face of the Islamic nation. They try to  undermine the Islamic trend and even side with those hostile to  Islam."    Dr. 'Imarah said that the Islamic movement is standing alone  to defend the Islamic nation in the face of the "Israeli enemy."  Asked why Islamists declined to take part in debates at the Book  Fair, he answered: "How could we have a debate about the  Islamic movement with 'Adil Imam and Samihah Ayyub [Egyptian  artists]? They asked us to debate with them."</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Tory health plans under attack over talks with US group The government's health plans yesterday came under renewed attack after Mr Tom Sackville, the health minister, said he had held discussions with a US healthcare group on the provision of services to the National Health Service. Labour accused the government of attempting to sell off the NHS to companies 'seeking to escape (US president) Bill Clinton's efforts at cost-cutting'. Conservative backbenchers also expressed deep unease at the unpopular decisions which the government may be forced to take by rising health costs. Mr Sackville said he had held discussions in June with Salick Healthcare, which was 'one of a number of American companies who are trying to gain a foothold in the UK'. However, he insisted that he had told the company, which specialises in diagnostic and therapeutic services for patients suffering from cancer and kidney failure, that his department was 'neutral' in any decisions taken by NHS trusts or fund-holding general practitioners to buy services from external sources. He said he merely encouraged the health service to co-operate with the private sector. The Department of Health denied any health service hospitals had been put on sale. It said: 'The NHS is not for sale, and neither are any NHS hospitals.' US healthcare companies are active in the UK, with the Boston-based Healthcare International recently opening a 260-bed private hospital in Clydebank, Scotland, aimed mainly at overseas patients. But they have not bought existing NHS hospitals. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the US companies were 'seeking to soak the British taxpayer with the aid and approval of government ministers'. He added: 'We must have become a soft touch for easy profits in health care if the Americans are seeking to escape Bill Clinton's efforts at cost-cutting and increased efficiency.' A senior member of the Tory backbench 1922 committee said the debate underlined the problem of rising healthcare costs. 'No one seriously wants a US-style healthcare system. But if the government can't afford to pay, it will increasingly be forced to take up other options, some of which may be very unpopular.' Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said: 'This will send shivers down the spine of those who feel the NHS is moving towards a capitalist system. The US involvement creates a special horror because of the persistent stories of American healthcare excluded from those of limited income.' Care volunteers 'ignored', Page 6</p>

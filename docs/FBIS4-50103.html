			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 11 (XINHUA) -- UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali today urged the international community to  try to find a political solution to the Bosnian conflict before  UN peace-keeping troops are withdrawn from the area.    The UN chief made the appeal in a meeting with French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur here today.    French President Francois Mitterrand and Minister of Foreign  Affairs Alain Juppe have recently been considering the  withdrawal of the 6,000 troops France has stationed in Bosnia.    The United Nations has deployed some 45,000 soldiers in the  former Yugoslavia, 14,000 of whom are in Bosnia.    Butrus-Ghali also expressed the hope that the 11 French  volunteers who have been detained by the Bosnian Serbs on  charges of smuggling weapons for the Bosnian army will be freed  as soon as possible through negotiations.    Balladur said today that the French government wants the  volunteers to be released unconditionally.    Butrus-Ghali intends to discuss the issue with his chief  advisers on Thursday and with the "group of contact" composed of  the foreign ministers of the U.S., France, Britain and Russia in  Geneva on Friday in an effort to find a political solution to  the Bosnian conflict.</p>

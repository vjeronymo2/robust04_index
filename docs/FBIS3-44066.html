This was in spite of the  moratorium declared by its parent body, the Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC], last week, to which APLA and its high command  had complied.    "It has been and it remains the PAC position that this issue  is a matter that must be settled between APLA and the South  African security forces, mainly the SA Defence Force and  Police," said a statement.    "We wish to warn that failure to reach an agreement on a  mutual cessation of hostilities could automatically mean a total  collapse of the moratorium.    "However, as long as the moratorium remains in place any  statement to the media challenging it will not be representative  of the APLA position."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis described  President Glavkos Kliridhis' decision to resign if the UN  Security Council continues discussion of the confidence-building  measures, as a strictly personal choice. President Kliridhis,  the spokesman said, weighed the developments very seriously  before reaching this decision and decided if resigning from the  presidency would make the future of Cypriot Hellenism easier, he  would not hesitate to do so. Responding to a question, the  government spokesman said that if the president resigns, he  would not seek the presidency again. Kasoulidhis also said that  if President Kliridhis resigns and calls for new elections, the  elections would be a popular mandate on a specific issue.    Kasoulidhis also said that there has been no reaction from  the United States or Britain to the letter that President  Kliridhis sent to President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister John  Major. The spokesman refused to reveal the contents of the  letter, saying the letter was confidential.</p>

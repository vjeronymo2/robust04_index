			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (26): Buzzwords explained - Marketing Databases Bureau, turnkey: A bureau usually provides use of one software package on a particular machine, usually a mainframe. In database marketing applications, the bureau usually acts as 'caretaker' to the data for the customer. Turnkey packages provide a 'bundle' of software and hardware from the same supplier, usually with an element of tailoring to a basic offering. CATI - Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing, also CAPI, Computer Aided Programmed Interviewing: The technique by which answers to market research questions are programmed directly into the database to improve accuracy and speed of collection. De-duplication: This is the technique by which name and address data, (the basis of all database marketing), is 'cleaned' for use. Duplication usually occurs at data collection because of the variety of abbreviations and styles used by people when filling in forms. For instance, J S Smith Esq, John Smith, Mr J Smith, all used in different circumstances for the same person. PAF - postal address files. These are the Royal Mail's codes which, used on letters, identify the address as one of a few houses int he area. These speed delivery for the mail, ensure accuracy, and are now the basis for a number of 'profiling' systems on a wide variety of computer hosts. These cross-reference the postcodes with demographic data to define the likely socio-economic class and other char acteristics of an addressee. PAF contains 1.6m postcodes and 24m addresses. SIC - Standard Industry Code: This is a code that segments companies by the areas in which they operate. It is usually included in profiling databases, (as held on CD-ROM) along with company data such as address, phone, senior management, bankers, auditors, business description, parent/subsidiary details, financial statements, growth rates,business ratios and industry comparatives. Soundex, 'fuzzy match': A fuzzy match is one where the details of a particular record can be pulled out from the database without an exact match. The key 'smith' used to search names with a fuzzy match would be enabled to extract similar sounding (soundex) items spelt differently: Smyth, Smythe Smithers.</p>

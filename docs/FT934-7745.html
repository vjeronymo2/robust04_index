			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (10): Disliked but 'still necessary' - A look at the financial rand, the investor's torment NEXT TO violence, political instability and concerns about ANC economic policy, what investors like least about South Africa is exchange control. In fact, outside of a few lawyers and tax advisers, it is difficult to find anyone who likes it. Even the Reserve Bank, which administers the policies, never tires of saying that it would like to rid the country of this albatross. Earlier this month Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented: 'An early end to the dual-currency system is not in the offing.' He also noted, that 'the financial rand will remain as long as the domestic political and social instability . . . continues'. With South Africa facing an election on April 27, 1994, and the immediate aftermath a great unknown, few believe the financial rand will go before the end of 1994 at the earliest. While most exchange control regulations are aimed at stopping people taking money out of the country, it is the dual-currency system that most affects foreign investors. In terms of this system South Africa has a commercial rand, the official rate of exchange used for all normal commercial activities; and the financial rand which is basically a currency for non-resident investment or disinvestment. The aim of the financial rand is to protect the country's foreign reserves. The system is designed to ensure that when foreigners repatriate their investments, they do not do so at the expense of the country's reserves. Foreign investors need to pay close attention to the financial rand as it is a highly volatile currency easily capable of negating any gains made in, say, an investment in equities or bonds. Indeed, many foreigners suffered heavy losses in the second half of 1992 when the currency weakened dramatically. Although turnover in the market has increased, it remains a very thin market, skittish and difficult to predict, and easily moved by a large order. Financial rands are created when a non-resident sells his South African investment to a South African. He must be paid in rand, which rands are then deposited in his account with an approved dealer in foreign exchange (all of the main banks). Once in his account, the rand becomes financial rand which can only be sold by the non-resident owner to another non-resident against payment in a foreign currency. By definition, residents can never own, and hence sell, financial rand (though, in very limited circumstances, locals may use financial rand for offshore transactions). Residents are also not allowed to buy financial rand as this would require foreign exchange - precisely what the system is supposed to avoid. In considering when the financial rand might be abolished, it must be remembered that this subject is inextricably bound up with South Africa's debt standstill arrangements. These were introduced in 1985 and covered the country's repayable foreign debt (then Dollars 13.6bn, now down to Dollars 5bn in terms of a final agreement reached last September). The government's position was that it would have been unfair if a restriction had been placed on repayment of foreign debt at that time without also restricting the repatriation of foreign investment in South African equities. This would have led to undesirable arbitrage transactions  -hence the introduction of the financial rand. Likewise, it is most unlikely that the Reserve Bank will scrap the financial rand system while foreign creditors remain subject to a debt repayment scheme. The latest scheme is due to run for eight years. For South Africa to consider ending it before then - that is, repaying the affected debt - will either require that it manages to roll over a substantial amount of the Dollars 5bn still subject to the scheme, or that its reserves grow to the position where it feels they can withstand a sizeable capital outflow. Current levels, which cover only about six weeks of imports, are a long way short of the required level. The best indicator that the financial rand is ripe for abolition will be when the discount to commercial rand, currently about 20 per cent, either narrows considerably or disappears altogether. This is unlikely before South Africa is seen to have achieved a stable and sustainable transition.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / People: Dominique Damon to head Alusuisse Two years ago, the Zurich newspapers grumbled bitterly when CS Holding, Credit Suisse's parent, and the Ciba-Geigy drugs group, decamped to London for their annual results press conferences, writes Ian Rodger. No question about it, they were betraying the homeland. But last Tuesday, when Alusuisse announced that the chief of its packaging division, Dominique Damon, 47, was to become chief operating officer and the designated successor to Theodor Tschopp as chief executive, nary a xenophobic or misogynist squeak could be heard. Damon is a French national, does not speak German well, does not speak Schwyzerduutsch at all and does not stay at home every day to look after her daughter. Nevertheless, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, the daily oracle of true Swiss values, observed graciously that it was 'pleasing to see that a woman will be the head of an important Swiss industrial group in the near future'. The quietly spoken Damon has gradually won over the Swiss with something they appreciate - the ability to make lots of money. In her hyperactive six-year career at Alusuisse, she has transformed a motley bunch of packaging businesses with annual sales of SFr744m into a highly profitable world class operation whose sales this year will exceed SFr2.5bn. Last year's SwFr1.1bn takeover of the big Canadian packaging group Lawson Mardon was her ninth acquisition, but she is proud of having kept the management teams largely intact at all of them. A career executive with long experience at the Danone and Carnaud groups in France, she believes her most important role is convincing her managers and employees to believe in their company's goals. Otherwise, she says, the risk grows that they will sabotage them. So she spends a lot of time travelling. Indeed, the joke at Alusuisse is that Damon, for all her success and influence, has no office. She smilingly agrees, saying she keeps up with the paperwork 'by telephone and fax'. Perhaps she is on to something.</p>

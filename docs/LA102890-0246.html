			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WALNUT;  </P> <P> COUNCIL REJECTS SITE PLANS  </P> <P> One of the prime undeveloped commercial sites in Walnut will remain vacant  until the owners of the property, Shea Business Properties and Wesmac Inc.,  come up with a development plan more acceptable to the city.  </P> <P> The City Council enacted a 45-day moratorium Wednesday on any development of  the approximately 37-acre site, which is near the intersection of Grand Avenue  and Valley Boulevard. Walnut-based Shea owns 31.2 acres of the site, and Wesmac  of Diamond Bar owns the remaining 5.9 acres.  </P> <P> The council backed a staff report that concluded that the developers'  proposals, including carwashes and auto repair shops, don't fit into the  upscale commercial center envisioned by the city for the site.  </P></p>

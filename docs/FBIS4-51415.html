			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC]  on Thursday [26 May] applauded the passage by a U.S. Senate  Committee of a resolution supporting Taiwan's bid to join the  United Nations.    Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, in reply to an  interpellation on the floor of the legislative chamber, said he  felt gratified upon hearing the news and that he hopes the  Clinton administration will pay heed to the resolution.    The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday  unanimously passed a resolution saying that the United Nations  should be encouraged to permit Taiwan to participate fully in UN  activities.    The resolution, introduced by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), now  goes to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate.  It also calls for cabinet-level exchanges between Taipei and  Washington, which it said would be in the interests of both  countries.    Taiwan in September made its first attempt to re-join the  United Nations since it was forced out in 1971. Seven Latin  American countries submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali in September, requesting that the ROC's UN  bid be put on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly, but the  request was voted down.    Chien told the lawmakers that a similar proposal will be  submitted to the 49th General Assembly, but that a different  strategy would be used -- namely, trying to get countries from  different parts of the world to support the bid.    However, he also admitted that getting Taiwan admitted to  the  United Nations would not be an easy task, considering that the  ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with only 29  countries. He said the ROC could easier gain admission if it  had diplomatic links with between 45 and 55 countries.</p>

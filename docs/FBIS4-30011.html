			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Go For Policy Coordination Without Panicking </F> Over '99 Yen' per Dollar; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 Jun  Morning Edition]    [Text] The yen's value against the dollar has reached the  double-digit level for the first time in history. In the New  York currency market on 21 June, the yen, for a while, was  posted at 99 yen per dollar. This condition, however, is due  less to an appreciation of the yen than to a depreciation of the  dollar. The important thing at this time is not to panic at the  historic rate of "99 yen" but to prepare conditions for policy  coordinatioin to stop the dollar's sharp fall.    The dollar's decline against the mark and the yen is thought  to have been caused by the outflow of funds invested in stocks  and bonds as a result of growing investor apprehension that  improved economic conditions in the United States might bring  inflation to the U.S. market. Another reason is that the  economies of Japan and Germany are starting to recover and the  gap between them and the U.S. economy is narrowing.    The problem is that the dollar's fall will aggravate the  market's apprehension about inflation, possibly raising U.S.  long-term interest rates and inviting a fall in stock prices.  The triple declines in value of the dollar, stocks, and bonds  would impact the world, putting upward pressure on long-term  interest rates throughout the world. It would also lead to  falling stock prices. Such a chain of movements in the market  would be amplified through a sharply expanded use of such  financial derivatives (financially generated products) as  futures and options.    Triggered by the fall in the dollar's value, long-term  interest rates in various nations have already started to rise,  and it is feared that this condition will have the effect of  pouring cold water on the recent mood of the world economy  recovering. Particularly with the yen reached an historic level,  Japan's exporting companies are taking the situation seriously  as one that will hurt their profits.    We must deal with this high yen problem in a calm manner.  While the U.S. market's apprehension about inflation has caused  the decline of the dollar, what has dominated the world economy  since the end of the Cold War is disinflation as a result of  low-wage nations' entry in the world market. Excesses in the  market will correct themselves sooner or later.    In the government, top leaders met in a hurry to discuss  measures to deal with the yen's appreciation, but this is  something we have seen done time and again. What is important  now is not responding to the yen's appreciation from the  perspective of our own country but agreeing on policy  coordination from a global perspective to stop the dollar's  sharp fall.    Coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market has  a  temporary effect in taming turbulence in the market, but it has  its limitations.    It is now time for the major countries to embark on policy  cooperation that will go as far as reforming the structures of  their economies. The July summit of the advanced nations (the  Naples summit) will provide a good opportunity to do that.    The U.S. monetary authorities should flexibly manage their  monetary policy to dispel apprehensions about inflation and do  all they can to reduce the budget deficits. Germany should  continue easing its monetary restrictions and revive its  economy. Japan, for its part, should reduce is current-account  surpluses by pushing to expand its domestic demand.    Japan should front-load the reduction of income taxes and  keep the rise in the consumption tax only to the level of  revenue neutrality. Deregulation should not be in name only,  and it must be an effective one. Assuming a strong yen, it will  also necessay to turn the country's export-dependent industrial  structure into one led by domestic demand assuming.    The current-account surplus is expanding now; it is not  clear  if the economic recovery is on the right track yet. It will not  serve the purpose of policy coordiantion if Japan is thinking  about seeking deductible tax increases [sashihiki zozei] or  taking the substance out of deregulation. We certainly hope the  government will take actions and not fall into a situation of  panicking once again as a result of failing to do anything this  time.</p>

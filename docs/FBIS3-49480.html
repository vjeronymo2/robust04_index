			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 7 -- The Sejm (lower house) approved on  Friday a new copyright law conforming with Western standards.  The House voted 408 to one against, with one abstention.    The law covers all types of intellectual property, including  video material and computer programmes, and extends copyright  protection to distributors and broadcasters. The law also  extends copyright to 50 years after the death of the initiator.    The law also envisages the creation of a fund for promotion  of creative output, supervised by the minister of culture, and  financed by payments from material out of copyright, and from a  3-percent levy on audio- and video-cassettes. It is also  intended that new organisations will be established to oversee  the copyright regulations.    Under the proposals, prison sentences of 2-5 years may be  imposed for copyright infringements. Heavy fines, and  confiscation of illegal copying equipment, are also envisaged.  The law now passes to the Senate for approval. When all  legislative hurdles have been negotiated, the new law will  become effective after three months.</p>

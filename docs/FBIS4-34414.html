			<p>BFN     [Text] Asked by the Chamber of Deputies' Comptrollers  Commission about financial aid, FOGADE [Fund for the Guarantee  of Bank Deposits] President Norys Aguirre reported that with the  payment of up to 4 million bolivares, announced by Finance  Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, 90 percent of the depositors of  the eight banks in which the government intervened will be able  to get their money back. She also said that FOGADE will request  the implementation, as soon as possible, of the Public Credit  Law, approved by the Congress for 4.15 million bolivares and  earmarked to cover the payment of up to 4 million bolivares  announced by Minister Sosa. Aguirre said she never agreed with  the system that has been applied to handle financial aid.    [Begin Aguirre recording] Our dependency on the financial  system must be taken into consideration. Venezuela cannot be  left without payment instruments. The procedure to attend to  this insolvency crisis will be completely different from the one  used in the case of the eight banks. You have asked me a number  of times whether I agree with this system. I cannot. Financial  aid and the insolvency crisis must be handled by the Banking  Superintendency, which must detect the trouble. Once the  insolvency problem is detected, the state, because the  insolvency crisis is general, will take over and assume control  of the bank's shares. The liabilities, however, which are the  bank's most valuable possession, will remain intact. [end  recording]    Finally, she explained that the government is not dealing  with 2 million people affected by the intervention but with 2  million banking instruments, which does not necessarily involve  2 million people because one single person may possess several  instruments.</p>

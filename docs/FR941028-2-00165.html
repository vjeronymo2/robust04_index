			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second level of the hierarchy is the use of engineering controls to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei. These controls include (a) direct source control using local exhaust ventilation, (b) controlling direction of airflow to prevent contamination of air in areas adjacent to the infectious source, (c) diluting and removing contaminated air via general ventilation, and (d) air cleaning via air filtration or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first two levels of the hierarchy minimize the number of areas in the health-care facility where exposure to infectious TB may occur, and they reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk in those few areas where exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  can still occur (e.g., rooms in which patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated and treatment rooms in which cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures are performed on such patients). Because persons entering such rooms may be exposed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the third level of the hierarchy is the use of personal respiratory protective equipment in these and certain other situations in which the risk for infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  may be relatively higher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific measures to reduce the risk for transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Assigning to specific persons in the health-care facility the supervisory responsibility for designing, implementing, evaluating, and maintaining the TB infection-control program (Section II.A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Conducting a risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in all areas of the health-care facility, developing a written TB infection-control program based on the risk assessment, and periodically repeating the risk assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB infection-control program (Section II.B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Developing, implementing, and enforcing policies and protocols to ensure early identification, diagnostic evaluation, and effective treatment of patients who may have infectious TB (Section II.C; Suppl. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Providing prompt triage for and appropriate management of patients in the outpatient setting who may have infectious TB (Section II.D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Promptly initiating and maintaining TB isolation for persons who may have infectious TB and who are admitted to the inpatient setting (Section II.E; Suppl. 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Effectively planning arrangements for discharge (Section II.E).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Developing, installing, maintaining, and evaluating ventilation and other engineering controls to reduce the potential for airborne exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Section II.F; Suppl. 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Developing, implementing, maintaining, and evaluating a respiratory protection program (Section II.G; Suppl. 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Using precautions while performing cough-inducing procedures (Section II.H; Suppl. 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Educating and training HCWs about TB, effective methods for preventing transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and the benefits of medical screening programs (Section II.I).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Developing and implementing a program for routine periodic counseling and screening of HCWs for active TB and latent TB infection (Section II.J; Suppl. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Promptly evaluating possible episodes of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  transmission in health-care facilities, including PPD skin-test conversions among HCWs, epidemiologically associated cases among HCWs or patients, and contacts of patients or HCWs who have TB and who were not promptly identified and isolated (Section II.K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Coordinating activities with the local public health department, emphasizing reporting, and ensuring adequate discharge follow-up and the continuation and completion of therapy (Section II.L).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II.

Risk Assessment, Development of the TB Infection-Control Plan, and Periodic Reassessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Risk Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;TB infection-control measures for each health-care facility should be based on a careful assessment of the risk for transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in that particular setting. The first step in developing the TB infection-control program should be to conduct a baseline risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in each area and occupational group in the facility (Table 1, Figure 1). Appropriate infection-control interventions can then be developed on the basis of actual risk. Risk assessments should be performed for all inpatient and outpatient settings (e.g., medical and dental offices).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Regardless of risk level, the management of patients with known or suspected infectious TB should not vary. However, the index of suspicion for infectious TB among patients, the frequency of HCW PPD skin testing, the number of TB isolation rooms, and other factors will depend on whether the risk for transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the facility, area, or occupational group is high, intermediate, low, very low, or minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The risk assessment should be conducted by a qualified person or group of persons (e.g., hospital epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, pulmonary disease specialists, infection-control practitioners, health-care administrators, occupational health personnel, engineers, HCWs, or local public health personnel).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The risk assessment should be conducted for the entire facility and for specific areas within the facility (e.g., medical, TB, pulmonary, or HIV wards; HIV, infectious disease, or pulmonary clinics; and emergency departments or other areas where TB patients might receive care or where cough-inducing procedures are performed). This should include both inpatient and outpatient areas. In addition, risk assessments should be conducted for groups of HCWs who work throughout the facility rather than in a specific area (e.g., respiratory therapists; bronchoscopists; environmental services, dietary, and maintenance personnel; and students, interns, residents, and fellows).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Classification of risk for a facility, for a specific area, and for a specific occupational group should be based on (a) the profile of TB in the community; (b) the number of infectious TB patients admitted to the area or ward, or the estimated number of infectious TB patients to whom HCWs in an occupational group may be exposed; and (c) the results of analysis of HCW PPD test conversions (where applicable) and possible person-to-person transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Figure 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All TB infection-control programs should include periodic reassessments of risk. The frequency of repeat risk assessments should be based on the results of the most recent risk assessment (Table 2, Figure 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The ``minimal-risk'' category applies only to an entire facility. A ``minimal-risk'' facility does not admit TB patients to inpatient or outpatient areas and is not located in a community with TB (i.e., counties or communities in which TB cases have not been reported during the previous year). Thus, there is essentially no risk for exposure to TB patients in the facility. This category may also apply to many outpatient settings (e.g., many medical and dental offices).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

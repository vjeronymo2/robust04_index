			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 160.077&hyph;15&blank;Deflation Mechanism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)(3) This paragraph will be changed by replacing the word ``can'' with ``may'' to clarify that the oral inflation mechanism is an option in meeting the deflation mechanism requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 160.077&hyph;19&blank;Inflated Flotation Stability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(3)(iii) The Coast Guard proposes to approve hybrid PFD's as Types I, II, III, and V for adult and youth sizes, and Type I and Type II for small child sizes for use on recreational boats, commercial vessels, or both if they perform accordingly and the applicable requirements are met. A requirement to test for Type I performance in accordance with the requirements specified under &sect;160.176&hyph;13(d)(2) will be added if the device is to be so labeled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the suggested approval Types and sizes, the requirements for inflated flotation stability need revision. The proposed method of change is to adopt revisions to Underwriters Laboratories ``Standard for Safety'', UL 1517, section 15 ``Inflated Flotation Stability Test.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this paragraph will be revised by specifying that the reference vest used must be the appropriate size device. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 160.077&hyph;21&blank;Righting Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)(4)(ii) As presently written in UL 1517, section S8, one inflation chamber must be deflated during the Righting Action Test. The Coast Guard proposes to change to one chamber the current requirement for two chambers on commercial hybrid PFD's to reduce costs. This paragraph will be changed to clarify that one inflation chamber has to be deflated only if there is more than one chamber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 160.077&hyph;23&blank;Facilities and Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g)(3)(x) This section requires manufacturers to provide the required test equipment for performance of production tests. However, the equipment necessary to perform the required Inflation Chamber Materials production tests was not included in the interim final rule. This paragraph will be added to require manufacturers to provide the Inflation Chamber Materials production test equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 160.077&hyph;29&blank;Manual <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f)(5) As discussed in &sect;&sect;160.077&hyph;13(d) and 160.077&hyph;17(b)(9) under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``Changes to make use of hybrids more attractive'', <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the USCG proposes to drop the requirement for commercial hybrid PFDs to be provided with an approved PFD light at the time of manufacture. Former paragraph (c) of this section is redesignated (f) and this paragraph will be added to include a requirement that the manual must specify the recommended type of PFD light to be used if a light is not provided by the manufacturer. Paragraph references in this section are revised to agree with the other revisions to this section discussed earlier in this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 160.077&hyph;30&blank;Temporary Marking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(1) The original paragraph (b) will be renumbered (b)(1) in conjunction with the addition of paragraph (b)(2) to this section. This paragraph defines the temporary marking requirements when a hybrid PFD is sold in a ready-to-use condition. Paragraph (b)(2) is proposed to define the temporary marking requirements when a hybrid PFD is not sold in a ready-to-use condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(2) Section 160.077&hyph;30(a)(1) (i) and (ii) will be amended to clarify that a total of three inflation medium cartridges and three water sensitive elements must be provided with the hybrid device when sold. Additionally, a cartridge and element may or may not be pre-loaded at the time of sale. This paragraph will be added to refer to the marking requirement specified in &sect;160.077&hyph;15(c)(3)(ii) which will be used when the device is sold without either an inflation medium cartridge, or a water sensitive element or both pre-loaded into the inflation mechanism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 160.077&hyph;33&blank;Approval Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(3)(vi) This section will be redesignated &sect;160.077&hyph;6 and this paragraph is proposed to indicate that the intended size range of wearers must be included with the application package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reorganization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of the sections within the subpart have been moved to be consistent with the organization of the inflatable lifejacket regulation at 46 CFR 160.176. The new organization with the old section numbers where applicable, and the section titles, is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

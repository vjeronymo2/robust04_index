			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by President Violeta Chamorro on the </F> fourth anniversary of her inauguration in Managua on 25 April --  read by announcer]    [Text] Despite our limited resources, we have implemented  many projects that have allowed us to consolidate peace and set  the foundations for the economic and social reactivation we are  truly and firmly promoting. Within this reactivation program  and at a cost of 70 million cordobas, this morning I inaugurated  an important public works project, which is being conducted with  assistance from the Central American Economic Integration Bank  and with funds from my government, and which is allowing us to  restore 57 km of roadway from Nejapa to Istapa and to build 13  bridges.    Today, a loan for 145 million cordobas to be used in the  cattle sector was signed with the Central American Economic  Integration Bank in my presence. It will be used to help our  cattle breeders rejuvenate their farms and improve cattle  production. We also signed, with the same bank, another loan  for 24 million cordobas to be assigned to the program that is to  revitalize small- and medium-sized industries. This is a very  important project for me because I want to give my support to  the women who run those small firms and are very good  administrators.    Today, in celebrating the fourth anniversary of my  inauguration as president of all Nicaraguans, I have come to  this palace, which is located in front of our dear Republic  Plaza, the ruins of our old cathedral, and in front of Managua  Lake, to confirm that progress and production financing must go  hand-in-hand with culture, which is one of the main objectives  of my government program.    Four years ago, I made a commitment to further peace,  freedom, and economic and social progress. I also made a  commitment to improve the Nicaraguan people's cultural  development. In keeping with the goals of our cultural policy,  we are celebrating this special day by announcing the initiation  of the repair of the National Palace, which from now on will be  called the National Palace of Culture. It is a genuine example  of our arts and handicrafts, of our history and our struggles,  and it is a place where our musicians, poets, painters, and  sculptors can express themselves with entire freedom. I am  convinced that actions that support culture will make our  progress and development comprehensive. The repair of this  palace is part of the program to reconstruct the center of  Managua. We have managed to restore the ruins of the Grand  Hotel and have converted it into the Managua Cultural Center.  We are also going to rescue the old cathedral as part of this  program.    I want to take advantage of this opportunity to show my  appreciation for the great help we have received from the  government and people of Japan, as well as from the United  National Development Program. They have helped us carry out  this important program.    All of you, my dear Nicaraguans, should help my government  in  its endeavors to continue to build, strengthen, and work in  order that together we can make Nicaragua an example of  democracy, peace, and progress for all its children. With the  help of God and the efforts of all, we will make this a reality.  Thank you.</p>

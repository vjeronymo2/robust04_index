			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS DAY  </P> <P> With the apparent increased racial divisiveness triggered by the establishment  of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, perhaps we should substitute a  celebration of an underlying integrating concept, instead of resorting to the  traditional practice of exalting personalities over ideas.  </P> <P> My nomination is to re-designate the King holiday as Civil Rights Day, a  concept deserving of universal support. In this way an opportunity would be  provided to honor all those who contributed to the advancement of civil rights,  including Dr. King.  </P> <P> GEORGE V. HALL  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

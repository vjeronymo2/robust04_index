			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MINISTERS OPPOSING GAMBLING PLAN  </P> <P> A proposal by former Hawthorne Mayor Guy Hocker to legalize gambling in the  city generated strong opposition this week when two Hawthorne ministers urged  the City Council to reject the idea.  </P> <P> Pastor Bruce Chamberlain of Hope Chapel, Hawthorne, and the Rev. Earl Thornton  of Del Aire Assembly of God Church told the council Monday that they oppose  gambling because it can lead to other problems, such as higher crime rates,  lower property values, and increases in gangs and graffiti.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Chamberlain said the Ministerial Assn. of Hawthorne and Lawndale  voted unanimously to oppose Hocker's plan.  </P> <P> At a council meeting last month, Hocker said gambling revenues could help the  city pay for a proposal by Police Chief Stephen Port to hire 40 police  officers.  </P> <P> After the two ministers spoke Monday night, Hocker urged the council to place a  measure on the ballot and allow voters to decide whether they want to legalize  gambling.  </P> <P> The City Council took no action on Hocker's proposal.  </P> <P> In 1938, the city passed three anti-gambling ordinances specifically  prohibiting draw poker and other forms of gambling.  </P></p>

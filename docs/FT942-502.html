			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Presidents of divided Korea to hold talks The presidents of North and South Korea are to meet next month for the first time since the Korean peninsula was divided after liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of the second world war. Agreement to hold the summit in Pyongyang from July 25 to 27 was reached yesterday during a tense eight-hour meeting of officials at Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone between the two countries. Presidents Kim Young-sam and Kim Il-sung monitored the negotiations on television from Seoul and Pyongyang. The possibility of a summit was opened up earlier this month during the visit to Seoul and Pyongyang of former US president Jimmy Carter. The breakthroughs which followed the Carter visit - US and North Korean officials are also to hold talks in Geneva from July 8 - have put into abeyance US-led efforts to impose United Nations sanctions on North Korea in retaliation for its refusal to permit full international inspections of its nuclear facilities. Mr Carter received a package of proposals from Mr Kim Il-sung for resolving the dispute, including his acceptance of a proposal from the South Korean president for a summit. After the announcement of the summit between north and south, a Seoul government spokesman said: 'This is a historic agreement. It will go a long way towards resolving pending issues . . . and easing tensions on the peninsula. The precious fruit we reaped today will serve as a foundation for . . . ending the history of national division and moving towards peaceful reunification.' Mr Lee Hong-koo, the south's chief delegate, said: 'Both presidents have moved to make a political decision to ease tension on the Korean peninsula at a time when the peninsula remains an exception. The rest of the world is trying to seek co-operation rather than confrontation.' For the North, Radio Pyongyang said the two sides would seek an atmosphere 'favourable to reconciliation, unity, trust and understanding'.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Jackson recovers to Pounds 236,000 Jackson Group, the Ipswich-based construction and industrial services company, returned to the black in the first half of 1993, prompting a bullish statement from Mr Frank Jackson, chairman. He said the outcome - losses last time of Pounds 987,000, restated for FRS 3, were turned into profits of Pounds 236,000 pre-tax - was 'encouraging' and reflected rationalisation measures taken and 'broadly maintained' turnover of Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 27.8m). Earnings per 10p share emerged at 0.7p (losses of 4.6p); the interim dividend is again 0.5p.</p>

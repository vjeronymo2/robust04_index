			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / People: The Weir Group The family ties which have bound the descendants of George and James Weir to Scotland's biggest and most successful engineering company for more than a century are slowly unravelling. George Weir, a 52-year-old great grandson, has retired after 20 years on The Weir Group board, leaving his brother, Viscount Weir, 59, as the sole remaining member of the family involved in the business. Viscount Weir has been chairman since 1972, apart from a brief gap in the early 1980s when the company ran into financial problems and Lord Tombs took the chair.</p>

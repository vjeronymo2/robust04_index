			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Appointments: Branching out NatWest, one of Britain's top two high street banks, has completed the rejuvenation of its top management team with Martin Gray's promotion to head its core UK branch banking operation. The 45-year-old Gray was the logical candidate to become chief executive, UK branch business (UKBB), since he served as general manager UK branch business under Derek Wanless who was chief executive financial services (UKFS). Just over a fortnight ago Wanless, aged 43, was made one of two new deputy group chief executives and given considerable new responsibilities. Under the latest reorganisation groups, UKFS disappears and although Gray takes on the main responsibilities, several subsidiaries, such as Lombard North Central, Ulster Bank and Isle of Man Bank, become part of Bernard Horn's international business portfolio. Trevor Blackler, aged 52, currently deputy general manager UKBB, becomes general manager, operations of Gray's new empire. Like Wanless, Gray is a Northerner. He was born in Leeds and started his career there. However, unlike Wanless, who got a first class honours degree from Cambridge, Gray has worked his way up from counter clerk. ***** S G WARBURG has picked David Rowland, chairman and chief executive of Sedgwick Group, Europe's biggest insurance broker, to join the board as a non-executive. Rowland, 58, fills a gap after both Tony Salomon, former president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Gualtharus (Hugh) Kraijenhoff, supervisory board chairman of Akzo, retired last year. Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, describes Rowland as 'a businessman of very considerable distinction in a very relevant area of business'. Rowland, who has just produced the radical report on reform at Lloyd's, was at the helm of Stewart Wrightson for seven years until shortly after it merged with Willis Faber in 1987. He has known Warburg well for many years; S G Warburg's then parent, Mercury Securities, held a 29 per cent stake in Stewart Wrightson until 1985. Other non-executive appointments have been announced: Brian Firmin at GREYFRIARS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. ***** Hal Jackman resigns from REFUGE Group following his appointment as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. ***** Martinus van der Vorm at TIP EUROPE; Charles Gonszor has resigned. ***** Baroness Denton resigns from TRIPLEX LLOYD. ***** Eric Kinder, chairman of Smith &amp; Nephew, as chairman of BRUNNER MOND HOLDINGS, bought by Pentrice from ICI last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Durban Jan 12 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] said on Wednesday it was baffled by the Transitional  Executive Council's [TEC] claim that the level of violence had  dropped in kwaZulu since more members of the SA Police's [SAP]  Internal Stability Division [ISD] were sent there last month,  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports.    IFP spokesman Senzo Mfayela said joint policing by the  kwaZulu police and the South African Police was the result of  bilateral understandings between the two forces -- not as a  result of TEC instructions.    He said there had been no visible decline in violence in  flashpoint areas policed exclusively by the SAP in Natal.    Mr Mfayela said it was ironic that the TEC favoured the  intervention of the ISD in kwaZulu areas where the ANC [African  National Congress] had little following, while the ANC  simultaneously campaigned for the ISD's withdrawal from areas it  believed it had a chance of dominating.</p>

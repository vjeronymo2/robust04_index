			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: BOGOTA;  </P> <P> HOPEFUL INAUGURATION  </P> <P> The one-time campaign manager for a Colombian presidential candidate killed by  drug traffickers takes over the office himself today, hoping to enlist more  foreign aid in the continuing war against drugs.  </P> <P> Cesar Gaviria of the Liberal Party assumes the presidency at a time when drug  lords have declared a cease-fire, several leftist guerrilla groups are talking  peace, and there is an agreement to reform Colombia's 104-year-old  constitution.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, violence continues. Last week police said they found three Uzi  submachine guns that were part of a terrorist plan to disrupt the inauguration.  Gaviria was campaign manager for Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, an anti-drug crusader  assassinated last year.  </P></p>

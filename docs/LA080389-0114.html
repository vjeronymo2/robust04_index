			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GABOR WINS ACCESS TO OFFICER'S FILE  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills Police Department was ordered Wednesday to turn over to Zsa  Zsa Gabor any misconduct complaints in the personnel file of the officer who  arrested her after a traffic stop confrontation.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin issued the order releasing paper work on  Officer Paul Kramer, variously described by Gabor as an "empty-headed, gorgeous  man" and a "sadist."  </P> <P> Kramer arrested Gabor June 14 in her Rolls-Royce Corniche after he pulled her  over for a registration violation. She drove off and, after the officer got her  to stop two blocks later, she allegedly slapped him in the face.  </P> <P> Gabor faces misdemeanor charges of committing a battery on a police officer,  disobeying a police officer's orders, driving with an expired license, having  an open container of alcohol in her car and carrying an expired registration.  </P> <P> Gabor's attorneys contend the officer has a history of harassment against  celebrities and that Gabor was only using self-defense.  </P> <P> The pretrial hearing Wednesday before Rubin lacked the glitz of Gabor's  arraignment last month, when she arrived in a silver limousine. Gabor did not  attend this hearing. Her trial was scheduled for Sept. 11.  </P></p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Observer: Wholly it So, God remains a man. At least, that's how the Church of England has decided to regard the deity. The church's general synod has pronounced that, despite the onward march of political correctness, the correct mode of address is 'He'. Texts for the church's next prayer book will not refer to God as 'Mother' or 'She'. The synod has thus endorsed a report from its Liturgical Commission, which argued God should be addressed 'in terms borrowed from our human understanding of fatherhood and monarchy'. Still, novelty creeps on apace. The commission also said new forms of prayers, avoiding gender references, could be introduced. So sometimes God will be It, after all.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public sector must also 'take medicine' of pay restraint Sir, I was incensed at the reaction of public sector workers when it was announced that, to help government spending, there would be an effective pay freeze in the year 1994-95 ('Unions warn of 'chaos' over public pay stance', September 15). Why do they consider themselves immune from the recession which the rest of society has had to suffer? I am a director of a small service company in Devon. Our livelihood depends on the prosperity of other companies and the recession has hit this area very hard - but we are not alone in that. To help protect the company our employees and directors have made many sacrifices, involving no pay increases since January 1991, 5 per cent pay reduction, redundancies, suspended pension contributions, etc. I think my company, along with thousands of others around the country, has by necessity taken the necessary steps to cut costs. I therefore pose the question - why should the public sector be exempt? After all, we pay their wages out of our reduced means. I also believe the average salaries shown in your article compare very favourably with the private sector. Public sector workers should take their medicine like the rest of us and stop whingeing. Think positive, think productivity, think cost-saving, think of others. A W Buncher, 21 North View Avenue, Bideford, Devon EX39 3LJ</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Labor Day baseball struck out by dispute It was the US Labor Day holiday yesterday, and President Bill Clinton had weighty matters of labour relations on his mind - the country's baseball strike, now into its fourth week. 'I might say, on this Labor Day, there's still time for them to go back and finish the best baseball season in 50 years, and I hope they will,' said Mr Clinton, taking time off from his holiday on Martha's Vineyard for a speech at a Maine shipyard. Mr Robert Reich, the president's top labour official, was also on the case. He has offered to mediate between the two sides, but said yesterday there was no point in mediating unless both sides actually wanted to negotiate. For the first time since Labor Day was established 100 years ago, there was no major league baseball to watch on the holiday that traditionally marks the end of summer. Hopes are fading fast that the deadlock between the players and the team owners might be broken in time for at least a truncated championship play-off. The owners insist the players must agree to a salary cap. The players insist there can be no serious negotiation until the idea of a salary cap has been dropped. On a Labor Day when New York City's trade unions could not muster enough support for their traditional parade, the doggedness of the tiny baseball players' union in pursuing its eighth strike in 23 years stands in sharp contrast to the weakness of the rest of the union movement. Today only 11 per cent of the private sector workforce is represented by a trade union, with only the government employees' unions showing anything like the bargaining tenacity of the professional sports unions. That may have something to do with the fact that most baseball players, whose average salary now tops Dollars 1m, have put something aside for a rainy day, and can also supplement their income while they are on strike by selling autographs or through advertising endorsements. At least for sofa sports fans the American Football season has started.</p>

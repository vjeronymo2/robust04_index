			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- New China has brought  about historic liberation for Chinese women, says the white  paper entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women" which is  published by the Information Office of the State Council here  today.    The white paper says New China effected fundamental  emancipation for women in all aspects of political, economic,  cultural, social and family life. This represented a  significant transformation in the history of contemporary social  development that China can be proud of and an important  contribution made by the Chinese revolution to the worldwide  movement for women's liberation, points out the white paper.    In semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, women were for a  long time kept at the bottom of society, notes the white paper.  It was not until the first half of this century that the  Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to wage a  profound national democratic revolution and launched a  large-scale women's emancipation movement which resulted in the  historic liberation of Chinese women.    The white paper says the impact of the several millennia of  oppression and devastation imposed by the feudal patriarchal  system on Chinese women was exceptionally grave. In political,  economic, cultural, social and family life, women were  considered inferior to men. They possessed no political rights  and were completely excluded from social and political life.  They were economically dependent and were robbed of property  and inheritance rights and possessed no independent source of  income. They had no personal dignity or independent status, and  were deprived of the right to receive an education and take part  in social activities, according to the white paper.    Ever since its birth, says the white paper, the Chinese  Communist Party has made the achievement of female emancipation  and equality between men and women one of its goals.    For the women of China, the founding of the People's  Republic  of China ended the thousands of years of feudal oppression and  enslavement and the history of being trampled and bullied by  foreign aggressors, stresses the white paper. With an entirely  new face, they have stood up and become the masters of New China  like all citizens of the country, the white paper says.    In 1949, the common program, adopted by the First Plenary  Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference which had the nature of a provisional constitution,  solemnly declared the toppling of the feudal system which  fettered women and stated that women enjoyed equal rights with  men in the political, economic, cultural and educational fields  and in other aspects of social life. Thus a new era in the  emancipation of Chinese women was ushered in, the white paper  points out.    The Electoral Law of the People's Republic of China  promulgated in 1953 also clearly stipulated that women enjoy the  same rights to vote and stand for election as men.    Along with the economic rehabilitation and development,  there  appeared a nationwide upsurge of women stepping out of their  homes to take part in social production. This thoroughly  transformed the situation in which women were excluded from  social productive labor, providing them with an independent  source of income, says the white paper.    According to the white paper, in old China, as many as 90  percent of women were illiterate. In order to raise the  cultural level of the entire nation, New China launched a  planned campaign to gradually wipe out illiteracy. Millions of  women attended the campaign.    The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China,  promulgated in 1950, was the first statute enacted by New China.  It declared the abolition of the feudal marriage system  characterized by arranged and forced marriage, male superiority  and female inferiority, and disregard for the interests of  children.    Implementation of the new system was marked by freedom for  both men and women in marriage, monogamy, sexual equality and  protection of the legitimate rights of women and children. This  signified a profound revolution in the patterns of wedded and  family life that had prevailed for several thousand years in  Chinese society, states the white paper.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Refugees Occupy `Radioactive' Villages"] </F>   [Text] Under the onslaught of refugees from Central Asia  the Gomel Oblast authorities have been obliged to "open up"  villages clogged with radioactive weeds.    Having learned of the opportunity for acquiring housing,  refugees are rushing here from the CIS trouble spots. They come  knowing that the local inhabitants are subject to enforced or  voluntary removal. They are fleeing poverty and dobule-dyed  nationalism and, they say, are choosing the lesser of two evils.  In all of last year alone, about 2,300 people including over 700  children arrived in radioactive Gomel Oblast. This year the  oblast took in a further 300 refugees.</p>

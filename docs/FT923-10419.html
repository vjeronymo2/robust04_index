			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BT The headline drop of 38 per cent in BT's first-quarter earnings per share is not quite as alarming as it looks. First, there is a large one-off exceptional charge on disposals. Second, the full-year charge to the profit and loss account for redundancies will be around Pounds 450m this year compared with just Pounds 30m last. The actual cash cost will be nearer Pounds 600m. But shedding more than 33,000 jobs on an average salary of close to Pounds 20,000 will save nearly Pounds 600m a year as well. In the context of a company making Pounds 3bn before tax that is fairly material. Thereafter, BT will be engaged in a slightly unnerving process of reducing employment each year in an attempt to match the downward pressure on prices imposed by the regulator. If inflation stays low, the promised regulatory formula of RPI minus 7.5 per cent should ensure this is a losing battle. But the company expects to keep cutting jobs for another three or four years. By then, with luck, competition in the domestic market will have increased to the point where regulation can be less demanding. For the investor, the central point is what all that means for the dividend. The headline earnings figure this year could show a fall of as much as 10 per cent. Adjusting for exceptionals and redundancy costs, however, the underlying figure could show a slight rise. This might be taken to justify a corresponding rise in the dividend. BT's historic yield premium to the market average is 10 per cent. It has been higher in the recent past but, as the market is doubtless starting to reflect, the lack of clarity over its dividend outlook is scarcely any greater than for the corporate sector as a whole.</p>

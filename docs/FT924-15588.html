			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Books: Ethnic, but not ethic THE FALL OF YUGOSLAVIA: THE THIRD BALKAN WAR by Misha Glenny Penguin Pounds 5.99, 194 pages THE war in the former Yugoslavia is not easy to explain. It is about a conflict between the rural and the urban population. It is about unsettled business between Croats and Serbs predating 1918. It is about different cultures imbued with weak traditions of obligation and contract. It is about societies seeking revenge because each believe they are the greatest victims of the past. Misha Glenny, the BBC's Central European correspondent, has tackled all these issues with sympathy and insight. In doing so, I hope the underlying theme of his excellent book has not been smothered. The communist system imposed on Yugoslavia by the western powers and the late President Tito extolled the virtues of 'Brotherhood and Unity' at the cost of brutally suppressing national feeling. This meant that Tito prevented any discussion about the past, in particular the complex relationship between Serbs and Croats. Glenny rightly argues that, until these two ethnic groups come to terms with each other, there will be no peace in the Balkan peninsula. The indefatigable United Nations peacekeepers in Croatia will testify to that. The collapse of the communist system in turn exposed the schizophrenic nature of these two ethnic groups, each claiming to be more modern and European than each other, yet each doggedly locked in the past. Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, a former communist and army general, vowed to make his independent Croatia the 'most democratic' of all democracies. Yet he never made room in the republic for the large ethnic Serb community, which was forced to sign a loyalty oath and treated as second-class citizens. This uncompromising attitude radicalised the Serbs in Krajina, south-west Croatia, and in eastern Croatia. Tudjman's vanity and authoritarianism, backed by Germany and some other western countries, played into the hands of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. Unlike Tudjman, who used power to create a nationalist state, Milosevic used nationalism (and the federal army) to pursue power. This meant that the Serbian leader could manipulate the Serbs in Croatia as long as they were of use to him. He will do the same in Bosnia until Bosnia's Serbs, led by Radovan Karadzic, have served their purpose. It is difficult to know what Milosevic wants from his war with Croatia and Bosnia. As Glenny shows, his quest for a greater Serbia has already led to the violent destruction of Yugoslavia and Serbia's isolation. But one thing is certain from this cruel war: sons and daughters from mixed marriages are today forced to choose their ethnic background if they want rights to citizenship and property. That is the tragedy of Bosnia, once a rich ethnic patchwork, and the fate of the people of Sarajevo, one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the Balkans. If Tudjman and Milosevic have forced the people of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia to choose sides, Glenny believes Macedonia, Kosovo and the rest of the Balkan peninsula could follow suit. I would go one stage further. The war in Yugoslavia has sharpened ethnic divisions to such an extent that the Karadzics, Milosevics and Tudjmans will only be content once they have created ethnically-pure, but intolerant and thuggish states. Indifference has led western governments into condoning this trend, which will have consequences for the eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. In consequence of the use of ethnic criteria to create new states in the post-communist world, the prospects of these states creating civil societies based on the rule of law are as grim as the prospects of peace and democracy in the region.</p>

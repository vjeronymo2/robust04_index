			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Rules on casino adverts may ease The government is considering relaxing the strict rules governing advertising by casinos and betting shops, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said yesterday. Pressure on the government to ease gaming restrictions has increased with the advent of the National Lottery, tickets for which go on sale on Monday. Competing operators, including the football pools, have won concessions after complaints that the lottery is not subject to the same tight rules on advertising, promotion and operation as other forms of gambling. Mr Howard told the British Casino Association that the government was looking at all gaming controls as part of its effort to cut down on unnecessary red tape, but it would not press ahead with any reforms without proper public consultation. Mr Howard added that the complete ban on advertising for casinos was 'ripe for review'. He said: 'There are legitimate concerns that unrestricted advertising would send out the wrong signal to those who might be vulnerable to excessive gaming. 'But I think there is a case for your being allowed to give out information about yourselves, the location and facilities offered.' Similar restrictions in other areas, such as betting shops, would be examined, he added. Betting shops are allowed to advertise on posters, but are not allowed to state their location. The Ladbroke Group, which operates betting shops and casinos, said it welcomed any move towards deregulation but added that it would also like betting shops to be allowed to have slot machine games.</p>

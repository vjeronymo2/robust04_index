			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Inaugural speech by President Theodore Sindikubgabo; place </F> and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] Your Excellency, the deputy speaker of the  National Assembly; Your Excellencies, the ministers of the  government that has just been sworn in; Your Excellency, deputy  and secretary of the National Assembly; heads of the parties  that are part of the government present here, and guests, my  speech is short because in my speech to all Rwandans last night,  I explained the reason for today [as heard]. I will also repeat  it today or tomorrow and explain at length why we have taken the  present important decision.    At present, I would like to thank those who make up the  government which has just been set up for agreeing to assist us  at a time when our country needs the strength of its children.  I would also like to thank and give support to our country's  forces who acted swiftly after the death of president and did  their utmost, as always, to preserve the peace of Rwandans,  especially here in the capital. We also thank the Army for the  good decision it made with the assistance of some civilian  leaders and set up a Crisis Committee. We shall inform you  about those who make it up.    The Crisis Committee is made up of some high-ranking Army  officers and other officials. The Crisis Committee's role was  very crucial. Without it, so that it could take important  measures to follow what was happening in Kigali after the  enemies [word indistinct], we could have found ourselves in more  trouble in relation to peace. I ask those present to help me to  thank the members of the Crisis Committee.    As I told you at the beginning of my speech, the day before  yesterday, the members of the Crisis Committee, after consulting  the five parties which are in the transitional government took  an important and useful step that was in keeping with the  Constitution before the broad-based transition started after the  Arusha agreement. Basing themselves on the Constitution,  especially Article 42, they asked me to implement the content of  the article. I found that what they asked me to do was correct.  I agreed to this because I believed that all of you, the Army,  ministers and all Rwandans who love their country supported me.    The deputy speaker of the National Assembly said it best: We  have not violated any article. We are within the law. We  consulted our legal experts on the legality of the decision.  They said that we were right. Some who do not understand the  Constitution enough will surely criticize our action. However,  that is normal. The decision we made was to extricate the  country from the constitutional vacancy. There was no longer  any leadership. After the killing of the president, the prime  minister and some of the ministers, there was no longer a  leadership. Before the setting up of the broad-based  transitional institutions, there was a need for courageous  Rwandans to make a decision like the one we made.    The prime minister has just summarized his government's  program. He has asked some of his ministers to act fast to  explain to Rwandans why we made the decision and reflect this in  their work.    I said that my speech would be brief. I will have enough  time to explain to Rwandans and foreigners, to explain our  program for the next few months so that we may lead our country  up to the setting up of broad-based transitional institutions as  contained in the Arusha agreement, without any obstacles in our  path, while our people are in peace.

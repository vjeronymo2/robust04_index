			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent fuelled by rate cut optimism Hopes for Europe-wide rate cuts coloured yesterday's trading, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT pulled itself out of a downward path, helped by short-covering ahead of tomorrow's futures expiry and some speculation that the Bundesbank might reduce interest rates at its meeting today. However, most market commentators do not expect a move given the growth in M3. The DAX index rose 20.54 to 2,134.38, almost recouping all of Tuesday's decline. In the post-bourse the Ibex index was little changed, while turnover settled at DM10bn. The chemical sector came into play helped by a positive note issued recently by Nomura which forecast that BASF, Hoechst, Bayer and Degussa were 'due a big year' given that 'restructuring measures, which have been executed, mean that profits are highly leveraged to any improvements in volumes or prices'. Nomura added that the chemicals sector had started to outperform the DAX, but still lagged by an average of 5 per cent a year. Degussa rose DM13.50 to DM464.00, also helped by a buy note from Bank Julius Bar, BASF by DM5.10 to DM294.70, Hoechst by DM3.80 to DM304.30 and Bayer by DM6.70 to DM356.50. ZURICH returned to record territory, helped by the strength of the dollar against the D-mark, the inflation outlook after good figures from Basle on Tuesday and the potential for lower interest rates. The SMI index rose 11.9 to 3,049.4. Industrials led the gains. Sulzer certificates added SFr43 to SFr925 on the view that the issue had become cheap relative to the market. Swissair, also viewed as a recent laggard, put on SFr20 to SFr860. SMH continued to pick up after recent declines, adding SFr19 to SFr1,025 on renewed speculation about its Swatch car project. However, the company declined to comment on press speculation about a potential partner. AMSTERDAM moved ahead helped by strength in neighbouring markets, with the AEX index rising 2.17 to 427.33. KLM went up over 5 per cent, gaining Fl 2.30 to Fl 46.30, in reaction to news that it will maintain its 20 per cent stake in the ordinary share capital of Northwest Airlines through a share swap. Unexpectedly strong trade was also seen in Philips whose shares improved Fl 1.80 or 4 per cent to Fl 46.60. PARIS captured the mood with a day's gain of 1.2 per cent in the CAC-40, closing 27.33 higher at 2,274.67. Turnover was steady at FFr5bn. St Gobain went against the trend, down FFr6 at FFr624, ahead of preliminary 1993 figures today. Elf Aquitaine continued firm, up FFr10 to FFr418, with reports that Suez was seeking a stake in the oil group. MILAN was little changed after the firm trend of the previous two sessions and the Comit index registered a dip of just 0.05 to 617.35.8. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, noted that with general elections set for March 27, market volatility was likely to increase as the implications of the current deep divisions of the centre-right became clearer. He recommended using dips in the index to increase market weightings with a view to ending the election period with a 1.2 percentage point overweight position in Italy of 8.7 per cent in a European, ex-UK portfolio. Industrials were in demand on hopes that they would lead recovery. CIR put on L49 to L1,920 and Fiat added L39 to L4,439 in spite of an eight hour strike against job cuts. MADRID sprinted to a record close with investment funds playing a central role in pushing the market higher. The general index added 4.87 or 1.4 per cent to 343.23 in volume of Pta47bn. STOCKHOLM resumed its rally and the Affarsvarlden index rose 14.4 to a record 1,559.5. Volvo B bucked the trend as profits were taken after their recent strong performance and ahead of the special shareholders's meeting later in the day. The shares finished SKr8 lower at SKr657, after a day's low of SKr638. COPENHAGEN reacted modestly to the central bank's cut in interest rates, the KFX index up 0.99 to 116.16 in turnover of DKr1.6bn. The bank cut key rates by 0.25 percentage points to 5.75 per cent - the tenth reduction in five months. ATHENS lost some 2 per cent as investors took profits after the market's steady upward rise in recent sessions. The general index closed down 24.48 at 1,170.10.

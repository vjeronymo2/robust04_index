			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Property revival 'losing steam': Housing market offers little cheer THE REVIVAL in the housing market, an important component in restoring consumer confidence, appeared to lose steam over the past three months, a survey by Halifax building society showed yesterday. Price rises petered out and the society's estate agents said poor business in August continued into September. Only two regions recorded a rise in prices over the third quarter of 1992, while nationally prices were 2 per cent down. The quarterly data contrasts with last week's monthly figures from Halifax, the UK's largest mortgage lender, which showed the first increase in September since January 1991. 'The general improvement in regional house prices reported in the second quarter has not been sustained in the latest quarter with average prices either falling or growing more slowly,' the society said. 'The underlying regional picture of annual price inflation remains weak.' Reports from estate agents in Halifax's network indicate generally modest levels of activity over the summer months. As expected, the holiday month of August was quiet. 'Furthermore, this appears to have continued into the last month of the quarter, with most agents describing September as 'poorer than anticipated'.' Housebuilders have also been concerned that the normal seasonal pick-up after the end of the school summer holidays has not been as strong as they had been expecting. Most are continuing to offer sales incentives to draw buyers into the market. The main problem, according to Halifax, is a shortage of new sellers with people reluctant to move because of the uncertain economic outlook. Only Northern Ireland recorded a significant rise in prices in the latest quarter, with an increase of 7.5 per cent. However, the small number of house sales in the province makes the margin for error in compiling figures greater than for other regions.</p>

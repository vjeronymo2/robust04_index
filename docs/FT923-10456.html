			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Imbert connects crime with poverty SIR Peter Imbert, Metro-politain Police commissioner, yesterday linked an increase in crime to poverty and social deprivation. Presenting his last annual report before he retires, Sir Peter said: 'The notion that there is a link between crime and social deprivation is a compelling one . . . there is a need to offer hope to those most disadvantaged if we are to see any reduction in crime levels.' Sir Peter said that crime in London had increased 11 per cent last year, largely because the capital was seen as the natural mecca for criminals and most of the country's wealth was concentrated there. His report paints a stark picture of crime in the capital that last year included 75 per cent of the country's drugs market and 75 per cent of frauds. In addition, London, with a seventh of the country's population, last year suffered more than 50 per cent of all armed robberies, and 20 per cent of all murders and rapes. Sir Peter's report discloses that a total of 945,000 crimes were committed, a rise of 11 per cent, and 113,000 people were arrested, 3 per cent down on the previous year. The 41,000 casualties on London's roads left 369 dead, 7,000 seriously injured and 34,000 slightly hurt. In addition, 184,000 people and vehicles were searched resulting in 25,000 arrests.</p>

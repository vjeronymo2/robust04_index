			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Ramos may sanction newN-plants PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos has ordered energy officials to study the possibility of building new nuclear plants to help solve a power crisis, Reuter reports from Manila. The Philippines has mothballed its first nuclear plant, built by Westinghouse Electric in 1985, calling it unsafe. The US company has denied the charge, and a Philippine claim for compensation is pending before an international arbitration panel in Geneva. Mr Ramos last night directed Mr Delfin Lazaro, the energy secretary, to study the feasibility of putting up new nuclear plants, a presidential palace statement said. Mr Ramos said he did not oppose setting up nuclear power plants as long as they were in places where they posed no danger to people, but the 600 MW Bataan plant built by Westinghouse would probably be operated as a coal- or oil-fired power project. Manila and the rest of Luzon island suffer some eight hours of power cuts daily because of low generating capacity, worsened by the frequent breakdown of ageing power plants.</p>

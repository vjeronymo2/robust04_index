			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Yevstafyev, chief of FIS arms </F> control and proliferation department, by Vladimir Orlov:  "Nuclear Redivision"; date and place not specified]    [Text] Russia may soon find itself encircled by nuclear  states. There is a growing threat of local conflicts with the  use of weapons of mass destruction on our southern flanks. This  seemingly pessimistic prognosis is shared today by many military  practicians.    Does the Russian leadership have information about real  nuclear arsenals and programmes of "threshold" and  "near-threshold" countries located on Russia's perimeter? This  is the subject of an interview MN correspondent Vladimir Orlov  had with Gennady Yevstafyev, head of the department of control  over arms and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  of Russia's External Intelligence Service.    MOSCOW NEWS correspondent: Do you share concern  about the "new nuclear encirclement of Russia?"    Gennady Yevstafyev: Only partially. Let me remind  you that a conference for the prolongation of the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is scheduled to take place  in 1995. I hope that it will be possible by that time to broaden  by joint efforts the composition of the Treaty's participants  and to prevent the appearance of new nuclear states, even in  intermediary or temporary terms. But there still remain places  in the world which give me cause for real worry...    Correspondent: Can you give examples? Name at  least three of them, in the order of diminishing danger.    Gennady Yevstafyev: First, North Korea; second,  Israel; third, India and Pakistan.    [Boxed item]  <H5>  MOSCOW NEWS File </H5>   According to the date of Western research centres  Israel may possess nearly 200 nuclear warheads or material for  their immediate manufacture; India has 60 nuclear warheads and  Pakistan 15. North Korea is capable of manufacturing one or two  nuclear bombs. Iran will be able to have nuclear weapons of its  own after eight or ten years.    [end boxed item]    Correspondent: Let us consider North Korea.    Gennady Yevstafyev: We agree with the common  conclusion of international experts. The leadership of North  Korea has been trying for a long time to develop nuclear,  chemical and biological weapons. Delivery vehicles have also  been developed successfully. One of the stages of this  development were the recent tests of the improved Scud missile.    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been actively  pursuing an applied military programme in the nuclear sphere  which is today, in the opinion of the External Intelligence  Service, at an advanced state of development.    Correspondent: Why then has North Korea "frozen"  its military nuclear programme?    Gennady Yevstafyev: There are two reasons. The  first one is international pressure. The second is financial and  technical difficulties within North Korea which is unable to  carry the burden of the immense cost of the development of  weapons of mass destruction.    I know that it is understood in Washington that the DPRK  [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] has not yet developed  such weapons, and has not yet made real combat devices. Nor does  Hans Blix, Director-General of the IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency], believe that the DPRK has nuclear weapons. The  External Intelligence Service also believes that the DPRK's  nuclear programme is now in a frozen state and that in certain  conditions the North Koreans are evidently prepared to stop it  altogether and open it fully to inspection. Pyongyang's recent  consent to have "gas-graphite" reactors replaced with  light-water ones is a sign that the DPRK is ready to suspend  part of its military programmes.    But there is one point which requires explanation. The fact  that the DPRK decided to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation  Treaty and sought to prevent control by IAEA inspectors has  caused another knot to develop. Pyongyang has held up its  withdrawal from the Treaty as a result of the dialogue between  the DPRK and the United States and the monolithic position of  the world community. But the interruption in IAEA control  activity is not a point in favour of the North Korean leadership.    I would further like to note that the process of the  transfer  of power in the DPRK is still being completed. In these  conditions everyone should display special caution and  discretion in order not to fuel the situation which is already  tense as it is.    The Americans display admirable firmness when they state to  Pyongyang the view of the world community on the unacceptability  of deviating from international treaties. At the same time it is  no secret that the United States is fulfilling its own national  foreign-policy interests in the region. The DPRK, on its part,  plays for its own high stakes in its "nuclear dialogue" with the  Americans. The conclusion follows that Russia, too, should  proceed for its own interests in the matter of ensuring security  in the Far East.    Correspondent: Israel is next on your list. It is  no secret that it unofficially possesses nuclear weapons as well  as advanced missile delivery vehicles...    Gennady Yevstafyev: Israelis themselves confirm  this with pleasure in informal talks. Nuclear material of weapon  purity is accumulated with the help of a heavy-water reactor and  an installation for processing irradiated fuel (they are not  controlled by IAEA). Their capacity is enough for manufacturing  nuclear material for 5-10 warheads a year. A reactor of 26  megawatt capacity was commissioned in 1963 with the help of  France and was modernized during the 70's. After its capacity  was increased to 75-150 megawatts the production of weapon  plutonium could have grown from 7-8 to 50 kilogrammes a year.  The installation for the processing of irradiated fuel was also  built with the help of a French firm. It can produce 15-40  kilogrammes of weapon plutonium a year.    In other words, Israel could have manufactured up to 20  warheads during the 70's-80's and now may possess as many as  200. These calculations can be corrected, of course, depending  on the specific technical conditions. The high scientific and  technological potential enables Israel to improve the designs of  nuclear weapons, for instance, to develop small-size versions as  well.    Correspondent: As far as I know Israel is now  capable also of producing chemical weapons of all types,  including nerve and blister agents and agents causing temporary  disability...    Gennady Yevstafyev: Yes, Israel has highly  developed chemical and petrochemical industries, qualified  specialists and stocks of raw materials. Frankly speaking, this  greatly complicates international processes of disarmament as a  whole. In particular, Arab states have not signed the convention  prohibiting chemical weapons and will evidently not sign it  until Israel's position in the military-nuclear sphere clarifies.    Correspondent: The third place mentioned by you is  Hindustan.    Gennady Yevstafyev: Let us begin with India. I  would assess its technological possibilities as being very high.  Though Pakistan's technical possibilities are somewhat lower  they are also quite high. Besides that, Pakistan has good  sources of financing, including foreign ones. About a year ago  the External Intelligence Service prepared an open report where  it pointed to Pakistan's possession of a nuclear potential.    Correspondent: But nuclear weapons are not the  whole issue. There is also the problem of the proliferation of  missile technologies.    Gennady Yevstafyev: The use of missile arms is  evidently an inseparable part of strategic and operational plans  in some countries. Among states which have made the greatest  progress in this direction are (besides industrially advanced  countries) Israel, Iran, Syria, India, Pakistan, the DPRK and  Brazil.    It is well known that there are legal loopholes that pave  the  way for acquisition by Third World countries of necessary  technical experience and technologies, such as the fulfilment of  subcontracts of Western aerospace firms, the purchase of their  shares, the setting up of joint or front companies, invitation  of foreign specialists, the training of probationers, etc. Add  to this the growth of industrial espionage. Incidentally the  special commission of the UN Security Council on Iraq revealed  the immense role which Western firms played illegally (or with  the blessing of their governments?) in the development of Iraq's  ramified missile complex.    But it is impermissible to deprive some countries of access  to peaceful technologies on the pretext of strengthening control  over missile technologies. Specialists (including those in the  External Intelligence Service) keep a careful watch over Iran's  missile intentions, including the direction of its purchases and  its interest in technologies. But the talk about "Iran's  strengthening" and "danger emanating from it" sometimes  camouflages the striving to deprive that country of access to  modern technologies for purposes of development of its peaceful  industrial potential.    Correspondent: The open report of the External  Intelligence Service published in 1993 says that about 100  countries now have an industrial base for making chemical  weapons.    Gennady Yevstafyev: While the situation with  nuclear weapons can be controlled (through combination of space  facilities with operational information), this is very difficult  to do where chemical weapons are concerned. It is believed that  the real requirement of chemical weapons amounts to only 100-200  tons even in a major and prolonged regional conflict. The stocks  of chemical weapons are in practice greater than these figures.  But it is practically impossible to detect 100 and even 500 tons  of hidden chemical weapons. Chemical compounds and agents can be  kept in containers smaller than an ordinary barrel.  <H5>  MOSCOW NEWS Commentary </H5>   It may be presumed that the highly placed Russian  intelligence officer has made public only part of the data at  his disposal. But the accents made by Gennady Yevstafyev show  that the world will soon face a new military-political situation.    This was ultimately the factor in Russia's official decision  in Nov '93 to reject the thesis of being the first not to use  nuclear weapons. The basic points of the military doctrine do  not preclude the use of nuclear weapons against states which  have not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty. What is more,  cases have been stipulated when Russia can use nuclear weapons  even against non-nuclear participants in the Treaty. In the  words of Valery Manilov, Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security  Council, this approach was a result of "painful revision" of  Russia's nuclear policy "at the highest level: each member of  the Security Council has expressed his view on this matter."    The members of Russia's Security Council believe that  nuclear  weapons are above all an important political factor for Russia.  "Having taken into account the growing number of countries which  conceal their nuclear weapons, Russia has reconsidered its  former approach," stated Valery Manilov.    Thus Russia's new nuclear concept is one of nuclear  deterrence. It looks like the military-political leadership of  Russia is increasingly less worried about the nuclear arsenals  of the United States. It is new nuclear countries that become  the subject of its closest attention.</p>

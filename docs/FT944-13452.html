			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Anheuser lifts income to record Anheuser-Busch cemented its position as the top brewer in the US during the third quarter, reporting record sales and profits as its Bud Light brand became the country's second most popular beer after Budweiser, the company's flagship brand. With Bud Light's ascendance to the number two spot among all beers - it overtook Miller Brewing's Miller Lite brand in the process - Anheuser-Busch became the market leader in the regular, light and non-alcohol beer categories. This performance helped push the company's share of the domestic beer market from 43.4 per cent to 44 per cent at the end of the quarter. The St Louis-based brewer said beer sales to wholesalers and retailers rose 2.7 per cent during the quarter, boosted by the successful debut this year of two new brands in the Budweiser family - Ice Draft and Ice Draft Light. The introduction of new, derivative labels like 'ice' beer is part of an attempt by leading brewers to compensate for the recent decline in the market share of big-name brands. Anheuser-Busch said overall sales climbed 3.9 per cent to Dollars 3.76bn, which helped lift net income to a record Dollars 329m, or Dollars 1.24 a share. In the same quarter a year ago, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars 75m due to restructuring and tax-related charges. Without the special items, third-quarter net income last year was Dollars 311m.</p>

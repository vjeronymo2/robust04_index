			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Italians get toughest budget since 1950's: Prime minister Giuliano Amato is weary but confident AFTER a gruelling all-night cabinet session approving Italy's 1993 budget, Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, announced with weary confidence: 'We have done what is necessary to return to the tracks from which we have been derailed.' His message was brief but clear. It is now up to parliament to approve as soon as possible the toughest budget Italy has faced since the 'economic miracle' began in the fifties. In theory parliament has till the end of the year to amend or endorse the budget. But with the lira under continued pressure floating outside the European Monetary System early approval of the budget will provide a key signal from Italy's fractured political parties that the country is willing to make a serious effort to tackle its huge public sector deficit. If unchecked the deficit could reach over 14 per cent of GDP within a year. Approval of the budget also conditions the timing of Italy's re-entry into the EMS which Prof Amato said yesterday he would like to see as soon as possible. The prime minister refrained from imposing a timetable on parliament yesterday; nor did he repeat his threat to resign if the budget is watered down. However, he has made this abundantly clear and one reason behind theseven hour cabinet session was an attempt to ensure the full loyalty of all the four parties in the government coalition. At several stages reports leaked out of threatened ministerial resignations but the cabinet has remained intact. The government appears confident, of being able to push the budget through and ride out a continuing wave of union protest. Today all public employers will observe a four-hour stoppage to protest cuts in pensions and the health service. The move to seek a special balance of payment loan from the EC, announced with the budget, could also prove a clever tactical move. Access to the loan is intended to provide a framework of external discipline, in the form of EC monitoring of the budget, which the government can invoke if parliament threatens to water down the proposed cuts. Despite strong pressure from several different lobbies, the budget has differed little from that outlined on September 17. The main aim is to raise L93,000bn in fresh revenues and spending cuts, so holding the public sector deficit down to L150,000bn, over 10.5 per cent of GDP. The proposals are framed against the background of reforms in the four areas  -pensions, the health service, the civil service and regional administration and local authorities. The savings will be cumulative over three to four years and will provide the basis of the government's strategy to reach a public sector deficit equivalent to 3.5 per cent of GDP by 1996. Ministers say that although the budget will not reduce the public sector deficit next year, it will hold it down in constant terms. There will be a primary surplus (net of interest payments of L200,000bn) of around L50,000bn. Interest payments themselves will be conditional on interest rate levels; but the authorities hope these can be reduced once the budget is approved. Each percentage point drop will save L15,000bn in a full year. All public sector spending is being frozen at 1992 levels, which on an inflation projection of 4.5 per cent for 1993, indicates a real decline. All ministries will be affected and some of the hardest bargaining in recent days has been over the sizeable health and education cuts. On the revenue side, much will depend upon whether the 1.5 percent projection for economic growth materialises. The budget, if implemented in its present form against a background of high interest rates, will force the economy into recession, according to several prominent economists. The shake-up of the state sector and declining industrial profits also suggests an increase in unemployment. To this end the government yesterday set aside L1,800bn over the next three years to aid employment schemes. The government also decided to introduce by decree with immediate effect a special tax of 7.5 per 1,000 lire on the net worth of all registered companies. This one-off measure which is expected to cost a group like Fiat some L670bn. It will raise a total of L6,000bn and also affects for the first time small companies. As a political measure there is also a tax on luxury goods like aircraft and expensive cars. In this way the government has done its best to try and spread the burden of sacrifice evenly.</p>

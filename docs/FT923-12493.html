			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: British Bloodstock cuts losses DESPITE more difficult trading conditions, pre-tax losses at the British Bloodstock Agency were reduced from Pounds 381,000 to Pounds 55,000 for the year ended March 31 1992, after a small trading profit was made in the second half. The pre-tax result however, was after including an exceptional property profit of Pounds 353,000 arising mainly from the sale of the Thormanby Stud. Also there was a Pounds 213,000 charge for further writing down the value of the stallion shares and increasing the provision for doubtful debts. Mr Michael Wates, chairman, said there were some positive signs that the industry may be approaching better times. He cited the reduction in betting tax which had allowed the Horserace Betting Levy Board to budget for an increase in prize money - the most important single factor needed to encourage owners back into racing. Mr Wates will be retiring after the annual meeting and will be succeeded by Mr Christo Philipson. At the same time, Mr Johnnie Lewis will become vice-chairman. Turnover for the year dipped from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 5.13m, while losses per share came at 3p (10.4p).</p>

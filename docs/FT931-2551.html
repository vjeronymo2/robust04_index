			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Japanese household spending falters GROWTH IN Japanese household spending slowed sharply last year, rising by just 0.4 per cent from the year before, according to a survey of almost 3,000 households published by the government's management and co-ordination agency. The survey found that spending when the head of the house is employed rose by 0.5 per cent compared with 3.3 per cent in 1988 and 0.9 per cent in 1991. Spending by other households, the self-employed, unemployed or pensioners, did not rise last year from 1991. The survey underlines the stagnation of Japanese consumer markets. Most of the increase in spending came from higher expenditure on utilities, such as gas and water, transport charges and education. Spending on food, clothing, furniture and domestic appliances fell. Consumer spending is likely to remain depressed for some time as the Japanese labour market deteriorates. Large manufacturing companies are announcing sweeping measures to cut costs by reducing staff over the next three years. The uncertainty this has created is encouraging more cautionary spending. The 1993 wage round, expected to come to a head in the next two weeks, is likely to deliver rises of less than 3 per cent. However, there are signs that some areas of industry may have reduced inventories of unsold products to the extent that they are starting a moderate increase in production. Steel production in February rose by 0.6 per cent from the year before, while the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association forecasts that vehicle sales this year will rise by 1.6 per cent to 6.91m units, up from the 6.8m units sold last year.</p>

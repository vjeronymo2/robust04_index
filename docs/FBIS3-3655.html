According to a draft development plan, the province will in  1994 increase the number of mobile telephones by ten times over  the previous year's total. Meanwhile, investment in the fixed  assets of the posts and telecommunications sector will rise by  65 percent.    When a 400-million-yuan project to improve mobile telephone  service is completed in August 1994, the capacity of the  province's mobile phone exchanges will be increased to 4,866  lines, ranking among the top four in China, official sources  said.    According to the plan, the province will install some  100,000  telephones throughout most of the rural areas by the end of this  year, with advanced telecommunications networks covering nearly  60 percent of its counties and regions.    In addition, the province has also planned to expand the  businesses of postal depositing, radio tracking, credit card  phones and emergency mail delivery.</p>

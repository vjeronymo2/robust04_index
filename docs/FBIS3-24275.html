			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pozdnyakov: "The `Fifth Channel' Has </F> Received the Right to Control City Radio Broadcasts"]    [Text] In her address on one of the broadcasts by St.  Petersburg Radio, Bella Kurkova, manager of the RGTRK  [All-Russian State Television and Radio Company] "St. Petersburg  Fifth Channel," considered the accusations of financial  violations made against the radio and television company  management as intrigues by the political opposition and  announced her intention "to fight them as a journalist is  supposed to." In her opinion, it is advantageous for the  national-communist opposition to undermine the authority of a  major radio and television company on the threshold of elections  to the City Assembly in order to "damage" the reputation of  political organizations close to the company's management.    According to some reports, after the statement by the  manager  of the RGTRK "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel" the deputy mayor of  St. Petersburg, Valeriy Malyshev, sent a directive to all rayon  administrations in the city to eliminate unauthorized  pre-election broadcasts by rayon radio stations and to  henceforth coordinate the content of pre-election broadcasts  with the management of the RGTRK "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel."  In Mr. Malyshev's opinion, the RGTRK is the only competent  broadcaster in the entire city, and all the other broadcasters  (even those registered as mass media) which use the city's radio  relay network should ask for the consent of its management in  order to prepare their broadcasts.    However, it is possible that the scandals involving the  RGTRK  "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel" stem not so much from political  reasons as commercial reasons. According to certain information,  the RGTRK management is studying the establishment of of a  joint-stock company (with the transfer to it of all buildings,  structures, and equipment of the RGTRK) with the participation  of the American company "TV and Radio St. Petersburg," which is  to receive 49 percent of the charter capital of the future AO  [joint-stock company], and one more TOO [limited liability  partnership], whose founders are not known at present. The  documents on establishment of the joint-stock company have been  passed by the head of the Press and Mass Media Committee of the  municipal administration, Dmitriy Mezentsev, and they have had  time to remain on the desk of Vladimir Sumeyko, the press  minister. Meanwhile, the radio and television company's  financial activity is attracting more and more interest from law  enforcement organs. The public prosecutor's office has asked for  the documents on its transactions with the "TV and Radio St.  Petersburg Commercial Center" Joint-Stock Company and the  "Nevskiy Glashatay" AO.</p>

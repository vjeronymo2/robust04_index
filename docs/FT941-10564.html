			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Lib Dem change on EU The Liberal Democrats have refocused their European strategy to maximise their chances of taking a number of Tory seats in the June European elections. The new policy, launched yesterday, emphasises decentralisation and diversity instead of what one senior Liberal Democrat called 'loose talk of a united states of Europe'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, denied that the party was watering down its commitment to a federal Europe but conceded that there had been 'a change of presentation'. The party has also gone back on its earlier pledge to reduce defence spending by 50 per cent - which if implemented could have led to the loss of jobs in the south-west - in light of the rise of nationalism and instability in eastern and central Europe. Mr Ashdown said: 'Anyone who looked around at the world in 1989 and said it was exactly the same in 1993 would be a fool. It's not true of the government and its not true of us.' The Liberal Democrats, who currently have no representation in the European Parliament, have earmarked between three and 10 of the UK's 81 seats that they believe are winnable. The party's campaign strategy is to use the European elections to expand throughout the south of England out of its stronghold in the south-west. The Liberal Democrats' new policy document on Europe, Making Europe Work For Us, refers only to the concept of a federal Europe in terms of decentralising power to enhance its appeal to Conservative voters.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Unwarranted Outbursts"] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Office in Islamabad has reacted strongly  to the unsavoury remarks made recently first by Indian  President. Dr Shankar Dyal Sharma, and later by the country's  Minister of State for External Affairs, Salman Khurshid. And  rightly so. The remarks focussed on the person of Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto, which apart from violating established  norms of diplomacy, reflect poorly on India's case on Kashmir.  What has actually agitated the minds of the Indian leadership,  causing the kind of outbursts as have more come out of Delhi, is  the Pakistani PM's expose of Indian atrocities in Kashmir before  the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva Even if President  Sharma's attack on Ms Bhutto's family problems is accepted at  face value. where is the connection between the PM's  differences with her brother and the Indian troops's gross human  rights violation against the people of Kashmir? if anything. Dr  Sharman's words are of an oppressor desperate to deflect world  opinion from the real issue. Salman Khurshid's diatribe against  the PM in which he likened her to a hot air balloon about to  seem to come from considerations of a different nature -- that  of a minority community member trying to prove his credetials in  the Congress which has brought him in primarily as a showpiece  of the so-called Indian secularism. Hence it is understandable  to see a carerist like him repeating parrot-like what his  benefactors want him to say.    But then he he is not the only Muslim who is willing to do  the dirty work for his masters. farooq Abdullah before him had  taken upon himself to do the same, though only to be humbled and  chased out of the Valley by the power of Kashmiri people's urge  for freedom. A test case for the Sheikh's position having any  relevance to the concerns of his people would be for him to go  back and try living in the Valley. Such a venture on his part  can easily demonstrate who the hot air balloons really are. It  is sad that toadies and frontmen of New Delhi have no sense of  shame in pleading a case that stands widely condemned not only  by Muslim nations but several of those countries as well which  had traditionally been supportive of India's stand vis-a-vis  Kashmir. People like the Sheikh and Khurshid may have an  uncontroliable desire to get public positions at any cost from  their paymasters but inpursaing these goals they can sve  themselves from a great deal of embarassment -- that is, if they  are capble of feeling embarassed -- by asking themselves if they  are capable of feeling embarassed -- by asking themselves if  they should be doing all this at the expense of the blood of  their fellow Muslims.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Conflict fails to survive translation Sir, James Morgan must have slipped a few pages in his dictionary or succumbed to a Freudian mis-translation in rendering 'Es ist doch kein Krieg' as 'It's not a war yet' ('As they say in Europe', September 26). He seems to have confused 'doch' with 'noch', which makes for an entirely dIfferent meaning. What the Bundesbank official is quoted as having said is precisely this in English: 'This isn't a war after all'. That translation is not nearly as spectacular as a statement and it certainly does not carry the connotation that the Bundesbank is 'spoiling for a fight', as the mis-translation suggests. Anecdotal evidence suggests to me that some people in Britain are positively heartened by war-like allusions to political or economic clashes with Germany. Such allusions no doubt serve as reminders of Britain's greatness and past superiority. The current Anglo-German 'war of words' is surely going to escalate now that some German officials appear to have hit upon a commemoration of the V2 rocket development as a riposte to the Harris memorial. A quality paper should perhaps take care not to support this war with the journalistic equivalent of dumdum ammo. Klaus D. Leith, Hauptstrasse 71, D-W5000 Cologne 50, Germany</p>

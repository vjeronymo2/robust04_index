			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Brittan calls for closer union SIR Leon Brittan, the EC Commissioner for external economic affairs, yesterday threw in his lot with the supporters of deeper European integration and issued a stirring call for a single European currency. In a speech likely to enrage British opponents of the Maastricht treaty, including many in his own Conservative party, Sir Leon dismissed the idea that the EC should develop into a loose, free-trade area extending into eastern Europe. 'Widening must not mean less deepening,' he told an audience of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Bonn, which included Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Sir Leon's speech offered a comprehensive view of the future development of the EC, and reflects a growing confidence inside the European Commission that Maastricht ratification is within reach. Turning to the post-Maastricht agenda, Sir Leon called for streamlining and modernising EC institutions such as the Commission and the European Parliament, as well as tighter policing of the EC's external frontiers to control illegal immigration, organised crime and drug trafficking. But the striking aspect of the speech was its enthusiasm for European monetary union and the 'undeniable' benefits of a single European currency to cover exchange rate risks and the commitment to stable prices and fiscal prudence. Hilary Barnes adds from Copenhagen: The European Community and Russia hope to agree the substance of a treaty on co-operation and trade in time for the EC summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22. Mr Brittan will visit Moscow for more talks next week.</p>

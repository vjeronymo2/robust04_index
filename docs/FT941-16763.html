			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Viacom and Blockbuster strike Dollars 8.4bn merger deal: Link-up raises cash offer for Paramount to Dollars 105 a share Viacom, the US cable television company, and Blockbuster Entertainment, the world's largest video retailer, last night announced an Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.6bn) merger agreement, together with a sharp increase in the cash being offered by Viacom in the five-month-old takeover battle for Paramount Communications. Viacom, with financial help from Blockbuster, increased its cash offer for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105 a share, or Dollars 6.5bn, topping the Dollars 92 a share cash offer on the table from rival QVC Network. However, Viacom also substantially reduced the value of the package of securities it is offering Paramount shareholders for the remaining 49.9 per cent of the company. The Viacom-Blockbuster merger will create a new US entertainment giant in its own right, while the higher cash offer for Paramount appears to give back to Viacom the initiative it lost to QVC last month. Analysts say Paramount is likely to be won by the bidder putting most cash on the table. Mr Barry Diller, chairman of QVC, and other companies which have backed his bid, must now decide whether to match or top Viacom's cash component. The Viacom-Blockbuster deal takes the form of an all-paper offer by Viacom, which will give Blockbuster investors 0.08 of a share of Viacom class A voting stock, 0.60615 of a share of non-voting B stock, and one 'variable common right' (a security whose value depends on the share price of Viacom) for each Blockbuster share. The deal values Blockbuster at about Dollars 8.4bn, based on the company's closing share price on Thursday of Dollars 29 7/8 . Blockbuster, which last September agreed to invest Dollars 600m in Viacom to finance its Paramount bid, has now given additional assistance by agreeing to invest Dollars 1.25bn in Viacom, provided it wins the Paramount battle, through the purchase of 23m shares of Viacom B stock at Dollars 55 a share. That compares to a closing price last night of Dollars 41, down Dollars 1 3/4 . The shares being bought by Blockbuster at an above-market price give Viacom the money to raise the cash element of its bid, while reducing by a similar amount the number of shares being offered to Paramount shareholders for 49.9 per cent of their stock. Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, will be chairman of the combined Viacom-Blockbuster group and will own 61 per cent of voting stock. Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, will be vice-chairman. The board of the new company will have six directors nominated by Viacom, three from Blockbuster and two from Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company which is also financially backing the Paramount bid. However, no new funds were provided yesterday by Nynex. Viacom is best known for its innovative cable television networks, such as the pop music channel MTV, while Blockbuster has been expanding beyond its video retailing roots into music retailing, the Hollywood film industry and theme parks.

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (4): Finding the right tools for the job - Case Computer-Aided Software Engineering or Computer-Aided Systems Engineering. The difference is important. The systems variety of Case is much more ambitious than the software variety. Software Case is the use of computers and software to help design and build other software. It is the latest step in the evolution of software, and, in one form or another, goes back to the beginnings of computing. Software Case includes high-level programming languages, such as those found with database management packages (sometimes referred to as 'fourth-generation languages'), and graphics-based flow-charting tools which can be used to design systems and programs. Software Case also includes tools to help define data used by the software. These data definitions are stored in a data dictionary or repository which can be accessed by every program in the system. Systems Case goes much further. It uses computer aids to model a business enterprise and build the information technology systems which are needed to support it. It includes the components of software Case which are used to generate applications systems. Systems Case is usually associated with a set of procedures called a system design methodology. These procedures ensure that all the important variables in a system are defined and that the design and construction process is kept under control. It is generally accepted that skilled practitioners of a formal 'methodology' are a pre-requisite for successful use of system Case tools. This does not necessarily hold true for software Case, however, where there have been useful productivity gains for programmers using software Case tools in isolation. The importance of Case - systems or software based - is that it brings engineering disciplines to the creation of information processing systems. Rigorous analysis of requirements, solid design principles and formal management control are as applicable to the creation of a computer system as they are to building a bridge. The similarities between large engineering projects and large-scale software development were first recognised in the 1960s when the term software engineering was first coined. At the same time, a concept known as the software 'life cycle' was identified. The software life cycle defines every phase of development of a software system from its initial conception through to its live application and subsequent maintenance. It was recognised that true software engineering would exercise complete control over the software life cycle. It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that it became practical to use computers to assist in software and systems development. Previously, computers were neither cheap nor powerful enough to do the job. But the emergence of powerful desktop workstations and personal computers, with graphics and networking features, have made it possible to equip systems designers and programmers with effective Case software tools. The first wave of Case software tools divided the work into two separate tasks. One set of tools was used to 'capture' the design requirements and perform the overall design task; and a second set of tools was used to generate the programs. This separation gave rise to the terms 'upper' Case - the design tools - and 'lower' Case, which referred to the program generators. Examples of upper Case tools include Intersolv's Exelerator, ProKit Workbench from McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems and Automate from LBMS. Examples of lower Case tools include Telon from Computer Associates and APS from Intersolv. Throughout the 1980s, various attempts were made to synthesise upper and lower Case tools into a single toolset which could offer a comprehensive approach to software design. Suppliers of the two different types of tools built links to each others' products to make what are called 'integrated' or 'I' Case development systems. Although these links made it easier to bring the design and construction phases of software development together, it was not completely successful. As a result, a new wave of integrated Case tools has come to the market in the past two years. These new toolsets provide a more coherent approach to Case and the control of the software life cycle. Many of them conform to an overall framework such as that specified by IBM in its Application Development (AD)/Cycle. AD/Cycle and other Case frameworks define how the various tools interact with each other. This means that customers can mix-and-match the tools they prefer from different suppliers. Other examples of integrated Case frameworks include Andersen Consulting's Foundation and DEC's Cohesion. International standards efforts are being made to provide a universal method of communication between Case tools and create open Case environments. The main standards effort - the Case Data Interchange Format (CDIF) - is being carried out by the Electronic Industries Association of the US, although European companies are also heavily involved.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Gutierrez Lopez] </F>   [Text] Acting Foreign Minister Jose Pallais asserted that  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon's announcement on  the possibility of taking Nicaragua to the International Court  of Justice at The Hague for its immigration controls in its  sovereign San Juan River area are "exaggerated."    Pallais, in statements made on the phone from his house in  Leon, said: "I do not see the need to resort to The Hague to  resolve matters which we, as friendly countries, can discuss  ourselves." The Nicaraguan Government informed Costa Rican  authorities that it "would implement immigration controls on  tourism activities carried out on that river" and would charge a  $5 fee for each person who used the river for tourism.  "Nicaragua is free to implement the measures it feels necessary  on its territory, and Costa Rica has to respect our decisions,"  Pallais underscored.    The Costa Rican president told the Costa Rican newspaper LA  REPUBLICA over the weekend that he did not agree with the  measures implemented by Nicaragua because the Canas-Jerez Treaty  established free transit on the San Juan without any type of  preference. Calderon requested his foreign minister, Bernd  Niehaus, to establish immediate negotiations with Nicaraguan  authorities. "If an agreement is not reached, the future Costa  Rican administration -- headed by Jose Figueres -- will have to  present the case at the International Court of Justice, although  we expect that will not be necessary," he said.    Pallais reaffirmed Nicaragua's right to safeguard its  sovereignty over the San Juan River as established in the  Canas-Jerez Treaty signed last century. He said the treaty  stipulates that Costa Ricans cannot navigate more than three  miles of the river, much less navigate up to Nicaragua Lake,  which is where Costa Ricans go in a clear violation of our  sovereignty.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Japan after the bubble There is a certain aptness about the fact that last week's plunge in the Tokyo equity market came just as most Japanese companies were holding their annual general meetings. When the Japanese asset bubble burst a couple of years ago, the immediate threat seemed to be to the Japanese financial system and the economy at large. But so far at least, the real sufferers have turned out to be neither Japanese banks nor consumers, but the big Japanese corporations. The damage is not so much to their balance sheets and profitability - though that is real enough - as to their self-regard. Previous crises, such as the oil shock of 1973 or the sharp rise in the yen in the mid-1980s, were external in origin and could be addressed accordingly. But the follies of the bubble years - the excess borrowing and investment, the scandals and corruption - were purely self-inflicted. As a result, corporate Japan is going through an unprecedented bout of self-examination. Companies have taken to asking themselves whether they have been misusing their resources, both human and financial. Perhaps they should pay less attention to market share and more to return on equity. Perhaps more of that return should be handed back to shareholders in the form of dividends. Perhaps the staff should work shorter hours and be paid by merit rather than seniority. Perhaps how the cake is divided between consumers, shareholders and employees needs fundamental review.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A senior Iranian official said that Washington has sent several messages to  Tehran in the hope of opening a dialogue. First Deputy Foreign Minister Ali  Mohammed Besharati, quoted by the English-language Tehran Times, said Iran has  not replied in writing to the messages, sent through the Swiss Embassy in  Tehran, but has sent an oral response. He said that Washington is trying to  remove obstacles to better relations between the two countries, which have not  had diplomatic ties since 1980. "The Bush Administration has realized mistakes  (were) made by the previous administrations," Besharati said.  </P></p>

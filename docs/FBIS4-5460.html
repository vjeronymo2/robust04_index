			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation at the Thai-Cambodian border is not a  cause for concern now. Troubles are created by groups of  bandits in uniforms who are stricken by poverty. The Thai Army  has no intention of causing trouble in Cambodia. Cambodia's  internal affairs should be solved among the Cambodian people.  Army Commander General Wimon Wongwanit was interviewed by  newsmen in Nakhon Ratchasima this morning:    [Begin Wimon recording] The situation now is not as serious  as in the past. Otherwise, more people would have fled into our  country again -- there have been no refugees these days. There  is some trouble for our people being created by the bandits in  uniform; we are trying to suppress them. We are coordinating  work with unit commanders on the other side of the border to  solve the problem. If they cannot get their bad elements under  control, we will have to resort to tough measures to suppress  them. I notice that those people are very poor. They have  small salaries, and sometimes there was a delay in salary  payment, and so on so forth. So those who lack discipline  created trouble for our people. Sometimes, the problems stemmed  from cheating among themselves since they are involved in arms  and cattle smuggling. We are not responsible for all the  troubles, but they are responsible. In this connection, the  Army is ready to take the strongest measure to deal with those  troubles and will not allow them to go on like this.    I would like to stress here that the Thai Army has never  caused trouble in Cambodia. We want to see peace and  prosperity, and to see our neighbors live happily. We do not  want to see killing between Cambodian factions. But that's  their duty to solve the problem. We have nothing to do with it.  [End recording]</p>

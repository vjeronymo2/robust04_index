			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Sharp fall in demand for plastics PRICES and demand for petrochemicals and plastics in Germany 'fell off the edge of a cliff' in the last quarter of 1992, according to Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, the UK group. A 12 per cent fall in manufacturing output between November and December fed straight through to the plastics industry, said Mr Sanderson. 'The downturn was quick and unexpected,' he added. 'Margins for ethylene are the worst since 1982. Manufacturers are losing hundreds of millions of dollars.' Mr Sanderson called for urgent rationalisation of the European petrochemical industry. At least three and possibly four ethylene crackers needed to be closed, and three plastics plants mothballed if the industry profitability was to return. 'The Germans are in the wrong place for petrochemicals and polymers manufacturing,' said Mr Sanderson. German producers were disadvantaged by an over-valued D-Mark, high environmental costs, excessive wage and social costs, and a high level of absenteeism, he explained. 'German manufacturers used to compensate from their natural disadvantages by being the most efficient producers. That's no longer possible. It's very difficult to be optimistic about the German economy over the next couple of years.'</p>

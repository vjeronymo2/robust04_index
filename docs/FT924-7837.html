			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / France andItaly cut interest rates FRANCE and Italy yesterday cut key interest rates in moves designed to reflect the growing confidence in their economies after the recent turmoil on the currency markets. The one percentage point cut in the Italian discount and Lombard rates, to 13.0 and 14.0 per cent respectively, came shortly after Prime Minister Giuliano Amato won a confidence vote in the Senate on the core of his 1993 budget. Mr Amato, who staked his government's life on winning the Senate vote, has now won parliamentary approval for 80 per cent of his budget, which aims to save L93,000bn (Pounds 45bn) next year, principally through a L53,000bn package of tax increases, and spending freezes. The Italian government has said that the passage of the budget is essential both for reform of the Italian economy and the return of the lira to the EC's currency grid. In France, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, declared that the second cut in French interest rates in two weeks was 'a sign of confidence in our economy and our currency'. The Banque de France lowered the regular intervention rate at which it lends to commercial banks from 9.35 to 9.1 per cent, and its repurchase rate for marginal lending to the banking system from 10.25 to 10 per cent. Both moves had been widely anticipated in the markets. The franc continued to trade at below FFr3.38 to the D-Mark, and share prices rose slightly. Mr Sapin said the French central bank had now 'not only recovered all that it had spent' defending the franc against speculative attack in September, 'but had also been able to increase significantly the level of its foreign exchange reserves'. Mr Sapin said the trend in European rates in general had changed when France approved the Maastricht treaty on September 20. The removal of uncertainty had paved the way for lower rates in a number of countries, he said, adding: 'Today's rate cut must be seen in the European context.'

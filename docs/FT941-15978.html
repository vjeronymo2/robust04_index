			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Schroder growth trust aimed at retail market Schroder, the merchant bank and fund management group, is launching an investment trust aimed at the retail market in the run-up to the end of the tax year. The Schroder UK Growth Fund will have a simple capital structure of ordinary shares offered at 100p. Free warrants giving the right to subscribe for one share at 100p between 1996 and 2002 are being issued on a 1-for-5 basis. The fund will share the same investment strategy of Schroder's successful UK Enterprise unit trust. Schroder is marketing a personal equity plan, the Schroder UK Growth Pep, which will invest in the new trust to tap the resources of private investors who have been turning to the stock market with enthusiasm as base rates have fallen. The issue is sponsored by De Zoete &amp; Bevan. The launch expenses will be capped at 4.5 per cent and total annual expenses are expected to be below 1 per cent.</p>

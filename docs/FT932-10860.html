			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): Cross-border barriers remain in force - Europe / Tim Dickson puts the view across the Channel into perspective PENSION developments in Europe at the moment can be viewed from two main perspectives. One is that of national governments, faced with the nightmare of ever more expensive social security systems, and desperate to find new ways of supporting their populations in old age. The other is that of the European Commission, eager to extend pension freedoms in the single market but frustrated by different and complex tax systems and jealously independent member states. Many barriers to the free movement of EC goods and services were dismantled by EC directives on January 1 this year, but specific pensions legislation was a notorious absentee. As things stand there is a proposed pensions directive before the EC Council of Ministers - but to the dismay of many practitioners the most ambitious goal of the man who originally drafted it, the then EC financial services Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, is now missing. The idea of cross-border membership of Community pension schemes has been shelved for the moment because of the technical and political obstacles to combining a wide variety of public and private EC systems - among them advance funding in the UK and the Netherlands, book reserving in German, and pay-as-you-go in France and the Mediterranean countries. What remains in the directive are less radical, but not uninteresting, proposals to allow greater freedom to invest pension fund assets, and to allow funds to select an investment manager established in another member state. The main impact of the latter proposal will be felt in Spain and Portugal, whose governments insist that pension fund managers must be locally based. Between them, though, the two remaining pillars of the directive raise the prospect of multinational company schemes currently administered along separate national lines being able to pool and centrally manage their assets in one place (without, of course, attempting to harmonise benefits). IBM and Digital are on record as looking at this option seriously; Ford is also studying the options, but is thought to be more cautious. The obvious attraction of setting up a pan-European common investment fund (CIF) is lower costs and greater flexibility. But, according to consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, tax and other hurdles outweigh the benefits at the moment. 'The cost savings . . . will not be large enough for many companies to offset the administration disadvantages, but if a solution is found to the withholding tax problem the situation could change dramatically,' says the firm. For the moment high expectations that liberalisation would bring a rush of new business for the big London investment firms appear to have been disappointed. Relatively few big cross-border accounts have been won, and most managers are reported to be treading over the same relatively narrow plot of continental ground. One problem is that continental funds have yet to be persuaded to embrace the cult of the equity, even if the buying of shares and non-domestic investments has graduallyincreased in recent years. Actuaries will no doubt continue to argue that a higher proportion of shares is justified to offset the risks of inflation - and that superior investment returns can substantially reduce contribution costs for companies - but the prize for investment managers should not be exaggerated. The EC directive when it comes into force in the mid 1990s should limit the ability of the Belgians and the Danes to restrict investment to certain asset classes (measures, incidentally, largely aimed at financing these countries' large budget deficits). Its effectiveness, though, is still unclear. On top of the prudential controls already introduced into the draft directive in the wake of the Maxwell scandal, liberals fear that a further amendment may allow member states to fix maximum limits on specified asset categories. This might channel pension fund money back into bonds, once again serving narrow national interests. As the directive stands, governments will in any case be able to require that 60 per cent of the assets of a scheme are matched with the domestic currency or Ecus. If the freedom of investment managers is perhaps the biggest issue of the moment, pension professionals like Richard Abramson, head of corporate pensions at Ernst &amp; Young, have not given up completely on aspects of cross-border membership. In the wake of last year's discussion document published by the EC Commission, for example, he says there is still some hope that the something can be done to allow mobile workers to remain in their existing pension schemes without suffering any adverse tax consequences. At present, for example, an employee sent by his company from the UK to Germany will have to pay tax on pension contributions paid into a UK fund. Not for the first time reform is strongly championed by the UK, but meets with a lukewarm response at best from other member states. One reason is their fear of losing revenue which might help support social security systems groaning under new demographic pressures. Most European countries face the same dilemma: increase contributions (ie taxes) to finance the rising cost of state pensions, or reduce benefits. Both are politically unpalatable, which is why there are tentative moves by several governments to encourage more private sector participation. The issue, for example, is certainly on the agenda of the new French government. Its predecessor laid out the options in a White Paper two years ago: though there were no recommendations for action a start has been made by allowing modest tax incentives for personal pension plans (the so-called Plans Epargne de Retrait). Interest is also focused on Austria where 50 per cent of pension liabilities now have to be pre-funded by companies; Denmark, where companies now have to make some provision for their blue-collar workers; and Spain, where pre-funding is also in its infancy and further complicated by the government's insistence on strong member representation.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       MAIN EUROPEAN PENSION MARKETS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Asset size    Estimated                                                (US Dollars  non-domestic                                 Main funding       bn)*      investment  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                                    Funded       644           26 Netherlands                           Funded       242           14 Germany            Book reserve/pensionkasse       114            4 Denmark                               Funded        40            4 France     Pay-as-you-go with small reserves        23            3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * As at December 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: InterSec Research  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

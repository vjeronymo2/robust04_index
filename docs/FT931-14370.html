			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Observer: Royal rumpus goes global If the more nervous members of Britain's embattled royal family think the whole world is agin 'em, they might take comfort from knowing they are not alone. There seems to be a bit of an outbreak of royal-bashing around the globe. Spain's royal household has come under fire following a British TV documentary in which King Juan Carlos behaved rather frivolously in the eyes of some courtiers. Meanwhile, the right of Malaysia's sultans to remain immune from prosecution for any offence, however big or small, is also under attack. Malaysia's media have been regaling the public with all sorts of alleged royal misdeeds, ranging from tales of lavish parties, and prodigious gambling, to overspending on imported luxury limos and air-conditioned stables for their finest polo ponies. Indeed, one golf-mad sultan is alleged to have assaulted, and killed, his caddie in a fit of rage. However, what seems to have brought matters to a head in Malaysia is the latest revelation of the sultans' high living - a Pounds 7m boondoggle paid for out of the public purse. Its purpose? To decide on the best location for a royal viewing of the moon  -apparently something of a favourite pastime among the country's sultans. It's alleged that they used the meeting to get up to other less than courtly pranks - like locking a senior government official in a kennel and roundly abusing several others. Now that's Observer's idea of real royal dirty tricks.</p>

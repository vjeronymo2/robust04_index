			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STALLONE'S ROCKY TO HANG 'EM UP  </P> <P> Sylvester Stallone says this summer's "Rocky V" will be the last in the series  because there is nothing more to say about the not-so-talkative palooka.  </P> <P> "I have no more to say about the character, which is my alter ego, I can't deny  that," Stallone said Tuesday.  </P> <P> So what's ahead for Stallone?  </P> <P> "Right now," he said, "we're doing something ecological, which is the theme of  the 1990s. Then I'd like to do a comedy."  </P> <P> The movie's premiere is tentatively set for Nov. 15.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn -- Security near the Israeli Embassy in  Bonn was further increased on Wednesday. In the afternoon, cars  using roads near the embassy were checked very thoroughly. It  seems that several locations were chosen where a great number of  police have been posted. [passage omitted]    According to police, stepped-up security is to be in force  over the next three to four days. After that, these activities  will not be stopped altogether but decreased to a ``normal  level.'' An Embassy spokeswoman said that security standards  are very high, anyway.</p>

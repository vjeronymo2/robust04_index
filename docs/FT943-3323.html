			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Tame CPI rise gives Dow renewed heart Wall Street US stocks improved yesterday as a tame reading on consumer price inflation brought some encouragement to a depressed bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.52 firmer at 3,879.86, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.30 at 467.51. Advancing issues outpaced declines on the Big Board by a slim margin following volume of 295.7m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 1.75 better at 456.81 and the Nasdaq composite forged 5.82 ahead to 765.83. A two-session bout of selling, triggered by news of a sharp increase in producer prices, came to an end yesterday morning. Before the market opened, the Labor Department had revealed a 0.3 per cent rise in the August consumer price index, a figure that compared favourably with the consensus forecast. Amid the relief, investors largely ignored contradictory evidence in a regional manufacturing survey. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said the prices-paid component of its monthly survey of business conditions showed a moderate upturn. In spite of that unfavourable news, analysts said the more benign reading on inflation in the consumer sector would allow the Federal Reserve to wait until November before lifting short-term interest rates again. That scenario had seemed less credible in the aftermath of last week's report on producer prices. The more positive outlook yesterday enabled bonds to finish with decent gains, but only after the market reversed direction several times. By comparison, equities were steadfast. The early gains eroded a bit near midday, but the market regained its stride later. Among the Dow industrials, raw material suppliers - which benefit from the accelerating trend in producer prices - led the way. Alcoa closed Dollars 1 3/8 stronger at Dollars 84 and International Paper climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 74 1/2 . Elsewhere in the robust paper and pulp sector, Georgia Pacific gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 73 and Champion International added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 36 5/8 . Market bellwether stock IBM set the positive tone among technology issues, moving forward Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 1/4 . Semiconductor issues showed some sparkle following the release of the August book-to-bill ratio, a keenly watched indicator of the industry's future performance. A surpris- ingly strong reading sent Micron Technology Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 39 7/8 and Texas Instruments up Dollars 1 to Dollars 75 1/2 . The session propelled two relative unknowns into the New York SE's most active list. Western Company of North America, an oil services concern, jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 16 3/4 after BJ Services announced its interest in acquiring the company. BJ said it was appealing directly to Western's shareholders after the rejection of its unsolicited Dollars 450m offer, worth Dollars 18.50 a share. Meanwhile, EMC appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 in unusually brisk trading of 3.1m shares. The activity reflected a positive reaction by analysts to the company's announcement that it was developing storage applications for 'video on demand' services. Mexico Equity prices ended just slightly higher after losing their earlier Wall Street generated steam. The IPC index of the 37 most traded stocks was 4.55 points up on balance at 2,713.34 after touching 2,725.25. Analysts said the Mexican market was basically in a period of consolidation while awaiting news of earnings reports, the annual anti-inflation pact between government, business and labour - due to be renewed shortly - and incoming President Ernesto Zedillo's new cabinet.</p>

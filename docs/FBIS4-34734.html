			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- PT [Workers Party] presidential  candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday regretted that  many Brazilian businessmen had not evolved since the 1989  elections. "They would rather have a thief in the presidency  than an honest individual," said Lula, before departing on a  six-day visit to the Republic of South Africa and to Germany.  Lula believes that the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries  (FIESP) represents the most backward of Brazilian businessmen,  especially if one is to believe "the foolish things said by  former FIESP President Mario Amato in 1989." On that occasion,  Amato said that if Lula had won the elections, 800,000  businessmen would leave Brazil.    Lula said he does not expect to receive support from the  "FIESP people," and that he will not make any effort to convince  the businessmen to vote for him, as he considers FIESP a  backward organization. "It is a fiefdom that works in an  outdated manner," Lula said. He recalled that when he was a  labor union leader he refused to negotiate with the FIESP. "It  is the most backward institution. Good businessmen do their  negotiations apart," he said.    The PT candidate said he is sorry for these businessmen who  have never evolved, while the rest of society is giving  unmistakable signals of doing so. "Those businesses think only  of themselves, and never think of a society of 155 million  inhabitants," he said. "I will win the elections, and they will  realize how bad it was for Brazil that I did not win the 1989  elections," Lula added. The PT campaign strategy will not  change over the criticisms made by businessmen. "In 1989, I did  not have businessmen's committees supporting me. Nowadays I  have them in several states, which means that on this particular  point there has been some progress," he said, after which he  recalled that since the beginning of the campaign he had already  participated in more than 80 meetings with businessmen from all  sectors.    Lula criticized Democratic Labor Party candidate Leonel  Brizola when he said that the former governor could relate only  with the workers of the fifties. Brizola considered Lula's  declaration of assets before the Superior Electoral Court  strange. "Brizola comes from a time when workers ate from a  wooden plate, wore old slippers, and were poorly dressed, which  were the times of populism," Lula said.</p>

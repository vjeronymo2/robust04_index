Though it started in high  spirits, declaring it will "tear up the collusion among  politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen," it is now coming  under growing criticism for being "led by bureaucrats" in making  decisions on economic policy matters like economic stimulus  measures and taxation system reform. Even U.S. President Bill  Clinton assailed the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of Finance [MOF] as master  culprits for rupturing the Japan-U.S. economic consultations.  But, meanwhile, there have been delicate changes in the  relationships of power between economic-related government  offices of Kasumigaseki in Tokyo under the coalition government.  We have looked into the rise and fall of the major government  offices.    The office which has shown its might under the Hosokawa  government is the MOF. In addition to Ichiro Ozawa, general  secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Jiro Saito,  administrative vice minister of the MOF, was denounced as a  "behind-the-scenes schemer" in the hassle over the national  welfare tax concept, but he still caught the attention of the  nation as he proved capable of moving even the prime minister.  Of course, even in earlier days the ministry was called the  "government office within the government offices," and there is  no doubt that the power of the ministry in charge of state  finance, including the budget and taxes, stands out among the  central government's offices.    But the weakening of the power of the members of the Liberal  Democratic Party's [LDP] Research Commission on the Tax System  as well as the LDP zoku-giin [Dietmen lobbying for interests of  certain industries or government offices] who built up their  power under the 38-year rule of the LDP has helped the ministry  solidify its strength too. One policy-related staff member of a  coalition member party admitted, "We cannot do without the help  of the MOF in specialty areas like the taxation system."    While there is a view that as a result of the failure of the  national welfare tax concept the prime minister's "trust" in the  ministry has been shaken, within the ministry there is an  unshakable belief in itself as evidenced in a remark by a  ranking ministry official who asserted, "We have succeeded in  ensuring that the matter of the consumption tax raise will be  settled before the end of the year; many people tell us we have  done well."    In contrast, the office which is losing power is MITI. With  the LDP's commerce-and industry-related zoku-giin having lost  their power, the ministry has lost supporters for its policies,  and that has contributed to its weakening as well. On the  matter of economic stimulus measures and reform of the taxation  system, there was a time when administrative Vice Minister  Hideaki Kumano, together with MOF Vice Minister Saito, ran  around, trying to push for "raising taxes [primarily consumption  taxes] and reducing taxes [primarily income taxes] in a package  deal." For a while, the ministry was chided as a "second  Ministry of Finance" on account of that.    The intraministry controversy over the dismissal of Masahisa  Taito, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau, at the end of  last year and the reports that the ministry carried out  "publicity campaigns" on economic organizations in an attempt to  sway public opinion on the general economic stimulus measures  have also facilitated the sinking of the ministry's power base.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is a ministry which  brought down its own rating by failing to bring about a  successful conclusion to the framework talks -- the most  important area of diplomacy in relations with the United States.  The fact that shortly before the Japan-U.S. summit, the prime  minister sent Akitane Kiuchi, former ambassador to France and  one of his advisers, as his special envoy to Washington to act  on his own, separate from MOFA, came as a shock as it showed  that the prime minister did not trust the ministry's diplomatic  capabilities. Even within the government there is criticism  that "the MOFA's connections with Washington are too shabby."  The ministry has to find a breakthrough in relations with the  United States to regain lost ground.    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  [MAFF] is one of those whose power is rising, helped by its  accomplishments in taking the lead in resolving the issue of the  partial opening of the rice market. It has actively campaigned  within the government on the need to take measures to help  farmers deal with the partial opening of the rice market -- by  setting up the Headquarters for Emergency Measures on  Agriculture and Farming Community headed by the prime minister,  and holding a meeting of the Agricultural Administration Council  in the prime minister's office for the first time in 14 years.  But its long-time ally, the Agricultural Cooperatives, rebelled  against the ministry when the latter engaged in  behind-the-scenes negotiations with the United States over the  partial opening of the rice market. The cooperatives for a  while refused to cooperate with the ministry on the policy of  reducing rice farm acreage. Now the two parties are moving  toward reconciliation, but there is a big scar remaining.    The Economic Planning Agency [EPA], which is led by a  cabinet  member from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], cannot  be said to have performed its adjustment functions well in  formulating overall economic stimulus measures, and its value is  not appreciated. But the work of legislating the Product  Liability Law, the first mammoth-scale law to be formulated by  the agency in about 20 years, is being helped by the change of  government since the prime minister is in favor of protecting  consumers, and the SDPJ and Komeito are enthusiastic about  legislating such a law.    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] no  longer  has the LDP's zoku-giin to support it. A senior ministry  official lamented, "When we had to negotiate with the Ministry  of Finance regarding new articles of postal savings, we used to  have support of the zoku-giin. Now we cannot expect such  support, and we have a very difficult time." The ministry is  said to be still groping for a way to establish relations with  member parties of the coalition.    The Ministry of Transportation, on the strength of its  slogan  for giving "priority to consumers," succeeded in getting a  budget allocation for construction of new city railway and  semi-bullet train systems. Senior ministry officials' visits to  Shinseito General Secretary Ozawa have also become conspicuous.  Apparently, they believe, "the coalition is flying toward  forming a new axis [of policies]."    Remarking on this change in the power of government offices,  a bureaucrat insisted, "It does not mean that the MOF has gained  more power. It only means that the power of politics has  weakened. We still need the power of politics -- going over the  framework of government offices -- if we want to have big  policies."    Political columnist Taro Yayama commented on the rising  power  of the bureaucrats, and said: "This is a temporary phenomenon  that happens in the early stage of a new government. Prime  Minister Hosokawa wants to break up the collusion between the  politicians and the bureaucrats which has continued since the  days of the LDP government. I don't think he will let the  bureaucrats do as they please in the future."</p>

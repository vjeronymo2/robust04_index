			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The gay consumer - US companies are recognising the buying potential of the homosexual community With US President Bill Clinton recently achieving some success in his attempt to lift the ban on gays in the military, plus his appointment of a leading lesbian politician, Roberta Achtenberg, to the White House, the homosexual community is gaining wider social acceptance in America. At the same time companies in the US are taking increasing note of gays as a distinct consumer group. Approximately 10 per cent of the adult population, or 18.5m people, is thought to be homosexual in the US. So the new attention is, perhaps, hardly surprising. 'There is little loyalty today from the consumer, but we find that gay consumers exercise great loyalty to those companies that support or recognise them,' says Taylor Ingraham, director of marketing for the North American division of Virgin Atlantic Airways. There are enormous benefits attached to tapping into the gay market. As the majority of like-sex households are dual salaried without children, they fit into the marketers favourite bracket of big spenders with high disposable income. According to Rick Dean, the senior vice-president of Overlooked Opinions, a Chicago-based polling and market research firm specialising in homosexual consumers, the average gay couple has an annual income of Dollars 50,000 (Pounds 33,500). Dean maintains that gays are avid travellers and purchasers of high-quality products in almost every market sector. Consequently, industry leaders such as Banana Republic, Giorgio Armani and Virgin Atlantic Airways have begun advertising their products in Out magazine - one of approximately 150 gay publications in the US. But does gay marketing work? Banana Republic refuses to comment on the motives behind its gay marketing programme but will say the company is planning to continue the advertising campaign in Out magazine for the foreseeable future - in itself proof that the programme is working. Ingraham, on the other hand, is able to identify tangible results from Virgin's alternative marketing campaign and says: 'We have made a number of large-scale bookings from these ads. Plus, we have had calls from people thanking Virgin for the advertising and for addressing them specifically. Like any other sector of the community, gays will support those companies and organisations that support them.' Joseph Ellert, a freight forwarder with an international shipping company based in San Francisco, regards himself as a classic gay consumer. He applauds those companies that recognise him and other homosexuals as valuable customers. 'We have the bucks, in fact we have more money to spend than many other sectors of the market. If I see something advertised in the gay media, I am more likely to take a second look at that product and consider purchasing it, than if it was advertised in a straight publication. It shows that the company recognises we exist and addresses us directly,' says Ellert. It would appear that corporate America is starting to wake up to the power of the gay consumer. While undertaking market research for various clients considering a launch into homosexual markets, Dean found there are business opportunities abounding in this traditionally ignored sector. As a result he set up a long-distance telephone company in competition with AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI. Community Spirit allocates 2 per cent of every telephone bill to the subscriber's chosen gay, lesbian or Aids charity. 'We took a benign, non-eventful product and gave it a gay identity,' says Dean. Within seven months of the launch, Community Spirit has 20,000 subscribers and attracts on average 1,000 new accounts a week. Among its subscribers are not only gay consumers, but parents of children who have Aids, individuals sympathetic to the gay concerns and issues. But if such profit and altruistic benefit are to be achieved from courting the gay market, why haven't marketing gurus tuned in earlier? According to Angie Novak, product manager of Paper Moon Graphics based in Los Angeles, some companies are still sensitive to a possible stigma attached to associating their products with a gay market. She believes that less progressive companies are afraid of alienating 'straight' consumers who might prefer not to purchase products and services openly targeted at the gay sector. When Paper Moon first launched its 'alternative lifestyle' line of greetings cards, featuring gay couples and gay scenarios in a clean and decent but humorous manner, the line did well in big cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. 'But we came across some challenging buyers in less progressive areas, like Salt Lake City,' recalls Novak. Paper Moon plugged a gap in the Dollars 5.3bn greetings card market, which was not being met by industry leaders. Furthermore, Paper Moon donates 5 per cent of 'alternative lifestyle' proceeds to gay-affiliated charities. Equally, Ingraham clearly states that Virgin Airways is not afraid of alienating straight customers by attracting gays. 'Why should there be a stigma against gays?' she asks. 'We don't exercise any stigma against heterosexuals. People are people, they are all the same. 'Our gay advertising is not targeting gays any differently from other consumer sectors. We are just targeting them in an environment they enjoy and in which they feel comfortable. My primary aim is getting as many people on board our planes as possible.' The US is not alone in identifying the advantages of courting a gay clientele. A former female buyer in a leading UK menswear chain noticed a gradual increase in sales of g-strings, thongs and 'skimpies' for men. 'Branch managers were demanding higher stock levels, as they claimed women were buying them for their husbands and gays were buying them for their partners, their friends and themselves.' The buyer, whose career blossomed as a result, recognised that branches in towns with a strong gay affiliation sold greater quantities of the risque men's underwear than branches in other areas. While some companies attribute their success in gay marketing to the fact that they support the gay community by contributing to affiliated charities, others are discovering that if the product is right and the marketing is correctly targeted, success will follow in the gay market - as in any other sector.</p>

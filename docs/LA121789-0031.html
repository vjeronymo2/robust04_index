			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH ALLIANCE WITH EUROPE;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ESTABLISH LINKS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN  LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION AND SEMICONDUCTORS.  </P> <P> The Japanese buy a stake in the venerable Rockefeller Center. At almost the  same moment, the Berlin Wall, symbol of East-West confrontation, comes crashing  down.  </P> <P> This historical coincidence aptly reflects the new world of trade and diplomacy  that will confront the United States in the 1990s: an economically dynamic and  politically more self-assertive Japan emerging from its postwar American  tutelage and a Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals where the traditional  military alliances are unraveling and economic concerns will be paramount.  </P> <P> In this new environment, Washington should move on two policy fronts. The  United States needs to respond to the Japanese trade and investment challenge,  and with the instability produced by the dissolving of the Eastern Bloc,  America must maintain close ties with the European Community -- a nascent  economic superpower and important pole of political stability.  </P> <P> The United States has an opportunity to pursue both goals -- boosting its  economic competitiveness and cementing transatlantic ties -- with a single  initiative. The Bush Administration should make the legal and regulatory  decisions necessary to establish new institutional links between firms in the  United States and the European Community to pursue cooperation in leading-edge  technologies such as high-definition television and semiconductors.  </P> <P> A high-tech commercial alliance between the United States and the 12-nation EC  would redress the economic balance of power that is tilting toward Japan, but  in a positive way. It would avoid protectionist, retaliatory threats, such as  the Super 301 clause of the 1988 trade act, and avoid lecturing Japan about its  social and cultural faults, such as in the ongoing structural impediments  talks. Moreover, a U.S.-EC united commercial front, by facilitating  transatlantic joint ventures, will prevent the EC from crowding out the United  States from the chase for Eastern Europe's commercial prizes.  </P> <P> A partnership between U.S. and European companies will inevitably be seen in  Tokyo as an attempt to gang up against it and as further proof that American  economic policy-making is not free of racist, anti-Japanese attitudes. But  there should be nothing racist in Washington's deciding that, on balance, its  most important interests lie in Europe. And with American confidence in its  economic competitiveness strengthened by its European connection, the current  mood of Japanophobia, which is already straining the U.S.-Japan bilateral  relationship, should begin to ebb.  </P> <P> In any case, the Japanese are pressing the United States at the structural  impediments talks to take its own actions to improve its long-term industrial  strength. That is what a U.S.-EC high-tech alliance is meant to do.  </P> <P> Americans and Europeans are already accustomed to working together on  defense-related high-tech issues through NATO and the Coordinating Committee  for Multilateral Export Controls, the 17-nation Paris-based group that monitors  strategic exports to communist countries. There also exists an informal U.S.-EC  High-Technology Working Group that regularly examines issues of joint concern.  But most important is the natural fit between U.S. and European industries in  the two key areas of HDTV and semiconductors.  </P> <P> Though Europe is struggling to retain a domestic chip industry, the United  States is still strong in this sector, despite growing Japanese competition. On  the other hand, the United States is years behind the Europeans in HDTV  commercialization. In fact, it is nearly impossible to imagine a U.S. effort in  HDTV without European help. Zenith is the sole remaining U.S.-owned producer of  TV sets, while two European companies, Thomson of France and Philips of the  Netherlands, own four U.S.-based TV manufacturers between them. Philips has  devoted considerable resources to HDTV research and development -- all of which  has been performed in the United States.  </P> <P> Private think tanks like the Economic Policy Institute, government-sponsored  groups like the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, as well as  congressmen on both sides of the aisle, have stressed the importance of a  domestic HDTV and chip industry. The Sematech consortium already pools U.S.  companies to research chip-manufacturing techniques, but the United States  needs an equivalent HDTV consortium, like the Advanced Television Corp.  proposed by the American Electronics Assn.  </P> <P> On the European side, the EC Commission has sponsored two endeavors, the Joint  European Submicron Silicon project (JESSI) for semiconductor research, as well  as a new European Economic Interest Group merging broadcasters, program makers  and equipment manufacturers to catch up with the Japanese lead on HDTV  commercialization.  </P> <P> As its first move toward a U.S.-EC commercial partnership, Washington should  endorse the EC's HDTV standard. The United States has dropped its earlier  support for the Japanese standard, but the Federal Communications Commission  has not come up with a replacement. A common standard will rationalize both  research and commercialization efforts.  </P> <P> Sematech and JESSI, as well future HDTV consortia, should also grant membership  rights to firms from both sides of the Atlantic. Officials from International  Business Machines Corp. and the Franco-Italian firm SGS Thomson have already  sought such reciprocal participation, but without much luck.  </P> <P> Right now, there is a "Fortress America" approach governing high-tech research  in the United States. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which  partially funds current chip and HDTV research, requires that only U.S.-owned  companies be recipients of their grants. This should be dropped. A step in this  direction is a bill sponsored by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), which, under  certain conditions, would make government funding available for foreign  companies participating in U.S. high-tech research efforts.  </P> <P> In the short term there will be strains in U.S.-Japan ties as American and  European firms set up joint high-tech efforts. Washington will need to explain  to Tokyo that, of all the possible options for responding to the weakening U.S.  high-tech industrial base and the domestic political pressures that come with  it, commercial alliance-building with the Europeans is the least harmful to the  global trading system.  </P> <P> Whatever the temporary damage done to relations with Japan, America's prospects  in the evolving economic landscape in Europe will take a turn for the better.  Although American anxiety about the EC's 1992 plan turning into an  inward-looking Fortress Europe has eased, new fears about a German-led European  commercial invasion of Eastern Europe are arising. European firms certainly  have a leg up on U.S. firms in dealing with the East Bloc, given their  historical and cultural ties. But with the interdependency created by formal  U.S.-EC high-tech linkages, American business will be able to make up for some  of its lost time.  </P> <P> With any luck, one day Poles, Hungarians and Czechs will watch their news on  (partially) American-made high-definition TV sets.  </P></p>

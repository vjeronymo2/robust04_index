			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Germans to step up aid to the east LEADERS of west German industry agreed yesterday to step up private investment in east Germany from DM110bn (Pounds 45.2bn) last year to DM130bn in 1993, provided the trade unions agree to hold back the pace of wage equalisation between east and west. The plans include specific commitments from German banks and the insurance industry to pump in an extra DM1bn apiece for housing and industrial loans. The business leaders also called for sweeping changes in the system of subsidising eastern enterprises, to be tied more closely to their competitiveness and market performance. They also want a strict time limit on the subsidy programme. The plans were put forward at a top-level meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as the latest round of talks to renegotiate the rapid rise in east German engineering workers' wages ended in deadlock. The employers want to postpone a 26 per cent pay rise due on April 1, arguing it will be the last straw for both privatised and unprivatised enterprises. The negotiations on behalf of 130,000 mechanical and electrical engineers in Saxony, the most important industrial state in the east, now go to legal arbitration. At the same time, the leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) rejected, 'for the time being', an approach by Mr Kohl to attend a new round of talks on his planned 'solidarity pact' for east Germany. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, rejected a package of government savings measures as 'sinister and anti-social'. The business leaders from Germany's four main employers' organisations yesterday presented a grim picture of the industrial collapse of the former east Germany. At their latest round of talks with Chancellor Kohl on the solidarity pact, supposed to be completed by next week, they admitted the 'necessary shrinking' of east German industry had now become outright de-industrialisation, with potentially devastating consequences for the rest of the economy. In a nine-point paper submitted to the chancellor, they estimated that total new investment of DM400bn-DM500bn was needed to create 2m new jobs in east Germany. Since 1989, the number employed in east German manufacturing industry has collapsed from more than 3m to an estimated 700,000 at the end of last year. The employers said the private sector planned to step up investment in east Germany this year from DM110bn to DM130bn, and would maintain those plans in spite of the gathering recession in the west. They also proposed programmes to boost the purchasing of eastern products by western enterprises, extra efforts to boost the marketing of eastern products inside and outside Germany, and special programmes to support research and development. The future of the solidarity pact hangs in the balance over coming days, with mixed signals from trade unions and the 16 state governments. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG-Metall, the engineering workers' union, maintains much has been achieved in the talks, but insists the eastern wage contracts of his members are not open for renegotiation - the key demand put forward by the employers.</p>

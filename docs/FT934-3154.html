			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Gabon president retains power Troops with tanks patrolled the streets of Libreville last night as the Gabon government announced President Omar Bongo had won an absolute majority in Sunday's multi-party elections, retaining the post he has held for 26 years, AP reports. Officials said he avoided a run-off election by winning 51.07 per cent of the vote, against 27 per cent for his nearest rival, Roman Catholic priest Paul Mba Abessole.</p>

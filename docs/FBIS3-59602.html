			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arnold Noeldechen: "Research Priorities: GMD </F> Wants to Push Neural Information Development in the Federal  Republic--Nanoelectronics is Also Moving Ahead--Light Pulses  Control a Transistor Made of Organic Molecules"]    [Text] Neural information science plays an important role  in Germany for the development of new image evaluation systems  including medicine and robot systems. Neural information science  will also become important for future telecommunication systems,  as Dr. Christoph von der Malsburg (Ruhr-University Bochum)  pointed out at a seminar of the Society for Mathematics and Data  Processing (GMD) at Birlinghoven Castle (53757 Sankt Augustin).    According to Professor von der Malsburg, the development of  neural information science constitutes a switch from Boolean  logic to an "algorithmic world" to control self-organizing  systems. Neural information science tries to use the brain's  data processing functions for technical communication  processes--a field which GMD wants to emphasize in the future.    An interesting practical application is an image processing  system which is able to recognize persons on photos, even when  the photos have been disguised or when they were taken under  different illumi nation or viewing angles. For recognition, such  a photo is covered with a coarse grid and the image content of  each grid cell is defined by an algorithm.    The system is based on a mathematical formula which  describes  how small, spatially arranged waves are changed by a  perpendicular sine wave. This allows the mathematical  determination of the image content of all grid cells.    Pictures which were distorted by rotation or other means can  be quickly compared with the original photo using the distorted  grid and the previously defined image content, so that the  identity can be established even from distorted pictures. The  system can be used for checking personal identities and  signatures.    However, it is also suitable for highly automated measuring  systems to avoid rear-end collisions. With this system, robots  can "recognize" and sort out individual parts, even if they are  scattered around randomly. Another possible application is the  automatic sorting of waste which would be very beneficial from  an ecological point of view since manual sorting does not make  sense because of the high labor cost and slow sorting speed.    In addition to neural information science, GMD is pushing  ahead with numerous research projects for the integration of  computer hardware to avoid falling behind the United States or  Japan on an international level. Dr. Gerhard Abstreiter, a  professor at the Walter-Schottky-Institute of the Technical  University Munich, claims that continued development of  microelectronics towards "nanoelectronics" with its even finer  structures will not be restricted by physical and technical  limitations in the next 20 years.    He says that the necessary manufacturing techniques will not  require a completely new technology, but can be accomplished  with advanced processes which are already being used today. They  are sufficient for layer thicknesses around five Angstrom and  for producing structures around 60 nanometers.    Such ultra large-scale (ULSI) circuits would have to take  into account quantum-mechanical effects. Research of his  institute in this field has already resulted in novel quantum  devices, and it is possible to produce n-type transistors for  functional logic circuits in the nanometer range.    According to Dr. Manfred Pilkuhn (Physical Institute of the  University Stuttgart) the continued integration beyond the  nanometer range towards the molecule and atom range will require  the use of biological reactions in order to implement molecular  circuits measuring only a few nanometers. This includes, for  instance, the principle underlying photosynthesis, i.e. the  controlled transfer of a charge under light.    The physicists in Stuttgart have presented a molecular  transistor which consists only of organic molecules and where  the transfer of the charge can be controlled by light pulses. A  combination of fulgides called a switching molecule can "block"  the transfer of a charge using ultraviolet light. The transfer  is made possible again by light in the visible spectrum.  Naphtacyanines in a polyethylene matrix receive and store the  transmitted charge. This molecular switch was supported and  developed in Stuttgart as part of special research program 329.    With the minute size of these structures around ten  nanometers, such switch structures can also be used as data  storage for binary information with the potential for memory  densities similar to those of the human brain.    As Professor Pilkhun's experiments have shown, the required  printed circuits in the molecular range can be produced quite  easily using long molecular chains consisting of polythiophenes,  for instance. Since the photolithographic process cannot be used  in the molecular range, the researchers will attempt to replace  it with application techniques using the Langmuir-Blodgett  process. However, Pilkuhn admits that it is not easy to build up  the desired structures in this manner.    Another unresolved problem is the attachment of molecular  circuits to circuits using nano- or microelectronics. Pilkuhn  thinks it is possible to work with optical controls using  semiconductor lasers instead of the conventional electrical  connections. Experiments in this area are underway at the  University of Stuttgart.    One can only hope that the GND will have more success with  its research projects in neural information science and advanced  electronics than with the development of parallel computers.  Some observers think that the Suprenum project could have given  German industry a considerable edge if they had succeeded to  develop the related software in time. However, the public should  also be informed about the economic success, the so-called  spin-off, so that the general public understands that research  in Germany pays off.    According to the Federal Ministry for Research, GMD's head  organization, this year DM1.5 billion will be available for  research in information science with DM 1.04 million coming from  the budget of the Federal Ministry for Research. Private  industry, however, finances about 95 percent of the research  itself and thus manages almost completely without government  support. On the other hand, the Federal Ministry for Research  supports nearly all research institutions, universities, and  research associations employing about 3,000 scientists.</p>

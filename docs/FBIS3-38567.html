			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Chairman Franco Rocchetta by </F> Lorenzo Fuccaro in Milan; date not specified: "Rocchetta: The  `Lombards' Are a Real Force, Whereas Berlusconi Is a Virtual  Politician"]    [Text] Silvio Berlusconi? "Quite frankly, we still don't  know who he is." Franco Rocchetta, chairman and foreign affairs  spokesman of the Northern League, answers the telephone almost  inaudibly from his home in Montello, where he is in bed with  influenza.    [Fuccaro] But do you want an alliance with Berlusconi or  don't you?    [Rocchetta] All I can say is that Berlusconi strikes me as a  virtual politician.    [Fuccaro] And what do you mean by that?    [Rocchetta] I mean that from one day to the next, like a  mushroom popping up after a shower, we have seen the emergence  of a label called "Forza Italia" on a platform very similar to  ours. But we are a force rooted in our territory, we have  deputies who have made their presence felt, and how, in  parliament. We have been the driving force for change. Can  Berlusconi say the same of himself?    [Fuccaro] Are you perhaps saying that he is a test-tube  product?    [Rocchetta] I prefer to put it like this. It is only fair  that we should talk to him, and some sort of agreement is  possible.    [Fuccaro] However, Berlusconi claims that "Forza Italia" is  the top party....    [Rocchetta] Hold on there, opinion polls are not the  election result.    [Fuccaro] True, but there are those in the League who think  that Berlusconi's sole aim is to take possession of your  electorate. In that case, how can you reach agreement with him?    [Rocchetta] I don't know. For the time being these are only  hypotheses. We neither bow down to him nor demonize him.    [Fuccaro] But they also say that his entry into the fray has  called the leadership of the freedom pole into question.    [Rocchetta] To be frank, I don't think so. Not at all. It  strikes me as too early to tell.    [Fuccaro] Why should it be too early?    [Rocchetta] We represent a real force, while he strikes me  as not a bluff exactly, but a long shot. It's as if Miss Italy,  in other words the League, were worried because one day a little  girl, "Forza Italia," might carry off her beauty queen's crown.    [Fuccaro] So, there's no comparison?    [Rocchetta] Berlusconi, whom I hold in high esteem and  respect, doesn't have the votes. And even if he had, he would  have to prove himself a shrewd politician, just as he has been  an "enterprising" entrepreneur.    [Fuccaro] But do you need Berlusconi as an ally?    [Rocchetta] For the time being he would appear to be more of  a potential ally. I'll give you an example from history. Let's  take the Americans: During the second world war, they had  allies similar to themselves, such as the Australians and  Canadians, against the national socialists, but they also had  the Spanish, who were Franco-ist, the Brazilians, who were  fascist, and the Soviets as well.    [Fuccaro] Are you in the League prepared to line up with all  those who are against the progressive alliance? And do you see  the national Alliance as forming part of this force as well?    [Rocchetta] I would not talk about agreements with Fini's  movement. What I have in mind is something that will avoid a  war between north and south, considering that a lot of people in  the south have decided to vote for the right for want of  anything better. We must keep an eye on movements in that camp.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen pays Pounds 84m for distributor - Purchase of Swift will not dilute group earnings CHRISTIAN SALVESEN, the distribution, specialist hire and manufacturing group, has agreed to pay Pounds 83.9m for Swift Distribution Holdings, a delivery company for the automotive and engineering industries. Swift was the subject of a Pounds 26m management buy-out in February last year from Lep Group, the security and freight forwarding concern. Swift's managers, backed by Prudential Venture Managers and 3i, paid Pounds 8m in cash, assumed Pounds 11m of debt and raised a further Pounds 7m in working capital. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive of Salvesen, said he was happy with the amount paid, in spite of the sharp increase in the group's price since the buy-out, and to have acquired Swift's management and workforce. The acquisition would not dilute group earnings. He said the deal meant Salvesen was now firmly established as a one of the leading companies in the third-party industrial distribution sector, which had considerable growth potential both in the UK and overseas. Salvesen is one of a small group of companies that provide dedicated distribution operations for retailers such as Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Safeway. However, it accepts that the UK retail market is relatively mature and has been keen to apply its logistics expertise to other areas, such as industrial components. Mr Masters said Salvesen had particular experience of managing warehouses, while Swift had greater knowledge of running a network of multi-user depots, so there would be a close and useful fit. Industrial distribution was becoming increasingly international, so Swift would also benefit from Salvesen's overseas exposure. Northampton-based Swift operates from 22 depots, linked by electronic data systems. The company has a fleet of more than 700 vehicles and employs some 1,500 people throughout the UK. It made operating profits of Pounds 6.5m in 1992. Net assets acquired amount to Pounds 20m. As a result of the purchase, Salvesen's gearing will increase to about 50 per cent, compared with 14.5 per cent at its March year-end.</p>

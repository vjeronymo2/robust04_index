			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Drive to reduce workplace injuries The Health and Safety Executive launched a campaign yesterday to cut the Pounds 1.25bn a year cost to industry of strain injuries at work. The body said that than 1m people a year were affected by injury, leading to the loss of 5.5m working days. This includes 500,000 back-related injuries a year, mostly caused by accidents at work. The second biggest problem involves upper-limb injuries. Ucatt, the construction union, called for an overhaul of the investigations system for accidents at work after a court verdict yesterday. British Rail and Tilbury Douglas Construction were each fined Pounds 25,000 and ordered jointly to pay Pounds 25,000 costs after pleading guilty at London Crown Court to breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act that led to the deaths of two workers in 1992.</p>

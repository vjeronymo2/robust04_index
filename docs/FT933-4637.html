			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: Award for young dramatist MARTIN Crimp has won the 26th John Whiting Award, given annually by the Arts Council to the writer of a new play which demonstrates a distinctive development in dramatic writing. The Treatment, the play which won Crimp the award, was performed at the Royal Court in London in April. It is unusual in that the setting is New York, a city that Crimp only visited briefly as part of an annual exchange between the Royal Court and a New York theatre. It deals with skulduggery in the film world. It was a critical, but not a box office, success, but was admired by US producers and opens at the Newman Theatre in New York in October. Crimp was awarded his cheque for Pounds 6,000 by Frances Barber, the actress, at the Hampstead Theatre yesterday. Previous winners of the award, which commemorates the playwright John Whiting, include Tom Stoppard, Peter Nicholls, Howard Brenton and David Edgar.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: Decadent opera comes good - David Murray reviews Decca's new series of 'Degenerate Music', or music banned by the Nazis MANY people know that the Nazis once staged a Munich exhibition of 'Degenerate Art', Entartete Kunst, by way of pillorying visual artists whose work they found offensive. The criteria stretched wide: artists and their works could qualify if they were any or all of (a) Jewish, (b) social-critical, (c) lurid in the eyes of decent folk, (d) abstractionist, or (e) sympathetic to Negroes. There was also, a little later - 1938, in Dusseldorf - a copycat exhibition of Entartete Musik, 'Degenerate Music'. There the criteria had to be fudged a bit. For (d), read 'atonalist", and for (e) 'sympathetic to jazz'; but (b) could be detected only in libretti and song-texts, and any plausible equivalent for (c) would take in, embarrassingly, grand old Richard Strauss (Salome] Elektra]) and even the one seriously respected composer with Nazi leanings, Hans Pfitzner. Thus the resultant exhibition was less effectively vicious than just confused and stupid. (When Bartok heard of the exhibition, he demanded that his music be included too.) The criteria for Decca's new CD series of Entartete Musik are no less generous. Any composer whose work was arguably significant but has been neglected, and whose fortunes suffered somehow under the Third Reich, seems to qualify. And why not? - it makes a good enough excuse for a welcome venture. One way and another, the Nazis did manage to deny performances to composers they judged inimical to their ethos. Careers were stifled or truncated, or driven to uncertain continuations in foreign lands, and German music certainly lost by that. Schoenberg and Hindemith were grave losses; Schreker and Zemlinsky were ruined. Decca has inaugurated its series, however, with two operas by utterly different composers. Erich Wolfgang Korngold (his middle name indicates the hopes vested in him by his music-critic father) began as a brilliant but innately conservative Wunderkind, a pre-'teen prodigy of competence in an early-middle-Strauss vein. Since Strauss himself had by then progressed to late-middle, it was unsurprising that even early-middle Korngold soon sounded passe, perfervid though it was, and that from 1934 he should find a lucrative permanent niche as a Hollywood film-composer. It was almost beside the point that the Nazis condemned his 1927 opera Das Wunder der Heliane as 'pornographic'. Yet it is a good, sour joke that what wrecked Heliane's prospects for continuing success was the outrageous campaign mounted by Korngold pere  - with epithets worthy of Nazi denunciations - against Ernst Krenek's hugely successful opera of the same year, Jonny spielt auf, 'Johnny strikes up'. Krenek (who died a year and a half ago aged 90) was a musician whose acute intelligence left him exposed to the virtues of every new musical mode. Before Jonny he had investigated free atonality and then neo-classicism; soon after it, he espoused Schoenberg's dodecaphony for good. Jonny, however, was a free-wheeling affair, with jazzy borrowings which at once prompted the label 'jazz opera'. It was no such thing, and in current lingo should count rather as 'post-modernist'. Not only does Krenek's score tack insouciantly between different idioms - late-Romantic, light operetta, chromatic abrasiveness, Stravinskian chorales and 'jazz', strictly associated with Jonny, the black American character - but the text (his own) plays off a soulful-artist's-crisis drama, as in Pfitzner or in Strauss's early Guntram, against amoral modern farce, the spectacular delights of new stage technology and the lusty allure of America. On the Decca set (436 631-2, two CDs) Lothar Zagrosek and the Leipzig Gewandhausorchester capture its dispassionate verve elegantly, and with an unerringly chosen cast: Heinz Kruse as the sweetly self-absorbed composer, Alessandra Marc's sumptuous soprano for his erring diva, Krister St. Hill (the parti-coloured young Swedish phenomenon) as the mischievous opportunist Jonny. Somehow there is a consistent Krenek voice through it all - and musically speaking, a fine variety of pace and tone, though recent stage revivals suggest that the story may be too slight for its playing-time. At the Almeida last summer, the astringent wit of Krenek's little 1945 one-acter What Price Confidence was a delightful revelation; Jonny, though more expansive, has plenty of that too. Contrariwise The Miracle of Heliane (436 636-2, three CDs) strikes me as a gangrenous monstrosity. The erotic 'mystery-play' that seized Korngold's cosseted imagination was vacuous, crypto-pornographic stuff, and he set it as an overcrowded sequence of overblown climaxes, replete with celestial celesta, harp, glockenspiel, piano and an overweening orchestra. Devotees of that dated idiom may warm to the strenuous vocal flights, which sound sincere and even noble from the mouth of Anna Tomowa-Sintow's Heliane, and fully committed from her co-principals John David de Haan (a liberating Dionysian stranger, as in Euripides' Bacchae) and Hartmut Welker as her grimly repressed royal husband. What the conductor John Mauceri draws from the Berlin Radio Symphony passes muster, though never on the Leipzig level. Szymanowski's 1926 King Roger, too, features a Dionysian ephebe who triggers seismic upheavals in the hearts of a royal pair; but here the drawn-out, 'untheatrical' music sustains an uncanny charge, hauntingly personal and original. There is a tantalising question about how far Szymanowski was aware of his homoerotic subtext. The new Schwann album (314 014 K2, two CDs), passionately sung and conducted - by Robert Satanowski with the forces of the Warsaw Teatr Wielki - surpasses the only previous version on records. Finally: in the post-modernist stakes Schnittke's scabrous, grossly inventive comedy Life with an Idiot (Sony S2K 52 495, two CDs) is a front-runner - bravely unabashed cast, recorded during the Rotterdam premieres last year, with Rostropovich conducting and terrific sound-effects. It is nevertheless so narrowly bound to its Ortonesque action that non-Russophones must either keep their eyes glued to the translation, or else let much of the music-drama pass by unheeded, tuning in only when it rises (as often it does) to a domineering pitch. Better, perhaps, to see the thing first (and blench), and then use the recording to recall the effect.</p>

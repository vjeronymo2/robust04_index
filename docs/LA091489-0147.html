			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS IN JAPAN DEFENDED BY MOSBACHER  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher predicted today that the Bush  Administration will treat U.S.-Japanese economic issues on an equal plane with  America's security alliance with Japan.  </P> <P> "I don't think you'll find the kind of schism we used to see" when security  concerns outweighed trade disputes in importance, Mosbacher told a breakfast  meeting with foreign correspondents.  </P> <P> The former businessman said President Bush "cares a great deal -- tremendously  -- about the alliance and friendship with Japan," then added, "But he doesn't  see that that precludes hard negotiations in the trade area."  </P> <P> Mosbacher said he did not think that negotiations that began last week to  remove impediments to trade would jeopardize America's defense alliance with  Japan. U.S. bases here, at which some 60,000 troops are stationed, play a key  role in American defense strategy throughout Asia.  </P> <P> "There's a little danger" that trade demands would jeopardize the alliance,  Mosbacher said, "but I think the earlier you lay these (trade issues) out and  talk about them, the better the chance of not having something fester and build  up (to the point) where you really get a rupture of friendship and alliance."  </P> <P> Mosbacher made the comments after delivering a biting speech at the Japan  National Press Club on Wednesday. In it, he declared that the "Japanese  consumer does not get a fair break in his own marketplace" and condemned Japan  as one of the "most closed" markets in the world.  </P> <P> "If Japanese consumers had the freedom to make the same choices that consumers  in other countries make, we would all be the richer for it," Mosbacher said.  </P> <P> He also warned that failure to achieve success in negotiations to remove  structural impediments to trade in both the United States and Japan would  threaten "the future of the world trading system." Japan, like the United  States, he said, needs "to temper its culture" to bring it "into line with the  times."  </P> <P> His remarks stirred sarcastic questions from Japanese reporters.  </P> <P> One of them, tongue-in-cheek, "thanked" Mosbacher for "your concern for the  Japanese consumer." The reporter then suggested that America's red ink in its  trade in Japan would not dwindle significantly even if Japan carried out all  the reforms Mosbacher suggested, and the reporter asked whether the United  States is prepared to tolerate any deficit, no matter how high, "as long as  Japanese consumers benefit."  </P> <P> Mosbacher said yes -- "if Japan has an open market." But he insisted that "the  plight of the consumer is a direct result of the lack of an open market in  Japan."  </P> <P> The commerce secretary was also attacked for his successful fight to overturn a  decision by the Reagan Administration and renegotiate a U.S.-Japan agreement  for the two countries to jointly develop a new Japanese fighter plane, dubbed  the FSX. The plane is modeled on the F-16 produced by General Dynamics.  </P> <P> A Japanese reporter said Defense Agency officials "are declaring publicly" that  they will never again work with the United States on joint weaponry development  and asked what guarantee Mosbacher could offer that Washington would uphold  future agreements.  </P> <P> Mosbacher offered no guarantee. Instead, he defended the reworked agreement as  "reasonable."  </P> <P> Another Japanese asked why the United States is urging Japan to carry out  sweeping reforms of its economic culture by next spring while the United States  is undertaking reforms that Washington acknowledges could take years to produce  results.  </P> <P> Instead of answering the question, Mosbacher said only: "Free trade, open  market. That's what everything is about."  </P> <P> Mosbacher, who declared earlier that Japan has made no moves to open its  markets, has been reminded by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that Japan had  increased its imports from the United States by $10 billion last year.  </P></p>

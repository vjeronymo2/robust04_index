			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> An angry American Indian family closed what has been a public road, claiming  that their ancestors never gave Madera County permission to use it. Echo Valley  Road is the only access to about 100 homes in the Sierra Nevada near Oakhurst.  Indian heirs of Frank Hammond formed a human barricade across the road and  asked residents to sign a form absolving them of any liability for injuries  that might happen on the 1,200-foot stretch they claim. Most residents signed  the form, but some just drove through, saying that the Hammond heirs were  legally wrong to try to land lock their properties. County Counsel Jeff Kuhn  said the county has offered $10,000 for the right-of-way, which has been used  as a public road since 1961, and is now considering condemnation proceedings to  reopen the road. The $10,000 offer was called "a slap in the face," by Harold  Hammond. "This is not about money," he said. "This is about principle. They  took something from us, and they don't give a damn."  </P></p>

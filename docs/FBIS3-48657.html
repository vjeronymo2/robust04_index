Branding this row of the South Korean puppets as an act  going  against the desire of the nation for reunification, the news  analyst says:    The puppets are carping on the North, crying over its  "commandos" and "provocation". But it is an old tune which  everyone is weary of hearing and a foolish phrase that can  convince no one.    "Emergency preparedness" on the lips of the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique means to make a war against the North a fait  accompli on the Korean peninsula according to the outside  forces' policy of aggression and to be prepared for mobilizing  all the human and material resources of South Korea.    The Kim Yong-sam clique ceaselessly staged military  exercises  in league with foreign forces of aggression last year and  mobilized even para-military forces in them beside the puppet  Army.    The puppets' outcries for "completion of allout combat  posture of civilians, government and Army" and "exercises  simulating actual war to provide against regular warfare"  suggest that they would be more frenzied in war rackets against  fellow countrymen by mobilizing even citizens this year.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is trying to divert elsewhere  the attention of people with the row of confrontation against  the North and thus tide over the crisis of the fascist rule.    The foul attempt of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however,  stands no chance of success.    Its confrontation row against the DPRK will invite fiercer  resentment of the people and precipitate its own destruction.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Processing side helps lift Strong and Fisher 47% Strong and Fisher, the leather and by-products group which is 88 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings, yesterday announced its second consecutive year back in profit with a 47 per cent rise at the pre-tax level from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.82m. Sales in 1993 were 7 per cent up at Pounds 89.9m (Pounds 84.1m). Mr Julian Dell, chief executive, said the group had performed well in spite of sharply higher raw material prices. Cattle and lambskin hides had risen by about 30 per cent. Finished product prices had begun to improve, but were not keeping pace with costs. The improvement in pre-tax profits was due largely to a Pounds 2m increase in operating profits to Pounds 2.4m in the leather processing business. The division had benefited from a reduction in capacity during 1992, and a focus on higher margin premium products. The by-products operation had also improved profits, with the return rising from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds 1.04m, in spite of lower volumes. Mr Dell was confident that the improvement would continue in the current year, although not at such high levels. The dividend was maintained at 1p. Earnings per share were 1.7p (1.32p) basic and fully-diluted 1.45p (1.19p). The company, which finished the year with cash balances of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 18.4m), said it would in time be looking for an acquisition to offset its dependence on the volatile leather market. However, this would not be for some months. It would first seek to conclude discussions over the size of Hillsdown's stake, the legacy of a rescue of the then-insolvent Strong and Fisher in 1990. It is expected that Hillsdown will seek to reduce its holding to at least 75 per cent in the coming months. If it does not, Strong and Fisher could lose its quote. Mr Dell said this was unlikely. Discussions were under way on a variety of proposals, he said. Hillsdown's stake rose from 70.3 per cent to 87.9 per cent in December when banks which had taken equity for debt in the rescue package exercised their options to sell.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Asda busy Interim results at the top end of market forecasts enabled Asda to continue its recent recovery, although profit-taking and other concerns restricted the final climb to just a penny at 56p. Turnover was a hefty 56m - the second biggest this year. However, the results did nothing to quell the debate over whether or not the food retail sector's recovery is likely to be sustained. Asda produced underlying sales growth ahead of the industry, with half-year sales up 9 per cent even without the benefit of any new store openings. But some analysts still professed concern over comments made by the Asda management that the group would continue to match the price cuts of its competitors. 'Asda has done all the right things but in doing so has stirred its competitors into price competition,' said Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones at Lehman Brothers. He remains negative on all the leading supermarket stocks. Others were less cautious, one leading sector analyst saying: 'The food retailing business has changed and people both within and outside the sector are beginning to live with it.' The recovery in shares yesterday reflected the more positive mood. J. Sainsbury gained 5 to 450p, Kwik Save 9 to 586p and Argyll 7 to 284p. Tesco, however, slipped 3 to 220p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Huang Nian-szu (7806 </F> 1819 2448): "The Chinese Ambassador to Britain Says the Chinese  Side Is Willing To Talk and Cooperate With the British Side on  Issues Other Than Hong Kong's Constitutional Reform"]    [Text] London, 23 Jun -- When talking about recent  Sino-British relations, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen  said that the Chinese Government is willing to talk and  cooperate with the British Government on issues other than Hong  Kong's constitutional reform. This is a pragmatic approach.    Ma Yuzhen told reporters yesterday that the Chinese  Government has taken account of Hong Kong's interests in  adopting this pragmatic attitude on current Sino-British  relations.    Both the Chinese and British sides clearly understand that  it  is impossible to hold talks again on Hong Kong's constitutional  reform, Ma Yuzhen pointed out; but both sides are aware that  there is still a need to cooperate on issues other than Hong  Kong's constitutional reform, he added.    He cited as an example that Hong Kong's economy and its  people's lives must not be ignored because the talks on Hong  Kong's constitutional reform have failed. In addition, China  and Britain must cooperate in international affairs and in their  economic and trade relations. British Foreign Office Minister  Alastair Goodlad will visit Beijing in July. This indicates  both sides' wish for cooperation.    On the prospects for Sino-British trade, which has received  attention in all circles, Ma Yuzhen said that the Chinese  Government welcomes British businessmen's investments in China  and hopes that British businessmen will have opportunities.</p>

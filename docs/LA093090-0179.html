			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PESTICIDE LEGISLATION SIGNED BY GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: KEY BILL WILL SET UP A RESEARCH CENTER WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF  CALIFORNIA. ALTERNATIVES TO MALATHION AND OTHER CHEMICALS WILL BE EXPLORED.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, saying California consumers "will not learn to live  with higher prices for maggot-infested fruit and vegetables," signed into law  Saturday six bills intended to give the state new weapons in its battles  against agricultural pests.  </P> <P> A key law in the package, designed to crack down on the Mediterranean and  Mexican fruit flies, will set up a center for pesticide research within the  University of California.  </P> <P> Aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion over Los Angeles and surrounding  cities over the last year prompted a prolonged outcry by residents and their  legislative representatives in Sacramento, claiming the spraying was  unhealthful.  </P> <P> The legislation signed by Deukmejian seeks to address these concerns by calling  for the UC center to search for alternatives to malathion and other  agricultural chemicals now in common use.  </P> <P> Three other bills in the package call for tougher inspections at air and sea  ports of entry, increased sterile fruit fly production and a long-term state  Department of Health Services study of the effects of aerial pesticide spraying  on humans.  </P> <P> Another bill places the Legislature on record seeking to reduce pesticide use  "to protect urban residents and the agricultural industry." The sixth bill  signed slightly raises a state assessment charged on the sales of registered  poisons.  </P> <P> "California's consumers and farmers deserve better protection from agricultural  pests," the governor said.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a foe of the malathion aerial  spraying in Southern California, the UC pesticide research center bill passed  the Assembly 47 to 24 and the Senate by 32 to 0.  </P> <P> Agricultural representatives opposed the measure because they said malathion  was the best way to cope with the fruit fly infestation that threatened the  livelihood of their constituents.  </P> <P> The fruit fly problem was a hot topic of discussion during the legislative  session that began in January with a flock of bills on the subject introduced  in both houses.  </P> <P> Last March, the debate prompted a rare committee of the whole in the Assembly  -- attended by all members -- to listen to top scientific and government  experts testify on the infestation, the health risks of spraying malathion and  alternatives to using the pesticide.  </P> <P> A Times poll that same month showed most Californians believed that the  Deukmejian Administration should temporarily halt the aerial spraying of  malathion until more studies were conducted regarding its possible health  hazards.  </P> <P> The Medfly infestation appeared to abate in the last two months and  agricultural officials are hopeful they can declare full victory by early  November. Some scientists, however, are convinced the pest is entrenched  statewide and detection of future infestations is inevitable.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the governor also signed a bill to create a new crime of stalking,  described as maliciously following or disturbing the peace of others with the  intent of making them fear death. It was authored by Sen. Edward R. Royce  (R-Anaheim).  </P></p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Premier League clubs count the cost of their breakaway: End-of-season concerns where pounds matter as much as points WHEN referee Keren Barratt blows his whistle tonight, ending the 1993 Cup Final replay between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, it will mark the end of a significant season for English soccer. The 22 clubs which broke away last summer to form the Football Association's Premier League will now be working out the financial winners or losers from the split with the 105-year-old English Football League. Pounds matter as much as points to hard-pressed clubs faced with expensive ground rebuilding programmes. Financial expertise is as important as soccer coaching skills - as Mr Terry Venables, Tottenham Hotspur's threatened chief executive, may yet dis-cover. Under the the Pounds 304m sponsorship deal with BSkyB each of the 22 clubs received Pounds 750,000 plus an equal share of separate Pounds 12m sponsorship deal with Bass, the brewers. In addition, clubs were paid Pounds 69,335 each time they appeared on television. The remaining 25 per cent of the BSkyB money was allocated according each team's final position in the league, with the top club, Manchester United, receiving about Pounds 850,000 - or 22 times more than the bottom club, Nottingham Forest. United, in spite of winning the championship, says it is not that much better off than it would have been under the old Football League. The financial attraction remains strong for the so-called English super clubs, such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, to promote a new European league of top soccer clubs joined by such clubs as Real Madrid of Spain, AC Milan of Italy, Benfica of Portugal and Ajax of Holland. So which clubs did gain from the new English Premier League? Most fees, under previous television deals, went to the handful of big clubs attracting the biggest gates. Under the new system every club is guaranteed several television appearances, to the delight of small clubs such as Wimbledon, which ended half-way down the league and in the previous 1991-92 season had a Pounds 4m turnover. Mr Reg Davis, commercial director of Wimbledon, said: 'Last season we didn't have any live TV appearances - this year we were featured three times.' He calculates that the club has emerged about Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m richer. It plans to pass this to fans by freezing season ticket prices next year. 'In the past we have had to sell a player a year to survive. This year we don't - we might even buy one,' Mr Davis said. For Manchester United, a quoted company which had a Pounds 17m turnover last year, the rise in income - even with its championship win - has been less impressive. Mr Robin Launders, finance director, said the club was 'relatively worse off' in television terms. Its games appeared fewer times on terrestrial television, which had an indirect effect on shirt sponsorship. 'The Premier League has had a levelling effect. We are better off from the league, but relatively speaking other clubs are even better off,' said Mr Launders. The place where the sums and the match points have become crucial, however, is on the cusp between the Premier League and the new Barclay's First Division, as the former second division is now known. In spite of pessimistic predictions that the appearance of the Premier League would lead to the decline of the other 70 football clubs, the three divisions of the Barclay's league seem relatively unscathed. According to Mr Ian Cotton, Football League spokesman, the three divisions have seen their seventh successive rise in attendances this year. Total attendance was 10.9m, 800,000 more than the Premier League. Mr Cotton said ITV's decision to feature more Football League First Division games had helped shirt sponsorship for all the clubs. ITV's Pounds 5.25m deal, however, does little to close the gap between Premier League and First Division clubs, which, following the Taylor report in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster, are required to convert to all-seater stadiums by August 1994. According to the Football League the report has al-ready prompted Pounds 73.9m worth of development work at First Division clubs, with another Pounds 215m planned. Mr Desmond McBain, club secretary of Bolton, just promoted into the First Division, said: 'Every club has got to fight to get into the Premier League now - it's a question of self preservation.' Although gate attendances rose by almost 50 per cent last year, the club still has little idea where finance for rebuilding will come from. Over the next two years the league will be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs. Mr Rick Parry, the Premier League's chief executive, denies that he will bow to pressure from the big clubs to make it even smaller and more exclusive. He insists that 'you cannot have a league with only five clubs'. But the pressure to make the league more exclusive seems likely to fuel the competition even further.</p>

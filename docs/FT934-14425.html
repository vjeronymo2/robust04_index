			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: High times in Hong Kong - At a glance Hong Kong's Hang Seng index has been hitting new highs for the last fortnight, in spite of the lack of progress in talks between Britain and China over the colony's future. There has been strong demand from foreign investors, chiefly US mutual fund managers, who have recently increased their weighting for Hong Kong. UK fund managers have also been enthusiastic about Hong Kong's potential. Price earnings ratios make the Hong Kong market seem good value to US investors, even given the political risk. Cooling-down measures being implemented in China do not yet appear to have had a negative impact; general opinion seems to be that the Chinese economy will have a soft landing.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD PROPOSES NEW ACCOUNTING RULES  </P> <P> In a flurry of activity this week, accounting rule makers announced plans to  set standards that may cost individuals and industry billions of dollars.  </P> <P> The Financial Accounting Standards Board, an organization that sets rules for  financial reporting at publicly held companies, sent out two separate  "statements" advising companies and accountants of upcoming changes this week.  </P> <P> One such change will force companies to set up reserves for their employees'  post-retirement medical benefits instead of paying these benefits out of  current earnings, which is the general industry practice.  </P> <P> Some industry experts believe that if corporations did nothing to restrict  their costs (that is, cut back on employee benefits), this rule could cut  corporate profits by upward of $200 billion over a period of years.  </P> <P> The other rule is designed to give shareholders more current information about  company-held investment portfolios. But company insiders and analysts complain  that it will force financial institutions to spend millions hiring legions of  actuaries and accountants to do nothing but comply with the proposed rule.  </P> <P> Neither rule will go into effect immediately. The medical benefit rule, for  example, starts in 1993. And the other could be delayed even longer. But  already companies and their consultants are scrambling -- trying to change  their operations in ways that will make these rules less costly.  </P> <P> "This will have a significant impact on companies, their financial results and  their employees," said Marsha Venturi, consulting actuary with Buck Consultants  in Secaucus, N.J., about the retirement benefit rule. "When companies take a  good look at how expensive those benefits are, they are going to start  re-evaluating what they provide."  </P> <P> Already Venturi says several of her clients have changed benefit programs to  limit their future expenses. Some are requiring retirees to ante up more per  month for their own insurance, others are capping company-paid benefits and  others are making working employees contribute more to pay for benefits they  may collect when they retire.  </P> <P> In short, companies may find their earnings hit by the rule, but employees will  feel the pinch, too, Venturi added.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, financial services companies are still trying to fight a proposed  rule that would force them to disclose the current market value of their loans  and investment portfolios in the footnotes of their financial statements.  </P> <P> Although these footnotes are generally read only by accountants, financial  analysts and reporters, some complain that calculating the figure will require  legions of accountants and actuaries.  </P> <P> The rules would apply to all companies, but banks, savings and loans and  insurance firms would be most affected because they often hold large portfolios  of loans and investments.  </P> <P> These assets are generally recorded on their books at their original purchase  prices. The accounting rule makers want companies to say what the assets would  be worth if they had to sell them today.  </P> <P> "This will cost millions. Serious millions," said Joyce Culbert, vice president  of research at Firemark Insurance Research in Parsippany, N.J. "Insurance  companies would have to have appraisers on staff to re-evaluate every  (shopping) mall. And you'd need another horde of actuaries to figure out the  present value of your insurance policies. This would be exceptionally costly."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, many industry observers favor the new rules because they say they  will give investors a better picture of a company's true financial health.  Post-retirement benefits can be a huge liability. And if it is not disclosed,  investors could be blindsided when a company is forced to start paying these  benefits from current earnings.  </P> <P> Moreover, financial services regulators have been widely criticized for  allowing "once-upon-a-time" accounting of investment portfolios.  </P> <P> Accounting standards that didn't require up-to-the-minute disclosure of what  assets were worth were cited as a major problem in the savings and loan  debacle. Some experts maintain that regulators simply didn't know how sick some  thrifts had become because accounting rules didn't force them to disclose when  their investments had soured.  </P></p>

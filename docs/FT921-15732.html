			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: Making a drama out of a movie: Television Several times over the years this column has complained about the broadcasters' habit of applying the word 'Film' to pieces of fiction which have never had a proper cinema release. Quite often the production has had nothing whatsoever to do with the cinema and yet it is tagged in Radio Times with the reversed white-on-black 'Film' logo normally applied to real movies, and in TV Times with the even more explicit black-on-white 'Film' logo with sprocket holes down the sides which unmistakably symbolises celluloid and, to most viewers, says 'This is a real movie'. Many newspapers have adopted a similar device which most use not at their own discretion but when advised to by the broadcasters. Before going any further let us deal with that word 'movie': it has only one meaning and everyone understands it, whereas a 'film' can be anything from the little spool on which you take your holiday snaps to a wildlife documentary by David Attenborough. Thus 'movie' will be the word used here to mean a feature film made for the cinema. But why all the fuss? There is, surely, less and less distinction between fiction made for the cinema and for television; does anybody really care any more? Ten years ago, as we approached the launch of Channel 4, that was becoming a popular attitude. Channel 4 proposed to use its drama budget and its corporate clout to destroy the differences. The chronically troubled British cinema was to be revivified by British television (long the repository of drama talents which in the US or France would have lived solely in cinema) and work such as The Company Of Wolves, The Draughtsman's Contract and My Beautiful Laundrette would be either commissioned or co-produced by Channel 4 and shown on both large and small screens. At the time this policy seemed not only attractive but inspired and almost heroic. Simultaneously we were getting used to the American idea of a pecking order for movie release, starting with metropolitan cinemas and moving on to local cinemas, video rental outlets, satellite subscription channels, pay cable, terrestrial television, sell-through video and local television. There was, furthermore much talk of 'convergence', meaning the tendency of all the mass media and information industries - film, video, computer games, television, Reuters reports - to converge on the customer's VDU. Under these circumstances what could it matter whether a bit of fiction had originally been intended for the cinema or for television? Ten years ago I would have subscribed to the convergence theory, and put considerable faith in Channel 4's drive to dismantle the barriers. But a decade later, having watched not only the three comparatively successful works named above but also a succession of hybrids such as The Ploughman's Lunch, Good And Bad At Games and Remembrance, lacking both the power of continuity that you get with good television drama series, and the 'big occasion' feel of real movies, I find myself once again deeply suspicious of the claim that there are no significant differences. With the word 'convergence' slumbering again in the dictionary and Channel 4 having pretty well abandoned its hybrid policy, the Christmas and new year holiday, with its scores of television dramas and movies of all vintages, seemed like an ideal occasion to do a little survey. The result was far more definite than I would have expected. Once in a blue moon you will find a movie which television might have produced as one of its own dramas. Baby Boom, for instance, with Diane Keaton playing a New York yuppie who 'inherits' a baby in a will, drops out of the rat race, and ends up making gourmet baby food in Vermont, could perfectly well have been made for television. Yet it would inevitably have been a series, not a one-off, and the whole idea would have been stretched out like chewing gum, thin and sagging in the middle. Not that the movie was any great shakes. Even more rarely you come across a television production which could conceivably have been created for the cinema, for example BBC1's Bernard And The Genie, in which Lenny Henry played a cool genie making his first appearance for a couple of millennia, and for the first time outside the Middle East. Many of the lines were well up to the standard you would expect from Richard Curtis, who co-wrote the Blackadder series: 'You met Jesus?' 'Of course. He helped out with the wine at my brother's wedding'. And, 'If I could just memorise the songs of Mr Barry White I could snog every babe from Mount Hebron to the Red Sea'. One of the reasons this seemed so atypical of television (British television, anyway) is that it was full of magic and special effects, and thus non-naturalistic. The new British drama in the last fortnight, both one-offs and series, has shown once again, as though we needed showing, that the home industry is dedicated unwaveringly to realism, either social realism (agonising family situations) and/or, more commonly still, surface realism. No matter how far fetched the plots of Miss Marple or Poirot, no matter how incongruous the accents, the sets and locations are dressed with an obsession for surface detail which now amounts to fetish. I cannot swear to it, but I believe I saw the handle of a 1950s Gaggia espresso coffee machine behind David Suchet's head in the supposedly 1936 setting of 'The ABC Murders' on ITV on Sunday: that is the sort of point-scoring to which we are being driven. The more you watch and the more you compare, the clearer becomes the difference between movies and television drama. With television you are perpetually aware that the material has been officially 'approved' by some bossyboots who sincerely believes that he knows better than you do what is good for you. Of course cinema has had to put up with the Hays Office and the British Board of Film Censors, yet despite such bodies there has always been greater freedom in the cinema. Even something as simple and funny as the free-wheeling sexuality in A Fish Called Wanda, shown on BBC1, with Jamie Lee Curtis turned on by her lovers speaking Italian or Russian is difficult to imagine in a television-originated fiction. The most telling evidence, however, was in BBC1's screening of The Accused last Thursday. This movie, with Jodie Foster playing a young woman who is gang-raped in a bar after she has been drinking, smoking pot, and giving an exhibition of suggestive dancing, has been criticised as 'exploitive' because it includes an explicit depiction of the rapes. It may be legitimate to argue that the scene should not be there at all, though to me it seems essential since it is the viciousness of the men's behaviour - the foul language of the hysterical onlookers as well as the brutality of the actual rapists - which will silence those viewers who argue 'She asked for it'. No woman ever asks for that. What is surely not legitimate is to re-edit that scene, as the BBC did, cutting out the swear words and deleting the painful and horrifying scenes from the rapes, so that it all becomes that much more harmless and acceptable. Not only does this destroy the power of the scene to silence the apologists, it also obscures the second and perhaps even more important message: that rape has practically nothing to do with sex and everything to do with violence. The BBC behaved like some dim old fool taking a knife to the private parts of all the nudes in the National Gallery to 'save' the rest of us from 'offence': an act guaranteed to insult the artist, the subject, and the public. Worst of all, having bowdlerised the movie, they then had the cheek to send out billings, to be accompanied by all those 'Film' logos, claiming to offer 'The first showing on network television of this graphic and disturbing drama' for all the world as though they really were showing the work as directed by Jonathan Kaplan and including the full Oscar-winning performance of Jodie Foster. The time has surely come for programme journals and newspapers to take it upon themselves to explain when a movie is really a movie and when it is something different.</p>

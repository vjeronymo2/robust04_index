			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Changchun (6392 7022 2504)] </F>   [Text] Helsinki, 4 May (XINHUA) -- (Numining), chairman of  the Finnish-Chinese Trade Association, hosted a welcoming  luncheon here today for the visiting Li Ruihuan, chairman of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They both  delivered speeches at the luncheon and said that they would make  common efforts to further promote the development of economic  and trade relations between the two countries.    At the beginning of his speech, Li Ruihuan briefed those at  the luncheon on China's reform and opening up. He said that  1994 marks an important year for China's continued reform  efforts. This year will see the concentrated introduction of  the largest number of new reform measures. The new reform  measures will be unprecedented in terms of their scale, scope,  difficulty, and their being in-depth in nature. Our general  policy is: seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider,  promote development, and maintain stability. With the  advancement of reform and opening up, China's economy has made  great strides and has entered the period of sustained, rapid,  and healthy development, which gives foreign businesses a great  opportunity for carrying out economic and trade cooperation with  China.    Li Ruihuan said that Finland is an industrialized and  developed country and that it possesses advanced technologies in  many economic sectors. Seen from the perspective of the  complementary nature of the two countries' economies and from  the respective countries' economic strengths, there are great  potentials for cooperation between the two countries, and such  potentials need to be further tapped. He added that he would  like to take this opportunity to tell Finish business circles  that the Finnish experience means much to China, that Finnish  technology is useful to China, and that China is interested in  and has confidence in expanding economic and trade relations  with Finland. China welcomes more Finnish businessmen to invest  in China, to trade with China, and to participate in China's  modernization construction.    (Numining) said that China's reform and opening up have  provided conditions for expanding Finnish-Chinese economic and  trade cooperation and have helped make it possible for the two  countries to achieve marked progress in their bilateral economic  and trade ties. The increase in the exchange of high-level  visits in recent years has further promoted the economic and  trade relationship between the two countries. He expressed the  belief that Chairman Li's current visit would further promote  the development of bilateral economic and trade ties.    Li Ruihuan also fielded Finnish businessmen's questions at  the luncheon.</p>

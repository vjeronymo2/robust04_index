			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleksa Kurpas: "A Pig in a Poke From Meshkov"] </F>   [Text] On the economic front in the confrontation between  the Crimea and Ukraine, the latter has sustained a defeat. On  11 April, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed three edicts  under the numbers 37/94, 38/94, and 39/94.... These are the  edicts "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," "On Banks  and Banking Activity," and "On the Improvement of Taxation and  the System of Settlements in the Economic Circulation." This  has become a real shock for Ukraine's entrepreneurs.    For example, the first of the edicts allows the circulation  on the Crimean territory of any foreign currency and, to spite  Zvyahilskyy, it envisages the creation of the Crimean Interbank  Currency Exchange. By the second edict, the peninsula has  placed Ukraine's National Bank and our commercial banks in a  quite desperate situation. At present, the Central Bank in the  Crimea may carry out functions of a national bank (with the  exception of issuing money). It may be expected that newly  created Crimean banks will gather speed very fast, because low  fixed capital will be assigned to them and they will be allowed  to purchase and sell precious metals and stones, as well foreign  securities. Incidentally, it is now possible to expect a  difference in the rates of exchange of the Ukrainian karbovanets  because in the Crimea, its rate of exchange will be determined  through auctions at the Currency Exchange.    The third edict is a blow below the waist to Ukraine's  Ministry of Finance. It envisages immediate replacement of the  income tax by the tax (30 percent) on the profit and further  improvement of the taxation system with canceling many types of  Ukrainian taxes.    If these innovations are taken into account, it may be  expected that the activity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs will be  focused precisely on the Crimea. The Crimea is now becoming a  kind of entrepreneurs' paradise through which money can be  easily transferred abroad (incidentally, this mainly attracts  shadow capital). Crimea itself will lose large sums of money,  because the profit of enterprises will immediately become  (artificially) minimal.    Yet, there also is a positive aspect: Such free  convertibility of the karbovanets may be fabulously instrumental  in raising its rate of exchange. However, an economic  confrontation has added up to the political confrontation  between the Crimea and Ukraine.</p>

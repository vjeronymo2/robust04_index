			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> STEP TAKEN TOWARD SCHOOLS REHABILITATION  </P> <P> The La Habra City School District has completed the first step in a process  that may result in the rehabilitation of school buildings on four of its eight  sites.  </P> <P> According to Supt. Rich Hermann, architectural drawings of the four school  buildings scheduled to be upgraded have been submitted for review. He said the  next phase depends on voter reaction to two proposed June, 1990, bond issues  that would provide funds for the construction and rehabilitation of district  school buildings.  </P> <P> Four schools now qualify for funding, Hermann said. The required paper work and  architectural renderings are being completed for submission to state offices.  </P> <P> Hermann said that school districts are prohibited by state law from using state  lottery funds for buildings. The superintendent described his view as "mildly  optimistic" regarding the chances that the bond issue will pass.  </P> <P> The schools scheduled for rehabilitation include Walnut, Las Lomas and Sierra  Vieta elementary schools and Washington Middle School.  </P></p>

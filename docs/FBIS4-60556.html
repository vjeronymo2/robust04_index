			<p>BFN     [Text] The expanded national symposium attended by the  leaderships of political parties and organizations, trade unions  and mass and professional organizations; tribal chiefs and  ulema; social figures, intellectuals and youth representatives;  and all national forces and personages in all parts of the  Yemeni homeland, ended in Sanaa last night.    The symposium issued a statement saying that the national  symposium's pledge of allegiance to brother Lieutenant General  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, is a  sincere pledge for the command of the battle for unity, for  confronting secession, and for the march toward entrenching  security and stability, and building a united Yemen which  rejects partition, fragmentation, and the relinquishment of any  inch of its territory--the Yemen of brotherhood, tolerance, and  love. The symposium reiterated absolute condemnation and  complete rejection of al-Bid's secessionist declaration and  emphasized confrontation of the secessionists led by the traitor  of the homeland, revolution, and nation, 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    The statement appealed to the Socialist Party leadership,  cadres, and broad base which believe in unity and the homeland,  to move fast and align with people's masses and political and  national forces to face the threat and protect unity and  constitutional legitimacy, and bury the crime of secession for  ever.    The statement warned all states and regional and  international organizations of the danger of dealing with the  secessionist clique and said that the entire Yemeni people will  regard such dealing as a flagrant hostile act against every  Yemeni citizen and an interference in the internal affairs of  the Republic of Yemen. The statement appealed to our Arab  brothers and friends in the world, and all good men to rally  round the Yemeni people, unity, progress, and stability.</p>

At this initial meeting, the committee will complete action on all procedural matters and establish a target date for submission of its recommendations. We expect that the target date would be no later than July, 1994. We anticipate a publication of a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking not later than October, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (4): A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - Venue for the 1996 Olympics / Atlanta stands to prosper much from the Olympics. In return, the guardians of the Olympic movement know they will get a superbly organised sporting extravaganza, delivered via the latest technology to several billion homes around the globe After visiting Atlanta for even a few short days, it is impossible not to marvel at the feat achieved four years ago, when the International Olympic Committee was persuaded to award the centennial games to this thriving, but in many ways unremarkable, American city. In September 1990, most observers believed Athens would be chosen as host for 1996. Given the historic ties between the Greek city and the Olympics - the first modern games were held there in 1896, so there would have been a perfect symmetry in returning a century later - the allure of Athens must have been powerful. Atlanta, in contrast, was a city best known for having been razed to the ground during the Civil War. How could it possibly win against Athens? Mr Billy Payne, the Atlanta lawyer whose idea it was in the first place to bid for the Olympics and who spearheaded the campaign to win the centennial games, is still not quite sure exactly how it happened. Suffice to say, he remembers the vote for Atlanta in 1990 as a 'miracle.' At the time, there was much cynical carping about how Atlanta won the games because, like Los Angeles in 1984, it would generate huge profits for the Olympic movement. Or because Coca-Cola, the long-time Olympic sponsor, was based in the city. Or because only American organisational know-how could cope with the logistic nightmare that the games had become. However, Mr Payne, who is now president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG), insists that Atlanta's victory had nothing to do with money, or corporate influence, or notions of competence - 'we had a strategy . . . that at this most important time in sports history, the people who had the power to award the right to host these games would do so to people that they trusted and that they liked. So we set about to do nothing more complicated than to assure them that they could trust us to take the Olympic movement into our custody at this important time, and do it great honour and justice. It was just that simple.' It was also a simple fact back in 1990, however, that Atlanta stood to prosper hugely from the Olympics, and the Olympics from Atlanta. The latest economic impact study estimates that Atlanta and the state of Georgia will benefit to the tune of 80,000 jobs and Dollars 5.1bn in direct and indirect spending, with a minimum Dollars 200m in incremental sales tax revenue pouring into state coffers. In return, the guardians of the Olympic movement know they will get a superbly organised sporting extravaganza, delivered via the latest technology, and with the backing of some of the world's largest companies, to several billion homes around the globe. All of the money needed to run the games will come out of private sector pockets (although a small amount of public funds will be be spent on areas such as security, transportation and street repair). Yet, in spite of the financial success of the Los Angeles games, Mr Payne says that raising Dollars 1.6bn has not been easy - 'we started in a very difficult economy in 1990, and so it's happened a little bit slower than we wanted it to. Of the Dollars 1.6bn, between the amounts already under contract through television revenues and sponsorships, and the amounts that will come later from tickets, merchandising and concessions ..we're about 92 per cent complete. So we've got to raise another Dollars 150m, and we've already got the companies and product categories targeted.' Construction of the new Olympic stadium and the athletes village is well under way and on target to meet the completion deadlines. Of the Dollars 1.6bn that will be spent on the 1996 games, about 35 per cent of the money will come from television (NBC paid a record Dollars 456m for the US rights), another approximately 35 per cent from corporate sponsors (such as Coca-Cola, IBM, Visa International and Matsushita), 15 per cent from ticket sales, 10 per cent from licensing and related merchandising sales, and a final 5 per cent from the sale of Olympic-related assets after the games are complete. And in theory, when it is all over the Atlanta games should register a profit. Inevitably, the people of the Atlanta, its community leaders and its politicians are keen to know what how they will profit from the games. Managing civic expectations, in fact, has been one of ACOG's toughest tasks. In 1990, it was hoped that considerable Olympics-related money would be spent on improving conditions in Atlanta's blighted inner city areas. Although some spending on infrastructure and services is planned, and Dollars 8.1m has been pledged from the Woodruff Foundation to help spruce up some neighbourhoods, many of those expectations have not been met. Over the past few years, the Corporation for Olympic Development in Atlanta (the body created by the former mayor, Mr Maynard Jackson, to lead the city's efforts to leverage the games) has identified Dollars 238m in public works that it believes are needed in the city. Yet, private sector funds have not been forthcoming for those works, which has created some bitterness within the community. Pressure groups like the Atlanta Olympic Conscience Coalition, which wants to see housing and development in the inner city neighbourhoods tied to the games, want the Olympics to do more for Atlanta's neediest communities. While Mr Payne says that hopes were too high from the start, he admits that the city and the organisers were slow to address the needs of the local community - 'there was originally an anticipation that it would not get done unless the Olympic committee paid for it. That was an unrealistic expectation,' he says. 'Now, however, we have a very pro-active mayor, a state that is beginning to feel the Olympics extend beyond Atlanta, and a private community that supports the projects like the park (the Dollars 50m, 60-acre Centennial Park that will be constructed in downtown Atlanta for the games) . . . but the Olympics are not a cure-all for every social issue that possesses this urban environment.' Arguments over who should benefit from the Olympics and how to divide the spending pie, however, are as old as the games themselves. Ultimately, few in Atlanta are likely to complain that the Olympics should never have arrived on their doorstep. For a place that has been proclaiming itself as 'the next great international city' for the best part of 50 years, the games are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make an impact on the world stage. Atlanta, a city that does not exactly suffer from a lack of self-confidence, is primed to do just that.</p>

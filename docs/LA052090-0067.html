			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE MISSILE LIMITS APPROVED;  </P> <P> ARMS TALKS: SUPERPOWER NEGOTIATORS CLEAR THE WAY FOR A TREATY. THEY AGREE TO  HALT PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS. BUT THE DEBATE ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS IS  STALLED.  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union reached agreement Saturday on limiting  air- and sea-launched cruise missiles, a key issue in a new treaty that will  substantially reduce the superpowers' nuclear arsenals.  </P> <P> Secretary of States James A. Baker III, concluding four days of intense  negotiations with Soviet leaders, said that difficult compromises were required  but that the agreements clear the way for a treaty this year and would open  negotiations for a subsequent treaty on reducing strategic arms.  </P> <P> President Bush is expected to sign a joint declaration on the fundamental  elements of the new treaty with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the  centerpiece of the Soviet-American summit meeting next week in Washington.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said that although a number of  difficult issues remain, largely concerned with ensuring the two countries'  compliance with the proposed pact, he is "confident now that the treaty on  reducing strategic arms can be prepared for signature before the end of this  year."  </P> <P> The treaty is expected to reduce by 30% or 35% the number of nuclear weapons  the two superpowers have.  </P> <P> The superpowers also reached an agreement on halting the production of chemical  weapons and destroying 80% of their present stockpiles of such weapons.  Following an international treaty outlawing chemical arms, they would proceed  with the stage-by-stage destruction of the rest of their stockpiles.  </P> <P> Baker called this accord on chemical arms "a trailblazing agreement" that would  "provide a real pathway toward a global ban on horrific weapons that we already  know from bitter experience actually get used." Its signing will be another  summit highlight.  </P> <P> Soviet and U.S. negotiators also concluded protocols that will implement two  treaties, originally agreed upon 15 years ago, limiting the size of underground  nuclear tests and of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. The protocols  provide for the treaties' verification, including on-site inspection.  </P> <P> And an agreement was worked out on cooperation in preventing the proliferation  of nuclear and chemical weapons and the spread of the technology required to  develop and manufacture missiles.  </P> <P> But no progress was reported on reducing conventional armed forces in Europe.  Negotiations in this area, now under way in Vienna, remain in "gridlock," Baker  said, apparently because of Soviet reluctance to move until the future  political and military status of a reunified Germany is settled.  </P> <P> In Texas, Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said that the  Soviets are "stonewalling" on the conventional forces talks. But the two sides  had achieved a breakthrough in Mosocw on strategic arms, he told reporters  traveling with the President en route to a commencement address at the  University of Texas. Some "minor things" remain to be settled, he said, but  "not treaty stoppers."  </P> <P> Baker said he had discussed a variety of other issues -- German reunification,  regional conflicts in Afghanistan and Central America, Jewish emigration and  Lithuania's bid for independence from the Soviet Union -- in final preparation  for the Washington summit.  </P> <P> "These have been some of the most intensive discussions we have had with our  Soviet counterparts during this Administration," Baker told a press conference.  "In short, we have been engaged in some heavy lifting to lock in agreements by  the time of the summit between President Bush and President Gorbachev."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said that the agreements on a number of difficult arms control  issues had laid the basis for further Soviet-American rapprochement at the  Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting.  </P> <P> "Final decisions and solutions in principle were found here with respect to  many issues," he said at a separate press conference. "We can now say that the  state visit of President Gorbachev will constitute an important and fruitful  phase in the development of the Soviet-American dialogue."  </P> <P> The Moscow negotiations were on the verge of breakdown several times as the  carefully balanced compromises were upset by new elements.  </P> <P> "This was not really easy to achieve -- I won't conceal it," Shevardnadze said  of the strategic arms agreements. "At this final stage, talks and negotiations  take on their own characteristics. Any progress forward is achieved by reaching  balanced decisions, creating packages.  </P> <P> "There were points when it seemed that our packages were about to fall apart,"  he continued. "It is very important in situations like this not to yield to  panic or become desperate but to continue to persist and move forward."  </P> <P> Although the breakthroughs were achieved in Baker's five hours of talks with  Gorbachev on Friday, he and Shevardnadze met late into the evening, put their  teams of negotiators into all-night bargaining sessions and then resumed their  own meetings on Saturday, delaying Baker's departure by eight hours.  </P> <P> The toughest issues, Baker said, were the limits to be imposed on air-launched  cruise missiles under the new treaty and on a way to limit the deployment of  sea-launched cruise missiles.  </P> <P> The sea-launched missiles will not be included in the treaty but will be  covered by politically binding declarations limiting the number of such  missiles to 880 for each side and setting their maximum range at 600 kilometers  (about 375 miles).  </P> <P> This formula establishes a limit on sea-launched cruise missiles, as demanded  by Moscow, but keeps it outside the treaty and thus not subject to  verification, which Washington had insisted would be impossible without  disclosing which ships carried the weapons.  </P> <P> The limit of 880 missiles imposes no real restriction, since the United States  had planned to deploy no more than 760 and the Soviet Union probably fewer.  Each nation will inform the other every year of the number of missiles it has  deployed and the number it expects to deploy over the next five years.  </P> <P> The compromise, concluded in the negotiations Saturday, runs along the same  lines as the one reached in February. But that had appeared to unravel last  month as Moscow weighed the whole package and concluded it was giving more than  it was getting on key issues.  </P> <P> To reach the compromise required on air-launched cruise missiles, the United  States agreed to the range of 375 miles wanted by the Soviet Union after Moscow  agreed that a new, conventionally armed U.S. missile, known as Tacit Rainbow  and employing stealth technology that makes it hard to detect, would be  exempted from the limits despite its longer range.  </P> <P> The negotiators also worked out a series of complicated rules on how to count  cruise missiles that might be carried by long-range bombers.  </P> <P> A number of issues remain to be resolved before the joint declaration can be  signed, U.S. and Soviet officials said, and a team of Soviet negotiators will  go to Washington at midweek to continue the talks. In Geneva, U.S. and Soviet  negotiators will be asked to complete the drafting of the statement of  objectives for the next strategic arms treaty. And at least four months will be  needed to finish negotiating this treaty, the officials added.  </P> <P> The issues still unresolved concern verification of both countries' compliance  with the agreed limits, with ways to prevent any circumvention of the treaty,  and limits on some weapons, including the Soviet Union's Backfire bomber.  </P> <P> "The primary issues were the ones that we wound up ultimately resolving," Baker  said. "These have been issues that have been very vexing in these negotiations  for a long, long time."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said these agreements were "really the main result" of the four  days of talks, and he praised Baker's determination to get an agreement and  what he called his "high professionalism" in the difficult negotiations.  </P> <P> Baker expressed disappointment that no progress was made on reducing  conventional armed forces in Europe, saying that the United States had put  forward proposals on key issues in the hope of obtaining an early agreement and  holding an all-European summit by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said that the Soviet Union needs time to study the U.S. proposals  and review them with other members of the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> But he made it clear that Moscow is not likely to move until its security is  assured in the wake of German reunification, and Soviet leaders discussed those  issues extensively with Baker.  </P> <P> "The formation of all-European security structures might speed up the process  of German unification and the development of the required security for  everyone," Shevardnadze said.  </P> <P> "But German unification is the problem of problems. It is a very complicated  and difficult issue. . . . We find totally unacceptable the idea of the entry  of a unified Germany into NATO. We must search for a solution that will meet  both the interests of the Soviet Union and the West," the Soviet foreign  minister added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cruise Missiles  </P> <P> An article by retired Vice Adm. John M. Lee on reductions in sea-launched  cruise missiles appears on Page 7 of today's Opinion section. It went to press  before Saturday's announcement in Moscow of a preliminary U.S.-Soviet agreement  on this type of weapon.  </P></p>

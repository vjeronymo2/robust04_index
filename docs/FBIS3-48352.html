Manuchehr Mottaki, who is deputy foreign minister for legal  and consulate affairs, made the remark while discussing  Tehran-Pyongyang relations with North Korean Foreign Minister  Kim Yong-nam.    Mottaki referred to the chaotic unstable situation in  countries neighboring Iran and said Tehran makes efforts for  preserving peace and security in Central Asia, Afghanistan and  the Persian Gulf.    Referring to the 1988 visit to North Korea of the leader of  the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, who was then in  the capacity of Iran's president, Kim reiterated that the spirit  of the joint communique issued then by the two countries still  was prevailing over bilateral relations.

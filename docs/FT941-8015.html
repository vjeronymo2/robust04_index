			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / MP urges halt to work on pit A Conservative MP yesterday urged the government to intervene to prevent British Coal removing more equipment from a pit for which it is considering rival bids by two companies. Mr Peter Atkinson, MP for Hexham, is questioning why British Coal has intensified what he described as 'scorched-earth activities' at Wearmouth Colliery, Sunderland, while giving assurances that no equipment will leave Ellington, Northumberland, while a private takeover remains possible. Mr Atkinson accused British Coal of stripping Wearmouth of all essential equipment before a decision was made on private bids. The MP said bidders were concerned at the continuing removal of coal-cutting equipment and hydraulic roof supports. Such new equipment can cost more than Pounds 5m per face and may be hard to replace. Mr Atkinson said British Coal on Friday ordered removal of the shearer and supports from Wearmouth's second face, a move which would leave the pit with no cutting equipment. He doubted that Longannet in Scotland, where both Wearmouth shearers are being sent, needed so much equipment. His comments coincided with confirmation that new cutting equipment was delivered to Ellington and sent underground this month, barely 48 hours before the closure announcement. 'Until a pit's closure is announced things carry on as normal,' said British Coal yesterday. Wearmouth bidders had been told what equipment would remain, it said. In December, the corporation said it planned to remove equipment with a written-down value of Pounds 8.3m from the pit.</p>

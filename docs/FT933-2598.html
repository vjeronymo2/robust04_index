			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (3): Ailing companies need help - Emiko Terazono investigates the restructuring of corporate Japan In the late 1980s, mergers and acquisitions for Japanese companies meant overseas expansion through the purchase of an international network, buying a US movie studio, or diversifying into new businesses. But some corporations, facing the fourth year of falling profits and under pressure to restructure operations, now regard merger and acquisitions as a means of surviving the current economic slump. As a result the opportunity now is the restructuring of corporate Japan. Deals in which distressed companies are taken over by larger domestic companies are now the mainstream of M&amp;A in Japan. Japanese companies' purchases of other Japanese corporations rose by 18.5 per cent in value last year. Ailing companies, hit by falling profits and higher capital costs - particularly smaller manufacturers and service businesses - are in need of assistance. Earlier this year Nippon Steel, the country's largest steel company, indicated interest in buying a majority stake in NMB Semiconductor, a struggling electronics company. NMB was a subsidiary of Minebea, the world's leading maker of miniature bearings. Minebea entered the semiconductor market in 1984 as part of a diversification programme. However, the losses at Minebea made it impossible for the company to support NMB, which was hit by the sharp downturn of the world electronics industry. A more recent rescue was that of Cosmo Securities, a second tier broker, by Daiwa Bank. Cosmo posted an extraordinary loss of Y69.8bn as a result of its tobashi deals (or shuffling of one client's account to another to avoid realisation of investment losses). Daiwa injected more than Y70bn through share purchases of Cosmo; it become its major shareholder, with more than a 50 per cent stake. The government says that Daiwa's acquisition of Cosmo is an exception. Although banks have been allowed partial entrance into the securities industry since last April, the government has yet to allow commercial banks to hold stock broker affiliates. The ministry of finance also waived a rule which forbids banks to hold more than 5 per cent of a company. However, the financial community is now placing bets on the next brokerage bailout, because the rescue of Cosmo comes at a time when smaller brokers, which depend on retail commissions for revenue, are in dire need of financial help, as trading volume of the stock market has plunged. Aside from the tobashi losses, Cosmo itself posted a pre-tax loss of Y150m for the first four months to July, as a result of the sluggish stock market. Although the trend seems to be offering a chance for overseas companies looking to buy Japanese companies at cheap prices, the number of acquisitions by foreign companies has been limited. An official at Nomura Wasserstein Perella, the M&amp;A subsidiary of Nomura Securities, says that although there are opportunities, there have been no large acquisitions, but small joint ventures, for strategic reasons. According to a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick, purchasers last year included Ciba-Geigy, Atochem, and Philips. Eight out of 43 deals were in pharmaceuticals, seven in industrial machinery and chemicals, six in computers. As for Japanese companies' acquisitions abroad, deals by value fell by 64 per cent last year. A market is emerging for the resale of foreign companies acquired during the late 1980s. Japanese companies are still licking their wounds from rash investments made during the late 1980s when the Tokyo stock market was rising and capital was raised through equity linked funding at almost zero cost. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, which bought Lyphomed, a US drug maker, in 1990, has seen its consolidated profit plunge due to losses at the US subsidiary. Although the parent company is faring well as a result of its innovative drugs, the US operations are a large burden to the rest of the group. The problems for Japanese acquisitions of overseas companies have not only been capital related, but also culturally oriented. The difference in management style has compounded the difficulties of relations between the new management and workers. Bridgestone, the tyre company which acquired Firestone, the US tyre manufacturer, five years ago, is seeing the US operations become profitable at last. Apart from outdated plant automation, the company's 'kid glove' approach also hampered the arrival of benefits from the acquisition. Absence of appetite for foreign acquisitions by Japanese companies has also prompted Treuhand, the agency responsible for the sale of former East German companies, to close its operations in Tokyo. However, Nomura Wasserstein Perella says that once the economy recovers, Japanese companies will once again look overseas. 'There won't be the mega deals you saw in the late 1980s, but Japanese companies will still need to go overseas to survive,' says an official. The high yen is also prompting Japanese companies to shift production outside Japan. Meanwhile, opportunities lie in industries in a consolidation phase, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, computer software, car parts, and foods. Dealing with smaller companies may not be as straightforward as dealing with the more sophisticated, larger, Japanese companies. Last month Mikuni and Nippon Carbureter, two carburettor companies, suddenly announced the cancellation of their planned merger. Car parts makers are being hit by sharp production cuts in the car industry, and the leading carmakers' shift of production to overseas plants. However, at the last minute Nippon Carbureter decided to cancel the merger as a result of opposition by some over-zealous board members.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- M&amp;A ACTIVITY IN JAPAN - (YBN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     1989   1990   1991   1992   1993*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Foreigners buying Japanese comps      22      3     48     27     12 Japanese buying foreign comps      2,899  2,583    710    254    106 Japanese buying Japanese comps       109    176    227    269    101  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Total for the first six months Source: Yamaichi Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / LA police in mass absenteeism Hundreds of Los Angeles police officers called in sick again yesterday, the third day in a row of mass 'sick-outs', as an acrimonious contract dispute with the city continued, AP reports from Los Angeles. Mayor Richard Riordan has urged the officers to accept mediation. The Police Protective League, the officers' union, did not favour this but was expected to reply later yesterday to the mayor's offer. Only 105 of the 317 officers and sergeants scheduled for the early shift yesterday arrived, the police department said. Officers from the Tuesday evening shift were kept at work to cover. The city estimates that the 'sick-outs' are costing it nearly Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) a day in overtime. The city has nearly 7,700 officers who have worked without contract for two years. Los Angeles has been reluctant to offer police more money because of budget constraints. Last week, they rejected a 6 per cent rise over two years. Starting pay for a new officer is Dollars 33,157 a year.</p>

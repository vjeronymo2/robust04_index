			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ROMANIA;  </P> <P> DISSIDENTS OCCUPY DOWNTOWN SQUARE  </P> <P> About 300 anti-government demonstrators occupied a central square in Bucharest,  Romania, a day after 48 people were arrested and two reportedly hurt in a clash  with police there.  </P> <P> Dissidents demanded the resignation of President Ion Iliescu. Critics accuse  Iliescu and his associates, who won free elections earlier this year, of  keeping many of the policies of the authoritarian Communist leader Nicolae  Ceausescu, who was executed after his regime was toppled. The protesters at  University Square, located at the main intersection on the capital's  fashionable Balcescu Boulevard, disrupted traffic and forced motorists to use  side streets.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Weiling] </F>   [Text] AT&amp;T signed a series of agreements yesterday that  guarantee the US communication giant will invest $150 million  and triple its 800-strong staff in China over the next two years.    Under the deals with the State Planning Commission,  AT&amp;T will  provide technology, products and services to China.    Last year the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding  to set up a long-term partnership.  <H5>  Ceremony in U.S. </H5>   Yesterday's agreements, signed in the U.S., called for  AT&amp;T  to establish:    -- Two joint ventures capable of producing 2 million  switching lines per year for China, with factories located in  Chengdu, Sichuan Province and Qingdao, Shandong;    -- A microelectronics joint venture to design and produce  integrated circuits known as VLSI (Very Large Scale  Integration); the location will be decided this summer;    -- An AT&amp;T Bell research and development facility;    -- Training courses for mid-level and senior Chinese  managers  in planning, communications, electronics and other industries;    -- And a comprehensive network management programme with the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications that will handle the  sale and development of hardware and software systems for  network surveillance, management and control.    The programme should alleviate problems in China's vast  telecommunications system.    ``AT&amp;T is committed to providing China with digital and  fibre-optic technologies that are the latest and best in the  world so it can leapfrog almost overnight into the information  age,'' said William Warwick, chairman of AT&amp;T China.    The company yesterday also agreed to explore remaining areas  of co-operation outlined in last year's memorandum.    Since the signing in February 1993, AT&amp;T has secured  more  than $500 million in sales contracts and last year doubled its  1992 revenues in China.    The company has already set up nine joint ventures in the  country; they are engaged in marketing wireless systems,  international long-distance services, computer products and  networks.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / People: Sterling stuff Sterling Publishing, the USM-listed company best known as publishers of Debrett's Peerage, has taken on Clare Whitley for the newly created position of finance director. Whitley had previously been finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising International. Sterling managing director Michael Summers says he found her because she had decided to take a sabbatical when the job at Saatchi's 'no longer proved a challenge.' Her early training had been at Price Waterhouse, and then Unigate, latterly as group treasurer. But her more recent experience at Saatchis prepares her well specifically for Sterling, which, as a trade and technical magazine and book publisher, works almost entirely in the advertising-financed sector. Summers remains cagey as to exactly why he needs a finance director at this point. A chartered accountant himself, as is his deputy chairman Michael Preston, he says that whereas there had always been enough financial expertise on the board until now, 'we are strengthening the management team ready for a period of growth and expansion.' While Sterling dipped well into loss last financial year (ending March 31 1991) Summers contends that this year's results, due mid July, will demonstrate it is again 'running in the right direction.' Putting a full time finance director on the board is ' a positive step, not a defensive one' he makes out. Of Whitley, he continues:' We think we've found a real nugget. She arrived on Monday and already has her feet well under the table. She is out now travelling around our subsidiaries acquainting herself with the financial controllers.'</p>

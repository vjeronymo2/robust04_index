			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Headlam in Pounds 5.4m floor coverings buy from Hickson In the latest in a string of moves going back over 5 months, Headlam, the footwear and fabrics group, is proposing to buy three businesses - HFD (South) - from Hickson Flooring Distributors, part of Hickson International, the Yorkshire-based chemicals group, for Pounds 5.36m cash. To fund the acquisition, Headlam is placing up to 11.6m new ordinary shares on a 7-for-6 basis at 58p each to raise Pounds 6.1m net. The price represents a 2.5 per cent discount to Thursday's closing price. Since September Headlam has been in discussions with Hickson with a view to buying the latter's UK floor coverings interests and indeed assumed responsibility for the day-to-day management of HFD. Terms could not be agreed for the whole of HFD, but in January Headlam bought two floor covering distribution businesses - in Stockport and Newcastle-upon-Tyne and called HFD (North) - for Pounds 742,000 cash. Mr Graham Waldron, Headlam chairman, said that his group had considerable experience of the floor coverings distribution industry - he himself had been involved for nearly 30 years - and that to confine the group's core distribution activities to the gradually shrinking UK footwear manufacturing market would weaken the group's performance and financial position.</p>

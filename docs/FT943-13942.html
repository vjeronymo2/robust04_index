			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Motoring: Topless in country lanes For the past few summery weeks in south-east England, there have only been two kinds of car: those with air-conditioning or the others in which you feel sticky and uncomfortable, especially in motorway jams. But what about convertibles, you ask. Certainly, they are an alternative, although I am not sure sitting in the sun for several hours at a time is a good idea. The rush of wind masks the heat and makes you forget the risks of over-exposure. For these reasons, convertibles are none too popular in really hot countries. Still, I have to admit that driving topless through English lanes on a moderately hot day can be very pleasant. You savour the smells of the countryside (well, some of them; others are best avoided) and feel more in touch with your surroundings. Just remember to cover your head and use sun block on bare arms. Not for years has there been such a wide choice of convertibles at prices ranging from modest to mind-blowing. It depends if your fancy is the Fiat Punto 90 ELX Cabrio, just arrived in British showrooms at Pounds 12,995, or a Pounds 166,681 Rolls-Royce Corniche IV. Like the Punto 55 hatchback (this column, July 4), the Cabrio scored a hit with me. For a car that opens, the body feels reassuringly stiff on less-than-perfect roads. Dropping one wheel into a pot-hole makes the fascia creak momentarily and the side windows tremble, but no more than it would in any other car lacking a steel roof. At all other times, it is agreeably taut. Windscreen pillars with strong reinforcing enable the Cabrio to pass the US test which assesses the ability of cars to protect their occupants should they roll over - even though the test is not yet compulsory for soft-tops in that country. Remarkably, for such an affordable car, the Cabrio has a power-operated hood. Undo two clips at the top of the windscreen, make sure the handbrake is on, press a button and the hood folds into the rear deck. It does not lie quite flat - as it does in the delicious but far costlier (Pounds 17,700) Peugeot 306 convertible - but an easily-attached loose cover, which lives in the rather pokey little boot, makes an open Cabrio look neat. The rear seats are habitable by two average adults. The Cabrio is not just a fair-weather car, either: the three-layer hood fits snugly when up, although the flexible rear window has no demister. But it is not quite as light inside as a larger-windowed three-door Punto hatchback. Power steering, engine immobiliser, fuel-flow stop valve and electric front windows are standard. Radio controls are built into the steering wheel, unless you decide to have a driver's-side airbag as an optional extra. The 1.6-litre, 88-horsepower engine is new and will be appearing in other Fiats in due course. Already, it meets European Union emission requirements that will not come into force for several years. It pulls hard at low revolutions or spins freely up to a boy racer's red-lined 6,500rpm. The five-speed gearbox shifts easily and the Cabrio feels quite lively. Fiat claims a top speed of 105mph (170kph) and says a kilometre is covered in 34 seconds from a standing start. Fuel consumption should be 33mpg (8.56 l/100km). Two other versions of the Punto that also are new to Britain are the 55 EL six-speed and the 60 SX Selecta. The Selecta has a continuously variable transmission which provides the easy driving benefits of a conventional automatic without its cost and complication. Price: Pounds 8,449. As for the six-speed 55, it is really an Italian market special. There, newly-qualified drivers are, very sensibly, restricted to cars with a low power-to-weight ratio. The idea of the 55 EL six-speed is that it allows them to stir the gear lever and indulge their fantasies without breaking laws or going too quickly. There is no such law in Britain, although the insurance industry exerts a moderating influence. But I did not much like the 55 EL, not least because it is geared lower in sixth than the normal 55 in fifth. Unless you have a fixation about gear levers, my advice would be to go for a standard 55 S at Pounds 6,760. That would save you Pounds 539 - and a lot of unnecessary gear shifting.</p>

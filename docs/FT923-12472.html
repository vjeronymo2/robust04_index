			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / The terrible price of a joke against Islam: Alaa Hamed wrote a poor novel about Islam that hardly anyone read. Now he lives in the shadow of the assassin / A report on the other Salman Rudshies ALAA HAMED, a balding, middle-aged tax inspector, seems an unlikely candidate for persecution. But his hobby - dabbling in fiction - has turned his shabby Cairo flat into a prison. Anonymous callers threaten him with death. Outside his flat, a 24-hour armed guard protects him from assassins. Soon the guards may arrest Hamed: temporarily free on appeal, he faces a maximum eight-year prison sentence for blasphemy against Islam. His crime: to have written a fantasy novel that pokes gentle fun at the prophets of revealed religion. Hamed is not alone among Moslem writers. The death sentance hanging over Salman Rushdie has drawn worldwide publicity, but the growing politicisation of Islam is exposing liberal Moslems to the wrath of their radical co-religionists. These are a few recent cases: Pakistani fundamentalists are demanding that 73-year-old Akhtar Mohammed Khan be beheaded for 'insulting the prophet' in a now banned collection of nursery rhymes. In May, Kuwaiti journalist Fouad al Hashem was sentenced to three months in jail for 'inciting debauchery.' Ridiculing fundamentalist claims, he had written a column denying that the Iraqi invasion was God's punishment for Kuwait's sins. If this was so, he demanded sarcastically, why were Londoners spared heavenly anger even though they openly kissed each other? In June, religious radicals murdered Dr Farag Foda, Egypt's most outspoken secularist, whose biting criticism of fundamentalist excesses had led some clerics to label him an enemy of the state. Egypt, with its century-old secularist tradition, was long considered a haven of relative tolerance in the Arab and Islamic worlds. But even before Islam became a political tool governments found it wise to be seen as defenders of the faith. Successive rulers have made pacts with the institutions of Islam - most prominently, in Egypt, with the 1,000-year-old theological university of Al Azhar. In exchange for Al Azhar's support against radicals, the state has wielded its power to preserve the university's rigid interpretation of Islam. Thus, in 1926, Egyptian courts banned one of the first critical essays into pre-Islamic Arabia by an Arab author, Dr Taha Hussein. In the 1920s Sheikh Ali Abdul Razeq, an Azharite scholar, was stripped of his post for arguing that Islam does not provide a clear-cut model for government. In 1959, Al Azhar banned a novel for using thinly disguised allegory to fictionalise various prophets. The author, Naguib Mahfouz, later won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Rare though these incidents were, their memory helped restrain historians, religious scholars and novelists from testing the limits set by Al Azhar. Now, Egyptian intellectuals feel these limits are shrinking. 'In terms of freedom of opinion we are going backwards,' says Hamed's lawyer, Niguad al Boraie. 'In the 1930s or '50s you could mostly say what you wanted, but now we have ideological terrorism to contend with. The pressure to adhere to Islamic orthodoxy takes many forms. In Hamed's case, a spiteful colleague told Al Azhar's Islamic Research Academy, which is responsible for authenticating Islamic texts, that Hamed's book, A Distance in a Man's Mind, was blasphemous. A study committee from the Academy then notified the Public Prosecutor that the book 'committed aggression against the Holy Koran, claiming that it is man's (not God's) work, mocking the prophet Mohammed and other Islamic symbols and treating them contemptuously.' On the basis of the committee's report police also detained Hamed's publisher and his distributor. The book - only 89 copies of which were sold  -was confiscated. Following the trial, which his lawyer denounces as a travesty, Hamed and his 'accomplices' were sentenced to eight years imprisonment under Egypt's anti-sedition laws. Because it was imposed by a special state security court, Hamed's sentence cannot be implemented without the signature of Egypt's prime minister. This has not been forthcoming, probably due to adverse publicity abroad about the case. Still, the writer has spent six months since his trial in agonising suspense. Hamed, virtually unknown before his trial, offended the clerics by using bawdy language to spoof religion. A Distance in a Man's Mind, says one critic, is a metaphorical book about the future. 'Its basic thrust is that nothing, including religion, should be free from human inquiry.' But, like other readers, the critic disparaged Hamed's work on literary grounds. 'The vehicle is weak and his sarcasm about the prophets seems frivolous.' While the book was considered blasphemous, other works faced banning orders for challenging orthodoxy. At the Cairo International Book Fair in January, raiders from the Islamic Research Academy confiscated five works by Said Ashmawi, one of Egypt's most prominent judges and Islamic scholars. Like Sheikh Ali Abdul Razeq some 70 years ago, Ashmawi argued against the fundamentalist claim that Islam offers a firm base for statehood. In an unprecedented personal intervention, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt ordered that the books be returned to the fair. Egyptian intellectuals applauded the move, but saw it is a futile gesture given the government's policy of appeasing a 'mainstream' Islam that is moving towards radicalism. This was exemplified by the treatment of the Hamed case, which was viewed by many of Egypt's increasingly beleaguered secularists as an example of the government, abetted by Al Azhar, throwing a sacrifice to the fundamentalist wolves. To Islamic radicals, Hamed's punishment was not enough - indeed, it was another sign that the state has failed in its primary duty to defend the faith. In the outspoken Islamicist press there were calls for Hamed's execution, in line with the strictest punishment for heresy and in emulation of Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Rushdie. 'The imposition of the highest penalty is an Islamic duty against any who dares attack the religion or prophet of God, so as not to leave our beliefs in the hands of deranged groups that call for apostasy under the cover of creativity,' thundered Islamic Banner, a religious weekly. While disturbed by such calls, Hamed and his supporters did not take them seriously - at least not until last month, when gunmen from the extremist Islamic Leagues shot Dr Farag Foda, a prominent opponent of political Islam who testified in Hamed's favour at his trial. Alarmed by the assassination, Egyptian liberals have begun to see a dangerous convergence between the 'radical' and 'moderate' Islamicist trends. As they see it, just as the government has accommodated Al Azhar and its orthodoxy, the orthodox have begun adopting political ideas from the radicals. There are many reasons for this. Because of their political motivation, Moslem radicals have come to dominate the Islamic press. Questions of religious identity have given way to impassioned discussion of threats which radicals claim are challenging the faith. One is the incompleteness, as they see it, of Islam as practiced - incomplete in that religion has not extended its sway over the procedures of government in most Moslem countries. More important, radical publicists have successfully pervayed a vision of an Islam under siege from its enemies. Accordingly, for example, the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzogovina is explained as a modern crusade against the Moslems of what was Yugoslavia. The Kashmir crisis, the Sudanese civil war, the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh: all are portrayed as pitting Islam against forces of Christianity, atheism and heathenism. Islamic institutions, which traditionally avoided meddling in politics, have found it difficult to resist the role thrust on them by the clamour of the radicals, particularly when they are backed by the financial muscle of Saudi Arabia and Iran. Inevitably, this submission has expressed itself in moves to limit freedom of expression. Does Islam forbid art or permit it? asks Egyptian Islamicist Mohammed Abdul Quddous in the rhetorical manner of a traditional Moslem sheikh. 'The correct answer is that art is a two-bladed weapon,' he answers. 'It can be in the service of heavenly teaching . . . or it an be a tool of Satan]' Quddous, son of a well-known writer, is considered relatively mild in his opinions. The Azharite scholars charged with imposing Islamic censorship declined to be interviewed, but presumably they agree with him. In Saudi Arabia, his view is already enshrined in law. According to Middle East Watch, a New York-based human rights group, the Saudi Law of Publication No. 17 of 1982 lists 18 subjects which cannot be addressed in any publication. In Pakistan, a recent law has made insulting the prophet a capital offence. Increasingly, it appears, other Moslem countries are adopting the Saudi view that there is no meeting ground between secularism and Islam. Dr Abdul Qader Tash, an editor of the Saudi Islamic weekly Al Moslemoon, expressed this idea bleakly. Rejecting the suggestion of liberal Moslem thinkers such as Egyptian philosopher Fouad Zakariya and Iraqi writer Shibli al Isami, who believe that there is no contradiction between humanism and enlightened Islam, Tash says that Moslems cannot accept western notions that religion and science, or religion and the state, are opposed. 'Some say that Islam will win in any case, and so there is no need to confront (its opponents),' Tash writes. 'But we cannot be cowards in this battle of ideas. The Word is the strongest weapon man has known throughout his history.' Moslems who think otherwise feel increasingly isolated. But judge Said Ashmawi, for one, is not intimidated. As he sees it the Islamicist programme, if it aims to compete with secular humanism, is doomed to failure. What is missing from the fundamentalist approach, he says, is the tool of finding answers through debate. 'We (Moslems) are developing a materialistic civilisation, but without the method of producing technology, which is based on the technique of criticism.' Alaa Hamed's wife, a middle-class Egyptian mother of three, agrees. 'The reason the west has progressed is that you respect reality, the truth,' she says. 'Why can't I be a Moslem and benefit from progress? They can't force you to deny your beliefs. Your beliefs are like your name, like your own mother.' In their cramped apartment her husband awaits his fate. 'My only crime,' he says, 'is that I failed to understand the space of freedom in Egypt. It is like this.' He draws a small circle with a finger. But even now Hamed has not lost his sense of humour. A recent poem, roughly translated, goes like this: They ordered my thoughts to be captured, Stuffed them in a sack And tied it to the back of a donkey. They opened it in court. It was empty. They asked why. Because the donkey got hungry and ate them.</p>

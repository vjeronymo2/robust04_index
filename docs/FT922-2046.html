			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: County Hall shift unlikely TIME appeared to be running out yesterday for the prospects of the London School of Economics being able to relocate to County Hall, as it wishes. Although a meeting of ministers yesterday afternoon did not take a final decision on the future of the headquarters of the former Greater London Council, giving the LSE a last chance to put together a formal bid for the site, it seems unlikely that the LSE and the government will be able to agree quickly a deal that would be acceptable to all sides. The building has already been bought by Japan's Shirayama Corporation from the London Residuary Body - the organisation winding up the affairs of the GLC. Ministers pointed out yesterday that if the government did exercise its power to require the LRB to accept a lower price for the property - as would almost certainly be the case if it went to the LSE - the arrangement would still have to be agreed with the London boroughs, whose amounts from the proceeds would correspondingly be reduced. The government has come under some cross-party political pressure to exercise its powers and help the LSE acquire the property, but there are powerful pressures in the opposite direction as well: just three days ago Shirayama itself threatened to pull out of the deal unless the government clarified its stance on the future development of the site. Answering questions in the Commons yesterday, Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said a statement would be made 'in the near future.' His pledge came in response to a question from Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, who tabled an early day motion earlier this week urging the government to delay the building's sale while 'full and detailed consideration' was given to the proposal that it become the LSE's home.</p>

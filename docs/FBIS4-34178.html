			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newcast"] </F>   [Text] Nicaragua does not believe the United States will  suspend its aid again. Should this happen, however, it would be  a grave mistake, affecting a country trying to consolidate its  democracy, Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said upon arriving in  Cartagena de Indias to participate in the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit.    Although the aid has been objected to by Republican  congressmen due to unresolved claims for property  indemnification filed by U.S. citizens, Minister Leal said the  Helms-Gonzalez Amendment has been misinterpreted. He added that  when a country has an adequate indemnification system, as in the  case of Nicaragua, there should be no major problems.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government has  confirmed the suspension of all weapons deliveries to Turkey.  Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel said today that Bonn was  obliged to investigate whether material from German deliveries  to Turkey was being used in Turkey's conflict with the Kurds.    Vogel said the government is in possession of reports to  this  effect from Germans who were recently in Turkey. He admitted,  however, that it would be difficult to prove whether the  suspected items from stocks of the former GDR National People's  Army in fact originated from German supplies, and not from sales  by former Warsaw Pact states.    The government spokesman at the same time confirmed that  Bonn  favors, in principle, the deportation of militant Kurds from  Germany. It must, however, be guaranteed that the expellees are  threatened neither with the death sentence nor with torture in  Turkey. If a relevant agreement is signed with Turkey, the  German Government has "not the slightest doubt" Ankara would  adhere to it.</p>

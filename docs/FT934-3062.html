			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: French approach to driving through EU rules Sir, While a student at London Business School, I recently completed an assessment of the French market for company operated cars. Government pressure in the early 1980s to buy French and a tax system which heavily favours domestic products leads 80 per cent of French companies to buy only French vehicles. In the leasing market, the proportion reaches 95 per cent. The comparable UK figure is about 4 per cent. As for European Union rules governing state purchases, most French state organisations contacted expressed little interest in even considering foreign products. As the French appear to view free trade as distinctly one-dimensional and EU rules as there to be ignored, just how far should we go in pandering to the attempted blackmail of France's protectionist demands in the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations? Incidentally, am I alone in being unable to recall vigorous French protests at the jobs to be created by that wicked American cultural import (sic) of Euro Disney?

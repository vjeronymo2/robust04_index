Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member  of the PLO Executive Committee, said that the renewed U.S.  commitment to achieving a comprehensive and just solution will  help the entire peace process. In a statement to our radio,  'Abd-Rabbuh expressed the PLO's leadership appreciation for the  stand reiterated by President Hafiz al-Asad in his talks in  Geneva yesterday with regard to linking normalization with  Israel with a comprehensive solution on all fronts.    The Palestinian official expected the talks between Syria  and  Lebanon on one hand and Israeli on the other to enter a serious  phase. He expressed hope that these talks will witness real  progress. He said that, at the same time, he believes that the  difficulties facing all parties call for reactivating the  comprehensive coordination among all Arab countries or among the  five cordon states.    Thus, in the absence of an official PLO stance, Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information Department, who was  optimistic on the eve of the Geneva summit today believes that  the results of this summit were not disappointing.</p>

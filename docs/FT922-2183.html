			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops to 5 1/2  year low on arbitrage selling ARBITRAGE selling drove equities down sharply and left the Nikkei average at a closing 5 1/2 -year low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index plunged 507.73 to 16,445.80, its lowest finish since November 1986. It opened at the day's high of 16,923.32 and reached the session's low of 16,444.70 near the close. Volume increased from 230m shares to 280m. Buying by pension funds and investment trusts failed to absorb continued arbitrage selling. Declines overwhelmed advances by 908 to 83, with 105 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 30.60, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,276.61, while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index receded 5.37 to 992.08. Negative sentiment spread as constant buying by public pension funds failed to counter selling by dealers and retail and institutional investors. Stricter disclosure on futures and options trading by the Osaka stock exchange also discouraged dealers. Indications by the Economic Planning Agency that it might be forced to revise downwards its 3.5 per cent growth target for the year to March 1993, in view of the continued sluggishness of the economy, also disrupted the market. Rumours that Daikyo, a leading condominium maker, was in financial trouble, additionally depressed investors. Daikyo later denied the rumours. Brokerages were heavily sold on reports of operational losses from April to June. A Japanese brokerage official said low volume and high costs, including summer bonus payments, have been hurting the firms. Nomura Securities weakened Y100 to Y1,300 and Daiwa Securities Y45 to Y810. Steel, construction and real estate companies also fell on heavy selling. Traders said domestic institutions that bought the issues in 1988 and 1989 were liquidating holdings. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 417.08 to 19,502.13 in volume of 20.1m shares. Roundup THE TOKYO market drop and Wall Street weakness dampened general sentiment in the Pacific Basin region yesterday. The Manila and Makati stock markets announced that they were to merge. Mr Rosario Lopez, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it might take six months to a year for the new market to begin operations. HONG KONG gained 30 points in early trade before profit-taking drove the market back. The Hang Seng index closed just 7.09 up at 5,853.84. Turnover was HKDollars 2.8bn. Banks were generally higher, with Bank of East Asia ahead 50 cents at HKDollars 32.50. In the property sector, Sun Hung Kai gained 50 cents to HKDollars 32.50. AUSTRALIA slid further for the market's sixth consecutive fall. The All Ordinaries index finished 8.3 lower at 1,631.1 in turnover of ADollars 270m. MANILA fell on profit-taking after the announcement that Mr Fidel Ramos had been confirmed as the new president. The composite index retreated 42.66 to 1,535.82 in combined turnover of 265m pesos. BANGKOK gained ground in heavy volume. The SET index rose 6.55 to 756.29 in turnover of Bt10.34bn. Advances led declines by 141 to 77. TAIWAN declined moderately in active trading and the weighted index relinquished 33.88 to 4,603.90 in turnover of TDollars 38.6bn. SINGAPORE had selected blue chips stronger as shipyard issues lost ground on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 2.44 to 1,517.44. SEOUL's composite index lost 3.23 to 576.72 in turnover of Won326.5bn, while NEW ZEALAND slipped in spite of foreign interest in Carter Holt Harvey, which rose 5 cents to NZDollars 2.65. The NZSE-40 index shed 2.67 to 1,530.80. BOMBAY's brokers continued to refrain from trading. Meanwhile in DHAKA, the all-share index jumped 9.96, or 3.2 per cent, to 322.7 ahead of today's budget for Bangladesh.</p>

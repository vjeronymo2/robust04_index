			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Central  Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party, yesterday evening met a  number of representatives of the tribes of al-Awatifah, and the  al [clan] ba Wazir, al (Jayd), and al al-Haddad from Hadhramaut  Governorate, who expressed their support for the establishment  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] as the latest victory  for the national movement for building a modern state of law and  order. [passage omitted]    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid hailed those present, and  expressed  his congratulations on the occasion of the Islamic New Year.  [passage omitted]    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that the declaration of the  establishment of the Republic was made three weeks after the  beginning of the war, and the northern insistence on effecting  an occupation, so that citizens had to defend their Republic and  its sovereignty.    He said: It was they who imposed the war, but they cannot  impose surrender on us, because they lack the capacity to do so.  He stressed the need to hail the resistance, reject the  occupation, have faith in victory, defend the Republic, reject  silence in the face of injustice, and defend the solidarity of  the front, because we have right on our side. He stressed that  the Yemeni Socialist Party did not envisage ruling on its own,  because it believed in pluralism, with the participation of the  various parties, all personalities in society, all individuals  of goodwill, patriotic shaykhs, and all who love this Republic  and struggle for its sake. The brother chairman of the  Presidential Council said: We are now experiencing another  stage imposed on us after 25 [number as heard] years since  independence and now, once again, we are struggling for our  independence.    We are struggling to stop the influence of this gang from  penetrating these regions, because they are committing crimes,  abominations, and pillage. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid lauded the  heroic steadfastness of the citizens of Aden, the citizens in  general, and the Armed Forces and security forces on the various  battlefronts. He noted that the comprehensive recognition of  the establishment of the Republic would accrue from this  steadfastness and determination, because our forces spring from  our people. [passage omitted]    He stressed that we Yemenis will not agree to be fourth  class  citizens, because we are fighters who created a democratic Yemen  by making sacrifices. [passage omitted]    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid called on the sons of Hadhramaut  Governorate to step up their mobilization and strengthen their  ranks, in order to fight this invasion. He noted that  historically, in the 17th century, such resistance prevailed in  Hadhramaut when invaders reached Dhofar during the reign of Imam  al-Mutawakkil ala'Allah Isma'il. Then they withdrew from Dhofar  to the sea, and were never able to return. He said: Today you  will also drive out these invaders from Hadhramaut. We shall  not permit ourselves to be governed by the al-Ahmar family and  the fundamentalists. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We in our  country know our history and our past, and we take pride in our  history. We shall work together with all our brothers in the DRY  to protect the Republic and its capital, Aden. We shall improve  our situation and build ourselves up to be better than we were.  We shall open our windows and our relations with all the people  of the world, in the peninsula, and in the gulf.    The meeting was attended by Brother Awad 'Abdallah Murshidi,  secretary of Hadhramaut Governorate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 January </F> Evening Edition]    [Text] Commenting on the formulation of the draft fiscal  1994 budget, which has been delayed due to the problem of  political reform, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  said at a news conference on the morning of 24 January: "We work  on the premise that the schedule for the Japan-U.S. summit  meeting (on 11 February) cannot be moved. We would like to make  a decision on the draft budget before the U.S. trip." However,  he also explained: "In view of the (tumultuous) political  situation, we need to coordinate with the deliberations (within  the ruling parties) on the taxation system, and discussions at  the government Tax Commission before making a final decision. I  have a feeling we are running out of time." He thus indicated  that there is a possibility that the government's draft budget  may be delayed depending on future developments.    Regarding economic stimulation measures, which are scheduled  to be announced within this week, Takemura said: "The  (government and ruling parties') conference on economic issues  will be convened as early as possible this week, instead of next  week, while deliberations on political reform are also in  progress. Since (economic stimulation measures) are an issue of  great interest to the people, we would like to deal with this  issue while working on political reform even amid the present  turmoil."</p>

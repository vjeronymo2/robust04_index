			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Foods uncertain The spectre of restructuring charges hung over several food manufacturing stocks following the Pounds 490m provision by Unilever on Tuesday. The Anglo-Dutch company blamed tough competition in Europe and the US for the move, raising fears that companies in similarly competitive markets will also be forced to retrench. United Biscuits, which reports finals on March 17, was one company attracting speculation, the shares dipping 4 to 338p. The company reported flat profits at the half-way stage in the face of fierce competition in the biscuit market and at its US subsidiary Keebler. Also touted was Unigate, which faces restructuring in the UK dairy market later this year, and continuing changes in consumer tastes as more people use cartons instead of bottles. The shares fell 6 to 373p. Unilever retreated a further 12 to 1150p on negative comments on the provisions. British Gas attracted exceptionally heavy two-way activity following the regulator's annual review and ahead of preliminary figures today. Some 15m Gas shares changed hands, with dealers saying that one big institution, which had been responsible for much of the selling on Tuesday, was continuing to unload stock. The stock was easily absorbed and Gas shares held up well to close unaltered at 339p. Traders said today's results could contain exceptional restructuring of up to Pounds 1bn. BP continued to edge higher, closing 3 up at 369p on heavy turnover of 14m although some traders expressed surprise at BP's resilience in the face of some continued selling from the US. Shell, also made progress ahead of today's full-year results and rose 4 to 722p. Barclays Bank shares were unsettled by the slide in NatWest and dropped 10 to 564p, but closed well above the day's low point of 544p, after big turnover of 9.7m. Lloyds, on the other hand, were boosted by switching out of the likes of NatWest and Barclays and settled 13 higher at 597p. A seller of a block of 2.5m shares depressed Abbey National, which closed at 507p. Commercial Union's preliminary results and dividend were above most market expectations and triggered an early rise in the shares, although this was eroded later in the day as dealers continued to fret about pressures on insurance rates in the UK. Marked up to 634p at the outset CU shares subsequently fell back to close a net 8 off at 616p. Royals were upset by worries about the market's response to the current crop of results and settled 8 off at 290p. Mining group RTZ closed 14 higher at 828p in the registered shares with Kleinwort Benson repeating its buy stance and helping the stock recover from recent falls. Analysts also expect good figures next week from CRA, the Australian mining conglomerate in which RTZ has a 49 per cent stake. Hanson rebounded 4 to 279p on consideration of Tuesday's Dollars 1bn convertible bond issue. Turnover of 11m shares was boosted by the equivalent of 6.5m shares traded in the form of options. Bread and pet foods group Carrs Milling attracted bid talk following disclosure late on Tuesday that Northern Foods had sold its 4.74 per cent stake to an unidentified buyer. Dalgety was an early favourite, but sources close to Carrs insisted that the stake went to institutions. Carrs surged 12 to 209p. Dalgety fell 10 to 467p. Engineering group Siebe broke finished 17 ahead at 606p. The group is to hold a presentation at SG Warburg next week. BBA Group, shed 5 to 214p, amid fears that it will announce a charge to cover redundancies with next month's full-year figures. There were also whispers that the dividend may be reduced. Chloride, the batteries manufacturer, held at 32 1/2 p, with the market alerted to the placing of a near 20 per cent stake in the company by SSA &amp; Partners, the Swedish company. Turnover in Chloride reached 95m shares.</p>

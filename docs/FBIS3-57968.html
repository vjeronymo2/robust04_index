			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paola Di Caro: "Berlusconi: Fewer Taxes to Beat </F> Occhetto"]    [Text] Milan -- Is it, then, really true? Will the Knight  [Fininvest President Berlusconi nickname] announce his entry  into politics on 10 January, and do so live on the RAI [Italian  State Broadcasting Corporation] to boot? Many are convinced  that he will in fact take part in a great "One-Against-All" [TV  talk show], i.e. the Fininvest president against his critics,  answering the why's, how's, and when's concerning the launching  of his political battleship. For his part, Silvio Berlusconi  said from his Arcore headquarters villa: "We are having  discussions." Whereas Nicolo Querci, his loyal right-hand man,  explained that "if anything, it would be on 11 January, not on  the 10th; we are currently engaged in talks with Carlo Freccero,  who is an old friend of Berlusconi's." The Fininvest boss made  it clear that "the possibility that the announcement of my  entering into politics will take place on that occasion,  assuming there is one, can be ruled out."    Why? Because the remaining doubts, which now center more on  the timing than on substance, stem from "four good reasons."    "To begin with," he explained, "I still have some hope left  that the democratic forces will find a way of coming together.  In the second place, however, it must be also taken into  account that voters require new reference points, which are  still lacking, and which I believe must be represented: 40  percent of Italians say they do not know whom to vote for." If  these are the premises, the two other points appear to provide  the conclusion: "To this," he said, "we must add the timescales  required to discuss the no-confidence motion, and those for  setting the election date." Only then, in short, will  Berlusconi solve the puzzle.    In the meantime, other bilateral meetings were being  announced, among which "a short visit to Rome," as they said in  sybilline fashion at Arcore. The Knight, however, does not stop  even for a minute: "I would get bored...," he winked, and then  went on to make a public proposal, which he defined as "a  reflection on the government's latest measures," but also "an  element of amalgamation around which a potentially victorious  electoral coalition could unite." The proposal involved setting  a "taxation ceiling."    This is, in fact, one of the 40 platform points which "we  are  actively working on." The taxation issue, however, is a  particularly sensitive, and particularly important, one.  Berlusconi's proposal -- namely setting by law a ceiling on the  income that the government can absorb through taxation -- is  very similar to that originally put forward by [National Rebirth  Pact leader Mario] Segni and supported by the League.    Berlusconi said: "You cannot reconstruct public finances by  increasing income without controlling expenditure. As a result  of the budget Italians will have 67 trillion lire [L] less to  spend on consumer goods or invest in savings, while the public  sector will have an extra L67 trillion at its disposal. This  resource transfer will not improve the situation of public  finances and will cause our production system further  difficulties." Was that a criticism aimed at Ciampi? "This is  not a critism aimed at Ciampi, who had to act in an emergency  situation," Berlusconi explained. "But, at this stage of the  game, we must break with this system which has been implemented  for far too many years by governments that, in the attempt to  restore public finances to a healthy state, have increased  public income," thus leading to "an overtaxed country." This is  why, according to the Knight, "we must abandon the old system  and introduce a taxation ceiling, set by law."    Berlusconi was very much aware that this project was shared  by potential allies: "Certainly, and I welcome this. The more  points we have in common, the greater the chances of building a  strong grouping." The latter, of course, will be opposed to  [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto, because --  Berlusconi maintained -- "the Left has always refused to  acknowledge that taxation was excessive, advocating instead new  and ever increasing taxes and duties." This is therefore "where  the major difference lies with the Left electoral coalition."</p>

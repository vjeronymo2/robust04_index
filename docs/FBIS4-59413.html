			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- The Egyptian Human Rights  Organization [EHRO] issued a statement today dismissing a  foreign news agency report attributed to an EHRO member that  said the number of political detainees in Egypt is between  20,000 and 30,000.    In its statement, EHRO said none of its officials had made  such a statement during its news conference yesterday. EHRO  stressed that the assertion that there are between 20,000 and  30,000 detainees is not true.</p>

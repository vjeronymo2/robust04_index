			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU proposes higher banana import quota The European Commission has proposed a 53,400-tonne increase in its quota for banana imports from Latin America this year in order to assist the Windward Islands where agricultural areas were devastated by tropical storm Debbie in September. Governments from the Windward Islands had asked if they could import bananas from other destinations while they are unable to fill their own import allocations. This will enable them to maintain their market share in the European Union while they rebuild their damaged plantations. The Commission has allocated additional tonnages of 30,000 tonnes to Martinique, 14,800 tonnes to St Lucia, 5,900 to Guadeloupe and 2,700 to Dominica. Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia, said recently that 68 per cent of the country's banana crop worth Pounds 45m had been wiped out by the tropical storm. He said it will take two years to repair the damage. The increase in quota takes EU banana imports from Latin America to 2.171m tonnes this year.</p>

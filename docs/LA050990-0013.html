			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS SHOCKED BY LOCKHEED RELOCATION;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: BURBANK CALLS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MOVE TO GEORGIA A BOMBSHELL, BUT  PALMDALE DOES NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT TO BE DEVASTATING.  </P> <P> Lockheed's announcement that it is relocating much of its activities from  Southern California to Georgia surprised officials in Burbank and Palmdale, who  had been expecting some bad news from the aerospace company, but not that much.  </P> <P> Both cities will be heavily affected by the company's move, although Palmdale  officials said they do not expect the impact to be devastating.  </P> <P> Burbank officials have known for several years that Lockheed was planning a  massive reduction of activities in the 1990s, but Mayor Tom Flavin called news  that the company would pull out all its operations there a bombshell.  </P> <P> Although Lockheed's announcement Tuesday burst what had been one of the  brightest job hopes in  </P> <P> the Antelope Valley, Palmdale Mayor William J. (Pete) Knight said he was not  worried or alarmed, saying it meant only that the area will get fewer  additional jobs than had been projected.  </P> <P> The company announced in April, 1988, that it would relocate virtually all  manufacturing, parts fabrication and engineering activities to newer facilities  in Palmdale, Rye Canyon and Marietta, Ga.  </P> <P> The biggest blow to the Antelope Valley was Lockheed's announcement that two  major aircraft that it had been proposing to build in Palmdale -- the Advanced  Tactical Fighter and the P-7A maritime patrol aircraft -- would be constructed  instead at its Marietta facility.  </P> <P> With the latest restructuring, Lockheed officials said they still expect the  Antelope Valley work force to grow somewhat in the coming years. Spokesman Jim  Ragsdale said that would depend on the business generated by the company's  top-secret "Skunk Works" operation, now based in Burbank.  </P> <P> Company officials had been predicting Lockheed's Antelope Valley work force,  now about 2,100, would increase to as many as 7,000 by the mid-1990s, and those  workers were expected to be many of the 9,500 now employed in Burbank.  </P> <P> "They were forecasting jobs and apparently that's not going to materialize,"  said Knight, a former Air Force officer and test pilot. "But that doesn't mean  that some other jobs may not materialize between now and then to take their  place.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's going to have a significant impact" on the economy of the  Antelope Valley, he said. "Those were anticipated jobs that may not  materialize. If we don't get what we anticipated, it doesn't mean we've lost  the economy."  </P> <P> But Burbank officials had expected some corporate and administrative jobs to  remain in the area. However, Ragsdale said that "by the end of 1994, the  expectation is that there will be no activities of the aeronautical systems  people in Burbank." He said the Lockheed Air Terminal will not be affected by  the restructuring.  </P> <P> Flavin said a company abandoning "325 acres of industrial property in a single  city the size of Burbank cannot be expected to leave the city government and  our operations unscathed."  </P> <P> "No doubt that the city will feel a financial shock," he said.  </P> <P> Last year, the city had been in negotiations with Price Co. and Kornwasser  &amp; Friedman Shopping Center properties for a shopping complex, and had been  developing a master plan for the area in anticipation of the move.  </P> <P> But in his prepared statement, Flavin said negotiations between city officials  and Lockheed over use of the property have "bogged down for a number of  reasons, including the toxic conditions of the property and price."  </P> <P> Ragsdale said the move will not affect the Rye Canyon facility near Valencia,  which now employs 1,000 people.  </P> <P> MAIN STORY: A1  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDA PANEL DELAYS DECISION ON CETUS' PROLEUKIN  </P> <P> A Food and Drug Administration panel Monday dealt a blow to loss-weary Cetus  Corp. when it postponed a decision on the firm's application to market  Proleukin, its costliest and most important product, to treat kidney cancer.  </P> <P> The panel, whose recommendations are almost always accepted by the FDA, said it  needed more time to review data that Cetus submitted as late as last Friday and  would probably request additional meetings between Cetus officials and FDA  staff.  </P> <P> The delay, although not as devastating as an outright denial, is at best  greatly frustrating to Cetus, the Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology  company that has invested more than $100 million developing Proleukin.  Proleukin is a genetically engineered form of Interleukin-2, a protein that  regulates the immune system. The company still has cash reserves but lately has  admitted a great need for revenue from Proleukin.  </P> <P> After the four-hour panel review, Cetus Chief Executive Robert A. Fildes said  "this product can play a significant role in altering the dismal progress of  kidney cancer for many patients. We continue to believe that this drug should  be licensed quickly. . . . It is a tragedy that Americans do not have access to  a drug developed in the United States that is already approved in nine European  countries."  </P> <P> The postponement also is a damper on the financial community's hopes that four  biotech drug reviews this week would reignite enthusiasm in biotechnology  issues. But in heavy over-the-counter trading Monday, the price of Cetus stock  closed down $1.75 cents at $14.125. More than 3 million shares were traded.  </P> <P> The panel did recommend approval, however, for Genentech to market its gamma  interferon to a very narrow class of patients who suffer from an inherited  immune system disorder called chronic granulomatous disease.  </P> <P> Each FDA application is seen as a first step for these drugs, all belonging to  the family of immune system regulators. This group of proteins is viewed by  scientists and researchers as holding great potential for widespread use in the  treatment of cancers and other pernicious diseases. For the companies, they are  viewed as the products that could finally lift the biotechnology business out  of a morass of red ink.  </P> <P> For Cetus, the trouble has been in finding the one application for Proleukin  that will produce the best results and win its first FDA approval. Some critics  have accused Cetus of "shopping for a disease" to fit its cure. Interleukin-2  has been in several different clinical trials since Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the  prestigious National Cancer Institute began first tests on humans in early  1984.  </P> <P> Proleukin has been controversial because it has shown only moderate success  while producing serious side effects. The FDA's dilemma is to balance that  against the glum outlook for patients without the drug.  </P> <P> Sales of Proleukin in European countries and Cetus' other revenues are not  substantial enough to offset its costs in developing the product, said Steven  Gerber, biotech analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. And  without U.S. approval, European sales could flatten or even fall off.  </P> <P> The approval would open an estimated $20 million to $40 million annual market  to Cetus, and Gerber called that "crucial for the company. . . . If approval,  for example, is delayed for six months, well, the timing is less crucial than  the fact of approval."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BIOTECH PRODUCTS BEING CONSIDERED  </P> <P> Products and action on the FDA Advisory Committee agenda:  </P> <P> MONDAY:  </P> <P> * Delays making a recommendation on Cetus' application to market interleukin-2  drug for treatment of kidney cancer.  </P> <P> * Recommends approval for Genentech to market its gamma interferon, Actimmune,  for treatment of a rare disorder.  </P> <P> TUESDAY:  </P> <P> * Considers application by Immunex to market its version of a "colony  stimulating factor" for use in bone marrow transplants.  </P> <P> * Considers application by Schering-Plough to market Intron, an alpha  interferon licensed from Biogen, for use in treating hepatitis-C patients.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dhaka, April 26 (AFP) -- A dawn-to-dusk strike  called by Bangladesh's two main opposition parties demanding  general elections under a neutral government crippled the  capital city Tuesday [26 April].    Shops, schools, businesses and most offices shut down as  activists from Sheikh Hasina Wajed's opposition Awami League  party fanned out to enforce the strike, officials and witnesses  said.    Police stepped up patrols and guarded the office of Prime  Minister Khaleda Zia's ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party.  There was no report of violence in the city so far.    The Awami League and the Jatiya Party of deposed Bangladesh  president Hussain Muhammad Ershad called the strike to press the  government to allow the staging of the next elections under a  neutral caretaker government.    The league, however, has exempted the port city of  Chittagong  and southern district of Bhola from the general strike.    League MP [member of parliament], Tofael Ahmed, said the  opposition was "preparing a common structure" for a caretaker  government for supervising free and fair polls. "We will present  it soon before the nation," he added.    The league, Jatiya Party and the rightwing Jamaat-e-Islami  have reportedly presented bills to parliament seeking  constitutional provisions for such a government.    Zia's administration has termed the opposition's demand as  unconstitutional.    Zia was elected in 1991 in polls supervised by a caretaker  government, but the opposition charged her with rigging the  ballot.    Political sources said opposition parties were likely to  unveil their plan for a caretaker administration later this  month, and that they were discussing whether to boycott  parliament's upcoming session scheduled to begin May 4.    Zia has previously criticised the opposition-led protests  saying they hampered her government's development efforts.    Wajed said earlier this week that the Awami League will not  sponsor strikes if the opposition was allowed to air its views  on state-run television and radio stations.    League officials said Tuesday's strike was withdrawn from  Chittagong and Cox's Bazar sea resort districts for a local  annual fair. It has been put off in Bhola because Zia was  scheduled to open an power grid there.</p>

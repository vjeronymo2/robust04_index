			<p>CSO     [Text] Cayman, along with 23 other countries,  has been charged to have a draft master plan for drug control  ready by 1 July, according to a press release issued by GIS.    The challenge came at the end of a five-day regional drug  control workshop attended by Miss Andrea Bryan, Acting Permanent  Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Drug Abuse Prevention and  Rehabilitation.    The workshop, held in Barbados on 21-25 March, was entitled  "Master Plan Development and Co-ordination Mechanisms." It was  held under the auspices of the United Nations International Drug  Control Programme (UNDCP). Miss Bryan attended it in preparation  for development of Cayman's plan on drug abuse prevention and  control.    After the workshop, Miss Bryan said that the main consensus  of the 24 participating countries was that production,  trafficking, use and abuse of legal and illegal drugs is a  growing social problem worldwide.    The Caribbean with its scores of islands and cays continued  to be vulnerable to intrusions of illegal drug trafficking.  "Although the Caribbean itself produces relatively little  illicit drugs, we are in the path of suppliers and consumers,"  she said.    Miss Bryan said that the Ministry was optimistic about the  impact of the plan being developed. Although drug abuse might be  difficult--or even impossible--to eradicate, education and  rehabilitation could serve as powerful forces to turn round the  situation in Cayman.    One of the benefits of the workshop, Miss Bryan said, was  the  commitment by participants to exchange information and share  resources to help each other develop national plans.    Inter-sectoral collaboration within each country was deemed  critical. Education, Customs, Police, Immigration and other  sectors, as well as non-governmental organisations, needed to  work together. "Each hand must know what the other is doing,"  she emphasised.    Part of the workshop included role playing by  representatives  to demonstrate development of a master plan for an imaginary  state, "This was a very useful exercise and gave us an idea of  what our own country's master plan should cover," Miss Bryan  said.    Donor agencies gave presentations on sources of funds for  drug abuse prevention programmes and presentations on projects  being undertaken in the region.</p>

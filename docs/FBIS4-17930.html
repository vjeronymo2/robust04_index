			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 28, BNS - The Lithuanian-Polish  agreement on friendship and cooperation that was signed in  Vilnius April 26 caused controversial reaction among Lithuanian  politicians, although they all agree that the signing is a  positive step toward expanding relations between the two  countries.    The parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday [27  April] postponed discussion of the treaty. The committee's  chairman, Kazys Bobelis, told reporters that committee members  decided to get acquainted with agreement's text in Polish.    Arvydas Bajoras, a member of the ruling Lithuanian  Democratic Labor Party, said he sees no negative aspects in the  accord. MP [member of parliament] Algirdas Kuncinas, vice  chairman of the ruling LDLP faction in the parliament, said the  agreement lacks a number of things, and shortcomings will come  to light in the future.    Social democrat Nikolai Medvedev told the RESPUBLIKA  newspaper that he is fully satisfied with the treaty because it  guarantees Lithuania's territorial integrity and the  inviolability of its borders.    Conservative Gediminas Vagnorius said he misses an  evaluation  of recent history (1920 occupation of Vilnius), which would  eliminate possibilities for speculations.    Centrist Romualdas Ozolas, who sharply criticized the treaty  while it was still in preparation, said the agreement means "a  strategic defeat and a tactical victory." In his view, the  parliament should adopt a statement on certain aspects that were  left out along with the agreement's ratification.    Saulius Peceliunas, leader of the Democratic Party, said he  will vote for the treaty's ratification if the parliament adopts  a statement saying that a different interpretation of history is  not a pretext for Polish social organizations to claim the  property that they owned in the occupied Vilnius and its region.</p>

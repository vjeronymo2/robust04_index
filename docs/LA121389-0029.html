			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THE TAP RUNS DRY IN PHILLY AFTER AVALANCHE OF SNOWBALLS  </P> <P> Snow and alcohol don't mix, at least not at city-owned Veterans Stadium in  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Because of snowball throwing and brawling Sunday at the Eagles-Dallas Cowboys  game, the Eagles have announced a ban on alcoholic beverages in the stadium and  at tailgate parties in surrounding parking lots.  </P> <P> The snowball attacks worsened as Sunday's game wore on. The Cowboys might have  been the primary targets, but snow and ice hit officials, Eagle cheerleaders  and fans sitting in the line of fire.  </P> <P> As the Cowboys left the field after a 20-10 loss, fans poured snow, ice and  beer on them. A policeman guarding Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson was hit in the  face by a snowball and was treated by team trainers.  </P> <P> Eagle owner Norman Braman said nearly 70 fans thrown out of the stadium will  lose their season tickets.  </P> <P> Add rowdyism: Cowboy punter Mike Saxon, on the incident: "Maybe (our fans) can  throw something at (the Eagles) in Dallas. Something like cow dung."  </P> <P> Trivia time: The average active NFL head coach spent 9 1/2 years as an  assistant. Which one spent the longest time as an assistant?  </P> <P> Send in the clowns: The Pittsburgh Steelers' official publication, Steeler  Digest, on the team's 23-16 loss to the Houston Oilers in the snow Dec. 3:  "Referee Ben Dreith and his crew were horrible, and the league office might  want to consider issuing them mini-tricycles, big floppy rubber feet and  plastic carnations that squirt water, because if they're going to act like  them, they might as well look like them."  </P> <P> Fresh infusion: Tired of seeing yet another early knockout by Mike Tyson or a  walk-through such as last week's "Uno Mas" fight? Glasnost might put excitement  back in the sweet science.  </P> <P> Seven Soviet boxers, all champions in their weight classes, announced in  Toronto that they would begin training there for professional bouts.  </P> <P> New York promoter Lou Falcigno, who has a deal with the Soviets, said: "One  fight between a Soviet heavyweight, of course with the right buildup, and a  Mike Tyson could easily be worth a quarter of a billion dollars."  </P> <P> Heavyweight Alexander Burmistrov, 26, has 157 victories in 169 fights. Through  an interpreter, Burmistrov said he eventually would defeat Tyson.  </P> <P> Add Soviets: Alexander Smirnoff, a defenseman for the touring Khimik team of  the Soviet Union, after playing against the Kings, the Edmonton Oilers and the  Calgary Flames: "I think (the Flames) are a great team and deserve to win the  Stanley Cup. Their style is closest to the European style of hockey. I think  the team plays a style closest to our team, even though they are physical at  times."  </P> <P> So far so good: Carl Barger, president of the Pittsburgh Pirates, on the  free-agent market: "There's always a big fear when you sign free agents. I'm  frightened. But we have some quality people coming aboard. We didn't get any  George Hendrickses."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The Minnesota Vikings' Jerry Burns, 20 years.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Former Dodger Steve Sax of the New York Yankees attended the Roberto  Duran-Sugar Ray Leonard fight Thursday night, along with teammate Don  Mattingly: "We had good seats. We were 30 feet from the ring. Just outside  sweat range." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

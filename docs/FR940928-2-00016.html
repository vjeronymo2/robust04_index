Comments were filed by the city of Janesville and are addressed in the final EA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the final EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / FT Training and Enterprise Council Survey:  The partnership between the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils and the government is one of the most ambitious forged with the private sector. The performance of the Tecs, which handle Pounds 2.3bn of public money each year, will help determine the private sector's willingness to push ahead with other programmes Questionnaires were sent to 1,220 Tec directors.  The majority of these were senior businessmen and women from the private sector.  A minority came from the public sector and trade unions.  A total of 506 replies were received and the main findings were: More than 88 per cent of directors have been with their Tec for more than one year 90 per cent expect to spend more than two years with the Tec 28 per cent spend more than six hours a week on Tec-related activities 72 per cent are satisfied with Tecs' progress generally, the greatest level of dissatisfaction being expressed by members of trade unions 78 per cent believe Tecs should be the subject of minor evolutionary reform.  Trade union members are again the most critical with 37 per cent alling for drastic reform 68 per cent believe the government's spending on training via Tecs is too low 49 per cent believe there should be a levy on business to pay for training people in work.  Nearly 40 per cent of business executives share this view A majority are unhappy with the current intermediary body between Tecs and government - called G10 and made up of 10 Tec chairmen.  30 per cent of critics of G10 want a stronger intermediary body, along the lines of Scottish Enterprise, which funds the Scottish equivalent of Tecs Youth Training, the government-funded scheme for 16-19 year olds, is seen as important or very important by 96 per cent of directors 78 per cent favour a 'universal credit' which would entitle all 16-19 year olds to full and part-time education and training 51 per cent say a department of education and training should be created 43 per cent believe the government's new Training for Work scheme for the adult jobless, with its emphasis on payment for getting people into jobs or gaining qualifications, could force Tecs to discriminate against individuals who need a lot of help 30 per cent say the relationship between their Tec and the local careers services is unsatisfactory 90 per cent say their Tecs relationship with schools is either very good or good 51 per cent are satisfied with the progress of Investors in People - the scheme to improve training of people in work - in their areas.  33 say they are dissatisfied 70 per cent of directors' own companies or, in the case of trade union members and local authority representatives, are committed to being awarded IIP. 54 per cent believe the promotion of Inward Investment into their area is inadequate 56 per cent are in favour of some form of workfare targeted at specific groups</p>

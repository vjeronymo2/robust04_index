			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Greater employee say urged by pensions body - Social Security committee EMPLOYEES should be given equal representation on pension fund boards of trustees in order to prevent the repetition of a 'Maxwell-like scandal', the National Association of Pension funds said yesterday. In testimony to the Commons social security committee, Mr Brian McMahon, NAPF chairman, said employers and employees should have equal representation with independent trustees appointed in appropriate situations. 'Care should be taken to avoid domination by any one party,' the NAPF said. The NAPF is the leading industry group on pensions in the UK and its members run pension schemes with more than Pounds 250bn in assets. The committee, which on Monday sought to question Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell about the Maxwell company pension funds, is considering proposing reforms to UK pensions law. The NAPF also urged that assets of pension funds should be held by a custodian trustee independent of the employing company. It added that where investment management is carried out internally, as it was for much of the Mirror Group Pension fund, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) set tougher rules. Mr McMahon said the disappearance of Maxwell pension funds assets reflects weaknesses in the regulation of fund managers rather than of pension funds. 'The supervision of an investment manager entrusted with the Mirror Group pension funds was inadequate,' Mr McMahon said. 'We should like to see the Financial Services Act amended to five protection to members of pension schemes.' The NAPF also urged that the 5 per cent limit on self-investment be applied to all types of investments, and said that a two to five-year period would be sufficient to wind down portfolios that currently exceed that limit.</p>

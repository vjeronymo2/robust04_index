			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn/Zagreb (DPA) -- Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman today accused the Muslims of using chlorine gas shells  in the fighting in central Bosnia. Following the departure of  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, with whom Tudjman had held  talks at a two-day conference in Bonn, Tudjman also accused the  Muslims of continued offensives. However, he described the  Bosnia-Croatian conference at the Petersberg government guest  house as useful.    Even after Tudjman's remarks, it remained unclear whether  there would be a cease-fire in central Bosnia. Izetbegovic said  yesterday evening on ZDF [Second German Television Channel] that  "no major results" had been achieved. Both presidents are now  preparing for a new round of talks on 18 January in Geneva, this  time involving all warring parties from the conference on former  Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Doha Qatar Television Service in Arabic  at 2000 GMT on 12 February 1994 carries a 45-minute recorded  program on Iraq. The program is entitled "The Blockade," and is  subtitled "A Special Program on the Impact of the Economic  Blockade on Iraq." A map of Iraq is shown in yellow. A white  ring surrounds the middle of the map near Baghdad. No other  countries are shown on the map, the rest of which is colored  green.    The program opens with a Qatari announcer standing under a  monument in Baghdad commemorating the Iran-Iraq war. The  monument consists of two long swords stretching from the two  sides of a wide avenue and forming a huge arch. The video then  cuts to show Baghdad streets and people shopping in a market  place. The announcer opens the program with the following  announcement: "The blockade has created a big crisis inside  Iraq. The Iraqi people are looking to the international  community to end this blockade. Today, what is the main picture  of the economic, social, and health conditions in Baghdad and  other Iraqi provinces? To convey this picture from where it is  happening and from the center of events, a Qatari television  mission set out on a journey that lasted over 10 hours between  the Jordanian capital Amman--the only gate to Iraq--and Baghdad.  It is a trip that conveys several images and many answers to  what is taking place in Iraq after almost three and a half years  of blockade."    The announcer interviews a citizen who complains that he  cannot find the medicine prescribed for him by a doctor. The  citizen blames the blockade for the shortage of medicine. He  says he "wants the world to see our suffering." Another citizen  says "all the people need food, not only medicine. The blockade  is unjust for all the Iraqi people." A third citizen notes that  children are especially suffering because of lack of medicine.  However, he notes that "despite the blockade, the Iraqi people  are standing fast." More citizens complain about the high price  of food and clothes. The announcer says: "The Iraqi individual  is facing an economic crisis in view of his low daily or monthly  income. The average monthly income does not exceed 500 Iraqi  dinars." A woman says she cannot buy new clothes and has to be  content with old and hand-stitched clothes. A man says his  monthly salary is 120 dinars, which is just enough for a meal in  a restaurant in Baghdad. Another man says his monthly salary is  125 dinars, while the price of a kilo of meat is 160 dinars.  Young men cannot get married, as a wedding costs between 50,000  and 100,000 dinars. He appeals to humanitarian organizations to  help the Iraqi people. A citizen says that "because of the  blockade some people have resorted to crime--to theft,  kidnapping, rape, etcetera." More citizens are interviewed and  they all complain about the high price of food and clothing.  The announcer notes that "food staples, such as rice, sugar,  and flour, are available in most markets of Baghdad and other  provinces, but their prices are beyond the reach of most Iraqis."    In a four-minute interview, Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad  Mahdi  Salih is asked what the materials are that can be imported from  abroad and what the materials are that can be exported under the  current blockade. He says that no exports are allowed because  "UN Security Council resolutions still prevent Iraq from  exporting any commodity." He notes that "after Resolution 687  was issued and after the military aggression against our country  stopped, Iraq was allowed to import food and medicine. But how  can it import when there are no oil exports and when our funds  in foreign banks, specifically in U.S., British, French, and  German banks, are still frozen? Therefore, the means of  importing these materials are also frozen. At the end of 1991,  we were allowed to import through the frozen funds. We imported  a quantity of foodstuffs, but another resolution, No. 778, was  issued at the end of 1992 re-freezing the Iraqi funds and  preventing Iraq from using them to buy food and medicine."    Asked about a certain UN Security Council resolution  allowing  Iraq to export a specified quantity of oil -- just enough to  enable it to import humanitarian materials -- the minister says:  "In fact, this resolution was designed for the purpose of  paying the expenses of the inspection teams and other UN  expenses and not for the purpose of securing the needs of the  Iraqi people. Therefore, the resolution was designed and its  technical details were drawn up in such a way as to secure the  export of a quantity of oil without securing the import of  materials. This resolution also interferes in the country's  domestic affairs regarding the distribution of materials to the  population."    Asked about the recent arrival of ships at the Iraqi port of  Umm Qasr, the minister says: "In fact, when funds are  available, the materials that are allowed to be imported, such  as food, come through al-'Aqabah. The Turkish line is also open  for food imports. However, the problem lies in financing  imports. As for Umm Qasr port, its opening and the entry of  ships into it last month enabled Iraq to have direct contacts  with the outside the world and to import permitted materials and  commodities. In other words, goods arrive at our national  territory directly and we have direct contacts with the outside  the world. This is an essential point on the subject. In  addition, the cost of imports is reduced when goods come to our  ports directly. The harsh economic conditions in the country  require a reduction in the cost of imports when the country is  in a position to import any quantity of food and medicine."    The video then shows the Jordanian border point of  al-Karamah  on the Jordanian-Iraqi border and trucks transporting Iraqi  crude oil to Jordan. More scenes are shown of Iraqi markets and  more interviews are carried out with Iraqi citizens.    The program then carries a two-minute interview with the  Hashim 'Ali 'Ubayd, under secretary of the Ministry of Finance.  He says: "The current exchange rate of foreign currencies,  especially the dollar, in the Iraqi market and in the so-called  parallel market does not represent the real exchange rate of the  Iraqi dinar. This is because Iraq's foreign assets and funds  are frozen. Iraq has not been allowed to export any commodity  to earn these currencies. The current market of foreign  currencies is very small and depends on what is available of  these currencies in the market. It does not represent the real  exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar."    The video then shows children in Iraqi hospitals and notes  lack of medical equipment, in addition to lack of medicine.  Several women who were interviewed stress that there is no  medicine for babies, either in hospitals or in pharmacies. A  nurse says that babies are suffering from anemia and  malnutrition. A pediatrician says there are no antibiotics or  other medicine.    In a 8-minute interview, Health Minister Dr. 'Umid Midhat  Mubarak says: "Regrettably, the unjust UN resolutions have  affected the situation. We can no longer obtain diagnostic  materials such as primary chemical materials. We cannot even  obtain isotopes, which everyone knows cannot be used for  nonmedical purposes." He says the "mortality rate for children  under five years old in 1989 was not more than 375 children per  month. In December 1993, the mortality rate was over 4,000 per  month. As for citizens over five years old, the mortality rate  in 1989 was 1,700 per month; now it is approximately 6,500 per  month." The health minister says most surgery is being postponed  due to lack of equipment and medicine. He notes that due to lack  of foreign currencies, Iraqi patients cannot be sent abroad for  treatment. He regrets that some countries who claim to be  defenders of human rights have denied entry visas to Iraqi  patients. He notes that "the brothers in Qatar have recently  sent medical consignments." He expresses the hope that "the  brothers and real friends will realize this injustice inflicted  on every single one of the Iraqi people for purely political  reasons." He says these reasons are no longer justified and  there is no need to use them to bring political pressure."    In a two-minute interview, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id  al-Sahhaf is asked whether he expects the blockade imposed on  Iraq by the UN Security Council to be partially or wholly lifted  in the near future. He gives the following answer: "We are  working to complete the implementation of Paragraph 22. Logic  says that the correct course is for Iraq and the Security  Council to complete the work together to implement Paragraph 22  without any political conditions being added to it by any party.  There is a very clear text. There are requirements which  should be fulfilled to implement this text. These requirements  are that Ambassador Ekeus, chairman of the Security Council Ad  Hoc Committee, and Dr. Hans Blix, director general of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], should submit a  report to the Security Council, in accordance with the mandate  given to them, saying that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations  under Section C, that is Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. We  are close to reaching this situation. We will work with the Ad  Hoc Committee and the IAEA to complete the technical formulas  for beginning the implementation of the supervision programs in  accordance with Resolution 715. Consequently, it will be the  duty of the Security Council to implement Paragraph 22."    The video then shows more interviews with Iraqi citizens  praising the State of Qatar and appealing to Arab states to help  the Iraqi people. One citizen says "Kuwait returned to its  people and Jabir returned as its amir. So what does the United  Nations want? What does the Security Council want? What does  the world want? What do the great powers want? What do they  want from the Iraqi people? The people are suffering greatly  and dying. There is no food, no medicine, and no essential  goods."</p>

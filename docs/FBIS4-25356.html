			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin today called on senior army officers to conscientiously  study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and Deng's ideas on army construction during the  present new period.    At a ceremony promoting 19 senior officers to generals,  Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission,  emphasized the importance of integrating Deng's theory and ideas  with practice.    He said: "We must pay close attention to the study of modern  science, technology and expertise, and study strategies and  tactics of the people's war in high-tech conditions, in order to  master the capabilities needed to direct modern warfare."    The leader stressed that senior officers must study hard,  unswervingly implement the line and policies of the Chinese  Communist Party and firmly follow the instructions of the party  Central Committee and the Central Military Commission.    Jiang described a powerful army and strong national defense  as a "powerful backing" for reforms, opening up to the world and  the modernization drive, and as a "reliable guarantee" for the  consolidation of state power, social stability, economic growth  and a peaceful life.    He said that officers and men of the People's Liberation  Army  (PLA), China's armed forces, must be vigilant in peace-time and  be well prepared at all times so as to make even greater  contributions to China's security, unification, stability and  unity.    He asked senior officers to serve the people wholeheartedly,  sincerely bring happiness to the people, work hard in the  interests of the people, and to be honest.    The PLA is best known for being well-organized and strictly  observing discipline, said Jiang, general secretary of the party  Central Committee.    For this reason, senior officers must set an example in  observing discipline and implementing rules and regulations, he  said.    They must also implement to the letter the decisions, orders  and directives of the party Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission, he added.</p>

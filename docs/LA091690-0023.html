			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: JAUNTS NOW AVAILABLE TO OTAGO BIRD PRESERVES  </P> <P> New Zealand is ideal for nature lovers, with nearly 20% of the countryside  under some form of protection. One of the interesting areas is the tip of the  Otago Peninsula near Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island, where travelers can  visit the Royal Albatross colony and Penguin Place.  </P> <P> The budget traveler who is interested in the South Island of New Zealand and  its popular albatross and penguin colonies can arrange for minivan  transportation at the Stafford Gables youth hostel in Dunedin.  </P> <P> Without the minivan ride, travelers would have to supply their own  transportation or join a tour. They would also be faced with a five-mile hike  from the bus stop at Portobello to the Royal Albatross colony at Taiaroa Head.  </P> <P> To avoid disturbing the wildlife at the colony, which is close to civilization,  the number of visitors is restricted. Before travelers go, they should get  details at the hostel and arrange for tickets.  </P> <P> Pick a windy day for the best sightings, because the albatross need a 15- to  20-knot wind to get airborne. At the site there is a reception building with  information.  </P> <P> At nearby Penguin Place, after paying a small entrance fee, visitors can see  "yellow-eyed" penguins and "fur" seals. Best sightings are after 5 p.m.  </P> <P> The minivan for guests at Stafford Gables in Dunedin, second largest city on  South Island, operates from October to April.  </P> <P> Open all day, the hostel is at 71 Stafford St. The telephone number is (024)  741-919. It has family, twin and dormitory accommodations from about $9.50 per  night.  </P> <P> This is one of 50 hostels in New Zealand affiliated with the International  Youth Hostel Federation. In addition, there are 75 independent facilities  referred to as "backpackers accommodation," which offer beds in small dormitory  rooms, plus twin and double rooms.  </P> <P> Rates for these facilities range from $5 to $9.50 per night, with no age  restrictions.  </P> <P> New Zealand also has 12 national parks on the North and South islands, the  largest being Fiordland with 3 million acres.  </P> <P> Considering the availability of all these parks, one of the most popular  pastimes in New Zealand is walking or hiking. Walks can range from an afternoon  in a Kauri forest to several days exploring lush rain forests and alpine  passes. In Fiordland, there are more than 300 miles of developed trails.  </P> <P> Instead of walking alone, arrangements can be made to walk with a group. Only a  day-pack is needed because meals and bedding are prearranged at lodges each  evening.  </P> <P> Travelers also can participate in "freedom walking" -- carrying their own food  and sleeping bags and paying only for use of backcountry huts and  transportation to and from the trailheads.  </P> <P> Throughout New Zealand there are more than 850 huts that provide simple shelter  with mattresses, bunks and cooking facilities, for $2.50 to $8 per night.  </P> <P> The best time to hike is October to March. Holiday crowds arrive in January and  February.  </P> <P> Travelers will find much information about South Island in a new 446-page  edition of the "New Zealand Handbook" by Jane King, which contains 81 maps. It  costs $14.95, was printed by Moon Publications and is available at major  bookstores.  </P> <P> For more information and brochures, contact the New Zealand Tourist &amp;  Publicity Office, 10960 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1530, Los Angeles 90024, (800)  388-5494 or (213) 477-8241.  </P></p>

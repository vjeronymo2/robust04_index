			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Airline body seeks let-up on investment THE International Air Transport Association (Iata) is urging governments to relax rigid foreign investment rules for airlines to encourage cross-border mergers and alliances in the industry. The organisation, which groups 210 international airlines, recommends in its annual report to be published today that governments allow foreign investors to acquire up to 49 per cent of the voting rights in their national airlines. Competition law should override national transport policies. This issue is at the centre of tense negotiations between the UK and the US over British Airways' plan to acquire a 44 per cent stake with 21 per cent of the voting rights in USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 460.1m). The US is seeking greater access for US airlines into the UK market as a condition for approving BA's investment in USAir. But the UK is only prepared to grant this if the US in turn relaxes its foreign investment rules for airlines. The Iata recommendation comes at a time of consolidation and globalisation in the airline industry which has been accelerated by deregulation and the economic recession. Mr Gunter Eser, Iata's director-general, also warns that despite a slow recovery the industry is heading for another big loss this year of around Dollars 2bn. Iata airlines lost Dollars 4bn on international scheduled services last year after losing Dollars 2.7bn in 1990. Mr Eser notes in the annual report that airline interest charges have doubled since 1987 reflecting high interest rates and, above all, the very high proportion of debt which airlines now carry on their balance sheets. Iata is forecasting average annual growth of 5 per cent in international passenger traffic between now and 1996 after a fall of 4.4 per cent last year. The International Federation of Tour Operators (Ifto) has warned that the number of tourists visiting Greece next year could fall by 1m following the introduction of a Pounds 16 airport departure tax, writes Michael Skapinker. Mr Martin Brackenbury, president of Ifto which represents travel companies in 17 countries, said the tax, which came into effect yesterday, could cost Greece up to Pounds 500m annually in lost tourist revenues.</p>

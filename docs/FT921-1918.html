			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Curves of iron IN THE currently fashionable interior, wrought-iron is usually much in evidence. There is something about its malleability, its paradoxical combination of visual spareness and brute strength which seems to appeal to a new generation of designers. It lends itself to the curving lines the Gothic and classically-inspired pieces require. Once almost solely confined to garden and conservatory these days it is marching into the most modish of interiors. From dining-chairs made from wrought-iron combined with rattan - for Global Village - to the sophisticated designs of Andre Dubrueil, wrought-iron is currently undergoing a surge of popularity. Suzanne Ruggles has been studying wrought-iron's potential and developing ideas with a group of 10 different blacksmiths all over the country. The results can be seen and bought in her shop at 90 Fulham Road, London SW3. From her first range - a Gothic-inspired collection which included a two-seater-sofa, a coffee table, side table, armchair and stool, she moved on to other motifs, including a wheatsheaf settle, an oakleaf side table and armchair and to her latest range, the neo-classical designs photographed here, right. Many of her pieces feature the now fashionable motifs of lyres, tassled ropes, cabriole legs and twisted stems. The sofa sells for Pounds 950, while the armchair is Pounds 450 (both include the base cushion). The coffee table is Pounds 450 and the plant-stand Pounds 190. The tall candlesticks (Pounds 95) and the sconce (Pounds 55) are just two examples from a large collection of candlestands and candelabra, many with a distinctly ecclesiastical air and many inspired by medieval designs. There is a particularly fine plain curving chandelier (Pounds 324) while candlestands come in many sizes and designs. Standing on the plant-stand is a vase made from hand-blown iridescent glass combined with metal which sells for Pounds 185, just one of the many hand-crafted pieces commissioned from other designers by Suzanne Ruggles. Look out for the strange floral sculptures by Kristine Gad as well for work by Isabel Tennent and Caroline Le Cras who have been using traditional techniques such as gilding, verre eglomise, lacquering and painted finishes to produce a stunning series of frames and mirrors.</p>

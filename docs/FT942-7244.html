			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds After near-disaster in the late 1970s, Courtaulds spent a decade trying to iron out volatility from its fibres business. The outperformance of the shares since then is a measure of its success. Yesterday's figures are a reminder of the limits to text-book management. While Courtaulds is a low-cost producer, demand remains unpredictable. Given the bleak outlook at the interim stage, a 14 per cent drop in full year operating profits from fibres and chemicals is something of a relief. If fibres markets are kinder this year, tackling the coatings and sealants business is now the most pressing task. Yesterday's Pounds 50m restructuring charge is a step in that direction. An operating margin of 7 per cent on turnover of Pounds 850m is well below what could be achieved. With the economic cycle now turning in Courtaulds' favour, improvement in this area should underpin growth. But even if Courtaulds repeats its management success in fibres, the prospects are hardly dazzling. For the shares to sustain a rating above the market average, Courtaulds' new fibre Tencel needs to deliver. With plans for 150,000 tonnes capacity by the end of the decade the company is backing its faith with cash. The potential return on this investment is still difficult to predict. If Courtaulds can make the best of its lead in this area, though, the shares should again outperform.</p>

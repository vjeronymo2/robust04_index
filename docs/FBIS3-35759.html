			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku, January 29 (TURAN) -- The President of AMOCO  Caspian Sea Petroleum Company Robert Balton arrived in Baku  yesterday.    Today he will meet with the leadership of Azerbaijan.  Questions of cooperation in oil exploration, and specifically  AMOCO's participation in the oil field exploration in the  Caspian will be discussed during the sessions.    More than three years have passed since the Azeri Government  declared its in?ent to begin exploration of oil fields with  participation of foreign companies. But political instability  and the frequent change in political regimes prevented the  signing of the contracts.    A representative of one of the oil companies told TURAN that  a few weeks ago the members of the oil consortium appealed to  the Azeri Government for a final answer concerning the contract.  Also, it became known that the companies have given an  ultimatum: They will leave Azerbaijan should if they do not  have a clear answer by that spring. [sentence as received]    A few days ago, Tim Hartnet, AMOCO's representative in Baku  told TURAN that "we are on the eve of signing a contract. We  think it will be signed in the near future."    The so-called "Russian factor" prevents an earlier signing  of  the contract. Russia, which has neither technology nor capital  to offer Azerbaijan, nevertheless wants to participate in the  distribution of Azeri oil. In November 1993, after the most  recent successful offensive of t?e Armenian army, President  Geydar Aliyev invited R?ssian Secretary for Energy Yuriy  Shafranik to Baku to sign an agreement allowing Russian  participation in exploration of Azeri oil fields. Baku agreed  to give 10 percent of Azerbaijan's s?are in the exploration  project of the Azeri-Chirag oil field to the Russian LUKOIL  company.    This gave Azerbaijan a needed break at the front. But the  planned December final signing of the contract with LUKOIL did  not take place.    At this time, Aliyev visited Paris where he proposed to  President Mitterrand that France use its capital in  reinvigorating the Azerbaijani economy. At present,  representatives of the French Elf oil company is looking into  possibilities for participation in the exploration of Azeri oil.  Meanwhile, AZADLIG newspaper writes, citing the well-informed  sources, that a massive transportation of arms and ammunition  from Russia to Armenia is taking place with the intent of  further transport to Karabakh. Evidently, on the eve of the  signing the contract with the Western oil consortium, the world  will soon hear about the next large-scale offensive by the  Armenian Army into Azerbaijani territory. Practice has already  proved this more than once.</p>

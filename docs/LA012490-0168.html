			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ALL THE PRESSURE IS ON S.F., BRONCO PLAYERS SAY  </P> <P> They know most of America expects them to get soundly beaten in Super Bowl  XXIV. Yet, the Denver Broncos, those 12-point underdogs from the AFC, aren't  acting like a club headed for the guillotine.  </P> <P> During the team photo-and-interview session Tuesday at the Superdome, the  Broncos acted like a carefree team with nothing to lose and portrayed the San  Francisco 49ers as a team with the weight of the world on its shoulders.  </P> <P> "We have a chance to be the (1980) U.S. hockey team against the Russians," a  relaxed Coach Dan Reeves said. "The 49ers have an opportunity to grab a piece  of history, be the first team in 10 years to win back-to-back championships and  the second to win four. We have a tremendous opportunity to alter history."  </P> <P> "We've got nothing to lose," added John Elway, sitting in a chair with his legs  crossed. "They're the dynasty with all the pressure. All we have to do is go  out and play. We're having fun because we don't have a chance to win this game  according to you guys."  </P> <P> The point spread for Sunday's showdown is the largest since the Kansas City  Chiefs were a 13-point underdog in Super Bowl IV against the Minnesota Vikings.  The largest spread ever came in Super Bowl III when the Joe Namath-led New York  Jets were 18-point underdogs to the mighty Baltimore Colts.  </P> <P> The Broncos are well aware that the Chiefs and Jets both emerged as surprise  winners. "There's nothing wrong with being the underdog," running back Sammy  Winder said. "It (the point spread) has nothing to do with what happens  Sunday."  </P> <P> The Broncos have been constantly reminded this week of their 0-3 record in  Super Bowls, including blowouts of 39-20 to the New York Giants in Super Bowl  XXI and 42-10 to the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII. Should they lose  Sunday, the Broncos would tie the Vikings for the most Super Bowl losses.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Broncos think this year's team is the best of their Super Bowl  entries in the last decade. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, they  have a simpler, more physical defense. The Broncos also have a respectable  running game that should take pressure off Elway.  </P> <P> "This is the best team we've brought to the Super Bowl," Elway said. "We're  bigger, we're better on defense and we have a better running game. But we're  playing the best team we've played in a Super Bowl."  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cook adds to Major's 'charge-list'  -'Inconceivable' that PM did not know of exports; Inquiry terms widen search for who knew what MR ROBIN COOK, shadow trade and industry secretary, sought yesterday to keep up maximum pressure on Mr John Major over the arms-to-Iraq affair with a fresh compilation of documents that he said showed the prime minister had repeatedly misled MPs. Continuing Labour's tactic of seeking the best impact by selectively releasing documents, Mr Cook said his 'charge-sheet' proved 'beyond reasonable doubt' that Mr Major must have known he was misleading MPs. He admitted he did not have proof that Mr Major had read papers sent to him when he was foreign secretary, chancellor or prime minister. But Mr Cook said it was 'inconceivable' the prime minister would not have had his attention drawn by civil servants to relevant information. One cabinet minister admitted that the handling of Labour's campaign to harry the government was 'impeccable'. Mr George Foulkes, a Labour defence spokesman, plans to publish tomorrow a list of companies which, he says, breached export guidelines  - sometimes with the tacit approval of the government. Asked how many more documents he could release, Mr Cook replied: 'I have 464 documents. As to when we release them is a different matter.' Mr Cook's case against the prime minister is based on assurances from Mr Major in the Commons and in a letter to Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, that the arms embargo against Iraq had been kept. Mr Cook said that 'ministers first relaxed and then ignored those guidelines'. Mr Cook cited a telex sent to the British embassy in Japan by Sir Geoffrey Howe, then foreign secretary, in June 1989 - a month before Mr Major became foreign secretary. It asked for information on why the Japanese had prevented the export of machine tools to Iraq and whether they were aware the export of similar items was being considered by the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Cook said: 'We therefore know that the office of his (Mr Major's) predecessor knew about the sensitive nature of this export order and were concerned enough to consult the government of Japan. Did the private office of the foreign secretary really forget all knowledge of the issue when John Major took over a month later?' A second document was a briefing note for Mr Major, when foreign secretary, describing media interest in Matrix Churchill before a meeting he had with Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister. A further document is a letter sent in June 1990 - when Mr Major was chancellor - to the private secretary to the chairman of Customs and Excise from the private secretary to Mr Nicholas (now Lord) Ridley. It referred to a forthcoming visit to Matrix Churchill and said that copies were being sent to the chancellor. Two other documents dating from 1990 were a letter from the DTI to Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, the former prime minister. It offered a draft reply to pressure for approval of exports of machine tools to Iraq. The second was a DTI memorandum recommending that future export licences for Iraq should be cleared through the Cabinet Office 'who are acting as the co-ordinator in the Iraqi gun context'. Mr Cook said: 'Did Downing Street forget all it had learnt about the exports to Iraq when he (Mr Major) came in the door?. . . The authority of government in Britain cannot be restored so long as its prime minister wriggles rather than face the facts.'</p>

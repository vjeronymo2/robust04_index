			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Guo Fengmin Stresses That If British Side Takes </F> Unilateral Action, Chinese Side Will Definitely Respond"]    [Text] Yesterday, Guo Fengmin, chief Chinese  representative China to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group  [JLG], pointed out that when the Sino-British talks on the  arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994/95 elections began, it was  made clear that the contents of the talks were confidential. If  the British side unilaterally publicizes the content of the  talks, the Chinese side will naturally take action accordingly.    Guo Fengmin made the above remarks when asked by a reporter  what reaction the Chinese side will take if the British side  publicizes the contents of talks at a spring party hosted by the  Island Office [Hong Kong Island] of XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong  Branch yesterday evening.    Guo Fengmin said: When China and Britain started the talks,  they laid down the rule that the contents would be kept  confidential. If the British side now takes unilateral action,  the Chinese side of course will react accordingly. As to what  reaction will be taken Guo Fengmin hopes the public will "wait  and see."    Besides, Guo Fengmin also said that according to the  provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, at least three  JLG meetings should be held each year. "I think there will be  three meetings this year." He pointed out that there will be a  experts panel meeting on the use of military land this week,  after which other expert panel meetings will be considered.</p>

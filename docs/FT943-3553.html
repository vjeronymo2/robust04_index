			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains ground for the first time in six sessions Equities rose for the first time in six trading days, but concern about oversupply weighed on activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average was up 19.40 at 19,917.28 after a day's high of 19,973.39 and low of 19,882.58. Institutional investors and public funds supported share prices, but the upside was limited by small-lot sales and arbitrage unwinding. Volume was only 194m shares, against Friday's 581m. Investor confidence remained depressed as Japan Telecom, the long distance telecommunications operator listed on the second section last week, lost further ground. Friday's Wall Street decline also weighed on sentiment. Traders said worries over the listing of Japan Tobacco next week prevailed. 'The sentiment indicators like the ratio of put and call options show that people are more bearish than the same time last year,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. Investors are also wary of Matsushita Electric Industrial's planned Y200bn convertible bonds issuance early next month. The Topix index of all first section stocks eased 0.43 to 1,586.17 and the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.16 to 289.04. Falls led rises by 488 to 464, with 229 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.89 to 1,291.39. Japan Telecom posted a new low of Y4.27m, falling Y13,000. Other telecommunication stocks were also lower, with DDI down Y9,000 to Y898,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y1,000 to Y884,000. Steels were firm on selling and buying back activity by investors who wanted to realise profits ahead of the September book closing. Nippon Steel rose Y5 to Y375. Some banks, which were down last week on profit-taking, rallied. Bank of Tokyo put on Y20 at Y1,510. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y30 to Y1,620 on fears of oversupply caused by its expected convertible bond issue. Sumitomo Bakelite dropped Y26 to Y691 due to the weakness of its convertible bonds floated last week. Daito Trust Construction fell by its daily limit of Y400 to Y1,620 following reports of sharply lower pre-tax profits projections for the current business year to next March. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 21.80 to 22,228.12 in volume of 42m shares. Rohm, a semiconductor device maker, rose Y80 to Y4,260 on a higher pre-tax profits forecast.

HONG KONG slid 2.5 per cent, with Chinese-incorporated issues the hardest hit after a recent rally, followed by the interest rate-sensitive property sector. The Hang Seng index shed 254.65 to 9,890.37, not far above the day's low of 9,856.11. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 5.08bn, down from Friday's HKDollars 7.28bn.

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave SBJ Pounds 0.5m in the red Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker, yesterday reported a swing from profits of Pounds 13.27m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 521,000 for 1993. A reduced final dividend of 6p cuts the total from 13.25p to 9p. The deficit was fully in line with expectations following the announcement of exceptional costs at the interim stage last September. Dealers responded positively to an underlying trading profit of Pounds 6.92m and marked the shares up 10p to 129p. A poor performance by the group's direct energy and marine reinsurance operations was the main factor in a decline in brokerage income to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 47.3m). Although hull, cargo and protection and indemnity business performed well energy brokers struggled with tight capacity in London and tough competition in the US. Income from marine insurance and reinsurance as a whole fell to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 14.7m). By contrast, brokerage income from London market non-marine increased to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 14.6m), while retail business rose to Pounds 19.95m (Pounds 16.7m). Income was also hit by an exchange rate loss of Pounds 2.24m. Investment and other income fell to Pounds 6.02m (Pounds 7.83m). The share of profits of associates amounted to Pounds 19,000 (Pounds 911,000). Administrative expenses increased to Pounds 44.4m (Pounds 43.9m) and charges for reorganisation and closure amounted to Pounds 4.4m. COMMENT The bad news which has led the shares to underperform in the last 12 months appears to be over. There was no further deterioration in the second half and tough management action last year should now begin to yield fruit. Planned cuts in expenses should produce savings of some Pounds 3m this year and the group should also benefit significantly from the strength of the dollar. New pay incentives have been introduced for senior staff, but trading conditions remain difficult and earnings prospects uncertain. Even so, on balance and barring any further mishaps, 1994 profits of at least Pounds 8m should be within reach, putting the share on an attractive multiple going forward of under 12. A prospective yield of 8.7 provides support.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / People: Non-executive directors Barrie Stephens (above), who has built Siebe into Britain's biggest engineering company in the space of 20 years, has picked up his first non-executive directorship since he announced that he was splitting his role as chairman and chief executive of Siebe. An industrial engineer who has spent his whole life in the engineering industry on both sides of the Atlantic, he has been appointed a non-executive director of the troubled Simon Engineering. The appointment is a coup for Simon which, despite its illustrious history, is a fraction of Siebe's size and has been beset by management upheavals and financial problems. Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman of Vickers, sits on the boards of Siebe and Simon and is understood to have helped recruit Stephens. The latter will be 66 next month and while he will remain a non-executive chairman of Siebe, is handing over the chief executive's job to Allen Yurko. Meanwhile, Alan Jarvis, who was replaced as Simon Engineering's finance director last October, has resigned from the board.</p>

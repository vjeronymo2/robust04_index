			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / BP nearly doubles profits in quarter BP nearly doubled replacement cost profits to Pounds 332m in the third quarter, shrugging off weak oil prices and sluggish economic conditions. Excluding exceptional items, the rise in replacement cost profits - which leave out swings in inventory values - was 51 per cent. Reduced losses on disposal of businesses in the third quarter of 1993, compared with the previous year, and increased tax credits were responsible for much of the difference. For the first time since 1991 the company saw a cash inflow from operations excluding disposals. Cash inflow was Pounds 733m while disposal proceeds were Pounds 522m. Better-than-expected progress was made in reducing debt, which fell by Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) during the quarter to Dollars 13.1bn - gearing of 86 per cent compared with 102 per cent a year ago. The reduction in debt was helped by an accelerated programme of disposals of non-core assets. These totalled Dollars 2.4bn in the first nine months, well ahead of a full-year target of Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn. Mr Simon said disposals for 1994 would 'probably be about Dollars 1bn'. Earnings per share for the quarter were 6.2p, while the third quarterly dividend was unchanged at 2.1p. The shares rose 10p to 357p. BP's operating profit for the first nine months of the year was Pounds 1.89bn, 44 per cent up on the same period last year. Mr David Simon, chief executive, said BP's strong performance reflected cost savings, improved oil marketing margins and a stronger dollar. The company also received a Pounds 50m after-tax benefit from changes made by the government last March to petroleum revenue tax. The star performer for the quarter was refining and marketing. BP attributed its success to improved margins, although analysts thought BP's cost-cutting in the division may have been particularly successful. Mr Simon said the latest results showed that BP was on track to make profits of Dollars 2bn a year by 1995. Chemicals lost Pounds 16m in the third quarter against a loss of Pounds 1m in the same period last year. Mr Simon pinpointed Europe's over-capacity in ethylene as a problem and said BP might 'look to its own solutions' if there was no early pan-European agreement to cut capacity.

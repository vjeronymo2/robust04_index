			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / European policy debates may go public THE European Community is close to agreeing proposals to open important policy debates and initial discussion of 'major new legislative proposals' to the public, as part of the EC drive to bring decision-making closer to the people. In practice, this would mean televising the debate for viewing in the press area of the Council of Ministers of the 12, according to proposals from EC ambassadors. These will be discussed - behind closed doors - at a 'conclave' of EC foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels on Tuesday ahead of the Edinburgh summit. EC leaders believe the popular backlash against 'Europe' and the Maastricht treaty is in large part due to too much secrecy and centralisation in decision-making. The latest draft of the 'transparency' plan from the current UK presidency of the EC claims most member states would back public access to: Six-monthly debates by foreign and finance ministers on 'relevant Presidency or Commission work programmes'; 'Regular open debates on major issues of public interest' in agriculture and environment policy; A breakdown of how member states voted when a formal vote is taken. This would include a justification of the vote, where requested, but not publication of the minutes of the meeting. Andrew Hill adds: The EC yesterday named the seven people who will carry out an inquiry into the alleged failings of Brussels' communications and information policy. Sir Bernard Ingham - Downing Street spokesman when Lady Thatcher was UK premier - was on the original shortlist for the group but the Commission said yesterday that he was not asked to take part in the audit. The working group will be chaired by Mr Willy de Clercq, a former commissioner and Belgian member of the European Parliament. The other members are Mr Ronald Beatson, director general of the European Association of Advertising Agencies; Mr Julian Bravo, chairman of the Madrid office of J Walter Thompson, the advertising agency; Ms Colette Flesch, head of the Commission's information department; Mr Sergio Guccione, head of the Parliament's information service; Mr Jacques Pilhan, deputy managing director of the Paris-based agency Havas; and Mr Mark Wossner, head of Bertelsmann, the German media group.</p>

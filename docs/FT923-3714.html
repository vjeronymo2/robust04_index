			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hino Motors predicts 57% fall in earnings HINO Motors, Japan's leading truck maker, yesterday forecast a 57 per cent fall to Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in pre-tax profit for the first half to the end of September, blaming a weak domestic market and a stronger than expected yen for the sharp decline. The downturn in capital spending in Japan has hurt the truck industry, which reported a 2.4 per cent fall in unit sales for the first quarter of the fiscal year, which began in April. Hino expects sales of Y299.5bn for the first half, down 5 per cent, though the decline would have been greater but for commissioned production of cars by Toyota Motor, which owns 11 per cent of the truck maker. The company had reckoned on an exchange rate of Y130 to the dollar for the year, but the yen has been trading at around Y123, reducing profits from exports to Asian markets, where demand remains strong. Japan's truck makers are hoping the increase in infrastructure spending promised in the recent emergency economic package will stimulate the domestic market, but fear sales will continue to decline for the next few months. The industry reported sharply increased sales during the late 1980s, when construction orders surged and companies were generally expanding capital investment. Unit sales in Japan rose 17.8 per cent in 1988 and 10.3 per cent in 1989, prompting manufacturers to increase capacity. But economic downturn has left most makers with excess capacity and difficult-to-cover depreciation charges, which rose in line with their expansion of facilities. Meanwhile, the volatility of the Tokyo stock market has left them less able to bolster profits by selling long-held stocks.</p>

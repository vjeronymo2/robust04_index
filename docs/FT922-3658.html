			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pension fund and investment trusts lift Tokyo SMALL-lot buying by pension funds and investment trusts pushed up share prices yesterday, but continuing inactivity among institutional investors left volume subdued, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 189.98 at 17,845.04, having fallen in the morning to the day's low of 17,550.28 on arbitrage unwinding. It reached a high of 17,861.50 in the afternoon on small-lot bargain hunting and dealer buying of theme stocks. Volume was unchanged at 170m shares. Advances led declines by 646 to 258 with 174 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 9.20 to 1,346.99 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 0.84 to 1,063.24. Investors waited for this week's June futures and options expiration, although most traders reckon that their concerns over arbitrage unwinding have subsided, due to the decline in cash stock positions held against the June futures. However, some caution remains because rule changes concerning option exercise and settlements will be implemented from the June contract. 'Since option exercise has been limited to once a month on expiration day instead of once a week, share prices will be affected by Friday's exercise related trading,' said Mr Masa Sato, derivatives trader at Dai-ichi Securities. Large buying positions of 'put' options - or the right to sell - at the 18,500 level could depress the index, he added. Dealers used theme stocks to boost volume. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, rose Y67 to Y992, capturing 12 per cent of market volume. Other bio-technology related issues were also firm, with Morinaga Milk Industry rising Y29 to Y866 and Okamoto Industries advancing Y30 to Y1,340. Fuji Photo Film gained attention on reports that it had developed an anti-cancer substance with Harvard University. However, initial interest waned, and Fuji closed unchanged at Y2,830. High-technology issues were higher on bargain hunting. Hitachi rose Y4 to Y799 and Toshiba added Y4 to Y635. However, Nikon, the precision products group, fell Y19 to Y605, extending its losses for the fifth consecutive day. Investors were discouraged by the company's forecast of a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 245.29 to 20,497.55 in volume of 10m shares. The index was supported by small-lot, dealer buying of environmental and bio-technology related shares. Roundup THE SEARCH for 'hot' markets in the region came to a halt yesterday, most of them falling, and Hong Kong playing a painful arbitrage game in the banking sector. Jakarta was closed for the Indonesian general election. BANGKOK threatened its May 19 low of 667.84 for 1992, the SET index dropping 18.79 or 2.7 per cent to 684.47 in turnover of Bt4.7bn. Selling was inspired by nervousness about today's third and final reading of a constitutional amendment, and demonstrations planned by pro-military and opposition groups. Two property groups, Krisda Mahanakorn and Bangkok Land, fell by Bt12 and Bt7, to Bt186 and Bt126 respectively, coming second and third on the most-active list. HONG KONG was pulled down by the continued fall in HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong Bank, in the wake of its successful bid for Midland Bank of the UK. HSBC fell HK2 to HK44.75 for a two-day drop of HKDollars 3.50, and banks in general posted the biggest losses as the Hang Seng index fell 38.56 to 5,940.19 following Monday's 57-point decline. Turnover rose from HKDollars 3.83bn to HKDollars 4.07bn. In an international context, brokers said that traders had reversed the arbitrage process followed when the Hong Kong market was going up, and were now selling HSBC to buy Midland. SEOUL hit its lowest point since President Roh Tae-woo came to power in February 1988, although intervention by the market stabilisation fund left the composite index just 1.89 down at 561.76 after an intraday low of 551.38. Most professionals, however, said that private and institutional investors were demoralised. TAIWAN's weighted index dropped 38.39 to 4,526.65 on fears that the central bank would tighten money market liquidity to fight inflation. MANILA dipped slightly on profit-taking, the composite index closing 12.03 lower at 1,568.25, but having seen a break about the 1,600 barrier in the morning, dealers thought that there was still upside in the market. BOMBAY closed up but off the day's highs on profit-taking and the BSE index gained 53.57 to 3,154.23 for a rise of 2 per cent since Monday.</p>

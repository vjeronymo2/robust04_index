			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Korea Approves Sanctions Resolution Against DPRK"] </F>   [Text] Seoul, June 16 (XINHUA) -- President Kim Yong-sam  has approved the United States-drafted resolution to be  submitted to the United Nations on sanctions against the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said here today.    The government reviewed the draft resolution it received  early on Wednesday [15 June] at a unification and national  security policy coordination meeting, and agreed that it was  ready to take part in UN consultations, han said at a press  conference.    The draft gives the DPRK a 30-day grace period to comply  unconditionally with the nuclear safeguards agreement and  implement the inter-Korean accord on denuclearization.    It contains six points, including a mandatory ban on weapons  imports and exports, partial diplomatic sanctions, a ban on all  flights except regular passenger services, and an embargo on any  technical cooperation related to nuclear technology.    These are the first phase of sanctions, Han said, with the  second phase to include preventing the remittance of funds to  the DPRK from abroad and freezing all the DPRK's assets abroad.    The second phase would be implemented immediately in the  event of any negative action by pyongyang, such as withdrawing  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), he explained.    The U.S. drew up the draft resolution after consultations  with South Korea and Japan when the DPRK banned inspectors from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing  samples of nuclear fuel to determine whether some had been  diverted secretly to make atomic weapons.    Pyongyang has warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it  to accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war.  At the same time it has insisted that its nuclear program is  strictly peaceful.    On Monday, the DPRK announced that it would withdraw  immediately from the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog,  and accept no more inspections of its nuclear program. It said  this was in retaliation for the agency's own sanctions  resolution against Pyongyang providing for an immediate halt to  IAEA technical assistance to the DPRK totaling 250,000 U.S.  dollars a year.    "The draft resolution, if adopted as it is, will be very  effective in exerting pressure on the DPRK," said the South  Korean foreign minister.    Han predicted that it would take two or three weeks for the  draft to pass discussion by the United Nations Security Council  and to be finally adopted.    "As we have said before, the purpose of the resolution is  not  to impose the sanctions themselves, but to clear up the  suspicion about the DPRK's past nuclear activities and secure  nuclear transparency," he explained.    Before, or even after, the resolution is adopted, the door  will remain open for dialogue "if the DPRK fulfills its  obligations under the nuclear safeguards accord and cooperates  with the IAEA," Han said.</p>

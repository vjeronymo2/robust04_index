			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Brazil sells petrochemical group Brazil has completed the sale of a controlling stake in Petroquimica, the first of several petrochemical companies due to be privatised this year. The auction, which had already been delayed five times and cancelled once mainly for technical reasons, was declared a success after meeting the government's requirement that at least 75 per cent of the shares on offer be subscribed. At this week's auction on the Rio de Janeiro exchange bids were received for 80 per cent of the shares on offer, raising gross proceeds of over Dollars 330m for the government. PQU was 68 per cent owned by a subsidiary of Petrobras, the government-controlled oil monopoly. Following the auction, Petrobras' stake has fallen to about 20 per cent, while employees hold 10 per cent. The company's main shareholders are now Unipar, a chemicals company controlled by Odebrecht, the chemicals and construction group, and PQU's main customers such as Shell, petrol distributor Ipiranga and Union Carbide.</p>

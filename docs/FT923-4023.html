			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Letter: Small share no longer seems to be beautiful Sir, My company is one in which Warburg suddenly ceased to be a marketmaker last week. My immediate reaction is that this decision and other similar ones recently taken by other marketmakers must mark the beginning of the end not only of marketmaking in smaller companies such as our own, but also of such listings. It seems to me that there will be little virtue in being a listed company. Why should we be treated like second-class citizens, relegated to The Stock Exchange's Bulletin Board? Presumably we shall still have to comply with the same stringent listing requirements and pay the same fees as hitherto. It will offer little encouragement to budding entrepreneurs to come to the market, yet the government and the stock exchange would have us believe that small businesses are the life-blood of the nation. In our own particular case, while the trade in our shares is not large, we have many small local shareholders who to date have been able to deal readily in our stock. Executors have been able to market their shares when the need has arisen. Members of our company's successful Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme have had no problem in being able to deal in options when these were granted. The ability to transact business via the Bulletin Board, where bargains have to be matched, is bound to be much more difficult. The attraction of holding shares in smaller companies will decline, as, presumably, will their value. In the corporate world it seems sadly that small is no longer beautiful.

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / NHS pension scheme to be a Next Steps agency THE National Health Service pension scheme is to become an agency under the government's Next Steps initiative in which Civil Service functions are hived off into arm's-length executive bodies. An announcement launching the NHS Pensions Agency will be made tomorrow. The new agency will take over responsibility for handling a pension scheme with nearly 1.3m members. More than Pounds 3bn passes through the scheme each year in benefit payments and contributions, and its liabilities are around Pounds 20bn. Mr Alec Cowan, formerly an official at the Department of Education, will be chief executive. As well as being Europe's largest occupational pension scheme, the NHS plan is also regarded in the pensions industry as particularly complex. It covers all grades of staff in the service, in which it is not unusual for personnel to move in and out of NHS employment several times during their working lives. The scheme is also unusual in providing pensions for many self-employed contractors such as general practitioners and dentists. Agency status will not change the scheme's benefits or funding, and pensions policy issues will remain with the NHS management executive at the Department of Health. 'But a range of benefits should flow from agency status,' said Mr Cowan. 'My priorities will include making better use of computer systems and improving links with NHS employers to ensure that the pension scheme has the best possible information flow. 'This is a classic area for a Next Steps agency. The business is well defined and we know our customers. It is clear, without criticising anybody, that improvements in administration can be made, and agency status will help give the pension scheme a stronger and more visible focus.'</p>

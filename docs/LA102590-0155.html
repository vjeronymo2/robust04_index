			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA MAN, 4 OTHER EX-HOSTAGES ARRIVE IN U.S.;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST: ONE, IDENTIFIED AS A MARINE SERGEANT, PRAISES PRESIDENT BUSH FOR  HIS TOUGH TALK.  </P> <P> Five former Persian Gulf hostages, including a Santa Ana construction worker,  came home Wednesday night, with one praising his tough-talking President and  all worrying about the fate of captives they left behind Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> They were among 14 Americans -- mostly ailing or elderly -- brought out of  Baghdad on Wednesday through the efforts of an American-Iraqi group.  </P> <P> "I'm very elated to be at home," said Lloyd Graham, one of five American men  who arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport at 8:10 p.m. aboard a  Royal Jordanian flight.  </P> <P> "The celebration won't start until all our friends and colleagues can come  home, too," the 48-year-old Houston man told an airport news conference.  </P> <P> Graham, who suffers from arteriosclerosis and has undergone two quadruple  bypass surgeries, appeared in good health, as did the others.  </P> <P> Also on the flight was Jack Frazier, 53, of Santa Ana, who said he had been in  Iraq doing construction work when the country invaded neighboring Kuwait.  </P> <P> Frazier told reporters that leaving the other hostages behind "was the hardest  thing I've ever done in my life."  </P> <P> "I'm glad to be home. Morale is great," said a man who wouldn't give his name.  He was identified by others at the news conference as Mark Ward of Middletown,  N.J., a Marine sergeant attached to the U.S. Embassy in Iraq.  </P> <P> "George, keep up the good work," he said, apparently having heard of the  President's statements about the crisis. "It's great to be back."  </P> <P> After the invasion, the men stayed in private homes in the Baghdad area through  U.S. Embassy arrangements. They said the Iraqis knew where they were.  </P> <P> Frazier, Graham, Ward, Larry Murray and John Thompson were allowed to leave  because either they or their relatives have medical problems, they said.  </P> <P> Murray's wife, Sandy, who lives in the Houston area, said she "talked to him  briefly and he seems to be doing very well. He's ready to come home."  </P> <P> The trip was engineered by seven members of the American-Iraqi Foundation, a  Washington, D.C.-based group of U.S. citizens of Iraqi descent, who met with  Saddam Hussein for 2 1/2 hours Sunday.  </P></p>

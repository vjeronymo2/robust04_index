			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ascom loses Swiss status under foreign ownership rules ASCOM, the Swiss telecommunications equipment group, has become one of the first leading Swiss companies to lose its Swiss status under the country's law limiting property purchases by foreigners. The problem is likely to become more widespread because many Swiss companies are actively courting foreign investors and removing restrictions on share ownership. The so-called Lex Friedrich requires that companies be able to prove that more than half of their capital is held by Swiss nationals. Otherwise, they must submit each attempted property purchase to review. Ascom confronted this challenge several months ago when it tried to buy a few square metres of land for a telecoms installation. The government demanded proof that more than half of Ascom's capital was in Swiss ownership, but the company was unable to provide it. In fact, the directors suspect that a majority is held by foreigners. 'We have evidence of considerable foreign investment in our company,' Mr Heinz Frey, chairman, said yesterday. About 80 per cent of Ascom's issued capital is in bearer form, so it is impossible to know where it is owned. However, even if a majority of the capital is held abroad, the voting control is clearly in the hands of Swiss nationals. Ascom reported a 12 per cent gain in sales in the first four months of 1992 to SFr1.01bn. Oerlikon-Buhrle, the long troubled Swiss armaments and engineering group, made a small net profit in the first quarter, its first in more than six years. Sales were up 8.7 per cent to SFr788m (Dollars 518.4m) and the operating profit was SFr100m better than in the comparative period.</p>

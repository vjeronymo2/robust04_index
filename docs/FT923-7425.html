			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Greece ELECTRONIC trading on the Athens Stock Exchange got off to a disappointing start yesterday, with the index losing 1.61 to 779.36, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. Greece's five biggest banks were the first issues to be traded on the screens installed on the trading floor. Prices of all but one bank declined slightly, and trading volume also fell. Insurance, commercial and industrial shares, still traded by open outcry, all went down but by a smaller margin than the banks. Brokers said the new system's failure to stimulate activity reflected anxiety about a new Gulf crisis, as well as concern that the government is planning further austerity measures. This month, the market has fallen to its lowest level since 1990, as daily volume has dropped below Dr1bn (Dollars 5.4m). Mr Nikitas Niarchos, the bourse president, said screen-based trading will be expanded until 'all the most active stocks are included, probably by the end of the year'. It will be some time before the system's capacity to handle 40,000 orders an hour is tested. The system was developed by Femcon Associates, of the US, at a cost of almost Dollars 4m, with part of the funding provided by the European Community.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Observer: Wiser man What a relief to find even Goldman Sachs' Gavyn Davies, one of the Treasury's wise men, makes the occasional boo boo. His column in yesterday's Independent newspaper carried the immortal words 'Short of Eddie George making an announcement by loudhailer from the middle of Threadneedle Street, no more conspicuous statement of unchanged policy could have been made.' So what went wrong? Davies puts it down to equipment failure. He likens the Bank of England's signalling to the money markets to the way that the Sea Lords used to send messages to the fleet by a system of pulleys and wires and semaphore flags. Davies's verdict is that 'a seagull sat on the line'.</p>

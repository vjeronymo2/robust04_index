			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STUDIO LIFTS SISKEL-EBERT BAN  </P> <P> Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and their famous thumbs again are  welcome at previews of 20th Century Fox films.  </P> <P> The studio Monday dropped its indefinite ban that had prohibited the pair from  attending the screenings.  </P> <P> The ban was imposed three weeks ago after the critics gave "thumbs down" to the  film "Nuns on the Run." Siskel, a movie critic for the Chicago Tribune, and  Ebert, a movie critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, said on the "Live -- Regis  &amp; Kathie Lee" television show they hadn't found a single laugh in the  movie. The two also have their own television movie review program.  </P> <P> Another Fox movie, "Vital Signs," was shown Monday in Chicago to a preview  audience, the first Fox screening since "Nuns." Ebert was out of town on  another assignment, but Siskel called Fox's Chicago office to ask if he could  attend. A company spokesman said the ban was lifted, and Siskel attended the  preview.  </P></p>

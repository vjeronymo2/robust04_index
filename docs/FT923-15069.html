			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith intends to update Labour's values MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, plans to present a paper at Labour's annual conference in Blackpool this autumn spelling out an updated reinterpretation of the party's core aims and values. The paper, now under discussion in the Smith camp, will draw strongly on the strands of Labour thinking that deal with the liberation of the individual in society and play down the role of the state as manager and social engineer. While the contender for Labour party leadership has taken pains not to appear to be pre-empting his certain victory at the electoral conference on July 18, planning is already well under way for his first 18 months. The 10,000-word discussion document, which will be drawn up in consultation with close colleagues, is likely to be put to the national executive committee for approval as a catalyst to spark a year-long public debate on the party's future. Mr Smith has already let it be known he is anxious to avoid any headlong rush back to policy planning before an intellectual framework for the future has been developed. He is determined to use a year of debate to highlight the party's history of progressive thinking and achievements in an effort to build confidence and counter the doomsayers disparaging Labour as wedded to a discredited philosophy. Senior figures close to Mr Smith stressed yesterday that its aim was to broaden Labour's objectives. It is intended to expand debate well beyond the parameters outlined in a similar 'aims and values' document written by Mr Roy Hattersley in 1987. The Smith paper is expected to seek a balance between the state's role as a propagator and promoter of the interests of society at large and its duty to act as a watchdog of individual liberties. It draws in part on a discussion of the role of community. The paper is also expected to stress the seams of Labour philosophy that deal with the liberation of the individual rather than the role of the state.</p>

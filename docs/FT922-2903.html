			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Airbus fears conflicts of interest: Partners seeking joint ventures THE Airbus partners risk creating conflicts of interest by negotiating with Japanese and US aerospace companies a number of ventures which could undermine the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, according to Airbus and other European aerospace industry officials at the Berlin air show. This follows a series of separate ventures currently being negotiated by the partners with other international aerospace companies. Deutsche Aerospace, a 37.9 per cent partner in Airbus, is expected to announce at the Berlin air show today an agreement to exchange engineers with Boeing, the consortium's main US competitor. The German company is also in advanced negotiations to acquire a controlling stake in Fokker, the Dutch regional aircraft maker. It proposes to create a new European regional aircraft partnership with Fokker, Aerospatiale, the French Airbus partner, and Alenia, the Italian aerospace company. This proposed venture plans to develop a range of jets which could compete on some markets with Airbus' own planned A319, a 125-seat derivative of its 150-seat A320 jet. British Aerospace, which holds 20 per cent of Airbus, is also negotiating with the big three Japanese manufacturers (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy Industries) a possible Japanese partnership in BAe's loss-making regional aircraft operations. Airbus is worried BAe's talks with Japan could have an impact on the consortium's own efforts to establish a partnership with the three Japanese companies in the research and development of a new 600-800-seat jumbo aircraft. It fears the Japanese could eventually use any co-operation in regional aircraft with a European partner as an excuse to opt out of serious discussion on collaboration with Airbus on a new jumbo, leaving the field to Boeing, which is co-operating with the Japanese on its new 777 wide-body airliner, and studying the development of a 600-800-seat jumbo. McDonnell Douglas, the other main commercial airliner maker, is trying to negotiate a partnership with Taiwan to launch a new jumbo, the MD12. Although the Deutsche Aerospace agreement with Boeing is limited at this stage to the exchange of engineers between the two companies, the German group appears interested in exploring possible collaboration with the US manufacturer in both the supersonic and the 600-800-seat, sub-sonic jumbo airliner field. While this could lead to a clash with Airbus' own jumbo project, it could also open the way for broader co-operation among Europeans, Americans and Japanese in the very large airliner sector. Such co-operation has already been agreed in principle in the studies for the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft. However, most industry observers regard it highly unlikely, at this state at least, that Airbus and Boeing will work together. The two groups did try to co-operate in 1976 on the BB10 project to build a new wide-body airliner, with Airbus providing the wide fuselage and Boeing the wings. The project collapsed and Airbus went ahead on its own to develop what became the A310 wide-body airliner. Airbus also tried on three occasions, unsuccessfully, to co-operate with McDonnell Douglas.</p>

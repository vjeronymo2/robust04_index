			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces, yesterday afternoon presided over a meeting of  the Higher Defense Council. Several brother ministers and  officials attended.    After reviewing the decisions it made during its previous  session, as well as the extent of their implementation, the  Council discussed the topics listed on its agenda. The  conferees also debated the discussions held between brother  Presidential Council Chairman Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general who was sent  to Yemen on a fact-finding mission. The brother president  briefed the conferees on the talks he had held with the speaker  of the House of Representatives, staff members of the House  Speakership Office, members of parliamentary blocs, the acting  prime minister, cabinet ministers, the leaders of various  political parties and organizations, the leaders of popular  organizations, as well as social, intellectual, and political  figures in the homeland.    The conferees laid special emphasis on the efforts under way  to implement UN Security Council Resolution 924, which concerns  the situation in our country, in light of the government's  appreciation of the aforementioned resolution and its declared  commitment to handle it in a positive spirit, and to implement  it in an integrated manner -- commitment that reflected the  eagerness of the Republic of Yemen to achieve security and  stability throughout its territory --, heedful that the UN  Charter guarantees all members of the world body inalienable  legitimate rights.    The conferees also debated the recent gesture made by the  political leadership to reactivate the work of the Joint  Military Committee so it may establish a cease-fire.    The Council discussed several important reports pertaining  to  developments in our country in the military, political,  economic, and social fields. It also debated the executive  programs endorsed to address the impact of the rebellion and  violation of constitutional legitimacy, which have caused untold  hardships in the country. For the country is currently  experiencing a military mutiny and a bloody national sedition  that have been courageously, heroically, and firmly confronted  by our people and their valiant Armed Forces.    The Council has made several decisions and issued various  directives to promote the victories achieved to safeguard unity  and constitutional legitimacy, and nurture the solidarity and  cohesion existing between the people and official agencies,  which must be manifested through supporting the Armed Forces and  security troops in their efforts to carry out their sacred  national duties. These decisions and directives also addressed  the connection between political action and the national  objectives of our Yemeni people, the objectives of shielding the  unity of their homeland, protecting democracy, and safeguarding  all the national and constitutional gains made by the Republic  of Yemen.</p>

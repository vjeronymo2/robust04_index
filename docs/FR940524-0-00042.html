			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Air Transport Association's Petition for Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On November 17, 1993, the ATA submitted a petition for rulemaking to amend &sect;121.343, requesting that the regulation be amended to require DFDR installation only on airplanes that will remain in the fleet beyond December 31, 1999, with installation on those aircraft accomplished in phases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As justification for this proposed change, the ATA stated that, if 10 of its operators were to comply with the retrofit requirements of &sect;121.343(c) by May 26, 1994, the cost would exceed $29 million. No details were given on how these costs were estimated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 23, 1994, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (Notice No. 94&hyph;4, 59 FR 8570) that detailed the ATA's request but proposed an amendment to &sect;121.343 that would extend for 1 year the compliance time for DFDR installation on Stage 2 airplanes that are subject to the Stage 3 transition requirements of part 91. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Four comments, including one from the ATA, were received in response to the NPRM. One comment was submitted in response to the publication of the ATA petition, before the proposed rule was published. That comment supported the ATA request, but did not address the rule change that was proposed. Only one operator affected by the rule submitted comments on the petition or the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) states that the FAA should not grant the ATA's request to adopt a phased DFDR compliance schedule. The ALPA disagrees with the FAA's finding that the chance of an accident happening on one of the Stage 2 airplanes covered by the rule change is remote. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA did not propose to adopt the ATA's requested phased compliance schedule for DFDR installation; the FAA proposed only to allow a 1-year extension for certain airplanes in the fleet. ALPA did not submit any information to refute the FAA finding that the chance of an accident occurring on a subject airplane during the 1-year extension is remote. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) believes that 7 years is sufficient time for the operators to have complied with the DFDR retrofit requirements and is disappointed that the May 26, 1994, compliance date is being delayed. ``However, because it would be impossible for the industry to complete the retrofit requirements by May 26, 1994, the NTSB agrees that a maximum 1-year extension for Stage 2 aircraft is the only recourse available to the FAA without requiring large-scale grounding of transport category airplanes.'' The NTSB also states that operators should be required to submit a list of airplanes affected by this rule change to FAA headquarters, noting that the ``industry has failed to comply with a previous FAA requirement for operators to provide an Aircraft Retirement Schedule'' as mandated in the ATA exemption discussed previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The repair and readjustment of farm  machines has been completed and the reservoirs are filled with  water. Substantial preparations for sowing have been made, and  carrying composts to paddy and non-paddy fields and carpeting  fields with humus soil have entered the finishing stage.    Unjong-ri is 30 kilometres away from the seat of Pongsan  County, North Hwanghae Province, in the central west of Korea.  The village surrounded with high and low mountains looks like a  picture. It has turned into a modern socialist village good to  live and work in under the deep care of the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il.    He visited it (then Tanghyon-ri, Sohung County) in winter 30  odd years ago and told by farmers there that they had eked out a  hand-to-mouth existence with mountain-side tilling and  charcoal-making before the liberation of the country, he  unfolded a bright prospect for rural construction. He said the  farmers in the mountain areas must turn the mountains to  advantage, if they were to be well off and that they must  create orchards on sunny hillside, raise silkworms, and actively  tap mountain resources to improve their living standard. Saying  they should rezone small plots into paddy fields and build many  modern houses, he indicated a concrete orientation and ways.    This place has changed beyond recognition since then.  Two-and three-storied modern houses for hundreds of families, a  nursery, a kindergarten, schools, a hospital and public welfare  facilities are standing in rows along the scenic Tanghyon River.  Thirty five hectares of paddy fields fit for tillage by  machines have taken shape in the place where not a plot of paddy  field could be seen before liberation. And nearly 200 hectares  of orchards and more than 700 hectares of forests of economic  value have been created. Tractors, rice-transplanting machines,  rice plucking machines and other farm machines have relieved the  agricultural working people from toil.    Agricultural production has grown every year, the output of  grain jumping 3.6 times, meat 4.6 times, fruits 7.6 times and  vegetables 21 times as against 30 years ago.    Tanghyon-ri was renamed Unjong (benevolence)-ri in October  1981 to hand down through generations the deep loving care shown  by the dear leader for the farmers there.    Such change as in Unjong-ri can be seen everywhere in Korea.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SHOOTING OF A SHOOT-FROM-THE-HIP MOVIE  </P> <P> The trail from story conception to the big screen is usually a long and arduous  one. It took "Batman" nine years to get there. In the case of "The Unsinkable  Shecky Moskowitz," it took three months.  </P> <P> "Shecky Moskowitz," the story of a cruise-ship waiter who dreams of taking over  the job of the ship's comic, is a comedy that was filmed almost entirely on  board a small, weathered cruise ship that sailed in May from New Orleans to  Cancun, Mexico, with a cargo of 50 beauty queens. The $800,000 film took three  days to write, a day to cast, two days to prepare and a week of on-board  shooting plus two days of pick-up shots.  </P> <P> The main character in "Shecky Moskowitz" is a waiter (MTV's Adam Sandler) who  receives comic instruction from the Guru of Comedy, portrayed in a brief  uncredited cameo by Milton Berle. The film's cast includes Burt Young ("Rocky")  as Gen. Noriega, who is intent on assassinating one of the beauties for saying  that he smells like a pizza ("What kind of a pizza?" one of his aides asks).  His mistress is portrayed by movie veteran Terry Moore.  </P> <P> "The film has a bizarre thesis," said Young, whose scenes were shot in Los  Angeles after the cruise. "When they told me how it came about, I had to help  them. I like young film makers who make things happen. They had no money. When  I showed up to shoot my scenes at Paramount, we didn't even get into the  studio. They could only afford to rent the tip of a building outside the studio  gates."  </P> <P> Theater audiences who want to grab the film by first-time writer-director  Valerie Breiman will have to get up early in the morning. The Nuart Theater in  West Los Angeles has agreed to make room for the film, in between its heavy  schedule of Oscar-qualifying screenings, today and Sunday at 10:30 a.m.  </P> <P> The unusual film project got started when independent producer Randolf Turrow  was asked to judge a teen beauty pageant in Palm Springs. As a publicity stunt,  the pageant promoters were renting a cruise ship and packing it with current  and former beauty contest winners from across the United States.  </P> <P> "They said they didn't have enough guys going on the boat," Turrow said. "So I  decided to call some of my friends and put together a crew to film this ocean  quest. The deal was a free cruise, all expenses paid, in the Caribbean."  </P> <P> Before setting sail, Turrow telephoned a friend in Texas, Mark Schultz, who  agreed to put up the film's production and distribution budget, hoping to cash  in on his investment in theaters and video rights.  </P> <P> Six days before cast-off, all Turrow needed was a script. He turned to Breiman,  an actress and aspiring screenwriter who is one of the female leads in his last  film, "A Tale of Two Sisters."  </P> <P> "The insanity of the whole thing was trying to shoot the whole film in six  days," said co-producer Adam Rifkin, who plays a sleazy rock star. "The key was  to kick in the adrenaline and don't even think that it can't be done."  </P></p>

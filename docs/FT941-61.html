			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Princedale A strong contribution from its newly-formed industrial division helped Princedale Group report pre-tax profits of Pounds 740,000 for the 15 months to end-December, against Pounds 254,000 for the preceding 12 months. Until midway through 1993, Princedale - which has a USM quote - was a specialised marketing services consultancy. However, in June it formed the new division with the acquisition from Hillsdown Holdings of two plastics manufacturers and a commercial vehicle contract hire business. Group turnover for the 15 months totalled Pounds 26m, against Pounds 12.8m previously. Of this, acquisitions were responsible for some Pounds 13.5m. At the operating level the new division boosted profits by Pounds 603,000 to Pounds 855,000, compared with Pounds 457,000 last time. Mr Stephen Bennett, chairman, said that after a difficult start the marketing services side had shown improvement in the latter part of the year. Earnings per share emerged at 1.9p (1p) and the company is returning to the dividend list with a proposed final of 0.25p. The last dividend was paid in 1988. The shares closed down 1p at 26p.</p>

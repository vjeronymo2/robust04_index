			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Flexible VAT Sir, Recent reporting on the number of company liquidations this year seems to ignore the fact that it is government departments which seem to be causing the mayhem. In a recent issue of Stubbs Gazette dated Friday July 23, under the section 'Petitions presented', one page alone contained 131 reports - there were 84 from HM Commissioners of Customs &amp; Excise and four from the Inland Revenue. The majority on other pages were just the same, but I lost count. Would not some flexibility on the payment of VAT by small firms dramatically reduce the number of liquidations?

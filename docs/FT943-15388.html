			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cariplo suspends L1,650bn share issue Cariplo of Italy, which claims to be the world's largest savings bank, last night suspended an issue of new shares, which could have raised up to L1,650bn (Dollars 1.02bn), because of poor market conditions. The decision comes three weeks after Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, delayed its L1,500bn rights issue for the same reason. The offer price was due to be announced today and the sale would have begun on Monday. The issue would have taken Cariplo on to the stock market for the first time since its foundation in 1823. In the last month, the Milan equity market has been hit by doubts about the new government's handling of the economy, and by the sheer weight of new shares - worth more than L10,000bn - being offered to investors during July. Yesterday the Comit index of Milan equities slipped 0.64 per cent, with banking and insurance stocks among the weaker sectors. Cariplo undoubtedly took into account the lacklustre opening performance of shares in Ina, the former state-owned insurer, partly privatised at the end of June in a L5,000bn sell-off. Ina shares began trading on Wednesday at a slight premium to the L2,400 offer price, but since then have rarely risen above that level. Cariplo said last night it would not have been 'in our interest, nor in the interests of investors' to have pushed ahead with the issue, but stressed that the bank did not have an urgent need for new funds. No new date has been set for the issue, which should be followed before the end of the year by the sale of a second, slightly smaller stake in the company in the form of bonds and warrants. The intention was to float up to 22 per cent of the bank, which is wholly owned by a charitable foundation. A third of the first tranche of shares was aimed at institutional investors outside Italy.</p>

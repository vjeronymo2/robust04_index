			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [IAEA "Press Release -- for use of information media, not an </F> official record": "International Experts Review the Safety  Situation at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station"]    [Text] Experts from a dozen countries reviewed with  Ukrainian representatives the current safety situation at the  Chernobyl Nuclear Power station at the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) Headquarters in Vienna 21-22 April 1994.    A recent IAEA expert mission in March 1994 found serious  safety deficiencies at the Chernobyl station and on that basis  its Director General informed the President of Ukraine that  international levels of safety were not being met. It was  subsequently agreed that a meeting of interested parties be  convened in April to consider what actions could be taken to  alleviate the situation.    The Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, in opening the meeting  reminded the participants that national governments carry the  responsibility for safety in nuclear installations in their  territory. Yet there is legitimate international concern about  maintaining safety of nuclear installations any where.  Technical safety issues and actions would need to be considered  in the context of other factors that influence the current  situation such as the overall energy and economic circumstances  in the Ukraine.    The Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister, Mr Valeriy Shmarov, and  the Chairman of the State Committee on the Utilization of  Nuclear Power, Mr. Umanetz, discussed the energy and economic  situations and the current safety situation at Chernobyl. The  meeting also heard views of the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development (EBRD) on the energy and economic situations and  was given a summary of the IAEA safety mission results.    Ukrainian officials pointed out that energy use had dropped  lately due to the temporary economic depression, but should rise  substantially as the economy improves; per capita energy  consumption is inordinately high, but reducing it would require  complete overhaul of the infrastructure, lasting decades; the  country is already heavily dependent on external, expensive and  potentially unreliable sources for gas and oil; coal is becoming  harder to extract and, in any event, greater use depends on  introducing, at high cost, modern combustion technology; and  thus, Ukraine must look to nuclear energy as a continuing major  source to meet its energy requirements.    They further stated that the role of nuclear power is  essential in their energy planning. More modern VVER  [water-moderated water-cooled power reactor] reactors will be  required along with on-time completion of five additional VVER  plants now under construction. The output of the Chernobyl  station is currently a least cost alternative for energy supply.  Completion of three VVER 1000MW units in an advanced stage of  construction can be completed by 1996 at a cost of $196 million.  Two additional units can be completed by 1999 bringing the  total cost to $1.2 billion.    They believe that the Chernobyl station could be upgraded to  a level no less safe than other currently operating RBMK  [expansion unknown] reactors. Chernobyl is now behind in  implementing the safety improvements at other RMBKs, but the  pace of implementation could be accelerated, if sufficient  resources were available. To date no international financial  assistance directed at improving the safety situation at  Chernobyl has been provided by the international community.    There was consensus at the meeting that the many factors  involved make the situation at Chernobyl complex and that there  was no simple one-step solution. Some participants suggested  continued technical assessment which could be undertaken in the  frame-work of IAEA activities. A clear majority wished to see  operation at Chernobyl discontinued as soon as conditions allow.    In concluding the IAEA's Assistant Director General for  Nuclear Safety, Morris Rosen, reminded the participants that, in  addition to the recent loss of many highly qualified staff, and  no matter what improvements were made, the situation at  Chernobyl was unique: For several years Chernobyl would be at a  lower level of safety than similar plants; the severe economic  situation would impact on the availability of spare parts and  the procurement of modern equipment. In addition one of the  former units is encased in a currently deteriorating shelter and  the remaining units would be operating in an environment of  elevated radiation levels.</p>

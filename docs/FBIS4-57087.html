			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 12 May (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry  has issued a declaration noting that the establishment of  diplomatic relations between Cuba and South Africa is more than  a formality, it is an action of historic significance that  encompasses dear aspirations of the two nations.    The document states: The electoral victory of the African  National Congress headed by undisputed leader Nelson Mandela was  a victory for the progressive people of the world and paved the  way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba  and South Africa.    After noting that the agreement signed by the foreign  ministers of the two countries was one of the first  international acts carried out by the new government, the  document states that there are many broad possibilities for  cooperation.    The document views as fundamental "the commitment to work  unitedly to turn common dreams of independence, equality, and  social well-being into reality."    The declaration adds: "Generous Cuban blood has enriched the  African soil, and for Cuba it is an honor and also a compelling  duty to take part with its South African brothers in the  beginning of this new page in their history.    The declaration also expresses Cuba's interest in  contributing modestly to the edification of a multiracial and  truly democratic South Africa.    The declaration expresses the wish that "the international  community be consistent in its support for the process that put  an end to apartheid, and grant the new government the  cooperation necessary to secure its goals of peace, harmony, and  progress."</p>

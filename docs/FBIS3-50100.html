			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Petr Placak: "The Security of the Czech </F> State"]    [Text] It was only a question of when the artificial and  unnatural division of Europe after World War II -- a division  forcefully maintained by the Soviet empire in Europe's eastern  half -- would collapse. This collapse was necessary for the  normalization of the situation in our part of Europe and the  search for ways to stabilize it. Our centuries-long experience  with the existence of the Czech state should help us in our  efforts.  <H5>  Western Powers -- Illusion Number One </H5>   Since the disintegration of the Habsburg-ruled system of  states and the upsetting of the power balance in Central Europe,  we have been looking to ensure our security outside the Central  European space. It is a pure anachronism when people say that  the only possible way is to return to the pre-war First  Republic's foreign policy concept and get closer to the Western  powers -- France, above all. This security system of the First  Republic not only failed -- as any child knows -- but also  contributed to Germany's being pushed out of Europe. The  tragical development after World War I has shown us quite  convincingly. Today's Germany is a state with great culture and  enormous economic potential; it is a country (unlike us!) with  50 years of uninterrupted democratic tradition that was able to  successfully cope with its Nazi past. Since time immemorial,  Germany has been our most natural economic, cultural, and  political competitor (in the positive sense of the word). In  view of our efforts to integrate ourselves into West European  security structures -- of which Germany is an inseparable member  -- any effort to circumvent this reality by jumping over Germany  far to the West is not only a naive but absurd idea, reminiscent  of the time before World War II.  <H5>  NATO -- Illusion Number Two </H5>   It was unrealistic in the time of the First Republic to rely  on Western powers in the matter of Czechoslovakia's security,  and it would be equally dubious to rely on our early joining of  NATO. There are thousands of things that could slow this process  down, if not stop it entirely: economic problems in countries  waiting for membership -- or in the member countries themselves  -- or unpredictable developments in Russia, which is, of course,  the most essential thing. Our efforts to join NATO should,  therefore, be understood as our attempt at keeping what we have  already achieved (in actual fact, this is not likely to change  in the future). In our country, we have succumbed, in good  faith, to the illusion that the Czech Republic has an  exceptional status among other post- communist countries and  that we will be the first to be admitted to NATO. However, when  judging the overall situation in the European security, the  Alliance may put the Czech Republic's membership in NATO in last  place on their task list.  <H5>  Central Europe -- Reality Number One </H5>   Our first efforts in foreign policy should be aimed, in my  opinion, at establishing an as-wide-as-possible cooperation with  our direct neighbors and at our collective building a  politically stable Central Europe as the basis for the security  of the Czech state. Cooperation with the Visegrad Four countries  (plus Austria or Slovenia) does not have to be  institutionalized, but common interests should be chiefly based  on wide economic cooperation between these countries, which is  what the Czech Republic is basically trying to establish within  the framework of the Central European free trade zone, which  should also include some military cooperation (for example,  joint military training with NATO countries within the framework  of the newly accepted Partnership for Peace project). In no  case should we look with disrespect at Meciar's Slovakia -- the  existence of a politically and economically stable country  between us and the former USSR is in the Czech Republic's vital  interest!  <H5>  The Czech State -- Reality Number Two </H5>   Of course, our domestic development and a quick and  conflict-free completion of the economic transformation of the  democratic state are the most important things. The economic  and political stability and power are the basis for every  well-functioning society, but we need more than that. We should  be aware and proud of the fact that we belong to this country  and state, and that we are part of its 1,000-year-long history.</p>

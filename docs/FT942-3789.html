			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: London There will be plenty of information for the gilts market to get its teeth into this week, with the normal mid-month flurry of economic statistics. While the retail prices index and the unemployment numbers represent the 'heavyweight' economic figures, the gilts market may be even more interested in the average earnings number. The relentless rise in the underlying annual rate of growth, to 4 per cent from 3 per cent, has been seen as a precursor of future inflationary pressures. 'The market will want to see at least an unchanged annual average earnings rate,' says Mr Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa Europe. 'The worst-case scenario would be a movement up to 4 1/4 per cent.' The chancellor of the exchequer's Mansion House speech is a chance for Mr Kenneth Clarke to reassure the markets about the government's economic policies. He has previously appeared much more willing to cut interest rates than the governor of the Bank of England. 'What the market will not want to see is an open dispute between the chancellor and Eddie George,' says Mr Joshi. Nevertheless, UK economic fundamentals have not always been the primary factor in determining the direction of gilts in recent weeks.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEASED WITH PLAN FOR GLOCKENSPIEL  </P> <P> I was delighted to read that there will finally be a glockenspiel in the heart  of Beverly Hills. (Times, Jan. 9).  </P> <P> It was my pleasure to see the one in Munich a few years ago and watch its  impact on its surroundings, as well as people. There was an aura of festivity  in its location in St. Mary's Square, City Hall and a lovely cathedral, with  outdoor parking slots and tables and chairs where people lounged or ate and  drank.  </P> <P> And when the glockenspiel was in motion, everyone seemed to communicate with  smiles and gestures and just plain watching. It was like a pause that  refreshed, and I would hope that the one in Beverly Hills will serve a similar  purpose.  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (7): An electronics success story - Profile, Elron MR UZIA GALIL, who in the 30 years since he founded Elron has built it into one of Israel's top high-technology producers, is not much troubled by the cold economic winds blowing in Europe and the US where his companies sell most of their products, writes HUGH CARNEGY. In his view from Haifa, overlooking a Mediterranean Sea still warm in the December sun, the worldwide electronics market is so big that relatively small players like those in Israel can go on making money in a recession if they have the products and skills to compete. In recent years, the Elron companies have garnered fewer headlines than other stars of the Israeli high-tech firmament like Scitex, the computerised imaging systems maker, or ECI Telecom, a manufacturer of advanced circuit multipliers. But the group, with combined sales of Dollars 50m, accounts for about 17 per cent of the country's electronics industry and is a mainstay of the export-driven sector. It includes, in Elbit, Elscint, Fibronics and Optrotech, four of the growing number of Israeli high-tech companies quoted on US stock markets which, Mr Galil points out, have recently spectacularly outperformed the main market indices. Not that all has been plain sailing in the group. Both Fibronics, a pioneer in fibre-optic networking, and Optrotech, which services printed circuit board production, have fallen into the red in the last 18 months. They dragged down net group profits to Dollars 6m in the first half of 1992, from Dollars 13.5m in first half 1991. But Elbit, which makes defence electronics, and Elscint, which makes advanced medical diagnostic equipment, have performed strongly to allow Elron to support the weaker companies to get back on track. Elbit has taken over Elscint to diversify out of the weakening defence sector. But Mr Galil says companies like Elbit can still make money in the defence market by concentrating on enhancing efficiency for clients looking to cut costs. Niche markets are what Israeli electronics companies have traditionally exploited successfully to make the sector account for about 30 per cent of the country's industrial exports, employing more than 30,000 people. Now the flow of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and heavy layoffs in the heavy end of the local military industries have increased the pressure on the electronics industry to expand. Uzia Galil says this requires a dramatic shift in attitude, looking to produce components for mass consumer products. 'The next step is to start from the market, not from the technology we have. We have to assume we have the technology and look for the markets that we could supply.'</p>

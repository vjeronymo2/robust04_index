			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Management: The unkindest cut of all - The head office conundrum Few company announcements, short of a set of glowing profits, attract so much approval from shareholders, employees and the media as declarations of intent to slash the size and cost of corporate headquarters. Yet few actually generate so little real action. Take three large corporations which, over the past decade, have been seen as management models: General Electric of the US, British Petroleum, and ICI. They may be models in other respects, but only one of the trio, GE, ended the 1980s with the really lean head office to which its chairman had supposedly dedicated himself at the start of the decade. The other two left much or all of the job to their successors; at BP, action was taken a year ago, while ICI made another declaration of slimming intent only in February. Back in 1982, when ICI was (as now) hit hard by recession, the incoming chairman, Sir John Harvey-Jones, set out to cut its head office staff from about 1,200 to around 150. But he managed to slim it only as far as 400 or so in London, with several hundred more re-located elsewhere. The central core has since edged up to 500, with another 480 on other sites, in and around London. In the same year, amid a veritable flood of supposedly swingeing head-office cost-cutting from other UK companies, the new chairman of BP, Sir Peter Walters, declared his intention to cut his head office from its 2,000-plus level. By the end of his tenure in 1990, BP's head office was 2,200. It took the new chairman, Robert Horton, to wield the necessary axe last year, and get the core down below 400, though on the widest definition BP's head office still employs almost 1,200 people. Defining who does, and does not, work for a head office of a large company, rather than for a division or 'business' beneath it, is difficult in these days of advanced information technology and widespread job dispersal that General Electric, despite its early successes, has given up talking about it in public. It may seem naive to wonder why most chairmen find it so hard to match brave words with action so close to their own seats of power - and why, in particular, it took ICI's Sir Denys Henderson, chairman after Harvey-Jones since 1987, until February to herald a much-needed further cost-cutting drive. According to a senior executive at ICI, one reason is that its head office, like most others, has always contained very powerful functional barons. Unless the chairman of the day takes a very strong line towards them, streamlining 'just won't happen'. ICI chairmen have declared their intention to kick head office into shape, but only Harvey-Jones came anywhere close to doing so. Then there is the chairman's own style. It was all very well for Sir Peter Walters to declare his intent to chop BP's headquarters sharply, but his natural insistence on central control of most group activities meant that a large head office staff was inevitable. This degree of supervision was probably necessary in the early 1980s in order to steer the transformation of BP's asset portfolio and to 'parent' the group's inexperienced new divisions. But these 'second-guessing' activities became increasingly redundant from the mid-1980s. When Robert Horton virtually halved BP's corporate staff on taking office, he also abolished about 70 of the head office committees which they served - more than three-quarters of the total. He also began to introduce a much more informal, and flexible, way of working. ICI, conversely has just been forced by the under-performance of its divisions to introduce an extra high-level control committee. As BP's 'networking' approach works its way through the corporate system - both at head office itself, and in relations with the group's constituent businesses - its headquarters could shrink further. There could be added pressure in this direction from the businesses, which want the group to be clearer about the degree to which its headquarters contributes to shareholder value. Beyond personal and corporate style, the size of a company's head office is influenced by some tricky structural factors. At BP, the traditionally complex matrix organisation has been simplified drastically by giving divisions (which BP calls 'business streams') primacy over geographic regions. Against the background of the new culture of openness and informality which Horton is trying to establish, the result is that headquarters no longer has to intervene constantly to iron out tensions between powerful divisional and regional barons. At ICI, by contrast, only in the past few months has a decision been taken to relegate all 'geographic territories' to providing services to global businesses, rather than sharing business decisions with them; the consequences for head office staffing will not be decided until later this year. A further factor which influences the size of any large company's head office is the extent to which a national corporate HQ is included within the global headquarters. BP has moved further away from this than has ICI. The fact that BP can now operate with a relatively small head office is also due to the slimness of its portfolio - just three large businesses, and one smallish one - and the fact that the inter-relationships between them are relatively simple. GE, with over three times as many businesses, nevertheless, has even fewer cross-business 'synergies' to manage. ICI, in contrast, is a much more complex animal. The portfolio pruning which it heralded last month may simplify things somewhat, but most types of chemicals businesses are much more interconnected than are, say, BP's exploration and nutrition divisions - and certainly more so than GE's conglomerate-like portfolio of aero engines, household appliances, financial services, TV stations, and so on. To be fair to ICI, a small head office is not necessarily beautiful for every type of company. Much depends on the 'parenting' requirements of businesses in its portfolio. One head office parenting role is right in some circumstances, but not in others. Precisely the same goes for size. Just as most head offices are probably still too large, and add more burden than value to the businesses beneath them, some suffer from the opposite complaint.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Mission Control Centre June 10 TASS -- Russian  cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov  have spent five months on board the "Mir" complex.    They devoted primary attention to geophysical studies this  week, which were carried out with the help of a multizonal  MKF-6MA camera and videospectrometric equipment, installed on  the "Kvant-2" module. Today, the cosmonauts are to make a  regular series of photographs of the earth's surface. They will  also carry out several experiments to determine the spectral  characteristics of major oceanic currents and to further study  the ionosphere and the earth's magnetosphere.    Astrophysical studies were carried out regularly in recent  days with the use of the international "roentgen" orbital  observatory. The telescopes were trained on the centre of our  galaxy, at the roentgen pulsar, the power of whose radiation  grew approximately 10-fold at the beginning of May.    Medical examinations show that the cosmonauts are in good  health. The flight is proceeding normally.</p>

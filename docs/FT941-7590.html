			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / BNF faces further Sellafield challenge British Nuclear Fuels faces a further legal challenge over its Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing complex in Cumbria, which has been dogged by controversy over the site's Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant. Copeland borough councillors decided on Tuesday night to grant outline planning permission to BNF for its proposed Pounds 300m mixed oxide (Mox) fuel manufacturing plant. This would mix plutonium from the adjacent Thorp plant with uranium to produce nuclear reactor fuel for sale to Europe and the Far East. Yesterday Nuclear-Free Local Authorities, representing 160 councils throughout Britain, said it was considering applying for judicial review of the decision. The authorities argue that BNF's environmental statement for the Mox plant, and the way Copeland handled the application, breached European law. They also contend BNF has not demonstrated that the plant's benefits would outweigh its drawbacks. The go-ahead was also condemned by anti-nuclear groups which argue that Mox fuel is commercially unattractive, and that its main function will be to convert the plutonium stockpile from Thorp's operation into a different form. Mr Simon Roberts of Friends of the Earth said: 'It's a logical extension of the misguided logic which led to Thorp. BNF seem keen to create a herd of white elephants at Sellafield.' Last October BNF began operating a Pounds 26m demonstration Mox plant at Sellafield, with an 8-tonne annual fuel output capacity. The main Mox plant, which will create 200 jobs, would have a 120-tonne annual output. Worldwide demand for Mox fuel is below 100 tonnes annually but BNF expects it to exceed 300 tonnes by the year 2000. Its only firm Mox customer is NOK, the Swiss utility, but BNF is talking to potential customers in Germany and Japan. The company says the fuel will be 30 per cent cheaper than conventional uranium fuel: 'We're here to make money ultimately; if it wasn't cost effective we wouldn't be able to do it.' Mr Bob Metcalfe, Copeland's director of development and services, said the council had followed legal advice on its handling of the application. The economics of Mox fuel were not a planning matter, he added. Mr Metcalfe said the council's legal advice suggested any legal challenge could not be sustained. The nuclear-free authorities will discuss the possibility of a legal challenge on Monday.</p>

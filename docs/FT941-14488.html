			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Darjeeling man moves to Food From Britain Food From Britain, the government and industry funded body to promote exports of British comestibles, has a new chief executive, Patrick Davis, 46. He gets his feet under the table, with a three-year contract, from March 7. Davis, right, started his working life in the food business in 1964, joining Cadbury as a management trainee. During his time with the company he served in South Africa during 1969-70 and then moved on to Ireland, with a variety of posts involved in sales, marketing and trading. In the management buy-out of Premier Brands in 1986 he took over the management of the tea division, and was closely involved with the company's acquisition of six different tea companies in the following two-and-a-half years. A previous chairman of the UK Tea Council - 'the champagne of teas is Darjeeling', he says - Davis was managing director of Premier Teas, a major division of Hillsdown Holdings, from 1990-93. FFB was established in 1983 and now has six offices in Europe and one in the US. Its overseas offices were recently privatised and last year provided consultancy support to more than 700 British companies. In September 1993 Derek Garner stood down as FFB chief executive, following a government decision to slim down the organisation. Davis says FFB will concentrate on two key aspects in the immediate future; the export of British food products and the development of speciality products in the UK. 'I'd like to put the 'great' back into great food from Britain,' he says.</p>

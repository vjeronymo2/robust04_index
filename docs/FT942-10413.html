			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Satirist blocks Schneider credit A journalist from a German satirical magazine has cut off fugitive real-estate tycoon Juergen Schneider from one source of cash - by ringing up Schneider's credit card company and cancelling his account. The magazine Titanic said journalist Bernd Fritz had telephoned the Eurocard company and blocked the account by giving Schneider's name and date of birth. Mr Detlev Buchal, Eurocard's managing director, said it was not easy to block an account. Mr Fritz had given Schneider's date of birth, address, bank account and private and office telephone numbers. Mr Fritz said he had just named a bank at random. Eurocard said the name of the bank had in fact been correct. Titanic said it planned to build on the Schneider experience by blocking accounts of other prominent politicians and businessmen. Mr Schneider disappeared over a month ago, leaving his property empire to file for bankruptcy with DM5bn debts.</p>

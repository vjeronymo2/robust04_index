			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: The Duchess of Malfi John Webster (c1580-c1630) collaborated with many of his Jacobean contemporaries, but wrote best alone, producing tense, atmospheric dramas. The Court Theatre Company's ambitious The Duchess of Malfi at the New End Theatre, Hampstead suits this small space. The production is thorough and intimate, but has yet to find the energy and the atmosphere essential for good Webster. The Duchess (1614) rivals The White Devil as Webster's most powerful play, a tragedy of steady desire ending in an orgy of carnage. The widowed Duchess seduces and secretly marries her court steward, Antonio. Her brothers, a cardinal and a duke, have forbidden her to marry; but after her first child is born, they send a spy, Bosola, to report on her. She and her husband flee; she is captured, mentally tortured and - with two of her children - strangled by Bosola. He in turn is killed by the duke, but not before stabbing Antonio and the Cardinal. TS Eliot was being flatly obvious when he found Webster much possessed by death. Webster throws long, deep shadows across the action. The sinuous verse closes scenes down: 'Cover her face. Mine eyes dazzle. She died young.' But Webster can be witty; a servant says to the Duchess' husband, 'Wherefore still when you lie with my lady do you rise so early?' The acting, fresh and honest, needs to be less timid and more forceful. Louise Salter as the Duchess is languidly sexy, seducing her steward with 'What think you of marriage?' in a voice like ground nutmeg. Opposite her, Nigel Daly as Bosola catches the expeditious quality of the Machiavel, always alert, sharp and sensitive: it is a fine piece of acting. Elsewhere, the married pair from the subplot, Castruchio (David Focques) and Julia (Lorna Phillips) wedded to infidelity, add lustre and life. The candlelit set is appropriately plain, a gallery and curtains; and the dress is quiet, modern and unfussy. Anthony Cornish's direction could be much tighter, bringing each scene to a point; he has yet to account for each line of Webster's admittedly difficult text. This company is the professional wing of the Court Theatre Training Company, and offers the chance to see new acting talent and work in progress. This production represents its strengths and weaknesses. Despite a fresh, buoyant approach, the play is delivered as a collection of encounters rather than a dramatic whole. The characters leave no more behind them, as Webster says, 'than one that falls in the frost: the sun melts both form and matter.' New End Theatre (071 794 0022)</p>

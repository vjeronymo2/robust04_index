			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME SEE NO HUMOR IN 'SEE NO EVIL'  </P> <P> I am debating whether to see the new movie comedy smash, "See No Evil, Hear No  Evil" or wait for the sequel, which is sure to be on the drawing boards.  </P> <P> Can you imagine what the stars, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder (who play a blind  man and a deaf man, respectively) and producer Marvin Worth and director Arthur  Hiller could do with epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease?  Wouldn't those be blockbusters?  </P> <P> And kudos to such eminent critics as Kevin Thomas (May 12 review) for  possessing a sense of humor that I obviously lack.  </P> <P> Is there no decency left in a society in search of the dollar?  </P> <P> NORMAN LITTER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

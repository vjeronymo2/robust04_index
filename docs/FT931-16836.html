			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK share indicies reach new highs The main UK stock market indices reached new closing highs yesterday. Mid-sized companies did especially well. The FT-SE 100 index, which tracks the shares of the 100 largest UK companies, rose 15 points to close at 2861.5, after touching a new trading record of 2,867.9 in mid-afternoon. The FT-SE 100 close was a rise of 0.5 per cent, less than half that achieved by the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which covers the next largest 250 companies. It jumped 33.5 points to close at 2896.4, a rise of 1.2 per cent. Mid-sized companies are more reliant on the health of the UK economy than their larger cousins. The new FT-SE SmallCap index, which tracks the next-largest 450 companies, rose 1.0 per cent to close at 1377.88 on its first day. The FT-Actuaries All-Share, extended yesterday from 651 to 800 shares, rose 0.7 per cent to 1,373.20, also a record close. SmallCap index debut, Page 17 London shares, Page 34</p>

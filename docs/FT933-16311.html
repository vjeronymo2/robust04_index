			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Serb artillery shells Sarajevo SERB forces yesterday pounded Sarajevo, the besieged Bosnian capital, as fighting between Croat and Moslem forces erupted on new fronts in central Bosnia, Laura Silber reports from Belgrade. Sarajevo radio reported that Serb artillery shelled several government-held parts of the battered capital. The bombardment followed the heaviest day of shelling in several weeks. United Nations monitors said over 1,000 projectiles landed on Serb-held and Moslem-held parts of the capital on Saturday. Fierce fighting raged around Moslem-held Maglaj and Zavidovici yesterday, and Croat forces reported heavy civilian and military casualties in the battle for the central Bosnian towns. The Croat forces (HVO) in Zagreb said that the 111th HVO Brigade had lost 40 dead and 100 wounded in recent fighting for the Maglaj salient 50 miles north of Sarajevo. Relief workers yesterday warned of an impending 'catastrophe' in Sarajevo. Supplies of food and medicine have dwindled and conditions have deteriorated. Relief officials have expressed concern about outbreaks of typhoid and dysentery because there is no electricity to pump water. In Banja Luka in the north-west Serbs pressed on with their campaign of terror against Moslems by blowing up four mosques, two of which dated from the 16th century. Ten out of 16 mosques around Banja Luka have been mined over the past year in the Serb stronghold. Bosnian radio said Croat forces yesterday began shelling Fojnica, about 25 miles northwest of Sarajevo. Croat radio accused Moslem fighters of starting the clashes. The Moslem-led army need to control the strategic towns of central Bosnia in order to link up territory to the bigger strongholds of Zenica and Tuzla. UN monitors said fighting also continued around Mostar, to the south-west.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The results of every emission test which the ICI conducted on the nonroad engine pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Should a subject nonroad engine fail an emission test at any time, the following procedures are applicable:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The ICI may either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Conduct one retest that involves no adjustment of the nonroad engine from the previous test (for example, adjusting the RPM, timing, air-to-fuel ratio, and so forth) other than adjustments to adjustable parameters that, upon inspection, were found to be out of tolerance. When such an allowable adjustment is made, the parameter may be reset only to the specified (that is, nominal) value (and not any other value within the tolerance band); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Initiate a change in production (production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal emission requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the ICI chooses to retest in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The retests are to be completed no later than five working days subsequent to the first emission test;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Should the subject nonroad engine fail the second emission test, then the ICI must initiate a change in production (a production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal emission requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the ICI chooses to initiate a change in production (a production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal requirements, a change involving adjustments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustable nonroad engine parameters (for example, adjusting the RPM, timing, air/fuel ratio) represents a change in the specified (that is, nominal) value to be deemed acceptable by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A production change made in accordance with this section is to be implemented on all subsequent nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity after the date of importation of the nonroad engine which gave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rise to the production change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Commencing with the first nonroad engine receiving the production change, every third nonroad engine imported under the certificate of conformity is to be emission tested to demonstrate compliance with federal emission requirements until, as in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity is exceeded without adjustments or other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, at which time the amount of required emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing is reduced to every fifth nonroad engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) A report concerning these production changes is to be made to both the Manufacturers Operations and Certification Divisions of EPA within ten working days of initiation of the production change. The cause of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of an emission test is to be identified, if known;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The applicable deterioration factor, if any;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The emission test results adjusted by the deterioration factor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Other information that may be specified by applicable regulations or on the certificate of conformity under which the nonroad engine has been modified in order to assure compliance with requirements of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) All information required under &sect;89.610&hyph;96 related to maintenance, warranties, and labeling;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) An attestation by the ICI that the ICI is responsible for the nonroad engine's compliance with federal emission requirements, regardless of whether the ICI owns the nonroad engine imported under this section;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) The name, address, and telephone number of the person who the ICI prefers to receive EPA notification under &sect;89.605&hyph;96(c);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) An attestation by the ICI that all requirements of &sect;89.607&hyph;96 and &sect;89.610&hyph;96 have been met; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Other information as is deemed necessary by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

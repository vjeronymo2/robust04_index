			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / France gets its Bundesbank, but a Gallic one: How the new independent Bank of France will work THE government of prime minister Edouard Balladur is planning to divest itself of a slice of national policy control by giving the Bank of France autonomy in 'defining and carrying out' the country's monetary policy. It was, in fact, in those terms that President Francois Mitterrand and France's constitutional court raised a last-minute hitch to the change in the central bank's statute. Could a French government, charged by the constitution with running national policy, cut adrift so important an institution as the Bank of France - created by Napoleon in 1800 and fully nationalised in 1936 - before the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union (Emu) required it to do? A compromise was found at a cabinet meeting on Monday. Article 1, the most important of the 33-article draft law, states that the bank will operate monetary policy 'with the goal of ensuring price stability' and 'in the framework of the government's general economic policy'. The latter phrase is intended to protect the government from any constitutional charge of dereliction of duty, and is heavily qualified in the same article by the ban on the central bank 'soliciting or accepting' outside instruction on the conduct of monetary policy. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said he personally did not like the phrase about the central bank operating 'in the framework of' general government policy, and that he hoped it would be struck out when the EC moved to monetary union. If Maastricht was never fully ratified, France's plan for an autonomous central bank would still stand, he stressed, because that form of central banking had proved its anti-inflation worth around the world. De-coupling the Bank of France plan from Maastricht in this way may also make it more palatable to a parliament which contains - chiefly in Mr Balladur's own RPR Gaullist party - more than 100 deputies who voted against the EC treaty in the referendum last September. Mr Balladur, however, still has an enormous majority and pro-EC remnants of the Socialist party to push the plan through. Part of his appeal is to give the new institution distinctively Gallic colours. In contrast to the Bundesbank whose main responsibility is monetary policy, the Bank of France would, in general terms, have all its multifarious activities intact. Its 17,000 employees supervise commercial banks, compile corporate data, run the payments clearing system, even provide management advice to industry and conduct some private banking. But inside the central bank would be created what Mr Alphandery termed the 'sanctuary' of a Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). It would have nine members  -the bank governor and his two deputies (appointed for renewable six-year terms), plus six outsiders. The latter would be appointed by the government from a list of 18 provided by various parliamentary and judicial institutions for staggered nine-year terms which could not be renewed or revoked (except for serious offence). No MPC member could have another job during his term, or anything but a public function for three years after retiring. The draft contains no definition of price stability. That, said Mr Alphandery, would be for the MPC to judge, just as the Bundesbank council does. It clearly states the government would still take overall exchange rate decisions concerning EMS parity changes or fluctuation bands, and that the MPC would decide day-to-day interventions in the foreign exchange markets. But, as with Maastricht itself, this still leaves a grey zone. Who, for instance, would decide exactly where the franc should be within its EMS band? The plan contains no mechanism to arbitrate between government and bank. To have included this, said Mr Alphandery, would have appeared to pre-empt the consensus he hoped would emerge. However, he hoped the MPC would not be stacked with 'the Parisian monetary intelligentsia' but have its six outsiders representing 'the live forces of the economy'. Another ambiguity is in accountability. The draft statute's only stipulation is that the central bank governor continue to make his yearly report to the president. But Mr Alphandery said he expected the governor to testify to parliament at least twice a year as his US counterpart did, and to develop an open press policy like the Bundesbank. 'This will be a plus for our democracy,' he said. The draft plan also clarifies the existing division of labour between the Finance Ministry and the central bank on regulation of commercial banks - who themselves have won a minor victory. The Bank of France is no longer to seek to add to the 100,000 private accounts it holds for individuals (many of them central bank employees) and companies.

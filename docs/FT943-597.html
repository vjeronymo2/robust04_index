			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine outlines terms of Singapore trading Jardine Matheson, the holding company for the diversified group of Jardine companies, yesterday outlined the arrangements it has put in place for investors to trade on the Singapore stock exchange following its withdrawal from Hong Kong. Jardine companies have been listed on the Singapore exchange for three years but have never been traded there. However, Jardine directors believe this will become the natural market for trading from Hong Kong because the two markets are in the same time zone. Other listings are in London, Luxembourg and Australia, but stock is only traded in London and the colony. The company will bear the costs of switching out off the Hong Kong clearing and settlement system and into the Singapore system. It has further arranged with nine local brokerages to levy a maximum commission charge of 0.5 per cent on retail transactions in shares of the companies. Normally, foreign brokers would need to pay this amount to the Singaporean brokerage, but under the Jardine arrangements selected brokerages say the Singaporean party will take 0.25 per cent. Shareholders will still find the cost of dealing more expensive than in Hong Kong, where the normal trade levy is 0.42 per cent including stamp duty and transaction levy at participating brokerage GK Goh Securities. Singapore charges a clearing fee of 0.05 per cent on the transaction value, but non-Singaporean investors are exempted from other fees. The arrangements initially effect shareholders of Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic, which delist on December 31. They will extend to Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land and Mandarin Oriental International when they switch on March 31 next year. Jardine's directors dismiss concerns of illiquidity in the Singapore market, which at the end of July had a market capitalisation of USDollars 137bn compared with Hong Kong's USDollars 312bn. Average daily turnover in Singapore - at SDollars 675m (USDollars 456m) according to Jardine - is not far off current Hong Kong levels, but half of that achieved in the final quarter of last year.</p>

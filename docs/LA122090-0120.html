			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> TOLAND DUMP WILL BE CLOSED SATURDAYS  </P> <P> The Toland Road Landfill between Santa Paula and Fillmore will be closed  Saturdays beginning Feb. 1, and a program for recycling household hazardous  wastes at the site will be changed to another day, officials said.  </P> <P> The Ventura Regional Sanitation District, which operates the Toland Road site  and the Bailard landfill in Oxnard, is expected to take final action on the  closure today.  </P> <P> John Conaway, the district's solid waste manager, said the landfill has been  operating from 7:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. The district  is changing the schedule to Monday through Friday because Saturday revenues did  not offset the cost of running the dump, he said.  </P> <P> "We have to maximize the amount we can get during five days. We're hoping  Monday will be the better business day," Conaway said. JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

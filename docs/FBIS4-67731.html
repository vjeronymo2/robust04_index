			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Helen Nowicka] </F>   [Text] Crew of the quarantined Royal Navy destroyer  Liverpool are to undergo further medical checks this week after  four of their number contracted viral meningitis.    The disease was diagnosed a week ago in two petty officers  and an able seamen while the 3,500-ton ship was visiting  Gibraltar. They were taken ashore and later flown home after  hospital treatment. A second rating fell ill at sea and was  airlifted to Lisbon on Tuesday.    Liverpool is at present anchored off Spithead, seven miles  from Portsmouth, and has been ordered to remain there until  Friday so that the health of the 280 crew can be monitored. A  number of sailors suffered stomach upsets after leaving  Gibraltar but preliminary tests suggest the illness has not  spread beyond the four cases.    "Viral meningitis is not life-threatening, but we are taking  all possible precautions," said a Navy spokeswoman.    Liverpool, which has only recently completed repairs to her  hull and radar systems after an accident in Bahrain harbour last  year, abandoned a planned visit to Norway and exercises in the  North Atlantic to return home for the medical checks.</p>

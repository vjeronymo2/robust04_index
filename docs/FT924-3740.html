			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Savings products THE NEW range of National Savings products goes on sale on Monday. Although rates have fallen, investors may still find some of the offers attractive. The 6th issue of index-linked certificates offers a lower level of inflation protection over five years than the 5th issue - 3.25 per cent per annum over the RPI tax-free, against 4.5 per cent. However, the 6th issue does offer better indexation in the early years. Certificates sold after one year, for example, will receive the rise in the RPI plus 1.5 per cent tax-free. The old 5th issue paid just the rise in the RPI. If one were to assume that inflation continues at its current rate of 3.6 per cent for the next year, then the certificates would pay 5.1 per cent. That equates to 6.8 per cent for the basic rate taxpayer, or 8.5 per cent for a top rate payer. As Scheherezade Daneshkhu's article above shows, those returns would be better than many on offer from the top building societies. In the second year, the 6th issue pays inflation plus 2 per cent; year three, inflation plus 2.75 per cent; year four, inflation plus 3.75 per cent; and in the final year, inflation plus 6.32 per cent. The other new products on offer are: the 40th issue of fixed interest certificates, which pay a tax-free 5.75 per cent per annum compound if held for five years; series G capital bonds which pay a taxable 7.75 per cent also for five years; and issue E of children's bonus bonds, which pay a tax-free 7.85 per cent, again if held for the full five years.</p>

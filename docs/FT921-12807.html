			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Equity Plans (25): Cheap if you have the time - Self-select PEPs / There should be no management fees. Charges will be weighted on the dealing side - to the disadvantage of those who deal often SELF-SELECT Peps are most likely to appeal to investors who like to play the stock market themselves. As the name suggests, the investor chooses a portfolio of shares, in contrast to the more common managed Peps which are run by fund managers. 'You must know what you are doing,' said Roz Barder, of Chase de Vere Investments, which publishes *Pepguide. Those who do not have the time or the inclination to manage their own portfolio would therefore be well advised to steer clear of self-select Peps. The advantage of self-select Peps is that they are often cheaper than those that are managed; and, since you choose what and when to buy, you are not at the mercy of fund managers' decisions. Nevertheless, you still have to go to a plan manager to get a self-select Pep, because only they are authorised to run plans. There is a basic difference in the charging structures of self-select and managed Peps. The latter usually carry an initial charge of anything between 1 and 6 per cent, and an annual management charge of about 1 to 1 1/2 per cent, with VAT on top. There will often be charges each time that you deal. By contrast, there should be no management fees to pay on a self-select Pep  -if there are, look elsewhere. Instead, the charges will be weighted on the dealing side. This means that those who wish to deal frequently, or in small amounts of much less than Pounds 1,000, may well find that a self-select Pep is more expensive than a managed Pep. Paul Killik, of the stockbroking firm Killik, says, however, that Peps are not the place to put speculative investments which you might want to buy and sell quickly. Instead, he sees them as 'the place to tuck away good long-term investments with reasonable yields.' David Nugent, of Pilling, also regards Peps as a long-term investment. 'Go for blue-chip stocks with a 10-year view,' he advises. Killik and Pilling are two of four plan managers recommended by Roz Barber for their low dealing charges. The others are Reykers and Sharelink. Killik (tel 071 224-2050) makes no initial charge or annual charges; and the commission on dealings is 1.65 per cent, or a minimum of Pounds 40. Mr Killik says it offers concessionary rates on 'bed and breakfast' shares - an investor's existing shares can only be 'Pepped' if they are sold on the market and bought again. However, there is a dividend collection charge of Pounds 7.50. Mr Killik points out that, if you deal in amounts of Pounds 2,400 or more, which is the point at which 1.65 per cent becomes cheaper than the Pounds 40 minimum, it is cheaper to have a self-select Pep. Dealing advice is also given at no extra cost. Pilling (061 832-6581) charges no initial or annual fees. Its commission rate is 1.65 per cent, subject to a Pounds 30 minimum. The dividend collection charge is Pounds 6.75, and advice is also part of the package. Reykers (071 499-9097) lets you use your own stockbroker. There is a Pounds 40 initial fee, and a 1 per cent annual management fee which covers collection and payment of dividends. Rates for a single-company self-select Pep are a Pounds 20 initial fee and a 1 per cent annual management charge. Investment advice is not given. Sharelink (021 200 4545) makes an initial charge of Pounds 25, which is being waived at the moment, and an annual administration fee of 0.75 per cent of the value of the portfolio, subject to a minimum of Pounds 20. This covers the dividend collection. Dealing charges are 1.5 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 17.50 and a maximum of Pounds 37.50 per order. No advice is given. Self-select Peps may prove more popular with the introduction this month of the single-company Pep, which allows investors to take out a Pounds 3,000 Pep in addition to the Pounds 6,000 general Pep for any single tax year. If you know that you want to buy and hold a particular company's shares, for example, you should seriously consider using the self-select route, because your investment dilemma is simplified by the need to select only that one company. Remember, however, that, for the vast majority of investors, it is the exemption from income tax that is the most important advantage of a Pep. This means that you should look for a stock which offers a healthy yield and looks able to maintain its dividend. There is one caveat for those wealthy investors who frequently face capital gains tax bills, however. Losses on shares held in a Pep are arguably worse than those held outside. Since there is no capital gains tax to pay on shares held in a Pep, losses cannot be offset against CGT. *Address and telephone number: see page 28</p>

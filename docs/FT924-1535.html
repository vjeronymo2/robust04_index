			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Intel expects to top market expectations INTEL of the US expects fourth-quarter results to be 'well above' analysts' estimates due to high demand for its Intel486 microprocessors, Reuter reports. The company, which earned Dollars 189m, or 90 cents a share, in the 1991 fourth quarter, also said fourth-quarter revenues would be 25 per cent above the third quarter's Dollars 1.43bn. According to estimates collected by Zacks Investment Research, Intel's fourth-quarter net income per share is forecast to be between Dollars 1.15 to Dollars 1.30 a share. Estimates from IBES place the figure between Dollars 1.15 to Dollars 1.36. Mr Andrew Grove, Intel chief executive, said the combination of seasonal strength, brisk personal computer unit demand, worldwide migration from the Intel386 to the Intel486 microprocessor, excellent factory performance and solid demand 'for our other products' was producing better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.</p>

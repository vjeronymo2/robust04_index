			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Unigate disposes of US cheese operations UNIGATE, the food and transport group, is continuing the restructuring of its portfolio of activities with the sale of its US cheese operations for about Dollars 75m (Pounds 37m). The disposal will give Unigate a profit over the book value of Dollars 57m and represents an exit multiple of 16 times last year's profits. Unigate's shares rose 4p to 231p. The buyer is Stella, a larger US cheese business ultimately owned by Artal of Belgium. The consideration will be met in cash and could be adjusted to reflect working capital at the time. The sale is subject to approval by US competition authorities. Unigate's US cheese operations consist of two businesses, Frigo and Gardenia, which make Italian-style cheeses. In the year to end-March the two made an operating profit of Pounds 4.5m, a recovery from Pounds 400,000 previously. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate since October 1990, said the business had been subject to volatile milk prices and despite action taken to improve profitability Unigate was still not satisfied with the return it was making. Profits were expected to fall again in the current year. In February this year Unigate sold JP Wood, its loss-making chicken operation, and last month sold part of its Giltspur International exhibition business. Its Wincanton car contract hire operation is being run down, and Unigate is discussing the sale of its vehicle rental activities. Last year Unigate set up a Pounds 76m provision to cover losses on businesses sold or closed. The cash from the sale of the US cheese business will go to reduce borrowings which were a net Pounds 47.7m in the March 31 balance sheet.</p>

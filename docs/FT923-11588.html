			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (6): Archaeologists race to save a crossroads - Already over 200 historic sites have been lost THE CAUSE of archaeology has never been uppermost in the minds of the Turkish engineers who drew up plans to flood the Euphrates valley. There are few signs that things will be any different when it comes to the Tigris. The race is on to save what is, in archaeological terms, a laboratory: a crossroads of some great civilisations of the world - from the Assyrian and Persians, Commagenians, Romans, Abbasids of Aleppo, the Byzantines and the Seljuk Turks. Already, as many as 210 documented sites on the Euphrates have been lost since the Keban, Karakaya and Ataturk dams were filled; perhaps many more. In 1977, in a rush to beat the deadline, Ankara's Middle East Technical University conducted a survey of the affected areas, on the basis of which local and foreign archaeologists were invited to choose one site to excavate. One example was Samosat, a massive Roman legionary base and the iron age capital of the region which is now inundated by the Ataturk reservoir. The birthplace of the Roman writer Lucian, Samosat is dated to the first half of the third century BC. It is mentioned by Pliny, by Strabo, and in the histories of Procopius. It is believed to be the capital of the late Hittite Kingdom known as Kummuku; it was also the capital of the Commagene kingdom. It was besieged by Mark Antony, and later Vespasian made it a Roman province. 'Surface evidence indicates the Samosat mound was occupied almost continuously from the beginning of the Chalcolithic period to the present day,' the report stated. Professor Halet Cambel of Istanbul University says that Samosat was probably the most important historical and archaeological site in the region. Today she is campaigning to save Nevali Cori, near Urfa, where a joint dig with Heidelberg University has discovered a 7th century mosaic, which is slowly being covered as the Ataturk reservoir advances. 'This is one of the two earliest mosaic floors in the world; the authorities should allow the waters to recede to enable us to move the mosaic,' Professor Cambel says. On the Tigris, things are potentially worse. 'There has been no survey done,' she says. 'That story is even more sad because we don't know what we are losing if the area is flooded.' After five years campaigning, Prof Olus Arik of Ankara University has just received a Dollars 10,000 budget direct from the Gap authority to excavate Hasankeyf, a late Roman frontier camp, at the crossroads of 'three different worlds - the Asiatic, Mesopotamian, and Byzantine.' This is three times the size of normal excavation funds approved by the culture ministry, but is still barely enough to make an impact on a site more extensive than Ephesus. Today Hasankeyf faces the fate of so many of the sites in the Tigris and Euphrates valley. According to the Gap master plan, the Ilisu dam near Midyat is projected to cover the area within nine years of the construction starting. 'Only the top of the highest minaret might still be visible,' says the professor. Scrapping the dam is probably unlikely, given its importance in the overall Gap masterplan. But Prof Arik remains optimistic that the authorities may give him a reprieve, at least to be able to survey the site properly. 'I hope they will cancel it, or at least alter the plans. My argument has always been that Turkey shouldn't sacrifice 2,000 years of history for some kilowatt hours of energy.'</p>

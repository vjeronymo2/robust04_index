			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drug wins US approval Glaxo has belatedly won US approval for one of its most important products of the 1990s, the inhaled asthma treatment Serevent. The US Food and Drug Administration had been expected to approve the drug in December and Glaxo shares fell when this did not happen. After Serevent's approval yesterday, the shares rose 15p to end the day with a net fall of 2p at 664p. The drug is important to Glaxo because it is a successor to Ventolin, the long standing big seller in asthma treatment. Such respiratory treatments are second in importance only to ulcer drugs in Glaxo's therapeutic portfolio, accounting for almost one quarter of total sales. The older drug has now lost much of its patent protection and the company is relying on Serevent to underpin its position in the market. The drug was approved in Europe in 1991 and should eventually reach sales of Pounds 350m a year, according to James Capel, the broker. In the last full year, Serevent sold Pounds 73m while Ventolin sales were worth Pounds 484m. The drug had a setback last month, however, when Italian government healthcare reforms favoured Ventolin by excluding Serevent from a list of drugs the government would pay for. Glaxo lodged an appeal against the ruling.</p>

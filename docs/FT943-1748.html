			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: ENI rebound opens way for privatisation options A strong return to profitability by ENI, the Italian state oil concern, has opened the way for the Berlusconi government to look afresh on the various options for privatisation. Mr Franco Bernabe, ENI chief executive, told parliament yesterday the group was heading for a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.28bn) net profit in 1994 with the bulk of costly restructuring of loss-making sectors such as chemicals nearly complete. He said this improved performance allowed the government to opt for two separate paths in privatisation. It could either be via the formation of a company grouping all the interests with those still controlled by ENI. Alternatively, ENI could be split into three - energy, chemicals, and other activities - that would be owned directly by the state. ENI, on its L50,000bn annual turnover, is the sixth largest oil group in the world. The government has been sitting on earlier proposals put forward by Mr Bernabe which were in line with guidelines laid down by the previous Amato and Ciampi governments that envisaged the creation of a 'super-Agip' centred round the core of the group, Agip, the producer of oil and gas. Mr Bernabe appears determined to force the government into deciding a clear policy for the group. However, the government is far from united with the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance resisting large-scale privatisation. On ENI's performance, the improved profit projection against a mere L419m in 1993 in part is attributed to extraordinary items from continuing divestments. Through August, ENI had raised L1,776bn from 60 new assets sales. The burden on the consolidated balance sheet continues to come at least for this year from the chemicals side which lost L2,600bn in 1993 and which accounts for only 15 per cent of turnover. Mr Bernabe said that if ENI's energy interests were hived off, it could remain in charge of running the privatisation of the other activities. But he clearly outlined his preference by pointing to the creation of strong state-dominated energy holdings with private stakes like Spain's creation of Repsol from INH.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The Emergency  Committee for American Trade (ECAT) today urged the U.S.  Government and Congress to continue to extend the most-favored  nation (MFN) trade status for China.    Kenneth Williams, vice-president of McDonnel Douglas  Aircraft  Company (MD), made the statement while testifying on behalf of  the ECAT at a hearing of the subcommittee on trade of the U.S.  House Ways and Means Committee beginning this afternoon.    He also said that all the 60 ECAT members "strongly support  the continuation of MFN trade status for China, which is a  requisite for U.S. participation in the explosive growth in  China's economy."    Williams said that MD and the rest ECAT members are large  U.S. firms with substantial overseas operations, which are among  the country's largest exporters and employers. Worldwide annual  sales of ECAT members are nearly one trillion U.S. dollars and  ECAT members employ about five million workers, he said.    "Increasing numbers of ECAT member companies are  establishing  business relations in China. It is a market of huge potential  and prospective huge benefits for U.S. firms and workers," he  said.    He urged the Clinton administration and the U.S. Congress to  review the Jackson-Vanik Amendment enacted 20 years ago as part  of the trade pact of 1974, which links trade with human rights  in socialist countries.    "For several years ECAT has recommended in testimony to  Congress that the Jackson-Vanik Amendment be reviewed for the  purpose of either eliminating it altogether or amending it to  provide authority for long-term extensions of MFN trade status  for periods of up to five years," he said. "Annual reviews of  MFN create uncertainty for prospective investors."    "Annual debates over MFN for China are increasingly  contentious and pose serious long-term risks for American  investors," he stressed.    After recalling MD's cooperation with China, Williams said  that "the withdrawal of MFN for China would fundamentally alter  the U.S. economic and political position in China. There would  be very substantial diminution in bilateral trade and in  existing and future U.S. investments in China."    He said American businesses "need the cooperation of our  government" in meeting and beating global economic challenges."    "Denying us the opportunity to play a meaningful role in  competing for the enormous business opportunities in China will  very much redound to the disadvantage of the United States," he  said.</p>

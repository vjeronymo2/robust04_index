			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Ministers bid for places in single currency fast lane EUROPEAN finance ministers yesterday publicly rejected the idea of a two-speed approach to monetary union, but governments are placing bids to participate in the 'fast track' towards a single currency. However, as Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, yesterday reminded his continental European counterparts, Ireland was one of only a few EC members to meet the Maastricht targets. The Maastricht treaty envisaged a period of economic convergence leading up to formal currency union by the year 2000. Only countries which met the criteria would proceed to a single currency. Yet most of the economies tipped to participate in a closer monetary union - not least Germany - are running annual budget deficits well in excess of the 3 per cent of gross domestic product laid down by the treaty. Belgium's budget deficit is likely to total 5.5 per cent of GDP this year, almost twice the Maastricht limit. In contrast, Denmark's participation in any core group is uncertain, even though economic convergence on many measures has been achieved. Inflation averaged only 2.4 per cent last year, and the current account shows a healthy surplus. However, the Danish electorate's rejection of Maastricht in June leaves the country in an awkward position. 'There is no illusion about Denmark having much independence from Germany in terms of monetary policy already, but there is no political mandate for moving to currency union,' said Mr Kit Jukes, economist at Warburg Securities. The Danish government is expected next month to unveil a revised plan for winning electoral approval of the Maastricht treaty. The country's participation in any future moves toward European integration, let alone a fast track a single currency, will turn on the result. However, analysts are cautious about predicting windfall gains in the bond markets of any countries which do embark on the fast track towards monetary union. Yields will probably converge with the German bund market, but in many cases from very low levels. Moreover, some premium over German yields may still be necessary. In particular, investors may demand a 'liquidity premium' from bond markets smaller than the bund market. This does not imply that the smaller markets are difficult to trade. Belgium reformed its bond market two years ago precisely to improve liquidity. However, big international investors are likely to allocate cash to bunds ahead of smaller European markets and bund yields may be consistently lower as a result, even if currency risk is removed by currency union or system of fixed exchange rates. If international investors do still favour the bund market, the smaller markets may suffer from the failure of their own governments to meet the Maastricht criteria on public sector borrowing. For example, the yield spread of Dutch bonds over bunds, which tends to fluctuate between 20 and 30 basis points at the 10-year maturity, often widens in periods of high government borrowing. The Dutch government's deficit is likely to be around 3.75 per cent of GDP this year, proportionately higher than that of Germany. Analysts also warn that high government borrowing in Germany could still damage the returns from bond markets tied to the German market in currency union. While the Bundesbank is expected to cut short-term interest rates as the economy slows, longer-term bund yields are sensitive to concerns about inflation and supply of new bunds. Lower yield spreads over the German market could come about through higher bund yields.</p>

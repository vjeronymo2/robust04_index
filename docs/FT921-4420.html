			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Operating officer for Young Group Young Group, the opencast and drift coal miner, yesterday announced the appointment to its board, with immediate effect, of Mr Brian Calver, a mining engineer with extensive experience at board level with RTZ mining subsiduaries. Mr Calver has joined the USM-quoted company as chief operating officer, a new post designed to strengthen Young's management team. He will report directly to chairman and chief executive Mr Bob Young and is expected to become a director. Young Group, which last week announced it was facing reduced 1991 profits and needed more working capital, is currently negotiating with its bankers and major shareholders for additional finance. The creation of the new post, intended to allow Mr Bob Young, the company's founder, to concentrate on broader strategic issues, had been planned well before the group's need for more working capital became public knowledge.</p>

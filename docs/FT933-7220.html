			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Potential losses of LUI could be Pounds 4.5bn POTENTIAL LOSSES of London United Investments, the insurance group which collapsed early in 1990, could be as high as Pounds 4.5bn, more than Pounds 1bn greater than earlier estimates. The estimated shortfall between liabilities and assets will be disclosed when provisional liquidators publish a scheme of arrangement next week. The full extent of the losses cannot yet be accurately assessed, as they depend on claims that could take years to settle. LUI was heavily involved in 'long tail' US liability business, in which claims often arise years after the policy is written. LUI's subsidiaries specialised in general and product liability for North American companies, with professional indemnity insurance for accountants, architects, engineers and lawyers, and medical malpractice insurance for doctors and hospitals. The provisional liquidators, Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, will seek creditors' approval for a scheme of arrangement rather than a liquidation, because they believe it offers the best prospects for the companies' creditors, which could eventually number more than 100,000. The scheme of arrangement allows creditors to receive some payment before the detailed picture of the assets and liabilities is fully known. Part of the impact of the LUI losses will be absorbed by the Policyholders' Protection Board, which could be faced with a bill of more than Pounds 250m. The PPB, which is financed by a levy on other UK insurers, covers 90 per cent of all claims from private policyholders when UK insurers go out of business. The PPB's potential bill has risen because of a recent House of Lords ruling which found that several thousand US policyholders could claim compensation even though they were not resident in the UK. But it reserved judgment on whether a number of professional partnerships would be eligible. LUI incurred its liabilities through its subsidiaries, Kingscroft Insurance, Walbrook Insurance, El Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual Reinsurance. In November 1990, the Department of Trade and Industry launched an investigation into LUI under Section 432 of the Companies Act.</p>

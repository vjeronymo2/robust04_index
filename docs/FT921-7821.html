			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Israel launches new attacks in Lebanon ISRAEL launched renewed air and artillery attacks on targets in southern Lebanon yesterday after an Israeli town was hit by rockets fired across the border by Lebanese militiamen seeking revenge for the killing of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, leader of the Shi'ite Moslem fundamentalist organisation Hizbollah. The fighting, the most intense in the area for years, went on unabated for the third day following the death of Mr Musawi in a rocket strike by Israeli helicopters in south Lebanon on Sunday. It prompted Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to warn that Israel was ready to use 'all our might' to stop the rocket attacks on its territory, although he denied suggestions that he was planning a large-scale action similar to the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. He was speaking after visiting a bus station in an Israeli border town hit by Katyusha rockets yesterday, the most dramatic Hizbollah strike to date. No one was injured, but 13 people were treated for shock. Residents of Kiryat Shemona and other border towns have spent much of the time since Sunday in bomb shelters. Later, Israel fired rockets from US-supplied Apache assault helicopters at an alleged Hizbollah base in the village of Jibsheet. No one was reported hurt. Iranian-backed Hizbollah, which normally confines its actions to attacks on Israeli forces and their local allies occupying a strip of Lebanese territory, has fired dozens of Katyushas across the Lebanese-Israeli border since Mr Musawi was killed. 'They have a lot of Katyushas, but we will overcome them and disarm them,' Mr Shamir said. Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister who as defence minister led the 1982 invasion, was reported by Israel Army radio as calling for a northward extension of the 'security zone' controlled by Israeli forces to push the Hizbollah rockets out of range of the border.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Comalco arranges finance for power station deal Comalco, the large integrated aluminium producer which is 67 per cent-owed by CRA, has succeeded in underwriting a ADollars 625m (USDollars 439m) debt facility which will partially finance its purchase of the Gladstone Power Station from the Queensland Electricity Commission. The deal is is the first financing of a large resources project whose viability could be affected by an Aboriginal land claim since Australia's Native Title (Mabo) legislation was passed at the end of last year. Some observers have seen the transaction as a test case for the international banking community's attitude towards the new law. The power station purchase is tied to Comalco's plans to almost double the output of its aluminium smelter at nearby Boyne Island, and the total investment in the project has been estimated at around ADollars 1.75bn. The problem is that a substantial tranche of land in the neighbouring Cape York Peninsula is subject to a land claim from the Aboriginal Wik people. This has no immediate bearing on the project, but the land being claimed does contain deposits which Comalco might wish to use to sustain its bauxite operations at Weipa, which in turn would supply raw materials to the Boyne Island smelter. Yesterday, however, Comalco claimed that the bidding for the funding had been 'very competitive' and that around ADollars 2bn of underwriting commitments had been offered in total. Barclays Bank of the UK has been appointed agent and lead bank for the limited-recourse debt. The other underwriting banks are Deutsche Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan, ANZ and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The financing is scheduled to close by March 31, after which there will be a general syndication of the debt to other project finance banks. Comalco did not disclose pricing details, but J. P. Morgan, which is advising on the project, said last night that 'no premium had been attached to the funding because of the Mabo situation'. It has always been questionable whether the cost of project finance would be affected by the Mabo legislation. Some critics of the government's native title bill have argued that the legislation's main impact will be to delay projects while native title claims are sorted out. 'These issues will generally be cleared up before a project goes to financing,' said one banker yesterday. Under the Mabo bill, native claims will not be automatically extinguished where there is a valid mining lease on the land. Such claims will be allowed to 'co-exist' with a mining lease, and then possibly take over when the lease expires. The bill also sets up a system of tribunals for hearing native title claims.</p>

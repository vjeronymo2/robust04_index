During the alert, all major commanders and staff officers  should stand by within easy access to communications, and leaves  and outings of all officers and men will be controlled.    An officer said the alert is to ensure firmer security  preparedness as President Kim Yong-sam, the supreme military  commander, is making an overseas tour at a time when a tension  is building up on the Korean peninsula following the breakup of  Panmunjom talks.    President Kim leaves the country on March 24 to embark on an  official visit to Japan, which will be followed by his tour of  China.    "Apart from the special alert, the special military  preparedness order issued earlier for a period until the end of  this month, will be extended for the time being," the officer  said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Since the establishment of Slovakia's new  government, this is the first visit by a Slovak minister abroad  to Budapest. Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis has confirmed  that military cooperation continues under the agreement signed  by Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur with the Slovak defense  minister last October 1993. Laszlo Gardai reports on the  details.    [Begin recording] [Gardai] [passage omitted] I asked the  Slovak defense minister what are the chances of a political turn  in the relations of the two countries in his view, and what kind  of steps would be necessary to be taken by the two sides.    [Kanis in Slovak with superimposed Hungarian translation] A  more civilized political conduct is required than the one we had  so far. It applies to both Slovak and foreign politicians. It  would be important that the small countries established on the  territories of former federations give up nationalism.  Nationalism implies isolation in this region. Slovakia will be  open in the future, and we will devote special attention to the  cooperation between the member states of the Visegrad Four, the  Slovak defense minister said. [end recording]</p>

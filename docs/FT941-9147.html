			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / A sorry spectacle in Tokyo: Robert Thomson and William Dawkins examine the effects on companies and consumers of the yen's rise The spectacle makers of Sabae, in western Japan, have their own index for foreign exchange fluctuations. At Y110 to the dollar, they are competitive in medium-quality frames, while at Y105 they must retreat to the top end of the market, and at Y100 they are making spectacles at a loss. Sabae's scale applies to many Japanese manufacturers, which are reeling from the yen's rise on the foreign exchange markets over the past two trading days. The yen stood at a just about acceptable Y108.30 to the dollar as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flew to Washington for a summit with President Bill Clinton on Friday. Their failure to agree on a trade accord sent the yen shooting up to Y101.9 at one point in Tokyo yesterday, to close at Y102.02 to the dollar, pushing Sabae's spectacle makers close to making a loss. The hard evidence that the US wants to push the yen higher is thin. President Clinton did refer to 'the exchange rate factor' twice at his press conference with Mr Hosokawa. But on both occasions he cited it only as one of the 'objective criteria' that the US was seeking to judge progress in opening Japanese markets over a period of years. However, the apparently non-judgmental reference to the currency was otherwise construed by the foreign exchange traders late on Friday and again by the broader markets on Monday. This prompted the Treasury on Monday to issue a statement timed for the opening of the Tokyo markets yesterday that 'we do not believe in artificially manipulating exchange rates'. Nowhere in the annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers, released on Monday, is there a single word on the desired value of the yen. Indeed US officials point out that a higher yen will tend further to deflate the Japanese economy, whereas the general thrust of US policy is to encourage Japan to cut taxes and thus stimulate growth. If anything, they say, currently weak Japanese economic fundamentals ought to push the currency lower. On the other side of the equation, the US accepts that the yen's strength has aided US car and semiconductor makers, which are gaining world market share at the expense of Japanese competitors. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association says Japan will lose its position as the world's largest car producer to the US this year, for the first time since 1979. Yen appreciation is still the big worry in Japanese boardrooms, from Sabae's small companies to Tokyo's multinationals. Nomura Research Institute estimates that the Y10 rise in the currency's rate against the dollar since early January has wiped 6 per cent off companies' average operating profits. If the yen stays this high, it could destroy corporate Japan's chance of pulling out of a four-year profits decline in 1994, warns the institute. Japanese consumers are, of course, helped by the yen's increase - but only in the short term. A stronger yen has meant some cheaper imported goods. This, plus the slowdown in economic activity, will help wholesale prices fall by 1 per cent in the year to the end of March, forecasts indicate. This does not always show up in retail prices, because the complex distribution system, with layer-upon-layer of wholesalers and distributors, soaks up most of the benefits. Even so, Tokyo shops this winter are full of discount sales. Over the long term, the yen's strength is encouraging two trends: the shift of production outside Japan, which has increased fears about rising unemployment and hence depressed consumer spending; and the weakening of traditionally close links between retailers and manufacturers. Investment in China is gathering pace among manufacturers looking for cheaper east Asian production sites. China is increasingly the preferred investment site for Japanese manufacturers, as it offers an expanding home market and a relatively cheap base for exports, according to the Export-Import Bank of Japan. Japanese direct investment overseas will fall by 6.4 per cent in the year from April, but investment in east Asia has been 'spurred by the abrupt appreciation' of the yen, says the bank. A strong yen is one extra, unwanted cost for Japanese manufacturers, already attempting to cope with a long-term decline in their profitability. Falling sales at home have put pressure on companies to find new ways of hiding excess employees in affiliates. But the common response to the profits decline, investing abroad, means that capital spending flows to, say, the northern Chinese city of Dalian, instead of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. New factories established in Hokkaido fell from 277 in 1989 to 170 in 1992, and only 48 were commissioned in the first half of last year. In northern China, the statistics are more impressive. Mr Suehiro Ohba, general manager of a Japanese-run industrial park in Dalian, presided over the signing of four contracts in a week late last year. 'The labour here is cheap. As long as you have control over the venture, there is not much difference in the production quality between Dalian and Japan, but there is a big difference in the cost.' The Japan Research Institute - Sumitomo Bank's research unit - estimates that over the next five years the transfer of production from Japan will cost 1.1m jobs. Most markets observers expect the yen's strength to ensure double-digit growth in Japan's foreign investment for the next few years. For example, Japan's imports of audio-visual electronics were 37 per cent higher in November, compared with the same month in 1992, with most of this equipment carrying a Japanese brand-mark from the makers' east Asian factories. Japan became a net importer of televisions last year, for the first time since the second world war. Offshore production of consumer electronics in Asia has not necessarily meant cheaper prices in Japan: the Fair Trade Commission, an anti-monopoly body, has warned makers against forming industry agreements, common until last year, to restrict discounts and cushion margins. However, the second main long-term effect of the higher yen - the impact on retailing - has resulted in some clearer benefits for consumers. It has spurred the development of stores operating outside the usual distribution system, which are able to pass on the savings created both by their own lower costs and by the yen's effect on imports. In the consumer electronics industry, manufacturers rely on the loyalty of small retailers tied to their own group, through Japan's networks of cross-shareholdings and exclusive dealerships. But these mainly small corner stores are under pressure from independent retailers willing to cut prices to attract business. A similar trend is emerging in the food and clothing industries. Mr Takashi Shirayama, of Shirayama Corporation, an Osaka-based investment company, has plans for at least five retail outlets, the first likely to open in March, which he said could undercut supermarkets by 20-30 per cent. 'If you have five stores, you have more import buying power,' Mr Shirayama said. It is harder, however, to get around the reluctance of power utilities to pass on the savings from the fall in the cost of energy, most of which is imported. The utilities still calculate energy costs at rates similar to those set in 1989, when the yen was Y124 to the dollar, the currency in which oil is priced. Tokyo Electric Power and the other regional utilities reduced rates in November after complaints from consumers and pressure from the government, but the average Tokyo household is still saving only Y111 on a Y7,010 monthly electricity bill. The result has been increasing numbers of Japanese worried that there are so few gains from a high yen. Their disappointment with derisory cuts in electricity bills may have been been offset by the attraction of cheaper holidays abroad: record crowds at Narita airport over the new year holiday were no doubt delighted with the chance of a cheap sunshine break. But on balance, the yen's rise is a further constraint on the recovery of an economy already in the grip of deflation. Additional reporting by Jurek Martin</p>

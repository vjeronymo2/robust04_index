			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Donor-aided research programme needs greater funding Sir, Your article, 'Not in the best of health' (February 4), quotes me as having said that lack of money has not been a problem for research in human reproduction and contraception. Regrettably, this statement has been taken out of context and, as a result, may give the impression that this field of research in general, and our programme in particular, is well provided for. I wish this were true. The special programme for research, development and training in human reproduction is an international research programme. It is co-sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank. The programme's activities are financed, not from the WHO's regular budget, but from voluntary contributions by some 20 developing and developed country governments and organisations. Until recently, these enlightened donors have been able to raise about 90 per cent of the programme's biennial funding targets. However, the fact that donors have provided such support should not be taken to mean that there is no funding shortage for the field in general or for our programme. It only reflects the donors' strong commitment and realistic budgeting on our part. I would point out that funding for our current 1992-93 two-year programme is likely to reach only about 75 per cent of target because several of our European donors are forced to reduce their budgets for overseas development aid and a number of their currencies have recently been devalued. P F A Van Look, acting director, special programme of research, development and research training in human reproduction, World Health Organisation, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland</p>

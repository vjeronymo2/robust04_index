			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS WANT VOICES HEARD IN HOT WHITTIER SCHOOL RACE  </P> <P> Still frustrated by their longest-ever contract dispute last year, teachers in  the Whittier City School District want their voices to be heard in Tuesday's  election -- making the quest for three open school board seats one of the  hottest battles in the Southeast area.  </P> <P> For the first time, teachers in the 6,000-student district in the heart of  Whittier have formed a political action committee and pledged to support three  candidates: Owen Newcomer, Reed Wilson and Dave Thomas.  </P> <P> Members of the committee have walked door-to-door, written letters to voters  and held yard sales to raise money.  </P> <P> "We've been politically active before, but not at this level," said Barbara  Gaborko, president of the Whittier Elementary Teachers Assn. "We are trying to  elect people who are understanding and have empathy for what goes on in the  classroom. We have not felt we have had that for some time."  </P> <P> Last year, the teachers and district officials battled for nine months over  details of a new contract. The teachers wanted a 7% pay increase but settled  for 5% just before a planned strike.  </P> <P> Hard feelings persist, Gaborko said. The election could help heal the wounds.  </P> <P> Nine candidates, including one incumbent, are running for three seats on the  school board. Board members Ermila Corral and Janet Henke are retiring.  Candidates include:  </P> <P> James Albanese, vice president of business services at Mt. San Antonio College.  Albanese has been active in school issues since the 1970s. His wife served on  the school board from 1972 to 1976.  </P> <P> Incumbent Mildred A. Early. Running for a fourth term, she has been on the  board for 12 years and involved in school issues since 1969.  </P> <P> Sandra Kersley, a librarian at the Rosemead Library. She has two children  enrolled in the Whittier district.  </P> <P> Peggy Mathews, a nurse.  </P> <P> J. C. (Mac) McFarland is president of McFarland Energy Co. in Santa Fe Springs.  He has three children in the district, which is what prompted him to become  involved in school politics, he said.  </P> <P> Owen Newcomer, a political science and speech teacher at Rio Hondo College. He  is a member of the Rio Hondo teacher's union and is currently negotiating for a  new contract.  </P> <P> A. Roy Salas, a business development loan officer for a commercial lending  company. Salas has served on school boards for the Los Nietos and Whittier  Union High School districts. This is the first time he has run in the Whittier  City School District.  </P> <P> Dave Thomas, a teacher in the Los Nietos school district. He has also been  active in contract negotiations.  </P> <P> Reed Wilson, an accountant for Powerine Oil Co. in Santa Fe Springs. He has two  children and has been active in parent-teacher groups for several years.  </P> <P> Downey Unified  </P> <P> A dentist and a chiropractor are vying for a seat on the Board of Education of  the Downey Unified School District.  </P> <P> Robert E. Riley, a 49-year-old dentist who was first elected to the board in  1981, faces chiropractor Donald K. Hopkins, 25.  </P> <P> The Downey Education Assn., which represents district teachers, has made no  formal endorsement, but it is telling members in its newsletter that Hopkins  would be more sympathetic to teachers if elected.  </P> <P> Association Executive Director Richard Ruether said Riley has consistently  opposed salary increases for teachers during negotiations.  </P> <P> Riley said this week that he supports good salaries for teachers but that he  has opposed some raises because it was unclear whether the district would have  enough money in the future to cover higher personnel costs.  </P> <P> Hopkins, whose wife, Cynthia, teaches math in the district, said he supports  giving the district's instructors good wages to do good jobs.  </P> <P> The term of office is four years, and board members receive a $400 monthly  stipend.  </P> <P> Board members Grace E. Horney and Walter S. Temple are running unopposed.  Horney was first elected in 1965, while Temple began serving on the board in  1981.  </P> <P> East Whittier City Schools  </P> <P> Ten candidates, including one incumbent, are running for three seats and one  unexpired term on the East Whittier City School District board.  </P> <P> Paula Hodgin, owner of an interior design business, is seeking reelection. She  has served on the board for four years.  </P> <P> Other candidates include Susan Hunter Eiden, a teacher at a junior high school  in East Los Angeles; Michael E. Martinet, personnel director for the city of  Bell Gardens; David Perry, a truck driver; Benjamin Rich, economics teacher at  El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera; R.F. Valdez, owner of a bookstore in  Whittier; Cathy Warner, a dental hygienist; and David F. Weitzel, a physician's  assistant.  </P> <P> Board members James Stewart and Shirley Nielson have stepped down.  </P> <P> Candy Harris, a businesswoman, and C.

Benavides, 45; Frank Millan, 54, and Mary  Lou Ramirez, 51.  </P> <P> Benavides and Millan said they were drawn into the race over an erroneous  dropout rate report released by the state. The report, which listed a 50.2%  dropout rate, was based on numbers that were accidentally submitted to the  state. El Rancho Supt.

In their literature and slogans, all of  the candidates are responding to parents' concerns about the dropout rate.  </P> <P> Little Lake City Elementary  </P> <P> Three candidates are competing for two board seats on the Little Lake City  Elementary School District board.

Luera, 55, is director of social services in Norwalk. He has served on  the board for 15 years, and wants a gang-prevention program in the school  district. Lupe Flores McClintock, 33, a school activity coordinator, is the  only woman in the race. She is a mother of four and wants to see after-school  programs expanded.

He has three children and  wants to start a parent advisory committee to work with the school board.  </P> <P> Norwalk dentist Ralph A. Nicassio, 30, decided to run for the board this year  because he wants to see priorities restructured and the budget process  reformed.  </P> <P> Ken Welch, 60, a quality assurance engineer in Pasadena, has been on the school  board eight years.

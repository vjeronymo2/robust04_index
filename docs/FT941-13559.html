			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: USM float will put Pounds 4.2m tag on CFS Computerised Financial Solutions, which provides specialised computer support and administrative services to financial institutions and manufacturers, yesterday published its full prospectus ahead of a flotation on the USM which will value the group at Pounds 4.23m. A total of 1.59m shares, including 1.35m new shares, are being placed with institutional investors at 90p each. The shares being placed represent 34 per cent of the group's enlarged share capital. Mr Alfred Stein, a former Chrysler executive, founded Commercial Inventory Service in 1976 and CIS was acquired earlier this month by CFS, a new holding company. Following the flotation IBM will hold just under 15 per cent of the enlarged capital and Mr Stein, chief executive, will retain a 40.09 per cent stake. Dealings are expected to begin on February 3. The placing will raise Pounds 920,000 in new funds after expenses, which will be used to repurchase existing preference shares and provide additional working capital. CFS expects pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 325,000 on turnover of about Pounds 3.5m for 1993, producing earnings of not less than 6.42p. The group has developed sophisticated software which is used by its customers to improve their control of inventory finance and consumer installment financing. The volume of transactions processed through its computer system is worth more than Pounds 1.5bn a year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The consultations over the make-up of the cabinet  will end on 6 May. On 7-8 May, "the situation will be examined  by the members of the Freedom Alliance," and on 8 May, Prime  Minister Silvio Berlusconi will break his silence.    Berlusconi is being cautious over the timetable and is  denying that there are obstacles concerning the possible make-up  of the government: "I believe that there will not be any  opposition." The government's program is "very advanced" and  will only be revealed when it will be presented to the Chamber  of Deputies. He also confirmed that there would be a meeting  this evening at 2100 hours between the heads of the parties in  the Freedom Alliance. Umberto Bossi will also be present at the  meeting.</p>

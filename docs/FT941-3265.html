			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Italian insider trading case Italy's first insider trading case is set to start today when Mr Luigi Busiello, a financial products sales manager, goes on trial in Rome. The case has been brought under a law implemented three years ago. Mr Busiello, an employee of the Fideuram sales network controlled by IMI, is alleged to have traded in the shares of Banca Manusardi in 1991 in the knowledge that Fideuram and Banca Manusardi were shortly to merge. He is alleged to have invested about L170m (Pounds 68,880) and made a profit of a few million lire. Mr Busiello faces a maximum penalty of a year's imprisonment and a L300m fine which could be tripled at the judge's discretion. The Consob stock market watchdog, which sees the insider trading law as part of reforms to increase investor confidence, has also pursued investigations against a second defendant who goes on trial in Milan in April.</p>

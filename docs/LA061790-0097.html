			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A MOTTO FOR COUNTY  </P> <P> Orange County's motto: As long as I have mine, to hell with everyone else!  </P> <P> I guess it should come as no surprise that, once again, Orange County, the  bastion of conservatism, greed and self-indulgence, goes against the homeless  bond (Proposition 107) and two education bonds -- school districts (Proposition  121) and higher education (Proposition 123) -- while the rest of the state  voters approved them.  </P> <P> PAMELA D. SMITH  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Estate crowns a difficult year - The Crown Estate combines age old tradition with effective portfolio management Britain's most powerful and idiosyncratic landowner published its figures this week for the year to March, the annus horribilis of the property industry. The Crown Estate, which includes Regent Street, large parts of St James's, both in London, and half the foreshore of the UK, saw its capital value fall by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.77bn, following a 12.8 per cent fall the previous year. Its revenue surplus, by contrast, powered ahead with a 12.2 per cent rise to Pounds 71.7m. It was a respectable performance, given that nearly half the Crown Estate's property is in the hard-hit markets of the City and the west end of London. Revenue increase was greater than for most other property owners, although the estate warned that growth this year would not be substantial. Damage to the Crown Estate's balance-sheet was limited by the absence of borrowings and a sagacious decision to stop developments in 1989 when the property recession started to loom on the horizon. Yet a more important factor behind the Crown Estate's resilient performance is the energy and commitment of its managers. That, at any rate, is the opinion of Mr Christopher Howes, the Second Commissioner (chief executive), who thinks the organisation is incorrectly perceived as sleepy and bureaucratic. 'When people talk about the Crown Estate being on the edge of the public sector, they imagine it works from 9am to 4.30pm. Nothing could be further from the truth,' he says. But for all the Crown Estate's apparent competence and efficiency, its image remains tainted by its anomalous constitutional position and the historic origins of its portfolio. Much of the portfolio dates back to before the days of William the Conqueror, more than 900 years ago. At that time, the estate encompassed about a third of the country, most of which has since been sold or given away. The Crown Estate is neither the property of the government nor the private property of the reigning monarch. Since the time of King George III, the estate's profits have been surrendered to parliament in return for the civil list (a form of salary for the royal family). The board of commissioners, the Crown Estate's ruling body, is appointed by the sovereign but is answerable to the chancellor of the exchequer. This curious combination of public accountability and centuries old tradition lends an unusual character to the workings of the Crown Estate. Its annual report would resemble that of any property company were it not for a declaration at the beginning: 'To the Queen's most excellent majesty may it please your majesty . . . ' Occasionally, ancient rights and obligations have a faintly anachronistic ring about them. Recently, for instance, the Crown Estate objected when the franchise for the ferry service between Tilbury and Gravesend in south-east London was transferred without its permission, because it was a breach of the sovereign's 'ancient rights to run a ferry' which dates back to the time when there was a fort at Tilbury. Likewise, in May, the Crown lost a legal wrangle that had been started by James I against the City of London Corporation, over land at Smithfield market in London. The case rested on the transfer of land to the City under a charter granted by Henry VI in 1444. Some aspects of the Crown Estate's privileged position are coming under scrutiny. The government is shortly to issue a consultation paper that will make all Crown organisations subject to the same statutory planning powers as other developers and landowners. Since the estate has voluntarily subjected itself to the planning process since the 1970s, this move is welcomed by the commissioners. A measure that is viewed with less equanimity by the Crown Estate is the government's proposals to enfranchise leaseholders. Allowing leaseholders to buy their freehold would mean the break-up of the Crown Estate's residential holdings, including the elegant Nash terraces of Regent's Park. 'The government's proposals regarding enfranchisement may seriously erode our objective to preserve the unique architectural heritage of the Crown Estate for future generations,' says the Earl of Mansfield, the First Crown Estate commissioner (chairman of the board). It is still unclear, however, whether the Crown Estate would be asked to comply with the new legislation. When similar measures affecting relatively inexpensive houses were introduced in 1967, the Crown Estate was exempt. It hopes for a similar outcome this time round. 'We shall make the appropriate representations at the proper time,' says the Earl of Mansfield. The Crown Estate's exemption from leasehold enfranchisement would irritate many of its tenants, who are often critical of their landlord. The heavy obligations to maintain the appearance of the stuccoed facades of the Regent's Park estate and the sharp increases in rents when leases are renewed is a source of continued complaint. The high degree of public interest in the Crown Estate means that any disagreement with tenants is likely to attract media attention. But the commissioners are adamant that they cannot be seen as a soft touch, as this would be unfair to other tenants. Mr Howes sees the task of the Crown Estate as a fine balancing act between extracting the best possible returns from the property and pursuing broader objectives. 'We can be tough negotiators and managers of buildings. We are entrusted to manage something that is rather precious,' he says. For example, the Crown Estate has long contained an element of low-cost housing in London. And in March it issued a statement about its environmental objectives called 'Stewardship in Action', designed to 'balance environmental, commercial and social needs in the management of the estate'. At the same time, the Crown Estate's financial practices have been receiving increased attention. Traditionally, the organisation has been difficult to pin down about its financial performance and, in particular, the value of its estates. For years, it argued that valuations were inappropriate and unnecessary for a portfolio which included properties such as Windsor Great Park. That policy changed in 1987, the first year the Crown Estate published a valuation of its assets. Since then, its financial performance has come under even tighter scrutiny, partly as a result of pressure from the National Audit Office (NAO), a watchdog which examines the financial performance of public bodies. In 1988 the NAO concluded that the absence of financial targets was the chief weakness in the Crown Estate's attempt to bring its financial management up to date. Now, Mr Howes jokes, the estate is monitored most closely than a cardiologist's examination room. This year, the organisation's performance against targets of the portfolio's value has been disappointing. However, this may partly be the fault of the target-setters, who made their forecasts a year ago when few chartered surveyors expected the depression in the market to be as severe as it has been. The portfolio's performance is not helped by some underlet business parks in St Albans and Cambridge. And a shopping centre in Worcester, jointly developed by the Crown Estate and which opens in the autumn, is an embarrassment because the co-developer, Ford Sellar Morris, went into receivership in the summer of 1991. But, compared to most institutions and property companies, the Crown Estate has enviably few problematic developments. That is helping the estate to come through this property recession in better shape than many of its less idiosyncratic rivals.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                        CAPITAL GROWTH (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                     Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties Year to May 92       -0.6    -13.3       -1.4           -5.7 Quarter to May 92    -0.1     -3.4       -1.6           -1.6 Month of May 92       0.0     -0.8       -0.6           -0.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to survive the recovery - In A Nutshell When the economy starts to recover from the recession, businesses may find themselves overtaken by decisions which appeared to make sense at the bottom of the downturn but which may lead to difficulties in the longer term. Marketing budgets may have been cut or investments neglected because of pressure on finance. Recession and Recovery: How Businesses Can Prosper provides an overview of six key areas which businesses need to consider if they are to survive in the longer term. The booklet, produced by Alex Lawrie, a factoring company, and the Henley Centre, a forecasting consultancy, covers sales and marketing, cash controls, raising finance, distribution, time management and planning. It is aimed at companies with turnover of Pounds 100,000 or more. *From Alex Lawrie, Marketing Department, Beaumont House, Beaumont Road, Banbury, Oxfordshire OX16 7RN. Tel 0295 272272. 46 pages.

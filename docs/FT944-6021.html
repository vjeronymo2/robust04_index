			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Gephardt re-elected as leader Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they are now the minority party, yesterday re-elected Mr Richard Gephardt as their leader, AP reports from Washington. Brushing aside conservative pressure for a shake-up after the Democrats' defeat in the mid-term elections, Mr Gephardt beat Mr Charlie Rose of North Carolina, by 150 votes to 58, to keep the post he has held since 1989. The outcome ensures that he remains leader for the next two years.</p>

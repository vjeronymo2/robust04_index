			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: CU makes Pounds 211m in a recovering market Commercial Union, the largest of the UK's composite insurers, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 211m for 1993 - underlining the recovery in the general insurance market. The figures, which compared with a profit of Pounds 24m in 1992, were at the top end of analysts' expectations. Earnings improved to 55.9p (46.8p) and a final dividend of 9.75p makes a 24.85p (24.35p) total on increased capital. Like Guardian Royal Exchange, which reported on Tuesday, CU benefited especially from an improvement in trading conditions in the UK, where underwriting losses fell to Pounds 57m (Pounds 162m) over the year and an underwriting profit of Pounds 3m was achieved in the last quarter of the year. Mr Peter Foster, general manager finance, said the improvement was 'substantially' due to rate increases, premiums having risen by an average of 10 per cent on commercial property and 15 per cent on liability and commercial motor business. London market marine business had been underwritten at rates between 15 per cent and 25 per cent higher than in 1992 and rates for domestic business, mainly house buildings and contents, were described as firm. CU confirmed, however, that there has been some 'softening' of rates in the motor insurance market. The company had not cut its own rates but acknowledged that it had lost market share, shedding between three and four per cent of its 614,000 policyholders over the year. In the fourth quarter motor insurance premium income was 18 per cent down on the same period of 1992, indicating that many of these customers were lost towards the end of the year. Mr John Carter, chief executive, cautioned that changes in the way insurers were assessing motor insurance risks made any assessment of overall rate movements more difficult. 'Some rates will go down and others up,' he said. The group also benefited from a low level of weather and subsidence claims, as well as a reduction in its overheads, following heavy cost-cutting since 1990. Expenses in the UK now amount to only 8.4 per cent of premium income, compared to about 15 per cent in 1990. Overall premium income during 1993 increased from Pounds 5.57bn to Pounds 5.97bn. Life income fell to Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 2bn), while general insurance income rose to Pounds 4.07bn (Pounds 3.57bn), with 7 per cent of the rise due to rate increases and a further 3 per cent attributable to increased volume. Investment income rose to Pounds 363m (Pounds 325m) and underwriting losses fell to Pounds 277m (Pounds 431m). Associated undertakings' earnings were Pounds 13m (Pounds 19m). Non-life operating profits amounted to Pounds 99m (loss of Pounds 87m) and life profits were Pounds 119m (Pounds 118m). Pounds 7m was lost after CU closed its Argentine subsidiary. See Lex</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Concern about oversupply, the recent declines in global bond markets and fiscal year-end inactivity are likely to weigh on the Japanese government bond market. The government is expected to auction long-term bonds this week while domestic corporate bond issues are likely to add to worries over supply. But activity is expected to remain low ahead of the March book-closing since most investors have locked in profits and few are willing to take new positions. The Bank of Japan, concerned at the overall rise in interest rates, is likely to maintain an easy stance in its money market operations. Demand from banks ahead of the year-end has pushed up three-month certificate of deposit rates. In addition, the long-term credit banks are poised to raise their prime lending rates - rates on loans to first tier customers. The central bank is worried over the effects of higher interest rates on a still sluggish economy, which will be highlighted in the Tankan, the BoJ's quarterly survey on business sentiment, to be announced on Tuesday. Barclays de Zoete Wedd expects the Tankan to show a further deterioration in confidence but this should be limited because the survey was taken before the breakdown of US-Japan trade talks and the rise in the yen.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: A dangerous line of argument when assessing the seriousness of fraud Sir, In your leader concerning the outcome of the Blue Arrow Affair ('From fraud to farce', July 18), you comment that 'the more important question is whether crimes in which there are no immediate victims with quantifiable losses merit a jail sentence at all'. Without commenting on any particular case, I would argue that your line of thought is exceptionally dangerous. You seem to suggest that the seriousness of a crime, or indeed its existence, depends on whether or not there are 'immediate victims'. But if certain operations in the market mis-price capital then there are certainly victims: many thousands of shareholders and, in sum, society as a whole. Although these victims are not 'immediate', the amounts of money are enormous - far more than is lost if a fund management operation runs off with the savings of a relatively restricted number of retired people, even though the plight of these people is obvious and attracts sympathy. Many more such people, and others, will be harmed if the country is poorer through the misuse of capital, whether through the misallocation of resources through mis-pricing or even if a takeover battle is won by the wrong party, when industrial activity will be seriously distorted.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dietmar Seher report: "Austerity Measures for the </F> Military"]    [Text] Bonn -- After the privatization of the Postal  Administration and the Railroads, the Bundeswehr, the largest  state enterprise, is still left. Numerous employees will have  to be laid off in the next few years, and several institutions  will have to be closed down. Resistance has developed to these  plans.    In the middle of an election year, the defense experts of  the  Bundestag will have to deal with a explosive document. After  internal talks among the Bundeswehr leadership, budget and  defense experts of the parliament in Bonn are to discuss the  document before the elections in October. The report by  Luftwaffe General Lorenz Huber might become the basis for a  major austerity offensive within the Bundeswehr.    It is becoming clear that the soldiers might not be the  "main  victims." The analysis that the representative for  rationalization measures, drafted together with economic  advisers, will hurt the army of civilian employees. The 370,000  soldiers are currently being supported by 151,000 civilians.  Moreover, it is still unclear whether the 660 Bundeswehr  barracks can be maintained.    Huber's assumption is as follows: Administration is  inefficient and highly unproductive in large parts of the armed  forces. Thus, repairs are being carried out with too many  personnel.    The comprehensive report mentions several critical  areas:     -  Stocks are too large: The arsenals of the  Bundeswehr are worth 55 billion German marks [DM], with  ammunition alone involving DM16.5 billion. A total of 70  percent was not requested in the last two years.    -  Expenditure is  too high: In 1983 operating costs alone amounted to 77 percent  of the defense budget. They could be reduced by 10  percent.    -  There is too much unproductive employment: A total of  130,000 people, including 35,000 civilians, are responsible for  supply and service support.    It is becoming clear that deep cuts could be carried out in  the arsenals of the navy. The auditors believe that the  workshops could do their jobs with 35 percent fewer people, thus  saving DM850 million by 2002. In the army, 4,000 jobs might be  reduced if no new jobs are created for those in repair units.  In the hangers of the air force [as published] and its stores,  60 percent of the 3,000 employees would be superfluous if  industrial yardsticks were applied, the working groups called  Combat Team Huber at the Bundeswehr found out.    A comparison between an air force hanger and Dasa reveals  the  following: The enterprise that belongs to the Daimler concern  works with 50-percent higher productivity and at costs that are  30 percent lower.    One of the major reasons for this deplorable state of  affairs  is that there are too many levels -- up to 10 -- of  responsibility.    The working group has not issued any specific  recommendations  for the reduction of jobs, which is very difficult to carry out  anyway: Many civilian positions are held by employees with  tenure. Moreover, there are firm plans to reduce civilian jobs  from 19,000 to 13,000.    Yet there is always room for more cutbacks: Expenditure on  education measures (involving over DM2 billion) could be reduced  considerably if civilian training institutions were also used.    As in every civilian enterprise examined by auditors, the  middle management of the Bundeswehr rejected Huber's proposals  for cutbacks. Annoyed about reductions concerning other items  in the defense budget, some generals have refused to cooperate.  Huber signed the report, handed it over formally, and then  asked to resign. He claimed he was not receiving sufficient  support. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe was not exactly happy.  Huber is to receive a practice-oriented job -- as the head of  the Procurement Office of the Luftwaffe.</p>

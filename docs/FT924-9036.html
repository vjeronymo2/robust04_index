			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever Having side-stepped the cycle for so long it was about time Unilever felt the impact of recession. Yesterday's third-quarter figures are solid enough, but there is clear pressure on margins in US consumer products and the outlook in Europe is far from encouraging, especially for industrial chemicals. The benefits of restructuring in European foods will start to flow through next year, but by then Unilever could be running to stand still. Selling detergent in Argentina and ice-cream in Thailand, though, remain growth businesses. Double-digit sales growth in 10 countries outside Europe and the US prevented an ordinary set of results from looking distinctly gloomy. The growth prospects in Asia and Latin America may be enough to keep Unilever busy for the time being, but history and the rude good health of the balance sheet point to activity closer to home. Buying Chesebrough-Pond's in 1986 and Faberge and Elizabeth Arden in 1989 helped Unilever outperform the market, even when earnings growth in other sectors was strong. With little more than Pounds 1bn net debt and strong cash flow, there is certainly scope to add to the formidable portfolio of consumer brands. A stronger dollar may act as a brake on the shares, since US shareholders could well see pedestrian earnings growth next year whatever Unilever's operating performance. Even so, with immense resources and exposure to fast-growing economies, it would be a brave bet on Unilever underperforming the market despite yesterday's 3 per cent fall.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan representative  offices in Italy and Sweden have changed their names recently to  better reflect their functions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  said.    Ministry officials said that the representative office in  Sweden changed its name from the Taipei trade, tourism and  information office to the Taipei mission in Sweden, while the  Taipei Cultural and Economic Institute in Italy was renamed the  Taipei Economic and Cultural Office.    The officials said that the renaming of the two  representative offices is a sign that Taiwan's political and  economic relations with the two nations have become closer.    They said that relations with European nations have been  improving steadily, noting that Sweden began to issue visas in  Taiwan last year, becoming the first European nation to do so.    The renaming of the Italian office also showed that Italy  has  begun to attach greater importance to its ties with Taiwan, they  said.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Clouded horizons for upset German bourse - A look at Frankfurt's fall from grace Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, pulled the rug on the German stock market last Monday. It was the H-word that did it. Speaking in Helsinki, while his domestic traders were enjoying the Pentecostal holiday, Mr Tietmeyer proclaimed that as far as central bank interest rates were concerned, the 'horizon is now clear for some time'. Although some saw this as a roundabout way of saying that the Bundesbank could see no obstacles in the way of continued discount rate cuts, a consensus rapidly emerged that Mr Tietmeyer meant that he could see no reason to put the bank's short-term rates back in the salami slicer for a little while yet. Although there was little pressure from sellers or buyers, Frankfurt's Dax index of 30 leading shares was left with nothing to stand on and slid rapidly downwards. Within the next three days, helped along by darkling hints of lurking inflation from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank council member, the Dax lost around 120 points. Yesterday, an early upturn was not sustained and when the Ibis-indicated Dax closed at 2,112.80 in the post bourse it was down around 6 per cent on the week. An enduring recovery may take some time to emerge, and will once again depend on the development of interest rate prospects. The improved outlook for industrial profits this year has long been included in most German stock prices. Meanwhile, according to a pessimistic analysts' report from the Bayerische Vereinsbank, the Dax is more likely to dip further towards the 2,000 mark within the next two months than shift up towards the key 2,300 level it strove and failed to attain in rises which were sparked solely by the April and May discount rate cuts. There appear to be few reasons why the Bundesbank should consider further short-term rate cuts for several months. Although the bank insists that its business is monetary - not economic - policy, the softly-softly decline in rates which began late in 1992 has clearly helped economic recovery in recent months. The upswing is under way, as shown by strongly rising export demand and clear signs of improvements at home. It appears to have enough momentum without the need for a further push from the Bundesbank, which in any case will want to avoid any risk of over-heating. After three cuts in short order, which have brought the discount rate down to 4.5 per cent - the lowest level since mid-1988 - the bank needs to be careful to avoid giving the impression that the economy's troubles are over, and raising inflationary expectations in a workforce earning sharply reduced real incomes. Public spending has also still to be brought under control in a process likely to last far beyond the official end of recession. Although experience shows that no assumptions are safe in regard to the Bundesbank's tactics, it appears Mr Tietmeyer and his men have allowed themselves three to four months in which to come to grips with their most pressing concern - money supply. The bank's key indicator for monetary policy, and its most trusted guide to inflationary potential, the M3 measure, has been running wild for four months. At the last count, M3 was growing at 15.8 per cent annualised compared with the bank's top target of 6 per cent for this year. By senior officials' own admissions, it has also become opaque. The figure has been distorted by a hefty overhang from the last quarter of 1993. The impact of the much-discussed special factors (the unhappy side-effects of tax measures introduced by the government) has been considerable, but apparently impossible to define. And as was suggested this week, the persistently high borrowing demands of government and quasi-state institutions such as Telekom, the railways system and the Treuhand privatisation agency, plus the private sector, may well prove to contain the seeds of future inflation. As the bank explained at the time, the most recent cut in the discount rate was intended to adjust the interest rates structure. The idea was to encourage investors rattled by uncertainty on rates to move funds currently parked in short-term deposits, which fall within the definition of M3, into longer-term instruments, which do not. Although this process of so-called monetary capital formation appeared to accelerate in April, several observers have been quick to claim that it is now too late for M3 even to approach the central bank's 4-6 per cent target range this year. They argue that if that turns out to be the case, the Bundesbank will have lost the 'gamble' it took by cutting rates three times this year while M3 was clouded in so much uncertainty. That loss could cause serious damage to the credibility which the bank sees as its most valuable asset. On the other hand the bank would hardly have won praise if it had left rates unchanged, and there is a certain measure of Schadenfreude detectable in some of the attacks. But the fact that the bank should have lost sight, arguably through no fault of its own, of the true amount of liquidity or readily-available funds sloshing around in the system at such a delicate time suggests that the M3 formula at least requires tuning.</p>

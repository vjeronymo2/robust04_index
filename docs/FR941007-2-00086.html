The proposed project could affect public and private lands in El Paso County in western Texas, and Do&ntilde;a Ana County in southwestern New Mexico. BLM's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viable alternatives; and (3) Notifying interested groups, individuals and agencies so that additional information concerning these issues can be obtained. The scoping process will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS process; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies the proposed action, alternatives and significant issues being considered to be distributed to selected parties and available upon request. In this notice, the BLM announces public scoping meetings for the proposed project. Maps and other information will be available at these meetings and the public will have the opportunity to ask questions regarding the proposed project. The public scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,xs100,r100 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Date/time  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Location <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Oct. 26, 1994, 7:00 PM  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Gadsden High School, 6301 Highway 28 &amp; West Washington, Anthony, New Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oct. 27, 1994, 7:00 PM  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Border Patrol Museum, Memorial Library,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4315 Trans Mountain Road, El Paso, Texas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments on the scope of the EIS for the proposed Newman to Port-of-Entry should be received no later than November 7, 1994.

As a result of this study, approximately 100 miles of alternative corridors were identified as being environmentally and technically satisfactory for transmission line development. Potential issues include, but may not be limited to, residential and agricultural impacts, sensitive wildlife and plant species, historical or traditional cultural properties, visual impacts, and electric and magnetic effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lands crossed by the alternative study corridors include those under the jurisdiction of the BLM, Fort Bliss Military Reservation, State of New Mexico, and the counties of El Paso (Texas) and Do&ntilde;a Ana (New Mexico).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of El Paso Electric's 10-year plan, the proposed project is intended to improve the reliability of the electrical system. Construction of the proposed transmission line is anticipated to begin in January 1998 and be in operation by June 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objectives of the EIS and related activities will be to study and assess the potential impacts of the proposed project to various environmental resources including biological (e.g., threatened or endangered species), cultural, land use, visual, socioeconomic, geology, soils, and surface water. Alternatives that will be considered in the EIS include routing/siting locations, no action, and others that are identified through the scoping process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the project study area includes the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, the BLM has invited the Department of Defense (Fort Bliss) to be a cooperating agency. A memorandum of agreement is anticipated between El Paso Electric, BLM, and Department of the Army (Fort Bliss).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that the EIS process will take 18 months and will include public information/scoping meetings; coordination and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involvement with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies; public review and public hearings on the published draft EIS; a published final EIS and a review period; and publication of a record of decision (ROD). Public information and scoping meetings will begin in October 1994. Publication of the ROD is anticipated in April 1996. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linda S.C.

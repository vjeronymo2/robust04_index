			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [T.T. Oudejans report: "Netherlands Adopts Wait-And-See </F> Attitude Toward Mexico"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Netherlands companies are also  showing increasing interest in Mexico, it emerged last week  during the three-day working visit to Mexico by Economics  Minister J.E. Andriessen. "We see Mexico as a country in the  process of stabilization which offers ever greater growth  potential," the minister said there.    The ministry likes to visit Mexico, although the country is  number 40 in the list of the Netherlands's trading partners.  Andriessen's previous visit was in November 1991, while his  secretary of state, Yvonne van Rooy, led a trade mission to  Mexico only a year ago.    In his meetings last week with President Salinas and other  key figures in various ministries and large Mexican companies,  the minister had a long shopping list with him. To mention a  few things: Martinair wants to acquire landing rights, while  Van Ommeren has shown an interest in providing container  processing in the Mexican harbors which are to be privatized  this year.    Aircraft manufacturer Fokker is positive about potential  sales to Mexican airlines, but sees problems in financing  possible orders. Schiphol is involved in the plans to expand the  international airport in Mexico City, while there are also plans  to build a new airport just outside the city.    In turn, the Netherlands Government wants to provide  assistance in developing the harbor in the coastal town of  Veracruz. Cooperation on the governmental level is also being  sought in the field of medical technology and, in the spring, a  return visit by a delegation from the Mexican Energy Ministry is  expected to examine how coal gasification is conducted in the  Netherlands.    There are opportunities to spare, above all in the  infrastructure where large investments are expected in the  coming years in NAFTA's wake. Various Netherlands engineering  consulting firms have already become involved in this sector.  In addition Andriessen thinks there are opportunities for  Mexican industry to set up a European distribution center in the  Netherlands. [passage omitted]</p>

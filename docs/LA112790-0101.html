			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRANSIT PLANNER TO HEAD NEW RAIL OFFICE  </P> <P> Orange County transportation officials on Monday established a new rail program  office, to be headed by veteran transit planner Brian Pearson.  </P> <P> The action came during a joint meeting of the Orange County Transit District  board and the Orange County Transportation Commission, which are in the process  of merging into one super agency.  </P> <P> Pearson, 51, of Laguna Hills, is the transit district's director of  development. He has supervised OCTD's plans for special, elevated ramps  reserved for buses and car-pools that will soar over congested freeway  interchanges.  </P> <P> Pearson, who will report to Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the  transportation commission, will help develop plans for a 23-mile light-rail  system that possibly will serve six cities between Irvine and Fullerton.  </P> <P> The transit district, however, will continue to pay Pearson his $80,000 annual  salary.  </P> <P> The planned light-rail system, dubbed the "Orange Line" by OCTC Chairman Dana  W. Reed on Monday, may use monorail vehicles, although no specific technology  has been selected yet.  </P> <P> "Please think big," Reed admonished Pearson during Monday's joint meeting.  "It's not enough to get from Santa Ana to Irvine . . . but from Santa Monica to  Irvine."  </P> <P> Reed said he was referring to plans to link Orange County light-rail projects  with those in neighboring counties.  </P> <P> In addition to the urban "core" system currently being studied, officials  agreed Monday to pursue purchase of a 5-mile stretch of old Pacific Electric  "Red Car" right of way and an adjacent, 3.8-acre site for a passenger depot  between Beach Boulevard in Stanton and the Los Angeles County border. The  purchase is expected to cost $13.9 million, with the money expected to come  from Measure M, the half-cent county sales tax hike approved by voters on Nov.  6. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN  </P></p>

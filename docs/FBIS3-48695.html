While receiving a major  shock, the LDP is desperately attempting to keep the changes to  a minimum. Meanwhile, the coalition government parties are  poised to attack the LDP en masse regarding the funds aspect,  and an uproar is spreading throughout Nagata-cho.    On 2 September [1993] following a conference of the  Keidanren  chairman and vice chairmen, Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa stated at a  press conference, "There was a strong view that corporate  donations per se are not bad. However, the political  circumstances have changed, and there is strong criticism by  public opinion. Therefore, the Keidanren has decided to halt  mediation to respond to the new era, and has set forth a  direction of abolishing corporate donations."    Also, General Secretary Miyoshi pointed out that "among the  12 vice chairmen, three opposed Mr. Hiraiwa's proposal  (abolition of mediation)."    However, the Miyoshi statement was a false statement, akin  to  an announcement by the Imperial Staff Headquarters [during World  War II]. One of those present says: "Three, including Vice  Chairman Katsuhiro Utada and Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi, were  in clear agreement with Mr. Hiraiwa, but nine either disagreed  or expressed caution. Mister Hiraiwa was apparently determined  to submit his resignation if his will was not accepted, and it  ended as a railroaded breakthrough. A decision despite  overwhelming opposition was unprecedented since Keidanren's  inception."    The Keidanren system of engaging in the accumulation of  funds  and distribution procedures--created after self-reflection over  the shipbuilding scandals and lasting for 40 years--has come to  an end. It is the result of Chairman Hiraiwa's judgment and  determination.    Even Hiraiwa himself was badly shaken. On 18 June [1993] at  a  press conference immediately after the dissolution, he stated as  follows. "The LDP has splintered. However, we will continue our  supportive posture regarding funds for the LDP. We are not  considering the New Party for the time being."    The financial circles responded with strong opposition. The  political donations had been the realm of the Keidanren's  exclusive authority, and the other economic organizations  normally had no say in the matter, but the leaders are  overpowered by the underlings in a turbulent era. Chairman Ken  Nagano of the Nikkeiren [Japan Federationof Employers'  Associations] said: "Political donations should be distributed  to the conservative parties commensurate with their respective  numbers of Diet seats."    Furthermore, the following views continue to surface. "The  Keidanren acts smart by doling out the money. Our views should  be included concerning money allocation." "Donations should not  be limited to the LDP, and neutrality should be observed.  Corporate donations should eventually be abolished with  political reform, and should be replaced by public assistance  and individual donations."    A contrasting view is offered as follows. "Chairman Nagano  of  the Nikkeiren and representative manager Hayami of Keizai  Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] have a  common awareness of having cooperated with the coalition  government. Consequently, they criticize the LDP severely."    Moreover, general trading companies like Marubeni-Iida and  Sumitomo Corporation have proposed "freezing political  donations," while the Department Stores Association has also  decided to abolish donations. Chairman Hiraiwa anguished during  the concentrated barrage of criticism from the leaders of the  various organizations, and his posture changed on 1 August as  follows. "We might as well take the lead in political reform.  The Keidanren would like to stop distributing political  donations."    Also, when an opinion was expressed at a conference of four  organizations, including the Keidanren and the Nikkeiren, that  "distributions should be made according to the number of Diet  seats including other parties besides the LDP on a sliding  scale," Chairman Hiraiwa stated: "We will not stoop to such a  stupid act as if we were distributing baked dumplings."    The Keidanren thus decided to completely abolish  fund-raising  duties.  <H5>  Doko-Kikawada-Hiraiwa Geneology </H5>   This is not the first time that the Keidanren quit  collecting  funds. In 1974 Chairman Toshio Doko called (the then) managing  director, Jinpachiro Hanamura, and told him: "The Keidanren will  withdraw from handling political contributions. We cannot permit  any further mediation." Hanamura resisted vehemently, and Shigeo  Nagano called Doko a fool, which threw the financial circles  into an uproar. At the time, it was the Tokyo Electric Power  chairman, Kazutaka Kikawada (Keizai Doyukai representative  manager), who fully backed Doko.    It was an era of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's theory on  the  reconstruction of the Japanese Islands and runaway commodity  prices. There was a movement against payment of power rates,  and Fusae Ichikawa (Dietwoman) contended: "The power companies  are making political contributions on the one hand and raising  electric fees on the other. We cannot permit this."    This contention hit a sore point of the power companies, and  Kikawada conceded by declaring: "In the future, the Tokyo  Electric Power Co. will stop political donations completely."    The Kyushu Electric Power Co. followed suit, and the  electric  power industry has subsequently refrained from contributions  under the Keidanren system. The Keidanren statement that  "although the LDP may be demolished, we cannot destroy Tokyo  Electric Power for the sake of the people's livelihood" remains  effective.    Hiraiwa was Kikawada's favorite disciple and executive  director in charge of general affairs at the time.    Why did Doko decide to abolish fund-raising activities?  During the 1953 shipbuilding scandals, Doko who was president of  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries gave a donation to  Secretary General Eisaku Sato through President Kensuke Matano  of the Iino Kaiun Kaisha in order to receive loans from the  Japan Export-Import Bank and the Japan Development Bank. Doko  was also arrested due to President Matano's confession and was  jailed for about 20 days. Although he was released without an  indictment, Doko reportedly achieved the following conviction  because of this experience. "I will absolutely not associate  with politicians in the future. Political donations are evil."    In the summer of 1974 upper house elections, Prime Minister  Tanaka, feared a reversal of power between the conservatives and  reformists, and he demanded 20 billion yen in contributions from  the financial circles. At the time, the annual donations  amounted to about 5 billion yen, so the financial circles were  petrified by the demand. "This is terrible. Political donations  have been raised by one digit."    Chairman Doko, the "rough priest," reacted strongly against  the money-power politics with a halt to fund-raising that lasted  for about a year. This became a factor for the collapse of the  Tanaka cabinet.  <H5>  Close Relationship Between Hiraiwa and Ozawa </H5>   Keidanren Chairman Hiraiwa thus follows the personnel link  between Doko and Kikawada, and he inherits their temperament  considerably.    Takeshi Sakurada, president of Nisshinbo Industries and  formerly one of the "Big Four" in the financial circles, once  evaluated Kikawada as follows. "A president who is unable to  decide the prices of products made at his own company is not a  manager."    Power rates are decided by MITI [Ministry of International  Tradeand Industry]. The criticism meant that such a company  president could not be recognized as a manager. Hiraiwa  inherited Tokyo Electric Power from Kikawada and, in Sakurada's  words, is not a manager, but still serves as Keidanren chairman.  An elder of the financial circles says: "Both Kikawada and  Hiraiwa stand outside the economic movements and their thinking  is mainly theoretical or conceptual."    Hiraiwa has served as chairman of Ichiro Ozawa's support  association for many years and is reported to be closely  associated with him.    A reporter, who covers the financial world, says: "Hiraiwa  believes in Ozawa. Although he questions Ozawa's political  methods, I have heard him highly evaluate Ozawa's great ability  to formulate ideas, his decisiveness, and his power of  execution." Hiraiwa also states: "The LDP splintering is a  history inevitability. They must converge into two major  parties."    It sounds like he is parroting Ozawa's theory. During the  general election four years earlier, Ozawa as the LDP secretary  general demanded and forcibly received 30 billion yen from the  financial circles. The financial reporter continues: "At the  time, the Keidanren distributed 12-13 billion yen annually.  Ozawa considered that as insufficient. He negotiated directly  with the four major industries of autos, electrical machinery  and electronics, finance, and construction for quota donations  and secured their promises. Chairman Eishiro Saito went over his  head to protest, but was rejected." It was probably possible  because it was during the bubble when the economy was  smooth-sailing.    An LDP executive complains: "About 4.5 billion yen remains  unpaid from the loans received from the city banks with special  donations as the collateral at the time. Ozawa and his followers  left the party, and only the debts remain. It was horrific,  given his repayment plan on the scale of 280 member in the Lower  House."    An expert on the financial world says: "Hiraiwa and Ozawa  frequently got together. Ozawa told Hiraiwa that he wanted a  halt to donations made solely to the LDP, and to stop  contributions if they cannot also be made to the other parties.  Hiraiwa had apparently heard about the 60 billion yen in public  subsidies from Ozawa quite early beforehand."    In mid-September, Hiraiwa spoke to his close associates as  follows. "In view of the fierce upheaval in politics, the  political donations system cannot continue to operate in the  1955 form. While I am chairman, I will not commit myself to such  a shameful act as resuming the handling of donations."    Until now, while the Keidanren was in charge of fund  allocations, sufficient funds were accumulated despite lower  yields due to the recession. An LDP member in charge of finance  says: "Last year, there was 25.5 billion yen in revenues. 12  billion yen was received from the Keidanren via the People's  Political Association. Party costs totaled 5.7 billion yen,  party supporter costs added up to 2 billion yen, and business  revenues from newspapers and ads totaled 4 billion yen. 16  billion yen was requested from the Keidanren, but real revenues  came to 12 billion yen because of the recession.    What will happen next year when the Keidanren's mediation  will no longer be available? A veteran reporter observes, "Even  if the Keidanren stops mediation, General Secretary Mori  estimates that 70-80 percent of past revenues can be secured  through organizations and companies. However, there is the  recession on the one hand and the stockholders' representative  litigation system on the other. The regional financial circles  will probably begrudge donations when even the Keidanren has  quit mediation. The LDP will be decisively damaged. Its  fund-raising ability will probably be halved, or even drop to  one-third."    The veteran reporter adds: "The LDP was badly shaken because  Hiraiwa was drawn into the Ozawa strategy. The fact that Hiraiwa  was appointed chairman of the prime minister's advisory organ to  write a new Maekawa report may be seen as an honorary reward."  <H5>  Direction Toward Abolition of Corporate Contributions </H5>   The first step toward abolition of corporate donations is  included in the coalition government's political reform bill  submitted to the National Diet. It is labeled "the abolition of  corporate donations to individual politicians."    Hajime Ishii, an executive of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party) and chairman of the lower house political reform special  committee, points out as follows. "If corporate donations to  individuals disappear, the politician has no recourse than to  receive funds from his party. If he thinks about secret money,  the strict implication system will preclude that. Is awareness  of this not lenient toward the LDP? The structure of political  funds will change fundamentally. Yet, they talk about public  subsidies of 30 billion yen, hoping it to be accepted by public  opinion. They should agree to the government proposal of 41.4  billion yen."    Representative Manager Hiroyuki Sonoda of Sakigake  [Harbinger] says, "Sakigake has contended that corporate  donations to individuals should be recognized. Of course, it  should be limited to 10,000 yen monthly. However, because the  stipulation to `move toward abolition of corporate donations'  was used as a loyalty test when forming the coalition  government, we have decided on abolition."    What happened to the tax exemption advocated by  Representative Masayoshi Takemura (chief cabinet secretary) of  Sakigake? Takemure stated at the time as follows. "It is  advisable to recognize a donation to the specific party of one's  desire with a limit of 1 percent of the submitted tax amount."    Such a system is practiced in the United States, but the  Ministry of Finance did not even consider it. The next proposal  submitted was "to exempt 100 percent of the tax amount as an  inducement toward individual contributions. "By giving political  donations, taxes would be fully exempt and the individual tax  burden would be zero. The Finance Ministry showed indifference  toward this also. After a tug-of-war debate, the government  proposal resulted in a 30-percent exemption. The system  stipulates that "if an individual makes a political donation of  1 million yen, 300,000 yen will be returned."    Despite such attempts to increase individual contributions,  swift progress is inconceivable. Hiroyuki Sonoda's outlook is as  follows. "When the recession and public criticism of corporate  donations are considered, a rise in the weight of public  subsidies is inevitable."</p>

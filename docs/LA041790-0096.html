			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEADER NAMED TO FORM NEPAL GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> King Birendra gave in to opposition demands for democracy Monday by permitting  a newly legalized coalition to form a provisional government, which promptly  named its acting president as prime minister.  </P> <P> The opposition Nepali Congress party announced that Krishna Prasad Bhattarai,  its acting president, would head Nepal's first government in 30 years not set  up by the monarch.  </P> <P> Birendra, who promised reforms after two months of bloody pro-democracy  demonstrations, earlier Monday dissolved the National Assembly and dismissed  Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, although Birendra asked Chand to stay on  in a caretaker capacity.  </P> <P> The concessions followed the king's decision April 8 to lift the 29-year-old  ban on political parties in an effort to appease the pro-democracy movement,  which included violent clashes between protesters and police.  </P> <P> Birendra had proposed that the leader of the Nepali Congress party, Ganesh Man  Singh, 75, be the new prime minister but Singh declined on health grounds and  proposed Bhattarai's candidacy.  </P> <P> A statement released by the party said it and the Movement for the Restoration  of Democracy -- an alliance of seven Communist parties -- agreed on the  appointment of Bhattarai, 65, who had been Speaker of the Parliament when it  was dissolved three decades ago.  </P> <P> Bhattarai told reporters that he will present the names of the members of his  government to the king today.  </P> <P> He called his new job "a very, very challenging task for which I was not at all  mentally prepared. Still I am glad that my friends and comrades have reposed so  much . . . confidence in me for which I am thankful to them all."  </P> <P> Bhattarai said the new government's first priorities will be to improve the  economy and relations with India.  </P> <P> Bhattarai also said his government plans to compensate the families of those  killed by security forces during the seven-week democracy campaign and  reorganize the police force to limit its powers.  </P> <P> The new government will have the task of conducting elections under a  multi-party democracy.  </P></p>

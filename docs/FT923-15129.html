			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / US discount rate cut after sharp rise in jobless THE US Federal Reserve responded swiftly to fresh signs of economic weakness yesterday by cutting the discount rate by half a percentage point to 3 per cent, the lowest level since 1963. The move came shortly after the Commerce Department reported an unexpectedly sharp rise in the unemployment rate last month - from 7.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, the highest level since 1984. The rise in the jobless rate could be a severe political embarrassment for President George Bush, who welcomed the Fed's move but conceded that the recovery was not as robust as he had hoped. The Fed also signalled a half-point cut from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent in the overnight federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other. Leading commercial banks reacted by cutting their prime lending rates from 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent, the lowest level in nearly two decades. The prime rate influences the cost of a wide range of consumer and business loans. Bond prices surged on Wall Street. By early afternoon the 30-year long bond was up by 1 13/32 points, pushing the yield down to 7.626 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after rising sharply in previous days, retreated 23.81 to 3,330.29, reflecting dismay at the poor employment figures. The employment news initially pushed the dollar down by 2 pfennigs to a 16-month low of DM1.4995. It later recovered in European trading to close in London at DM1.5135 before slipping back in New York to DM1.5075. The Fed move followed intense lobbying by the White House, with both Mr Bush and Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, making public calls for lower interest rates. The timing of the rate cut - just ahead of next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Munich - was particularly convenient for the Bush administration, which intends to stress the importance of co-ordinated measures to stimulate global growth. The Fed move was part of a 'major commitment on the part of industrial countries towards growth', a senior US Treasury official said yesterday. The three biggest G7 nations have now signalled steps which they believe will promote non-inflationary growth in the world economy in the medium term. On Wednesday, the Bonn government announced a tough 1993 budget and four-year savings plan that is supposed to pave the way for lower German interest rates. Although the Bundesbank yesterday left its key interest rates unchanged, the German economy is due to receive a short-term DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) boost from the discontinuation this week of a special 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge levied for the past year to help finance the absorption of the new states of the former East Germany. In Japan, the ruling Liberal Democratic party has proposed a wide range of pump-priming measures, including a large-scale supplementary budget that would probably be introduced in September. LDP officials have suggested the package could be worth between Y6,000bn and Y10,000bn (Pounds 25bn-Pounds 42bn). Taken together, these moves represented a 'very substantial change' in the policymaking climate, the US Treasury official said. World leaders, he indicated, had begun to recognise that the main challenge was sustaining growth rather than fighting inflation. The Fed, however, justified the discount rate cut in purely domestic terms. It followed 'sustained weakness in credit and money growth, continued movement toward price stability and the uneven progress of the economic recovery'. The seven Fed governors voted unanimously for the cut, the first since December and the seventh since the recession began nearly two years ago. The employment numbers were bad enough to draw the sting from charges that Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, bowed to political pressure for lower interest rates. Financial markets had expected no change in the unemployment rate and a rise in non-farm employment. The actual figures were much worse. After months of gradual improvement, employment fell by 117,000, with sizeable falls in manufacturing, construction and the service sector. The unemployment rate - politically the most sensitive number - jumped to 7.8 per cent. The employment figures followed other poor economic indicators pointing to a slowdown in growth in recent months. Most forecasters believe the economy is still growing sluggishly but at a slower pace than the 2.7 per cent annual rate recorded in the first quarter.

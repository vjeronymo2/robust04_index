			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Greek-language Nicosia dailies on  Thursday, 10 March comment on UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's latest report on the progress of the proximity  talks on the confidence-building measures being held by Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special  representative in Nicosia.    Right-wing I MAKHI carries a 350-word editorial on page 16  entitled: "Unacceptable Document!" The paper says: "The UN  secretary general's latest report on the new phase of the Cyprus  issue has caused strong discontent in Nicosia." On the one  hand, in his report the secretary general tries to stress the  dangers and on the other hand, he tries to make the famous  confidence-building measures look better, by presenting them as  a panacea! The Butrus- Ghali report is not only reserved for  making the confidence-building measures look better. From any  other side, it is also disappointing and unacceptable for the  Greek Cypriot side because Butrus-Ghali himself abolishes the  four principles that he had set down in his previous report.  Now, he wants to present UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] as  supra-government and supra-authority, but at the same time he  demands that the Republic of Cyprus cede some of its powers and  authority.    And not only this! He also demands that the legal government  recognize the pseudostate's "documents" so that the Turkish  Cypriots can travel freely anywhere in the world. At the same  time, he wants the area of Nicosia Airport and the fenced area  of Famagusta to actually become a "state" of the United Nations.  The writer goes on to say that if this UN proposal is accepted,  in Cyprus there will be the most unusual phenomenon with part of  the island under the control of Greek Cypriots, another part  under the Turkish Cypriots, another part under the British, and  finally a fourth part under UN control. The writer concludes  with the following: "With such unacceptable views and  philosophies, there will be no solution to the Cyprus issue in  the foreseeable future. And since the UN secretary general and  the other foreigners behind him have now revealed the most  miserable plan against Cyprus, we should make our own decisions.  The measures by Butrus-Ghali, the British, and Americans belong  in the trash can! The National Council should, at last, make its  own decisions."    ELEVTHEROTIPIA, mouthpiece of the Democratic Party, which  shares power with President Glavkos Kliridhis' former party, the  Democratic Rally, comments on the secretary general's report in  the 200-word "Freely" column entitled "The Butrus-Ghali Report,"  on page one. The writer says: "The first conclusion one draws  after a careful study of the UN secretary general's report to  the Security Council, is that we are drawn to even deeper seas  and, at the same time, we move further away from the substance  of the Cyprus issue and the principles of international law and  the United Nations which should govern a just and lasting  solution of our issue." The writer then says that the UN  Secretariat actions are outside the norm and thus create new  faits accomplis, and adds: "We think that we should tell  Butrus-Ghali certain things clearly. We should register our  disagreement in a straightforward way, and with dignity and  credibility demand justice. Neither Butrus-Ghali nor anyone  else should be allowed to form the impression that we are  willing to be brought back and forth and be dragged into  arrangements that do not take into account the justice of our  case."    KHARAVYI, mouthpiece of communist party AKEL [Restorative  Party of the Working People] comments on the report in a  150-word column entitled "The Butrus-Ghali Report," under the  general banner "Aggressively" on page five. The writer says:  "The UN secretary general's first report on the proximity talks  for the confidence-building measures has brought confusion to  the government, which has avoided commenting on it. The ideas  for promotion of the proximity talks appear to be based on the  UN experts' reports [on implementation of the  confidence-building measures] which the government did not want  to accept at the negotiating table. Naturally, with the  Butrus-Ghali report it is evident that the fenced area of  Famagusta and Nicosia Airport will be under UN administration.  This means that beyond the occupation and sovereignty of the  British bases, we will now have the sovereignty of the United  Nations, albeit temporary, in two parts of our homeland. Of  course, the danger of indirect recognition of the pseudostate is  present, since we also have the demand to allow the Turkish  Cypriots to travel freely abroad." The writer says that it  appears rather difficult for President Kliridhis to be able to  overturn the developments, as the secretary general's report is  very strict, and concludes: "The government reaps what it has  sown."    Independent O AGON carries a 450-word comment in the  "Opinion" column by the "Observer" on page three, entitled "The  Republic of Cyprus Is Being Abolished." The writer beings by  asking: "Why are we shocked and surprised by the contents and  approach of the UN secretary general regarding the way the  confidence-building measures will be implemented and by the  status that will result from the implementation of the relevant  arrangements? Butrus-Ghali has said nothing more upsetting than  what was `pictured' in his documents for the confidence-building  measures. He also does not present any other reality than what  was expressed by the UN experts in their reports." The writer  says that the secretary general has already told us how things  will be, and explains: "Famagusta will be a new, worse Pyla,  captive of the Turkish Army. Nicosia Airport will be the  entrance to the recognition of the pseudostate. The sovereignty  of the Republic of Cyprus will be canceled. The sovereignty of  two administrators, one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot,  will take its place. Famagusta will be under double  sovereignty, that is, Greek-Turkish sovereignty." The writer  says the same will happen with Nicosia Airport and, "the first  step toward abolition of the Republic of Cyprus is a fact." The  writer argues further why the UN proposals will abolish the  Republic of Cyprus, and concludes with the following: "We are  only a small step from the abyss. The step will be made if we  accept the measures."</p>

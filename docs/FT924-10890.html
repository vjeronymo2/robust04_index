			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Bill Cosby seeks to buy NBC television network MR Bill Cosby, the comedian who broke racial boundaries in the 1980s on prime-time American television, wants to buy NBC, the television network that made him the best-paid entertainer in the US. Mr Cosby's personal net worth is estimated at between Dollars 300m and Dollars 400m (Pounds 185m-Pounds 245m) - and still rising. Last year alone, he is believed to have earned more than Dollars 90m. The Cosby Show, his situation comedy series portraying the upper-middle class lives of a black obstetrician and his family, was the most successful programme in the history of US television, so far earning Dollars 1bn in syndication sales. The approach to buy NBC was made a few days ago by Mr Cosby's long-time agent, Mr Norman Brokaw, chairman of William Morris talent agency. Mr Brokaw, whose previous clients included Marilyn Monroe, former President Gerald Ford and Joan Crawford, said he took the Cosby offer directly to Mr Bob Wright, the NBC president who came from General Electric, the company that bought the network as part of RCA in 1986. 'I talked to Bob Wright, and he is not saying NBC is for sale, but that doesn't stop anyone from presenting an offer. Bill Cosby would have an interest in buying NBC and I have strongly registered his interest in buying it,' Mr Brokaw said yesterday. GE gave a terse 'no comment', the response it gave in recent weeks to rumours of two other potential purchasers, Mr Marvin Davis, chairman of Paramount, and Mr Barry Diller, former head of Twentieth Century Fox. Both are friends of Mr Cosby. Mr Brokaw would not comment on speculation that Mr Cosby might team up with Mr Diller, who like the William Morris chairman started his career in the talent agency's mail-room. Although GE's willingness to sell NBC remains uncertain, the betting is that the network could be available if the right offer in the range of Dollars 4bn were to be presented. It is widely known that Mr Jack Welch, the GE chairman, likes his companies to be ranked as first or second in their sector. When GE acquired NBC six years ago, the network was ranked as number one thanks partly to Mr Cosby. But last spring the Cosby Show ended its run on NBC, which has now slipped to third place among the three US networks. In its recent third-quarter results, GE said its broadcasting operations, which include NBC, suffered a loss. Mr Cosby got his first break on television in 1965 as co-star of the spoof adventure series I Spy. 'Bill has always felt very close to NBC because they gave him his first opportunity,' Mr Brokaw said. His later series was a blend of middle-of-the-road comedy and ideologically sound subject matter. This year Mr Cosby has embarked on a new series - the relaunch of the 1950s quiz show You Bet Your Life. This show is the first Mr Cosby has made with CBS rather than NBC.</p>

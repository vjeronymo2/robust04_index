			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The inconvenience of a la carte: Germany hopes France will yield to gentle persuasion and sign a Gatt deal With barely two weeks to go in the Gatt trade negotiations, the moment of truth is fast approaching for France - for its deeply nervous government, its unequally matched agricultural and industrial lobbies, its key relationship with Germany and its vision of the European Union as a power in the world. There are signs of movement in the long logjam over agriculture now that the Clinton administration has lifted its sights from regional to world trade issues. But Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is still talking very tough. He is threatening to block a Gatt deal if the US does not produce some speedy concessions not only in farm trade, but also on steel, textiles and future world trade rules that would submit Washington to the same disciplines as others. 'We have obtained nothing of what we have asked for,' he told his backbenchers last week. On one thing only, the French prime minister has conceded. After months of letting his ministers deride Gatt's December 15 deadline as 'an American date', set to suit Congress, he has acknowledged that, for better or worse, the middle of next month is decision time. Indeed, he has now cleared the decks for little else but Gatt, scheduling a parliamentary debate on Gatt before mid-December and making a trade agreement the focus of bilateral summits with European partners. By far the most important of these is the Franco-German summit in Bonn tomorrow and Wednesday. Leaders of the world's third-largest exporter (Germany) and fourth-largest exporter (France) will not have any precise Gatt text to chew on. But the task before Chancellor Kohl, President Mitterrand and Mr Balladur is to recast, on a world level, the historic compromise which their countries made in 1957. This gave French agriculture free run (though on price terms that protected less efficient German farmers) of the Common Market in return for opening that market to German industry. A generation later, the trade-off is more complex. Germany's interests as an industrial exporter remain constant, while France has become the world's second-largest food exporter, thanks largely to EU subsidies, and a big exporter of manufactures and services to the world. The US and the Cairns group of food exporters are insisting that France commit itself to sacrificing some of its 12.3 per cent share (at 1991 levels) of the world cereals market in return for industrial trade gains that are only potential. Will Chancellor Kohl add his voice to this chorus? President Clinton apparently requested this in a message passed on by Mr John Major when the UK prime minister was in Bonn last week. There is superficial logic in Mr Clinton's desire to bring German influence to bear on France. Such is the depth of the Franco-German relationship that Mr Kohl is probably the only person in a position to prevail on Paris. The two countries are each other's biggest trading and industrial partners; inside the EU they have produced a joint plan for their economies to converge; outside the EU each takes few foreign steps without the other; they have merged part of their armies in the Eurocorps; their civil servants and young people infest each other's ministries and universities; and so on. The historic rationale of this relationship, admitted by the leaders of both Germany and France, has been to bind the Federal Republic into western Europe. But on the Gatt, the rationale is reversed - it is for Germany to persuade France not to break ranks with the common commercial policy which is the European Union's earliest and most lasting achievement. In the shorter term, Mr Kohl has a tough election year ahead in 1994. He urgently needs the recovery which German industry is convinced a Gatt agreement could bring. Inside his coalition government, the foreign and economic affairs ministries, which lead for Germany on the trade issue, are headed by pro-Gatt Free Democrats. But, if one thing is sure, it is that, while Mr Kohl is asking France to recognise its own and Europe's interest in doing a Gatt deal, he will never insist. To do so might not only endanger the position of Mr Balladur, who might be toppled by his party leader and presidential rival, Mr Jacques Chirac; it would severely strain the overall Franco-German relationship, more important to both countries than any individual policy. Neither side sees Gatt as a real threat to their relationship. An Elysee official says: 'We do not see Gatt as a confrontation with Germany, but rather with the US and it is easier in France to stir up anti-American reflexes than anti-German ones.' The same sentiment exists on the Rhine. 'It is not a question of pressure by one side on the other. That is a rather Anglo-Saxon formulation,' says Mr Ingo Kolboom of the German Foreign Policy Association in Bonn. 'The relationship does not function like that. It is a matter of mutual persuasion . . . and the French know that they are a modern industrial state.' Assuming such self-knowledge on the part of many French is, however, a bit risky. They regard Gatt as a pistol held to the nation's head and see images of their past collective life passing nostalgically in front of them: Van Gogh's golden wheat fields, which would lie forever fallow because of the Blair House cuts in subsidised cereal exports; or arty Truffaut films, which would be pushed out of French cinemas by Hollywood blockbusters given even freer rein under Gatt. France is only now coming to political terms with an industrialisation process far slower than that of many of its partners. Whereas, for instance, the rural population in Britain had shrunk to 42 per cent in 1881, it was only well after the second world war, in 1954, that France's rural community dwindled to that level. Since then, however, the modernisation of agriculture has increased apace. Active farmers now account for 6 per cent of the population. The average size of farms is more than 30 hectares and half are now run as companies. Mechanisation and flight from the land has resulted in the paradox that as it has become a world 'agri-power', so France has ceased to be a mainly agrarian society. But French farmers retain an outsize political clout, providing the swing vote of more than 10 per cent in a fifth of the National Assembly's 557 seats. No less than a third of the country's 36,000 mayors describe themselves as farmers or retired farmers. And in the Hotel de Ville in Paris sits Mr Chirac who has never forgotten how much he enjoyed himself as agriculture minister in the early 1970s. However, there are now faint signs of the emergence of countervailing pressure to the farm lobby. The exporters of (unsubsidised) wines and spirits have come out squarely in favour of Gatt. The house magazine of the Institut de l'Entreprise, a select club of France's top captains of industry, recently dared to say what its members have been privately telling Mr Balladur in an article entitled 'Let's hope France is bluffing'. It stated: 'If France were to carry the blame for the breakdown of a multilateral trade accord wished by all its partners, it would very quickly lose all the standing it has acquired with its foreign clients over decades.' This is precisely the message Bonn would like to see spread in France, but dare not to do so overtly itself. 'We have been terribly careful not to be seen to dictate or interfere in the French debate,' says a senior diplomat in Bonn. 'We have simply tried to suggest to some leading people in the French media that there may be another, more positive side to the Gatt. We have not been very successful.' Certainly, the big fear among Gatt's supporters on the both sides of the Rhine is that Mr Balladur has left it too late to start selling a world trade agreement to his country. 'Something must be found which makes it impossible for the French to say No,' says the German diplomat. And in the German view, a large part of the answer must come from Washington.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Ellington miners vote for closure Miners at Ellington Colliery in Northumberland, the last pit in north-east England, yesterday voted to accept closure, reversing their decision last weekend to put the mine into the industry's colliery review procedure. Unions plan to meet British Alcan, which has an aluminium smelter that is Ellington's main customer, to discuss the chance that the company may bid for the pit in a joint venture with Ryan Group. Seven hundred miners at Ollerton Colliery and a further 700 at Annesley Colliery, both in Nottinghamshire, also voted yesterday to accept closure.</p>

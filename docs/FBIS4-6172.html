			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Chen] </F>   [Text] Brisbane, April 18 (CNA) -- The Republic of China  [ROC] is striving to play a stronger role in the Asia Pacific as  its economy becomes more closely enmeshed with the region's  economy, the ROC's top economic planner said today.    Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Insight 1994 meeting in Sydney  on Monday [18 April], Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council  for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said Taiwan is  well positioned to expand its already significant role as a  contributor to regional economic cooperation and development,  especially as a supporter of Asia's developing economies.    "We can serve as an effective gateway for overseas investors  who wish to enter Asia's fast-growing markets," he said.    He said Taiwan has four key assets in shaping its future  economic role in the Asia-Pacific region -- its geographic  location, its rapid economic development and highly skilled  labor pool, its manufacturing and engineering resources, and its  historical and cultural links with its neighbors.    Attending the meeting were business leaders and senior  officials from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South  Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Indonesia, the  Philippines, Vietnam, and Papua New Guinea.    Among them were Singapore's former Prime Minister Li Kuan  Yew  and Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans.    Hsiao said Taiwan's trade with the Asia-Pacific region  totaled US$120 billion in 1993, accounting for 75 percent of its  overall trade. About 35 percent of Taiwan's total trade is with  South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Mainland China, he said.    The ROC has become the largest investor in Vietnam, the  second largest in both Malaysia and Mainland China, the third  largest in Indonesia, [words indistinct] Thailand and the fifth  largest in the Philippines, he said.</p>

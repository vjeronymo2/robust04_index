			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Dikun: "Islam Karimov--Uncomfortable in a </F> `Member-Carrier'"]    [Text] As reported in the press, Uzbekistan President Islam  Karimov made an official visit to Moscow last week. Prior to his  return to Tashkent, Mr. Karimov met with representatives of  business circles and the Moscow intelligentsia at the Uzbek  Embassy. The confidential discussion broadened the understanding  of meeting participants of the current situation in Uzbekistan  and of its leader. In particular, President Karimov stated...  <H5>  On Democracy and Democrats </H5>   The Moscow newspapers are writing a great deal about Karimov  allegedly using the bugaboo of fundamentalism to protect his  authoritarianism and policies, about him being a reactionary.  While at the same time they make no mention of the fact that in  all of Central Asia it is only in Uzbekistan, in 1991, that  presidential elections were held with alternative candidates in  the running. I received 86 percent of the votes at that time,  while Akayev and Nazarbayev got 98.5 percent. They are referred  to as democrats, and I--as a postcommunist.    When Akayev meets with Americans, he states that Kyrgyzstan  is the bastion of democracy in Central Asia. Incidentally, had  Karimov not gone to Kyrgyzstan on the eve of its referendum and  supported Mr. Akayev, the latter would not have received 96  percent of the votes. Or consider what is going on in  Turkmenistan. You see 15-meter statues of the leader with every  step you take--the likes of which even Stalin did not permit  himself. We have adopted a Constitution that underwent the most  exacting expert review in many Western countries. Incidentally,  the states of West Europe and America follow very closely what  is going on in Uzbekistan. We have adopted laws on human rights,  on citizenship, and on elections, that correspond to the norms  of the democratic states. And we will attain the kind of  democracy others only dream about. The fact that we are only  able to do this some time after you have done it is a different  matter. But I am a practical individual, a realist and  pragmatic. I therefore often ask myself the question: Why  inflict harm needlessly?  <H5>  Purely Personal </H5>   I will admit that when they received me with full honors  just  now in Moscow and then transported me around the city in this  grand "member-carrier," I did not feel good about it. Why so?  After all, I have spent 40 years in Moscow and, like any visitor  who walks, I know it perhaps even better than you. Before, when  I was an economist and later minister of finance, I used to come  here at least twice a month on official business with the  Gosplan [State Planning Committee] and the Ministry of Finance.  I would run all around the capital then with my briefcase, and  each time would drop in without fail at Children's World.  Usually I tried to arrive when the store opened, when there were  fewer people, and would spend an hour or two here. I was  familiar with all five floors of the store and knew what was  sold in each department. After all, I have two little girls and  I used to bring them everything from here...  <H5>  On Independence </H5>   After the Soviet Union collapsed and we became sovereign,  there was a period of giddiness with us, of euphoria. All of a  sudden we all felt quite independent. In certain cases this  independence turned into a fetish and people began to fashion  grand plans around it. But life is cruel and it quickly  demonstrated to us that simply declaring independence was not  sufficient to achieve it. What is the point of sovereignty if  our children will not live normal lives under it?    Recently at an international forum in Davos, I sat next to  Mrs. Bhutto, Mr. Demirel, Nazarbayev, and my friend the Turkmen  leader--I forgot his name. Mrs. Bhutto, a strong personality, of  course, compared to us, brilliantly rattles off English (I feel  insecure in that I do not know foreign languages, though I did  study English, German, and French in my time). So she began  talking about the fact that since there is no Iron Curtain now  and the Central Asian republics are open, we finally have the  opportunity to make contacts with one another, integrate, etc.  When I was in Islamabad I learned that many people there are  starting to think that Pakistan will now be the leader in the  region. It is very important, therefore, for us to feel that we  have something behind us that will impart to us power and might.  For Uzbekistan this pillar is Russia. He who believes that  Russia can be written off is mistaken. We in Uzbekistan realize  that Russia is a great power in every sense of the word.  <H5>  On Reforms </H5>   I am an advocate of the reforms Russia is carrying out, and  I  fully support them. But we have different methods of attaining  these objectives. Under our conditions, radical reforms are  unworkable. Tell me, do we have the right, when 50 percent of  the population of Uzbekistan are children, who cannot feed  themselves, to tear everything down to its foundation and then,  as the revolutionary song goes--"We will build a new world, our  own world"? If we followed this course in Central Asia, you  would see an explosion worse than what has occurred in Karabakh.  You in Russia have gotten too carried away by these reforms and,  as a result of their forced implementation, you have discredited  the most noble intentions. But we have found the only proper way  out--we have operated without "shock therapy" and have not been  too quick to repudiate the legacy of the past. We have achieved  a great deal. Whereas the decline of production as compared with  1989 is somewhere around 46 percent on the average for the  countries of the former USSR, in Uzbekistan it is 12 percent.  The drop in national income on the average throughout the  republics is 34 percent, while in Uzbekistan it is just 6  percent. In short, our situation is much better than that in  other regions.  <H5>  On Barriers </H5>   We ourselves are inventing a great many barriers today that  separate us from one another. For example, the expressions "near  abroad" and "far abroad" have recently come into everyday use.  These concepts appeared with you in Russia, not with us. Then  too, it is not entirely clear as to just what criteria are used  to categorize certain countries with the "near abroad" and  others with the "far abroad." For example, why is America, with  whom you have developed fairly warm relations, considered the  far abroad?    In the same manner, I do not really perceive the concept  "Russian-speaking population." Whom does this term include--just  Slavic peoples? But then, where do you place me, a person who  has completed Russian schooling and who speaks Russian? The  Russian language has always united us--now we seem to be turning  it into a watershed.    Nazarbayev and I resisted right up to the end the departure  of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan from the ruble zone. I said that  the most terrible consequence of this step would be the fact  that millions of people would feel alienated from Russia. And  this is in fact what happened. Today Belorussia [Belarus] and  Russia want to create a unified monetary system. I think this is  proper, but it should not be confined to a union between  Belorussia and Russia. This garment should be thrown out to all  the countries of the former USSR.</p>

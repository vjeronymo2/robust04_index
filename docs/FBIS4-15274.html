			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed feature under the general heading: "71 </F> Percent of 1993 Level. Drop in Production May Mean End to  Production of Unnecessary Output"]    [Text] The statistics regarding the state of our economy  in March can hardly be cause for optimism. Vice Premier A.  Shokhin admitted that we have not seen such a slump in  production throughout the years of reform.    One should not doubt the accuracy of the State Committee for  Statistics' [Goskomstat] figures -- the country's main accounts  department has been working better and, importantly, more  honestly. There is certainly a slump, but what has caused it?  Statistics do not provide the answer to this question and that  is why it is just as hard to paint a real picture of the  situation in our economy as it is to say without knowing the  rate of exchange who is richer -- an Italian with 1 million lire  or a Turk with 1 million Turkish lire.    First it is necessary to compare the figures for the  production of various categories of output with the demand for  this output. Undoubtedly, a considerable proportion of the  decline is due to the fact that production of unnecessary or  poor-quality output has stopped and been replaced by imports.  This means that a normal market has begun to operate with a  manager only buying what he needs.    The second reason for the fall in demand is the fact that  enterprises are resorting to their own internal stocks:  Previously idle machine tools are being started up,  dust-covered tires are being supplied from depots, and electric  motors that are still fit for work are not being scrapped. This  second inhibitor of demand will quite obviously exhaust itself  fairly rapidly -- stocks will run out -- and this represents the  main potential base for the revival of demand and future  economic growth.    A third inhibitor will however also manifest itself here --  one that is coming into play even today -- prices. Will  enterprises have the money to buy equipment that they really  need and that is of really good quality (the same applies to  consumer goods for the population)? This question is perhaps  the most tricky. Today many enterprises are cutting production  and are inundated with goods that are necessary in theory but  are failing to find a market owing to their price which  potential customers consider to be too high. A kind of "trench  war" is under way -- who will sit the other out?    In a normal market economy the vendor is usually the first  to  "give in," lowering prices and guaranteeing himself a profit by  increasing turnover. When this mechanism comes into play in our  country too, then it will be possible to say that another  important element of a civilized market has appeared. But at  the moment we evidently cannot do without vigorous intervention  on the part of the state. This primarily applies to the rescue  and recovery of unviable production units.    A second highly important lever for state regulation is  credit policy. We have finally managed to get inflation under  control -- it has proved possible by targeted efforts to lower  the rate from 18 percent in January to 8.7 percent in March. It  is quite likely that the rate will be reduced further in the  coming months to 5-7 percent. But is that necessary? The  leadership of the Ministry of the Economy believes that it is  more advisable to slightly raise the rate of inflation once an  influx of credit into the most viable sectors and production  units has been guaranteed.    It is not only "bald" statistics that are needed to adopt  such decisions, but also in-depth analysis of what is behind a  particular figure. Otherwise decisions are adopted on the basis  of the following principle under pressure from sectoral  lobbyists: "Everything is collapsing, let us help." Analysis of  the economic situation along with the adoption of the  corresponding decisions must be prompt and efficient.  <H5>  Production of the Most Important Categories of Industrial </H5> Output in the First 20 Days of March 1994    In the first 20 days of March 1994 the average daily volume  of production of 13 out of 163 reported categories of output --  8 percent of the total -- rose compared with the same period in  March 1993 (including urban telephone system cables,  polypropylene, potash fertilizers, asbestos-cement pipes and  sleeves, cotton fabrics, school books, pencils, full-fat cheeses  and sheep's milk cheese, and toilet soap), while production of  145 categories of output, or 89 percent, dropped.    During this period in March 1994 no tower cranes with a load  capacity of eight tonnes or more, no feed-, grain-, and  flax-harvesting combines, and no mainline electric locomotives  were manufactured.  <H5>  According to Russian State Committee for Statistics Figures </H5>   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |A

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: Dubious voice of Satan - Theatre Not everything at the Royal Court is wonderful. While David Mamet's Oleanna is playing to packed audiences in the main house, a much more dubious production, though also well-attended, is taking place in the Theatre Upstairs. Gregory Motton's The Terrible Voice of Satan is an example of a talented playwright losing his way, and one can't help thinking that it was the Royal Court influence that led him beyond temptation. Motton was a specialist in the obscure to begin with, as anyone who saw the recent revival of his A Message for the Broken Hearted at the Battersea Arts will testify. He can write beautifully, but it is not always clear what he means nor who or even where his characters are. By the standards of The Terrible Voice, A Message was a model of clarity. The new play is all over the place, including under the Irish Sea. The Court must have some responsibility. Most of its best productions in the last year or two have been either Irish or American. Yet it can be dangerous to point indigenous playwrights in foreign directions. The Court sent the once promising Martin Crimp to New York to learn about America. He then wrote The Treatment, which showed not a hint of American subtleties or the American talent for self-parody. In The Terrible Voice Motton has gone very Irish, but to no great avail. Irishness apart, the main literary influences on the piece seem to be Marlowe's Dr Faustus and, even more blatantly, Coleridge's The Ancient Mariner: modest titles for big works - a practice stood on its head by Motton. A few lines from Mephistopheles in Dr Faustus say it all: 'Why this is Hell, nor am I out of it. Thinkst thou that I, who saw the face of God, And tasted the eternal joys of Heaven, Am not tormented with ten thousand Hells?' I suppose that's roughly what The Terrible Voice is about. Motton adds priests, sex, the IRA and a whole lot of gimmicks without moving forwards. The Ancient Mariner comes in with the albatross, in this case a magic bird initially huge and finally slung dead, and much diminished, around the waist of the principal character, Tom, as the boat in the Irish Sea runs into a storm. Don't forget that the word 'bird' nowadays has more than one meaning. The play is very well directed by James Macdonald. There are catching scenes of miniature cars along a track in a funeral cortege in the background, and a full-size bicycle in the foreground with strip-tease and simulated sex somewhere in the middle. Some of the staging draws on the National Theatre's Carousel. I wouldn't fault the performances, especially Sean Murray as Tom, but the play is a terrible fall from grace: Paradise Lost.

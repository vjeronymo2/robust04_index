			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The Korean people  extend militant greetings and solidarity to all the  revolutionary people of the world, renewing their revolutionary  resolution to steadily defend the cause of socialism, the human  cause of independence, from the counterrevolutionary offensive  of the international reactionaries, develop it and remain loyal  to it, on the lapse of two years since the historical Pyongyang  declaration "Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of Socialism"  was published on April 20, 1992, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed  article today.    The article notes:    The Pyongyang declaration was signed by 70 political parties  of the world at the time of its adoption but, in two years, the  number of the signers has reached 213. As this figure shows,  the declaration has evoked warm support and deep sympathy  among the world's revolutionary people to be accepted as an  action programme for the cause of socialism, the human cause of  independence.    Touching on its great attraction and invincible vitality,  the  paper says:    A dynamic movement is going on in all parts of the world at  present to defend and advance the cause of socialism in the  spirit and idea of the Pyongyang declaration.    The propaganda of the imperialists and bourgeois  restorationists about the mistaken socialist idea and "collapse"  of socialism is a sheer sophism and it is nothing but a trick to  embellish reactionary capitalism which has no future and  maintain the old order of domination and subjugation.    It is not socialism but imperialism and revived capitalism  which are nearing their downfall in a grave crisis.    As socialism has to cover an untrodden path hewn by mankind,  there may be turns and twists and trials in the course of its  advancement, but it is a historical necessity that it emerges  victorious for its truth, validity and vitality.    The victory of the cause of socialism can not be expected  without a common struggle of the world's revolutionary people.    What is important here is that the revolutionary parties and  people should keep to independence and strengthen the driving  forces.    As socialism is pioneered and built by the national state as  a unit, the cause of socialism in each country should be  undertaken and carried out by its party and people, being the  masters of it.    To keep faith in and principle of socialism is an essential  condition and an important guarantee for defending and  developing the cause of socialism.    Today when the international reactionaries are challenging  socialism with an allied force, it is more necessary for all the  forces aspiring after socialism to firmly unite and cooperate  with each other.    The Korean people will fight vehemently to smash the anti-  socialist offensive of the international reactionary forces and  achieve the progress and final victory of the cause of  socialism, in close solidarity with the world's revolutionary  people.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Diego Valades Rios, attorney general of </F> the Federal District, with unidentified reporters at the  Attorney General's Offices in Tijuana on 24 March; from "ACIR  Radio News" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Valades] The Federal District Attorney General's  Office announces that according to the investigation conducted  so far, the multiple testimonies provided by eyewitnesses, and  the evidence obtained, it has been confirmed that Mario Aburto  Martinez was the person who killed Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta  yesterday.    Mario Aburto Martinez fired two shots, one directly at the  head and the other at the abdomen. The first shot was fatal.  Both bullets exited the body. The shots were fired with a  special Brazilian-made .38-caliber Taurus revolver. According  to the expert's report, the weapon contained two unspent bullets  and two spent caps.    Mario Aburto Martinez was arrested at the scene of the  incident and brought to Attorney General's Office [PGR]  installations in Tijuana to make his first statements. He  admitted being the perpetrator of this crime, which has shaken  the Mexican republic. His statements were made before the  Federal District Attorney General's Office in the presence of  Lawyer Xavier Carbajal, president of the Emilio Orra Baja Bar  Association of Tijuana, and before Jose Luis Perez Canchola,  human rights ombudsman of Baja California State, in compliance  with the provisions of the Republic's Federal Constitution,  thereby preserving the rights of the person responsible for this  heinous crime.    Aburto Martinez's health condition was also certified upon  entering the judicial installations because he had already been  beaten by people near him after he carried out the attack. This  may be confirmed by the various media that witnessed the  incident. The attack was carried out following a political  event at the Lomas Taurinas Neighborhood in this border city.    Also turned over to the Attorney General's Office were  Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela and Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega, who  may be released with legal conditions unless new elements arise  that change their legal status.    The assassin will be remanded in the next few hours and  taken  to a maximum-security location. I came to this city on the  express orders of President Carlos Salinas and I have directly  coordinated the investigation. I was accompanied by Rene  Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera Morales, assistant  prosecutors for preliminary investigations, and by other  officials and experts dedicated to the investigation and the  complete clarification of this regrettable crime.    Also working on the investigations was (Mario Fabio  Beltrones), governor of Sonora State, where Colosio was born.    The incidents occurred as follows: At the conclusion of the  public rally that was part of his election campaign, Luis  Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, candidate for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], at 1710 stepped off the stage that  had been constructed for the event in Lomas Taurinas and mingled  with the people in attendance. He subsequently headed for his  vehicle. After Colosio walked approximately 10 meters, Mario  Aburto Martinez emerged from the crowd on Colosio's right-hand  side. Martinez drew a revolver, placed it a few centimeters  from Colosio's right temple, and pulled the trigger, causing the  injury that took his life. After the bullet entered the right  temple and exited through the left side, the victim spun around  counterclockwise. As he was falling, the attacker fired his  weapon again to produce a second wound in the abdominal region.  The bullet entered [words indistinct] and left a wound on its  way out near the right hypochondrium.    This account of the events was duly and completely confirmed  by eyewitness testimonies, by the results of the autopsy and a  forensic histology, and by a ballistic study that established  the position of the victim and the attacker and the trajectory  of the projectiles.    Mario Aburto Martinez was subdued by people who were around  the victim, immediately arrested, and placed at the disposal of  the Federal District Attorney General's Office. Based on this,  it can undoubtedly be concluded that the two shots were fired by  one person from one weapon whose cylinder contained two spent  and two unspent cartridges. The former were next to each other.    Aburto Martinez underwent the sodium [word indistinct] test  to determine whether he had fired a firearm. This test proved  positive. In his initial statement, Aburto Martinez confessed  to firing the two shots at Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. He  did so, as we said, in the circumstances already described in  the presence of two people who represented him, local lawyers,  and the president of the Human Rights Commission.    Mario Aburto Martinez, the 23-year-old perpetrator, is from  Zamora, Michoacan. He has a primary school education and is an  industrial mechanic. He said he has lived in Tijuana since he  was 15 and has dedicated himself to working since that time. He  confirmed that he was employed by Cameros Magneticos in Mesa de  Otai and was domiciled in this city of Baja California. As for  the weapon he used, he admitted acquiring it several weeks ago  with the intention of using it for the incidents under  investigation. He was arrested in the act and confessed to the  crime with all the evidence against him. He will be remanded to  the competent judicial authorities within the legally  established time.    The case is not fully closed. There are still questions  which, according to the law, must be taken to their final  answers. The country requires it, and the citizens demand it.  The instructions I have received from the president are  specific in that sense. The contribution and participation of  the legal authorities demand all their abilities and  professionalism. All of society, for the benefit and  tranquillity of all, expects clarity and stability. That is what  it will receive as a result of the work of this institution in  coordination with the competent governmental authorities of Baja  California State.    The Federal District Attorney General's Office has had and  will continue to have at all times the support and cooperation  of the government authorities of Baja California State, to whom  I publicly express my fullest recognition. Various state and  municipal officials have actively participated in the  clarification of this incident, thus affirming once more their  previously demonstrated commitment to the cause of justice.    A distinguished Mexican was deprived of his life. Mexicans,  however, will not be deprived of their determination to continue  on the path of justice. Society demands justice, and there will  be justice.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Valades] Allow me to speak, if you please. I am a serious  government official, and I have given you the information. If  you think that the person responsible for the crime and how the  crime took place is not information, then I don't know what kind  of information you want.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Valades] I want to add that this is a responsible process  of  information. The state authorities will not tolerate  provocations of any kind. We do not practice an adventurous  policy of information, and we will always strive to inform  society with responsibility, objectivity, and impartiality. I  have fulfilled my duty. I have announced it before you and will  continue to do so. Good evening.</p>

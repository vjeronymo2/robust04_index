French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe recently said it is  highly likely that Iraq will soon resume its oil exports. A  French source said Iraqi-French negotiations on developing oil  investments have been conducted on a regular basis in Baghdad.  The talks were moved this week to Paris where an Iraqi  delegation, led by the Oil Ministry undersecretary, has arrived.    Moving the talks to Paris indicates the extent of the  progress made and France's desire to restore relations with  Iraq. The visit was made at the invitation of France. This  means French diplomacy will act to lift the embargo. The two  French oil companies have shown interest because Iraq has the  world's second largest oil reserves.    Commenting on this development in Iraqi-French ties, British  sources in London said Iraq will likely become, once the embargo  is lifted, an arena for competition among French, Italian,  German, British, and U.S. companies. Officials from these  companies have been frequenting Baghdad for months to win  contracts with Iraq, especially in the field of food agriculture  and pharmaceutical items not included by the embargo. They are  awaiting major deals worth tens of billions of dollars, as was  the case in the seventies and eighties, once the embargo is  completely lifted.    Even if the embargo is partially lifted, this would  constitute progress, since the Iraqi economy has high production  capabilities and rich resources.</p>

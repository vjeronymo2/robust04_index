			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (17): Providing a window on the world - Mark Ford looks at the range of support provided by the EU to help small and medium-sized exporters in Europe to expand their markets / Small and medium-sized enterprises and the European Union As Europe seeks to compete with an emerging generation of supranational trading blocs the European Union has made support for small businesses one of its top priorities. UK companies can benefit from a range of facilities. According to a European Commission document on the subject: 'European policy meets a need to provide Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) with a European dimension and a 'window on the world' thus helping them to operate less within compartmentalised national markets'. SME development is one of Europe's highest priorities - but export strategists in small firms must look at the range of support that can be obtained from the EU from two perspectives. Direct support for export related activity is available but the bulk of support for small firms searching for wider markets is through initiatives that encourage the development of internationally competitive personnel, products, processes and services. An SME is generally accepted to be a business of fewer than 500 employees with fixed assets having a book value of less than Ecu75m (Pounds 57.75m) and with not more than one third of capital held by a larger firm. In particular policy areas, EU programmes and facilities often favour companies which are smaller than the defined maximum size. The importance which the EU attaches to small firms is manifest in the existence of DGXXIII for Enterprise Policy, Distributive Trades, Tourism and Co-operatives - the EU's directorate (the EU's equivalent to a national government department) dedicated to SME development. There are two main objectives within the EU's policy towards SMEs. The first, according to the Commission, is to 'help create a favourable administrative, regulatory, cultural and social environment sufficiently open and simple so as not to handicap firms in terms of costs and profitability'. The second is to provide practical assistance to new and existing SMEs seeking to develop European and wider markets. To meet these objectives, programmes and facilities are introduced within six project areas for SME development: training; information; exports; establishment of firms and innovation; inter-firm and inter-regional co-operation; and the provision of finance to help SMEs operate in a European context. Finance, in the form of loans and grants for SMEs, is made available most often through intermediary national or regional representative bodies, for training, research and development and innovation that can either directly or indirectly help UK companies improve skills or develop products for competing in wider markets. Facilities which indirectly help SMEs to become more competitive in international markets include a range of initiatives to encourage co-operation. Financial assistance is available, for example, for projects in which SMEs pool their resources with other small firms, with larger firms and with universities and research institutes to develop and market internationally competitive products, processes and services. Information is perceived to be a leading resource for companies investigating new export markets or who are seeking partners with whom they can collaborate. European Information Centres provide advice on a range of subjects relevant to SMEs; BC-NET is the EU's computerised system which matches organisations seeking and offering financial, commercial or technical resources. Facilities which directly help SMEs to export to new and wider international markets are contained within the EU's General Export Promotion Programme in which potential export markets for SMEs are targeted where it is felt that promotion on an EU scale would have an impact on trade development and facilitate market access for EU businesses. Current targets include Brunei, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Japan. Still more opportunities for SMEs result from EU policies towards countries on its southern and eastern flanks. Various agreements and EU-sponsored initiatives encourage EU businesses, including SMEs, to bid for work in a range of projects from infrastructure improvements to the provision of training in the emerging democracies in the former Comecon countries and in North Africa. Activities promoting exports for SMEs from member states include the provision of financial assistance for firms exhibiting in EU-sponsored pavilions at trade fairs and technical seminars designed to promote technological innovations emanating from European organisations. Trade missions are organised for sectors in which EU businesses are internationally competitive and market studies are organised to identify public purchasing and sectoral opportunities for EU companies. Since 1979 the EU has provided special assistance for firms looking to break into Japanese markets. Activities funded by the Export Promotion for Japan programme have included long-term stays, short-term visits, study trips, sectoral market studies and commercial visits to Japan. The programme is open to all EU firms with the potential to export to Japan, but businessmen and engineers from SMEs are particularly encouraged to participate as are companies seeking to export sports goods, food and drink, analytical and measuring equipment and jewellery. The Executive Training Programme (ETP) offers young executives from EU member states the opportunity to acquire, through experience, knowledge of Japanese business methods and culture. In addition to a 12-month Japanese language course, participants attend a parallel programme of seminars and factory visits and six months' work experience within a Japanese company. According to John Patrick of PA Consultants, which administers the programme for the EU, there is an increasing emphasis within the ETP on the rapidly expanding economies of the Pacific Rim. But he is concerned that too few candidates come from small firms. 'The problem is that perceptions about who the programme is for are wrong - people from small firms perceive that ETP is for large multinationals but we are very keen to attract candidates from SMEs - especially from the manufacturing sector.' Export strategists in UK small firms are perhaps becoming too introspective and may be disoriented by years of relentless political rhetoric persuading firms to export to Europe. That small exporters are not taking up opportunities to learn about more distant markets seems to beg a question. Why work hard on developing export strategies for a recession-hit Europe, while ignoring facilities provided by the EU which help SMEs open the 'window on the world' and look into the flourishing markets of the Pacific Rim? Distant market: Shanghai. China is one of a number of potential export markets targeted by the EU's General Export Promotion Programme Sarah Murray</p>

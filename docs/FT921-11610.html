			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse plans Dollars 500m issue WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has been hit by bad real estate loans, yesterday moved to shore up its finances by virtually halving its dividend and announcing plans to issue Dollars 500m of new stock. Both of the Westinghouse board's actions had been widely expected on Wall Street because of problems at Westinghouse Credit, its financial services subsidiary, which has been reeling from poor investments in speculative real estate and highly leveraged buy-outs in the late 1980s. Westinghouse took a Dollars 1.68bn charge in the third quarter to cover problems at the finance company and is trying to sell many of its assets to bolster its balance sheet and reduce debt. The recession has hit the company's other businesses, which range from power systems to broadcasting. The dividend cut reduces the payout due on March 1 from 35 cents to 18 cents. Mr Paul Lego, the chairman, said this would both provide capital and reduce the amount of equity the company needed to raise. The equity will take the form of preferred equity redemption cumulative stock, one of the most popular new instruments on Wall Street. Mr Lego said these measures, together with the company's recent establishment of a Dollars 6bn line of credit, a Dollars 200m cost-cutting programme and strong cash flow from operations, 'are sufficiently far-reaching to provide a sound capital structure and meet our financial needs. 'Nevertheless, we will continue the orderly reduction of assets at our financial services subsidiary.' Separately, he announced that the adoption of a new accounting standard for retirees health benefits, which is hitting the balance sheets of many American companies, would have no impact on Westinghouse shareholders' equity. It would be offset by the beneficial effects of a new tax accounting standard and the improved performance of the group's pension fund, he said.</p>

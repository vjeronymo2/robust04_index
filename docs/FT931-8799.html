			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Arts: Entertaining Mr Sloane - Theatre revivals in London Watching Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane, which will be 30 years old next year, it is easy to feel that it is a modern classic. Since it has been absent from the London stage for over 10 years, 10 years in which Orton's legend has grown, this Greenwich revival is well timed. This is still the blackest of black comedies. The themes of youthful criminality, manipulation, bisexuality, misogyny and murder still prompt an audience to appalled laughter at regular intervals. At Greenwich, however, no-one as yet falls off his or her seat with laughter. Orton, even 29 years on, should be funnier. That the director has comic gifts is not in question. He is Jeremy Sams, who is also one of our theatre's leading translators and musical arrangers. His very successful directorial debut, with Schippel the Plumber, occurred less than a year ago, in this same theatre. Very occasionally in that, and quite often in the rhymes of his translations, he has liked to nudge along a comedy with extra clevernesses of his own. In Entertaining Mr Sloane, however, he resists that. In this respect he shows a new kind of maturity. He also makes us feel something quite surprising: that Orton is not far from Pinter - and that Entertaining Mr Sloane is the flip side of The Servant. It could be that, within another week of performances, the laughter will quadruple. (At present the violent scenes are so choreographed that you can almost hear the counts.) That the comedy sometimes hangs fire as yet is largely to do with Sams's handling of Mr Sloane himself and his landlady Kath. Ben Daniels has the right kind of promising late-adolescent musculature and body-language; the way he turns over on the settee as he refers to Eddie doing 'a bit of servicing' says volumes. But he lacks Sloane's hilariously alarming mystery. He even tries to make us understand his thuggish, panicking, nervous system. Nice work, but wrong play. Janet Dale, as Kath, is funny from the first minute - from the moment she explains that the room should have the summer curtains, which 'are more of a chintz.' And her beady-eyed, squashy, puglike face is a hoot - until you notice how sometimes she pulls it into consciously 'funny' expressions. That she does not possess the buxom figure her lines suggest need not be a problem. But she seems not to imagine she is voluptuous; and she characterises Kath so sharply as a slatternly lower-class dowd that she misses her hypocritical pretensions to gentility and 'ideas of morality.' (And 'My teeth, since you mentioned the subject, Mr Sloane, are in the kitchen in Stergene' should raise a louder guffaw.) Remembering the first-rate performances Dale has given with such directors as Trevor Nunn (Nicholas Nickleby) and Nicholas Hytner (The Madness of George III), I imagine that another director would have elicited a more rounded and suggestive performance from her. But, as her brother Ed (whom Orton himself felt should be 'the central pivot of the play'), Ian Gelder is perfect. Early on, as he finds himself encouraging Sloane to wear leather trousers without pants, he tries to laugh; the laugh becomes a choke, he goes red in the face, and there in a jiffy he shows you the whole character  -bent, horny, closeted and apoplectic. There are one or two puzzles. Sams runs Acts 2 and 3 together. Though this spoils Orton's suspense, it makes dramatic sense. But why make a momentary blackout between them? And why stress Sloane's terror, rather than his manipulation? Earlier on, preparing for her seduction of Sloane, Kath puts on some easy-listening music; and only when Act 1 ends on their sex does the record get stuck in a silent groove. But Orton's stage direction is funnier. Kath has hardly put the music on than 'the needle jumps a groove, slides across record. Automatic change switches record off.' God (said Blake) is in the detail; and so is Orton. At the Greenwich Theatre, until March 20</p>

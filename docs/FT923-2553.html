			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / ERM in turmoil after confusion in markets STERLING'S MEMBERSHIP of the European exchange rate mechanism was suspended yesterday after the largest assault by currency speculators on the European exchange rate system since its formation in 1979. The move ended a day of extraordinary confusion on European foreign exchange markets, and allowed the government to rescind the second of two interest rate rises it had announced during the day. The Bank of England had earlier announced rises in the benchmark minimum lending rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and then to 15 per cent. The turmoil came after foreign exchange traders pounced on the uncertainty surrounding next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union to increase speculation about an imminent realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism. An emergency meeting of the European Community's monetary committee - with powers to decide on currency realignments - was also called last night after intense talks among senior economic policymakers in European capitals. Attempts by European central banks to discourage the speculators had failed. The announced 5 percentage point rise in UK interest rates and huge purchases of sterling by the Bank of England left the pound beneath its permitted floor against the D-Mark in the ERM. Other big interventions in Europe did not alleviate renewed pressure on the Italian lira - devalued by 7 per cent at the weekend - and the peseta. Although the pressure was highest in London, most of Europe's financial capitals were in turmoil: In London, overnight money market rates spiked to 100 per cent, while the one-month rate climbed towards 30 per cent. The stock market, however, rallied on expectations of an imminent devaluation of sterling and prospects for German interest rate cuts. In New York trading, the pound was quoted below DM2.73, compared with its official floor of DM 2.7780. In Stockholm, the Swedish central bank raised marginal lending rates to banks from 75 per cent to 500 per cent, in a bid to squeeze out speculators against the krona. The krona is outside the ERM, but tied to the European currency unit. In Rome, the government was in meetings with the Bank of Italy, as the lira fell through its permitted floor against the D-Mark. In Madrid, economic policymakers expected a sharp rise in interest rates from 13 per cent. Efforts to ease the pressure were seen in countries with the stronger ERM currencies. The German Bundesbank intervened in the money markets to nudge domestic interest rates lower, and rumours circulated that a further move was likely today. Belgium and the Netherlands announced one-quarter cuts in interest rates. The ERM's last wide-ranging realignment was in 1987, but this was before sterling - one of the five most heavily traded of the world's currencies - joined the system in October 1990. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said in London that a further realignment was likely soon.</p>

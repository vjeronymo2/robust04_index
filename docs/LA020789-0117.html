			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARBARA TUCHMAN DIES; AWARD-WINNING HISTORIAN  </P> <P> Historian Barbara Tuchman, who for nearly 50 years wrote steadfastly of her  belief that the world is the creation of men and women "invested with power to  affect their destiny," died Monday.  </P> <P> The two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author of a dozen books, most recent among  them "The First Salute," a current best-seller, died of complications following  a stroke.  </P> <P> She was 77 and had lived for years in Cos Cob, Conn. She was taken from there  to a Greenwich Hospital, where she died.  </P> <P> Ironically, Mrs. Tuchman, who became one of the most popular historians of her  time, was not trained in history.  </P> <P> "It's what saved me," the 1933 Radcliffe College graduate once admitted in an  interview. "I think if I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any  writing capacity."  </P> <P> Since her first book in 1938, her narrative accounts of history were praised  for their literary merit. She answered that she loved to "do" history, rather  than merely write about it.  </P> <P> For "The Guns of August" in 1962, she walked the battlefields of World War I;  for "A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century" in 1978, she trod the  same path as the Crusaders of that distant time and traced their tumult by  following the career of a feudal lord, Enguerrand de Coucy VII.  </P> <P> She won the Pulitzer Prize for history for "The Guns of August" and for  "Stilwell and the American Experience in China" in 1971.  </P> <P> She was always more popular with her public than with academicians, many of  whom disdained her lack of credentials. But as the London Times Literary  Supplement once reported, "Tuchman may not be a historian's historian, but she  is a pleasure for the layman to read."  </P> <P> It was one of many accolades the privileged daughter of Maurice and Alma  Wertheim struggled hard to achieve.  </P> <P> She was born to a family of diplomats and bankers: Her grandfather had been  U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Mexico under President Woodrow Wilson and an  uncle was secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In  times of limited opportunities for women, she had come to look on herself as  "just a Park Avenue matron."  </P> <P> Out of school, she became an editorial assistant for the Nation magazine and  American correspondent for the London-based New Statesman. Then in 1940, she  married Dr. Lester R. Tuchman.  </P> <P> With the children that followed, she told Newsweek magazine a few years ago, it  became difficult to achieve a long-dreamed ambition: to begin creating word  pictures of the paths of history.  </P> <P> She was, she stated without complaint, the wife of a physician and "had three  small children and no status whatsoever."  </P> <P> But she gradually carved out the time and had written "The Lost British Policy:  Britain and Spain Since 1700" (1938) and "Bible and Sword: England and  Palestine from the Bronze Age to Balfour" (1956) before coming up with a  captivating account of intrigue that became her first best-seller.  </P> <P> It was "The Zimmermann Telegram," published in 1958, in which she traced the  World War I German telegram to Mexico that promised the Mexicans part of the  American Southwest if Mexico would enter the war on Germany's side. The  discovery of the document was credited with helping bring the United States  into the war in 1917.  </P> <P> "The Guns of August" was an even bigger best-seller. Although it focused on the  tactical and logistical aspects of World War I, it was widely praised for  illuminating aspects of the conflict as would a storyteller by a campfire.  </P> <P> In "The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914,"  published in 1966, she examined society at the end of the last century and the  beginning of this one. The years before World War I, she wrote, "lie like a  band of scorched earth dividing that time from ours."  </P> <P> Her second Pulitzer came for "Stilwell and and the American Experience in  China." It traced the career of Joseph Stilwell, the feisty commander of U.S.  troops in China, Burma and India before and during World War II, who watched as  China moved from a feudal republic to communism.  </P> <P> In 1979, she became the first woman elected to the Jefferson lectureship of the  National Endowment for the Humanities. A year earlier, she had won the gold  medal for history from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  </P> <P> She also lectured in such disparate spots as Harvard University and the Naval  War College, but she continued to write. For her next work, she retreated six  centuries from wartime China for "A Distant Mirror."  </P> <P> In 1981, she put out what might be described as a Tuchman primer -- a volume of  her selected essays called "Practicing History." It explored her views of how  history should be written while also promulgating thoughts on subjects as  diverse as Watergate and Vietnam.  </P> <P> In 1984, nearly all of recorded history became her palette in "The March of  Folly: From Troy to Vietnam."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times book critic Richard Eder called it a collection of  "historical folly: a kind of prideful, or as she puts it, 'wooden-headed' error  committed by powerful societies, despite the presence of voices arguing against  it and the existence of visible alternatives."  </P> <P> Her subjects ranged from Britain's ill-fated struggle with its American  Colonies to the Trojan War to the Renaissance Papacy to Vietnam.  </P> <P> Mrs. Tuchman's latest book, "The First Salute," a look at the American  Revolution and the Dutch revolution that preceded it by 200 years, has been on  the New York Times best-seller list for more than nine weeks.  </P> <P> In one of her last public appearances, an interview at an October book signing,  Mrs. Tuchman said she had not given any thought to her next book.  </P> <P> "I don't really need a new project now," Tuchman said. "I need a good, long  rest, really."  </P> <P> At her death, the woman who chose to ignore a doctoral degree while in school  could count 22 honorary ones from a like number of institutions.  </P> <P> The New Republic wrote once that "Tuchman's books provide (her readers) with  examples that lift the level of their lives. Before the academic deluge, this  was what history was supposed to do -- to teach philosophy by example -- and  few writers have performed this office more inspiringly than Barbara Tuchman."  </P></p>

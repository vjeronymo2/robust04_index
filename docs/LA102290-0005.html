			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA GIRLS  </P> <P> I am a Marine currently deployed in the Persian Gulf. First, let me say that  all the support that we have received from everyone at home is outstanding!  Every letter written reaches a Marine, soldier or sailor who is lonely and far  from home, and shows him or her that someone cares.  </P> <P> One of our major problems during our off-time is boredom. Invariably, talk  turns to home. Then the competition factor sets in. Friendly arguments become  loud arguments. The most popular subject, by far, is women, and this always  leads to the question "where do the best looking women come from?" As a native  Californian, stationed at El Toro for most of the year, I have maintained that  the best-looking women in the world are all from California. However, those  poor souls who are not lucky enough to have seen for themselves keep asking for  proof. Thus I come to you for help. Photos, to be exact. The more that I, and  the other Marines I work with receive, the higher our morale will get. Any help  (letters or photos) can be sent to the following address: HQ 3rd MAW G-2, FPO  San Francisco, CA 96608-6001.  </P> <P> CPL. J.L. WOLFF, FPO San Francisco  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / BBC plans to launch world service news channel in US The BBC is planning to take its World Service Television News and Information channel into the US for the first time in what will be seen as a further challenge to Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network. Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director general, said yesterday the corporation hoped to launch the service, already available in more than 140 countries, on US cable networks either late this year or early next. Apart from news, the 24-hours a day channel would carry documentaries and other factual programmes. 'This service would report international news and current affairs from an international perspective in a way that complements the existing US services,' Mr Phillis told the FT Cable and Satellite conference in London. He said that the BBC hoped to launch its news and information channel in Europe before the end of this year to complement the existing European entertainment service. He also said the BBC was: close to finalising an agreement to launch an Arab language version of the BBC's news and information channel. actively exploring the possibilities of launching new non-news channels and news and information programmes in local languages as part of a more aggressive commercial policy. engaged in 'constructive talks' with News Corporation over whether BBC World Service Television remained on the Star satellite system in Asia.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHELTER PROGRAM WILL DO WITHOUT ARMORIES  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles launched a new 60-day shelter program for the homeless  Monday, but had to find new homes for part of the program.  </P> <P> The National Guard, citing factors such as the Persian Gulf mobilization,  refused to allow two armories to be converted from part-time shelters to  nightly use.  </P> <P> New shelters will be established in the San Fernando Valley at Van Nuys Airport  and on the Westside at Stoner Park Recreation Center, officials said, replacing  the West Los Angeles and Van Nuys National Guard armories.  </P> <P> Those facilities had been designated as two of the 13 shelters in the  three-year-old city program, which the City Council last week voted to operate  on a continuing basis during the coldest part of the year. Previously, the  program operated only on nights when temperatures dipped below state emergency  guidelines.  </P> <P> The change grew out of a study that found the Van Nuys armory was used on 40 or  more days of the 60-day cold weather period during the past two winters, and  that other shelters were used with equal frequency, said Bob Vilmur,  coordinator of city programs for the homeless.  </P> <P> Officials hope that opening shelters for the entire 60 days will allow them to  serve more homeless people and offer more and better medical and social  services.  </P> <P> "It was the most humane way to do it," said Wendy Greuel, an aide to Mayor Tom  Bradley. "We are disappointed that they did not allow us to do it this way."  </P> <P> Guard commanders told Bradley's office that the armories should be used only on  an emergency basis. The Guard cannot open the armories to the homeless for two  months consecutively because that could lead to similar demands in colder parts  of the state and interfere with preparations by guard units that may be called  to duty in Operation Desert Shield, said Sgt. Phil Jordan, a spokesman for the  California National Guard in Sacramento.  </P> <P> City officials plan to use a hangar at Van Nuys Airport in the Valley, where  more than 40 people have been housed at the National Guard Armory on five  nights since Nov. 1. The Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners is expected  Wednesday to approve the city's request to use the hangar, Vilmur said.  </P> <P> The Westside homeless program will move temporarily to a recreation center in  Stoner Park this week, Vilmur said, while program officials search for another  facility to use until Jan. 15. The city of Santa Monica has agreed to provide a  shelter from Jan. 15 until Feb. 15, he said.  </P></p>

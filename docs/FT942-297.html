			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (15): Tips on raiding bins - Private Intelligence / Robert Peston finds that companies need to keep a close watch on their secrets Corporate Cloak and Dagger by James Croft Harper Collins, Pounds 7.99 212 pages To bug or be bugged? To tap or be tapped? Those apparently are the choices for companies and powerful individuals these days. Whose secrets are safe? Not those whispered down the phone by the Prince of Wales. Not the private financial affairs of a chancellor of the exchequer. The 'private intelligence' industry is booming and agencies are becoming increasingly brazen about advertising their services. Prices are surprisingly reasonable. One intelligence firm has sent out a brochure containing the following tariff for searches: Bank balance - Pounds 245 Hard copy bank statement - Pounds 1,000 Salary - Pounds 200 Pension details - Pounds 200 Full career history - Pounds 590 Hard copy of itemised telephone bill - Pounds 750 Overseas tax havens, numbered accounts - price on application. The firm's blurb continues: 'More sensitive areas of intelligence are available on request.' Belatedly, the government has become aware that the law on the protection of privacy is too vague. New legislation is planned. In the meantime, it is wise for companies and individuals in possession of confidential information to consider how best to protect themselves. A Boy's Own Guide to seeing off the snoopers - or indeed becoming a snooper  -has been written by a certain James Croft, described by his publisher as an 'expert in covert and overt intelligence gathering'. The otherwise anonymous Mr Croft - 'We have no further biographical details', said Harper Collins - dispels some of the popular illusions about intelligence industry. Its techniques are mostly low-tech, such as searching through public records or - in its seedier form - persuading officials or bankers to pass on information they should keep secret. Though banks and companies are wise to put in place safeguards against sophisticated computer hacking, there is little evidence that this is widespread. Computerisation has increased the risk of disclosure of sensitive information, but only because it often involves a centralisation of vast quantities of information which can then be sold by corrupt employees. Loss as a result of an outsider accessing the system directly is far less common. Unsurprisingly, given the sensitivity and complexity of its subject, the book oscillates between the trite, the obscure, the genuinely practical and the hilarious. In the latter category are his six practical steps for raiding the rubbish bin of a surveillance target. It contains tips such as: 'Always try to collect (rubbish) between 2am and 4am; Always have a reason to be there - excuses such as a sudden need for the toilet . . . or conducting market research (at 2am?) ..are useful; Where a foray into the countryside is needed, use the following procedures: a) full reconnaissance of area; b) two personnel; c) assess drop-off point; d) passenger leaves vehicle as car slows but does not stop; e) car continues to predetermined location and waits for an agreed time. Engine is not turned off - etc etc.' There is also a lengthy discussion of the legality of rubbish-bin raiding, in particular the question of who owns the rubbish. His section on electronic eavesdropping - how to do it and how to prevent it  -is the most disappointing. It does not give any real insight into how the various homing, encryption, bugging and jamming devices work, nor how to use them. Far more practical is a guide to what information is legitimately available by searching government and corporate databases. One of the UK's best-kept secrets is the vast amounts of useful information available to the diligent researcher from the examination of public records, even in a closed society such as the UK's. For example a search of Companies House's directory of directors shows that 13 different 'James Crofts' - if that is his real name - are directors of UK companies. Their addresses, ages and nationalities are given with other biographical details. Is intelligence expert Mr Croft the one who lives in Hertfordshire and describes himself as an aquatic specialist? Or is he the car hire manager from Lancashire? Or could he be the Leeds police officer? There is a chance, of course, that his real name is something quite different - in which case, the only way to trace him is to resort to the tried and tested method of cajoling his publisher into telling all.</p>

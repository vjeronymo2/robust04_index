Among the  groups writing were the following: the Sun of Justice for the  Liberation of the Haitian People, OSJLPH, [Organisation Soleil  Justice pour la Liberation du Peuple Haitien, also known as  Soley Jistis pou Liberasyon Pep Ayisyen, OSJLPA], the  Organization for the Defense of Youth, ODEJ, [Organisation de la  Defense de la Jeunesse], and the St. John Bosco basic church  communities.    The letter's signatories reproached President Clinton, among  others, for his indifference in the face of the current climate  of deterioration in the country, including an upsurge in acts of  violence, both in the capital and in the provincial cities.    The 14 people's organizations wrote the following: We  deplore  your silence about the horrors (?being committed) in Haiti. By  acting thus, you send a conspiratorial signal to the Haitian  military and to the armed civilians who continue to slaughter  the population. Remember that Americans of Haitian origin voted  for you because they were convinced that your presence in the  White House would inaugurate a new era for Haiti.    Mr. President, one cannot avoid noting that again today you  are putting pressure on President Aristide to appoint a new  prime minister, but the current climate is not really  appropriate for that, the signatories of the letter pointed out.    They further demand the departure of General Cedras, the  disarming of the paramilitary groups, and the return of  President Aristide on a specific date.</p>

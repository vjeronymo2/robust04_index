			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Chile likely to make Frei President Candidates yesterday wrapped up their campaigns for presidential and congressional elections to complete Chile's transition to democracy begun when General Augusto Pinochet stepped down as president in 1990, Reuter reports from Santiago. From midnight Wednesday, Chilean law forbids candidates to hold rallies, stick up posters or advertise so voters have time for reflection. But polls left little doubt as to the outcome of tomorrow's election. Ruling coalition candidate Eduardo Frei was favoured to win the presidency with three to four times the vote of his right-wing rival, Arturo Alessandri. Analysts also expected a majority in Congress for the centre-left coalition forged by President Patricio Aylwin to defeat Gen Pinochet in a 1988 plebiscite and which Aylwin again led in 1989 elections to restore civilian rule. But they say complicated voting rules make it almost impossible for the coalition to win the two-thirds of the congressional seats it needs to rid Chile of the last traces of authoritarian rule imposed by Gen Pinochet in a 1980 constitution.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter from Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Reflections </F> on the Qiandao Pleasure Boat Fire Incident"]    [Text] My dear brother,    I heard an unfortunate piece of news from Chunan County,  Zhejiang Province, that on the afternoon of 31 March, a fire  started on a pleasure boat when cruising Qiandao Lake with 24  Taiwan compatriots, two local tour guides, and six crew members  aboard, killing everyone on board. Like Taiwan people, we were  shocked and grief-stricken when the bad news arrived. We hoped  sincerely that there would be full cooperation between  authorities on both sides of the strait in handling this  unfortunate incident and dealing properly with its aftermath,  making sure that this tourist misadventure would not affect  relations across the straits.    After the incident, from what information I could gather, I  think that concerned mainland authorities are handling this  matter seriously. The State Council persons-in-charge, its  Taiwan Affairs Office, National Tourism Administration, and  Zhejiang Provincial Government and concerned departments, have  taken the tourist accident very seriously. Luo Gan, State  Council General Office secretary general, instructed Zhejiang  Province officials on the morning of 2 April to quickly find out  the cause of the fire, ascertain the number of deaths, organize  salvage operations, and deal with the aftermath of the fire.  The Zhejiang Province officials put together a top team to  direct the rescue effort and begin investigations at the scene,  search for bodies, and provide every possible convenience for  relatives of the victims. Concerned mainland departments are  continuing their work to settle problems arising from the  incident, and their work has won the understanding of relatives  of the victims. Now, the bodies of victims have all gone  through funeral rites and have been cremated and the ashes  brought back to Taiwan by victims' relatives.    Concerned departments are investigating causes behind the  Qiandao pleasure boat fire incident and will release the results  as soon as possible. Concerned departments will learn from the  experience of this extraordinarily serious incident, heighten  safety awareness, tighten safety measures, plug all loopholes,  take preventive measures, and create good tourist conditions and  environment in order to better serve overseas and domestic  tourists.    Taiwan people were grieved by the unfortunate incident  befalling on the 24 Taiwan compatriots. Media on the island  over the last few days have given extensive coverage to the  responses by Taiwan society, the strong objections of the  island's ruling force, and speculations on the causes of the  incident. Many Taiwan newspapers ran dispatches sent by  reporters from the scene of the incident. I think Taiwan's  enormous reaction to the serious incident was perfectly  understandable. Human lives are a serious matter; and mainland  tourist, transport, public security departments should listen  seriously to criticisms and views and meet the reasonable  demands of victims's relatives in order to ease their minds.    The Qiandao pleasure boat fire was a tourist accident of  rarely seen seriousness and complication. This is precisely the  reason we should remain objective and calm in our approach and  should not be emotional, much less politicize the incident and  make moves detrimental to cross-strait relations. Recent  speeches and actions by some leaders of Taiwan have caused  concern among people on the island. A Taiwanese writer pointed  out in a newspaper article that tourist accidents are social,  not political matters. If both officials and society wanted to  cut down cross-strait mutual help because of the incident, it  would be like refraining from eating for fear of choking and  would revert the situation to before the "lifting of martial  law." Tourist accidents can happen at Qiandao Lake as easily as  anywhere else.    A high-level Taiwan "economic ministry" official asked  Taiwan  businessmen to temporarily suspend mainland investment in the  aftermath of Qiandao incident. The demand was opposed by  high-level personnel with the "Society for Taiwan Economic  Building," who believed Qiandao to be an "isolated incident,"  and cross-strait economic ties and trade are the trend of the  times. He also said that it was too early to make the  conclusion that the Qiandao incident would affect cross-strait  economic ties and trade. The trend shows that cross-strait  economic ties and trade should continue to develop on the basis  of mutual benefits, and authorities can only play a facilitating  role.    I believe that the views of the above-mentioned two Taiwan  personnel are quite perceptive and wise observations on the  Qiandao incident.    My wish is to see concerted efforts from both shores to  increase mutual trust, so that the shadow cast by the  unfortunate Qiandao incident on cross-strait relations will  disappear, the benevolent dynamic between the two shores can be  maintained, and cross-strait relations can continue to develop.  Bao Xin 11 April</p>

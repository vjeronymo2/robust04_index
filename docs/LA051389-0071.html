			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VERDICT IN NORTH'S IRAN-CONTRA TRIAL  </P> <P> The seldom mentioned fact that North's acts, deeds and operations were covert  is the crux of the entire situation. This simply means he cannot reveal all the  facts -- to anyone.  </P> <P> Covert operations are a vital part of the nation's intelligence lifeline.  Having established that fact, do you really think a mere lieutenant colonel,  who in this situation, is the low man on the totem pole with many superiors,  acted on his own? He reported to those superiors when he carried out orders.  </P> <P> Can you imagine telling a secret to Congress? Or any congressman? When you're  dealing with the national interest and security, some classified information  does not belong to everyone, not even Congress.  </P> <P> Too bad President Reagan didn't pardon North. There would have been an initial  flap and flurry but it would have blown over and he'd still be the popular past  President and the country would be better for it.  </P> <P> But this way, Reagan has left everyone with an unhappy legacy. Especially  North, the pawn, the scapegoat, the fall guy.  </P> <P> MAURINE R. RUZEK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCGWIRE PASSES FOR 530 YARDS IN VICTORY;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE: AZTECS BEAT NEW MEXICO, 40-34, AND KEEP THEIR SLIM BOWL HOPES  FLICKERING.  </P> <P> San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire completed 33 passes for a career-high  530 yards, six short of the school record set by Todd Santos against Stanford  in 1987, and led the Aztecs to a 40-34 victory over New Mexico before 7,868 at  University Stadium Saturday.  </P> <P> Fred Miller, Aztec athletic director, said San Diego State, 5-4 overall and 4-2  in the Western Athletic Conference, is still one of the teams under  consideration for a berth in the Dec. 29 Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La.  </P> <P> San Diego State is apparently in the running with North Carolina, Temple and  Louisiana Tech for a berth against a Southwest Conference opponent, probably  Baylor.  </P> <P> Against New Mexico (2-10, 1-6), McGwire spread around his 49 pass attempts,  with three Aztec receivers getting at least 100 yards. He threw two touchdown  passes to Jimmy Raye, and Patrick Rowe caught six passes for 131 yards. Rowe  tied a school record with seven consecutive games of 100 or more receiving  yards. The NCAA record is eight, set by Tulsa's Howard Twilley in 1965 and tied  by Fresno State's Henry Ellard in 1982.  </P> <P> Rowe now has 1,129 yards this season, seventh on the Aztecs' all-time single  season list.  </P> <P> He also became the 10th receiver in SDSU history to surpass the 1,000-yard mark  in a season with his first catch of the game, a 34-yard reception on the last  play of the first quarter.  </P> <P> Dennis Arey caught eight passes for 150 yards, and Raye had eight receptions  for 110 yards.  </P> <P> The Aztecs rushed for 158 yards and finished with 688 total yards,  third-highest in school history.  </P> <P> "It didn't seem like it . . . we were so inconsistent," McGwire said. "We were  inconsistent throughout the whole game. We had an off day. To overcome that and  post a victory like this . . ."  </P> <P> It was the Aztecs' first road victory of the season.  </P> <P> Trailing, 10-7, the Aztecs scored touchdowns on three possessions in a row and  led at the half, 31-21.  </P> <P> The Lobos pulled to 31-28 when Marcus Goodloe passed 43 yards to Eric Morgan  for a touchdown to cap a 67-yard, four-play drive.  </P> <P> The Aztecs answered with a 23-yard field goal by Andy Trakas. With 11:08 to  play, Tommy Booker capped a 67-yard, nine-play drive with a five-yard touchdown  that put the Aztecs ahead, 40-28.  </P> <P> Nate Morris intercepted McGwire's pass with 4:13 to play and returned it to the  Aztec 35 and, three plays later, Goodloe passed 18 yards to Morgan for a  touchdown. A two-point conversion attempt failed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPARING FOREIGN AND U.S. AUTOS  </P> <P> I got a big laugh while reading Koblosh's letter detailing the problems he has  had with his 1985 Dodge. May I present the following problems I have  experienced with my 1983 Toyota pickup truck:  </P> <P> Four brake failures; 2 headlight replacements less than 1 year after purchase;  total brake failure; refusal to repair damaged right wing window while under  warranty; need for 4 new tires less than 2 years after purchase (less than  25,000 miles driven); replacement of timing chain; cracked bearing; total  engine failure -- 4 years after purchase; battery cable failure; replacement of  entire fuel pump system.  </P> <P> I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Do you think I'll ever buy  anything made by Toyota? No way!  </P> <P> RONALD KERNS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

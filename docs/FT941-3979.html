			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Judge to probe exam allegations Cardiff University of Wales has appointed a retired judge, Mr Norman Francis, to investigate allegations that examination papers from its business school were sold in advance to students in Italy last year. Mr Francis is looking into the links between Cardiff Business School and the European Business School in Parma. In 1992 the University of Wales - a federal institution of which Cardiff is the largest part - agreed to validate Parma's business studies degree. Last year the founders of EBS lost control of the business school to a group of parents, at least some of whom were alleged to have Mafia connections.</p>

Pavelev; UDC 528.8]    [Abstract] Revised experimental data on the magnitude of  the refraction angle and refraction attenuation of radio waves  in Venus's atmosphere are presented using the results of  bistatic radar measurements of the planet. In order to describe  the refraction effects, a theoretical model is developed. This  model is used to determine parameters which are necessary to  calculate radio communication lines in the troposphere using  refractive index versus height. The experimental data are  compared with the results of calculations made using a  theoretical model. Ratios which link the length of the phase  path and integral absorption of radio waves in the atmosphere  with parameters of the theoretical model are obtained. These  ratios may be used to calculate communication routes in Venus's  atmosphere. Figures 4; references 16.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: Cos fan tutte - British Youth Opera WITH a fund-raising gala at Covent Garden and an Arts Council Grant to its name, British Youth Opera is making notable headway in funding a fledgling opera company. Its aim is to give singers not far up the professional ladder an opportunity to climb a few rungs further in fully-staged productions. This is a trickier proposition than it may seem. The music colleges already put on opera productions open to the public. Protected from the need to fill large theatres on a commercial basis, they are able to give often outstanding performances of rarely-seen operas, as the Royal Northern College did recently with Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress and the Guildhall School of Music with Prokofiev's The Duenna. British Youth Opera's two new productions are not on that level. In order to lure an audience to Sadler's Wells, the company has chosen Mozart's Cos fan tutte and Bizet's Carmen. The singers include names already noted at the music colleges, but asked to perform in popular repertory works such as these, they face difficult challenges, which show what a gulf remains before students reach professional standards. I saw the production of Cos fan tutte on Wednesday. The ambitions of the company's undertaking, as in everything it does, were laudable: the version of the score was more complete than usual and an experienced production team had been assembled, an essential feature if the young singers are to gain the maximum benefit from participation. Unfortunately, Jamie Hayes's setting of the opera as Cos-on-Sea, taking the sisters on holiday to a down-market British seaside resort at the height of what seemed to be Falklands fever, failed to make anything of its updating of the story. The English translation, credited as the old Ruth and Thomas Martin version but horribly tarted up, had every cliche in the book. The strength of the evening lay entirely with the young performers. Susannah Glanville was a radiant Fiordiligi and Nathan Berg a vocally resonant Guglielmo, both singers of notable promise. Emma Selway's unexaggerated Dorabella and Andrew Burden's sure Ferrando made an able second couple. Liza Pulman and John Neale judged well the character roles of Despina and Don Alfonso. The talent is there and British Youth Opera has assembled some of the best. Sadler's Wells season lasts until Saturday. Box Office (071) 278 8916</p>

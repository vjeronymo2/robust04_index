			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Paper roses in all their glory FOLLOW the silk road to Clapham and you will be amazed at what you will find. There, in her own house, Helen Hardy sells an amazing collection of vibrant fake flowers: daisies, Easter lilies, sprays of fuchsia, purples bunches of lilac and roses, roses, roses. These are not the fake flowers of yesteryear, all hideous plastic and harsh colourings. These are enchanting versions made from silk and parchment that can save the day for those who love rooms filled with bowls and vases of flowers but cannot always be sure of finding real country roses, the right greenery or the particular collection of sweet spring flowers they crave. Hardy sells all the stems individually (including a big selection of greenery) and she will send out a price list on request. A fuchsia spray, costs Pounds 3.20, a single medium rose, Pounds 1.40, a bud blossom, Pounds 2.30. She will also happily make up arrangements - some customers just ask for a country look or a collection of country roses and are usually, it seems, well-pleased with the result. A formal collection in a large container - like the one shown left - suitable for a grand reception or a large drawing-room, might cost as much as Pounds 240, but a simple collection of country flowers could be had for about Pounds 30 (and just think how long they will last]). Helen Hardy, 33 Larkhall Rise, SW4. Telephone: 071-720-5780.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Diary of a Private Investor: When to say 'yes' to BES EVEN THOUGH the Goat Advisory Bureau wished the venture 'every success', Angora International - a Business Expansion Scheme - became a butt for jokes as it was not a success. Fortunately, I did not have an investment in it. Over the years I have resisted the tax temptations of a wide variety of business expansion schemes, including one, Unicorn Heritage, which offered the opportunity of 'the chilling sensation of walking down the corridor with Mary Queen of Scots on the way to her execution.' Instead, Unicorn got the chop as its business failed. I did, however, invest in a small number of BES companies and although, taking tax considerations into account, I have made a profit, I will not be mourning the ending of such schemes. In his budget last year, the Chancellor, Norman Lamont, announced that BES will 'come to an end' on December 31, 1993. According to the chancellor's statement, when BES was first introduced 'the venture capital industry was in its infancy and there was concern that the investment needs of small firms were not well understood and provided for.' However, he said Britain 'now has a venture capital industry the equal of that anywhere in the world outside the US. But the provisions of the Business Expansion Scheme have become ever-more complex. And nowadays only a small part of the total invested goes to small businesses.' This latter comment has, to me, been the saddest feature of the schemes. Vast sums were poured into property-backed ventures rather than into new and innovative small companies involved in manufacturing. Even with tax relief of 75 per cent (when high-rate taxpayers like me started investing in such schemes in 1983/84) there seemed to be too few attractive manufacturing companies available in which to invest. Nearly all of my BES investments have reached the end of the qualifying period for tax-free capital gains and their sponsors have provided various 'exit routes' for investors. For example, I invested in the 1983/84 Britannia BES Fund which backed a range of companies, including three which went into receivership. But some of its investments performed much better, especially the fund's Pounds 61,270 investment in Graham Wood, a structural steel fabricator, which produced a return of Pounds 602,900. By the time the Britannia scheme had disposed of all of its investments and wound-up the fund (in 1991) investors who had been in the highest rate tax bracket had received a return of more than 290 per cent. In 1985, I invested in Hotel Apartments, a BES company sponsored by Johnson Fry. The shares, before tax relief, cost me Pounds 1 each. The company sold its hotels and I received a payment of Pounds 1.06p a share in September 1991 and a further 2p per share in December last year. While I am quite pleased to see the end of this investment, I am sorry that my involvement with another BES company, Perry Publications (Holdings) has ended. I invested in Perry in 1987 because I very much enjoyed reading the monthly magazine which it produced: Business Traveller. I thought it was the best magazine of its type on the market. Unfortunately, the world of publishing is tough and so the company felt in need of a partner which could strengthen its financial resources and enable it to expand. Thus, Motor-Press International Verlagsgesellschaft Holding, part of a German publishing group, made an offer to acquire investors' interests in the company. I accepted their offer. For each share in Perry Publications which cost me Pounds 1, ignoring tax relief, I received 43p in November last year and will receive a further 42p per share in March this year. I wish there had been some other way in which Perry Publications (Holdings) could have raised additional funds in order to develop Business Traveller so that I could have retained a small financial interest, as I remain convinced of the publication's potential in the UK and US and would have liked to have shared in the future profits - but without being locked in. But, then, that has always been one of the problems with BES companies: those you wish to escape from you find yourself locked in for longer than anticipated whereas it is impossible to have a long-term relationship with companies where it is desirable. I hope that, in spite of the demise of the BES, small companies will still seek funds for expansion from private investors and will not rely on institutional investment. Perhaps, in his next budget, the Chancellor could announce the DTI sponsorship of a 'sorting house' which would match private investors with small companies seeking to raise funds for expansion - and provide this service at no cost to the companies and investors concerned.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: AB Foods AB Foods' interim results were very much in character. The dour struggle of the milling and baking business contrasts with the vigorous energy of British Sugar. The sharp decline in the return from the remnants of ABF's cash mountain was a reminder that it correctly timed that acquisition. That said, the chairman's downbeat description of the outlook left the market rightly unimpressed and the shares languishing on a prospective multiple of 9. Given that ABF stands somewhere between Ranks Hovis McDougall on the one hand and Tate &amp; Lyle on the other, it is instructive to look at how the three have performed relative to the market in recent years. The cyclical downturn in milling and baking began in 1988-89, so one can legitimately go back a little further than that. Over the last five years, whereas ABF has almost exactly matched the market, RHM has fallen by 41 per cent in relative terms, while Tate &amp; Lyle has outperformed by nearly 80 per cent. The only ground for optimism is that ABF is becoming more like Tate. British Sugar is on course to make about Pounds 140m out of a group pre-tax profit of Pounds 325m this year. Perhaps more importantly, it is the focus of ABF's strategic thinking; talk of an investment in C&amp;H Sugar in the US, if realised, should mean another Pounds 100m or so of cash will be spent by the end of the summer. The rest of ABF is correspondingly uninspiring, but at least investors know what they are buying.</p>

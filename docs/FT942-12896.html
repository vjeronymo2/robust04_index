			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME ready to meet challenge The London Metal Exchange would immediately review its approach to the North American market following the unexpected approval yesterday of a merger between Comex and Nymex, said Mr David King, the LME's chief executive. 'The LME has worked long and hard to gain global supremacy in the contracts it trades and if we have to work even harder to maintain that position, so be it,' he commented. 'We will be more inclined to be pro-active rather than re-active (in the US) after this merger. The North American market is very significant for the LME,' he added. This attitude seemed to leave little room for any joint ventures between the US and London exchanges, although Mr King said the LME 'wished the new organisation well'. He said there were often contacts between international exchanges and the LME had a good relationship with Comex. But no specific joint projects had been discussed so far. Mr King refused yesterday to give any indication of what the LME's plans might be, saying it would be unwise to alert the competition. At present the only competition the LME faces in the US is from the Comex copper contract. Copper is deliberately excluded from LME-authorised warehouses in the US so as not to challenge this contract. There is now likely to be increased pressure from some members for the LME to establish copper warehouse facilities in the US, which they see as an important step towards winning more North American copper hedging business. The US accounts for about 25 per cent of the world's non-ferrous metals market activity but only 15 per cent of LME business, so there is obvious scope for business growth there.</p>

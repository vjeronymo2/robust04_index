			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Business customers given priority British Telecommunications is telling its staff not to use the fact that business customers are being given priority over residential customers as an excuse to explain poor service. A memo to regional managers from a customer complaints manager - Mr Brian Hughes in London - says engineers should not tell customers about the priority given to business. It says: 'I have had several customer complaints flagged to me whereby customers are complaining that they have been told by engineers that business is being given priority over residential customers. 'Although I am aware that this is the case, to offer this as the excuse for delayed or failed appointments is not helping the situation. I am requesting your assistance to put a stop to this practice as it is only compounding an already difficult situation.' BT said there were certain clearly-defined areas where business customers were favoured but added that there was very rarely a direct clash of interests between the two types of customer. Telecommunications analysts say the rebalancing of tariffs over recent years has clearly favoured business customers although business does pay a higher rental for individual lines. One analyst pointed out that the favouring of business was not surprising. He said: 'It is perfectly logical and proper for BT to behave like this. They may continue to have a general obligation to all customers but business customers are both more profitable and also much more likely to defect to a competitor organisation.' BT does explicitly favour business in certain areas. The BT service commitment sets stiffer standards for business customers than for residential. If those standards are not met it gives higher compensation to business customers. BT commits itself to clear up all faults within one working day for residential customers but within five hours for business customers. If that goal is not met then a residential customer can claim one month's free telephone rental. A business customer can claim Pounds 25 a day. Further compensation can be claimed if either a residential or business customer can show actual loss incurred. But in the case of a residential customer that compensation is usually capped at Pounds 1,000 compared with Pounds 5,000 for a business customer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 14 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev called on Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic Tuesday  to accept the proposed partitioning of Bosnia-Hercegovina which  he said would lead to economic aid from Russia and the end of  sanctions.    "If you choose war, you will not be able to count on us for  support," Kozyrev warned Karadzic who arrived here Monday to  receive a literary award from the conservative Writers' Union.    The foreign minister said he supported granting Bosnian  Serbs  49.1 percent of the territory in line with the proposed peace  plan but that 70 percent was "much too much".    He told Karadzic that if Bosnian Serbs accept the plan, "you  can count on Russia's firm support," adding that it would lead  to the lifting of sanctions against former Yugoslavia and fresh  economic aid.    Karadzic stated that Bosnian Serbs were "tired" of the  four-year conflict and that they wanted peace.    He thanked the Russian leadership for its support, adding:  "We know that Russia is our friend."    Kozyrev reiterated his call for a second ministerial meeting  to pursue the efforts launched at the first conference held in  Geneva in May.    "This conference lead to the recognition of equal rights for  all peoples of Bosnia," Kozyrev said.</p>

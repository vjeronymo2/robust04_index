			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Victoria chosen by DoE for new HQ The Department of the Environment, which has been striving for years to relocate from its dilapidated Marsham Street headquarters, will announce its new home today: Eland House in Victoria, London, David Lascelles writes. The department's attempt to relocate to London Docklands 18 months ago was thwarted when its 2,000 staff threatened to strike rather than move to the fringes of east London. Eland House, in Stag Place, is close to Victoria Station, one of London's busiest commuter stations, and less than a mile from Marsham Street. Staff unions indicated last night that Eland House's central location would make it acceptable to their members. The building, an undistinguished 1960s office block, has been empty for two years, but its owner, Land Securities, has been preparing plans to refurbish it along with a recently acquired neighbouring school site. The department is understood to be insisting that the redesign incorporate a number of 'green' features appropriate to its governmental mission. Marsham Street, a vast post-war office development which has been described as the ugliest building in London, would cost more than Pounds 50m to repair, and the department decided several years ago that it would rather move out and demolish the property. The building's other occupant, the Department of Transport is making separate relocation plans.</p>

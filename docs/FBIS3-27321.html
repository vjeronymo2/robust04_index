Rong said that although there were at one time setbacks,  Sino-French relations have been on a normal track in general  since the two countries set up diplomatic ties 30 years ago.    He hoped that the two countries' relations will be further  bolstered on the basis of non-interference in each other's  internal affairs, mutual respect and mutual benefit.    Monory visited China in 1987 when he was French education  minister. He said his current China tour is to strengthen the  friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries.    The French Senate president also expressed the belief that  the cooperation between the two countries will be enhanced.    Rong noted that the upcoming China visit by French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur is very important in the development  of Sino-French ties.    Monory said: "The new French Government is quite aware of  the  importance of its relations with China and Prime Minister  Balladur attaches great importance to the cooperation with  China."    He added: "I hope his China tour will be a success."    Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of  the  Chinese National People's Congress, was present in the meeting.</p>

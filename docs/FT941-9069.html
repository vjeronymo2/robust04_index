			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Investors go for safety first in volatile environment European government bonds had another volatile day, with the higher-yielding markets posting the largest losses and the core markets benefiting from their perceived status as safe havens amid widespread nervousness. 'In this volatile environment, investors opt for safety-plays in the core markets,' said Mr Andre de Silva, a market strategist at Paine Webber in London, noting that the yield premiums on Italian, Spanish and Swedish bonds over German bunds have widened significantly over the past two weeks. In the UK, gilts ended a choppy session slightly lower despite encouraging economic data. Gilt futures hit the day's high after the release of much weaker-than-expected December manufacturing output and industrial production figures, but drifted lower as follow-through cash buying failed to materialise. The announcement of the terms for next week's gilt auction had little impact on the market, although traders were cheered by the size of the auction, which was at the low end of market expectations. Otherwise, the details were in line with forecasts: the Bank will auction Pounds 2.5bn of the existing 7 per cent gilt due 2001 next Wednesday. The issue will be partly paid, with 50 per cent payable on April 11, and is Free of Tax to Residents Abroad (Fotra). When-issued trading began yesterday. Gilt traders today will focus on the announcement of the January retail prices index and retail sales data. German bunds saw another trendless day amid thin volume as parts of Germany were closed for a holiday. The bund future fell on comments from Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, who said that he did not expect German interest rates to decline in the near term. Although the D-Mark firmed against the dollar and some ERM currencies, few market participants expect the Bundesbank to lower interest rates at its council meeting on Thursday as long as the pay dispute in the engineering sector continues. Italian and Spanish bonds continued to slide as investors shifted into lower-yielding core markets. The Italian futures contract on Liffe dropped by 0.97 point to 116.27, pressured by the 10-year bond auction, where the yield rose to 7.59 per cent from 7.36 per cent at the previous auction in January. The Madrid-based Spanish bond future fell by 0/70 point to 104.98. Prices remain pressured by recent bearish inflation indicators and selling by overseas investors. Supported by the weak stock market and the strong yen, Japanese government bonds continued their recent rally but late profit-taking erased most gains, leaving them only slightly firmer at the close. Nevertheless, Mr Mark Hale, senior economist at Sakura Finance, expects the yield on the JGB No. 157 to ease to 3.20 per cent to 3.25 per cent in the near term, from 3.385 per cent currently, aided by the strong currency, more evidence of the economy's weakness and an accommodating money-market stance by the Bank of Japan ahead of year-end on March 31. US Treasury bonds held steady yesterday as the dollar stabilised against the yen and two readings on the economy produced no surprises. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 97 11/32 , with the yield at 6.448 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note also showed no change at 99 7/32 , to yield 4.403 per cent. Bonds across the maturity range held close to their opening levels despite underlying concern over trade relations between the US and Japan. The long end had slumped in the previous session after tensions between the two triggered a downturn in the value of the dollar against the yen. But the US currency firmed yesterday, easing fears the Japanese investors would sell off their dollar-denominated holdings. The longer-dated securities drifted higher, but eased later in the afternoon. The day's economic news was largely in line with expectations. The Federal Reserve reported January industrial production up 0.5 per cent, against a revised 0.9 per cent in December. Capacity utilisation, which is keenly watched as a measure of inflationary potential, edged up to 83.1 per cent, from 82.9 per cent the previous month. Neither set of data was conclusive enough to influence sentiment.</p>

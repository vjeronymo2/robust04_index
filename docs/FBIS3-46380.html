Wu told a press conference held here today by the  Information  Office of the State Council that on January 16, 1992, China  reached a memorandum of understanding on the issue of  intellectual property rights protection with the United States.  China has kept its words in the memorandum thoroughly, which  the U.S. side also admitted.    Till now, the Law on Trademarks, the Patent Law, and the Law  on Copyright have been passed in China, and its Law on  Trademarks conforms to the Paris Convention for the protection  of industrial property, of which China is the 95th member  country.    Since China signed the Madrid agreement for the  international  registration of trademarks, about ten thousand foreign  trademarks have been protected in China.    Moreover, China has also signed the Berne Convention for the  protection of literary and artistic works, and the universal  copyright convention.    When answering a question about the U.S. view that the  status  of China's intellectual property rights protection posed another  obstacle to America-Chinese ties, Wu said that the U.S.  Government neither knows nor understands China's positive  practice in this regard.    She added that it is not wise to try to impose pressure.    Having a vast territory and large population, China  developed  unevenly in different regions on the issue, Wu admitted.    But she added that China will start a comprehensive  education  drive to strengthen its people's sense of intellectual property  rights protection, since all countries, including China, are in  need of protection of intellectual property rights.    Wu said that China will open courts for intellectual  property  rights in some key cities. If evidence of violation of  intellectual property rights were found, both Chinese and  foreigners could sent the cases to court.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Observer: Disney honor How times change. Only a few months ago Walt Disney chairman Michael Eisner was being accused by the French intelligentsia of foisting a 'cultural Chernobyl' on France in the form of his Euro Disneyland theme park. Yet this week he found himself in the Matignon Palace in Paris, receiving the honorary title of Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur from Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister. If it seems a little strange that the Disney chairman should have received the French government's blessing so soon after the 'Chernobyl' eruption, it should be remembered that the French government is not exactly stingy when it comes to dishing out honours, especially when there are jobs on the line. Who knows one day Eisner may follow in the footsteps of the great Walt Disney himself and be promoted into the officier class?</p>

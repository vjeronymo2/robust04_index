			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov by </F> Nikolay Leontyev; place and date not given: "A Slow-Moving Civil  War Is Under Way"]    [Text] A. Lukyanov is in no need of any special  introduction. He became particularly well known as chairman of  the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and as M. Gorbachev's perestroyka  associate. A former leader of the disintegrated CPSU, he is now  a deputy of the State Duma from the slate of the new communist  party--the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.    [Leontyev] Anatoliy Ivanovich, how do you evaluate the  Duma's  work?    [Lukyanov] The State Duma and the Federal Assembly as a  whole  have sensed quite rapidly that they cannot linger over  organizational matters and must embark as quickly as possible on  a resolution of the problems which are troubling the people.  This process has begun, it is moving quite actively. The Duma  has also taken up questions of payment of the arrears to the  peasantry and the structural reorganization of industry and  national problems and questions of protection of research and  the child and many international problems. So all this is taking  place. But at the same time I understand full well that the  powers of the Duma and the Federation Council are very, very  limited. They cannot tackle much by virtue of the constitution  that was adopted by only one-third of the population of the  country and that was foisted on our society. I cannot yet say,  therefore, that there will be big results from the Duma's work.    [Leontyev] With which factions are you prepared to  cooperate?    [Lukyanov] I am a member of the Russia's Way group of  deputies, and we are prepared to cooperate with any faction in  the Duma that defends Russia's interests and contributes to at  least some slowing of the country's decline into the abyss of  crisis.    [Leontyev] Is the formation of a bloc of all patriotic  forces  possible?    [Lukyanov] Such a bloc has already been formed. It is called  Accord in the Name of Russia. It includes the Agrarians, the  Communists, and leading figures of the Democratic Party, the  Free Russia People's Party, and the Russian National Union, that  is, of the most important public associations. In terms of  numbers the bloc is superior to all other associations put  together. This is a hand proffered the president.    [Leontyev] What is your attitude toward Zhirinovskiy's  party?    [Lukyanov] One of composure. I believe that V.V.  Zhirinovskiy's party is very diverse in terms of its composition  and the positions of the people who are members of it. To take  the program principles of this party, they largely coincide with  the program principles of Russia's Choice. For example, V.V.  Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice concertedly support this  constitution, while the parties of the left, the communists  included, are opposed. Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice are for  stringent and strong presidential power. Many communists are  altogether opposed to the institution of a presidency in Russia.  In their view, it corresponds neither to our mentality nor to  our traditions. The LDPR, like Russia's Choice also, agreed, on  the whole, to the exclusion from the constitution of the term  "sovereignty" as applied to the components of the Federation.  Zhirinovskiy altogether proposes that Russia be divided into  provinces. The communists, like the Russia's Way group also,  have a more balanced position.    [Leontyev] Do the terms "province" and "oblast" really have  a  different semantic content?    [Lukyanov] It is not a question of the name but of the fact  that Russia should not have national-territorial division.    [Leontyev] Perhaps this would lessen the interethnic  discord,  and the peoples would cease their disputes as to whom this  territory or the other belongs?    [Lukyanov] It is a complex issue. Entirely different forms  became a part of Russia: the Bukhara Emirate and the Khiva  Khanate, the parliamentary Republic of Finland and the Kingdom  of Poland, Estland, in which serfdom was abolished almost 50  years earlier than it was in Russia, and others. Entirely  different components, but they were formed with regard to the  national composition of the population. There were the Turkestan  and Transcaucasus governorships general.... Account had to be  taken of the nationality factor after October 1917 also,  otherwise the country would have fallen apart. The concentration  of production, integration, and the economy as a whole would, in  principle, develop better were there simply  administrative-territorial division with the existence in a  number of places of national-cultural autonomy. But such are the  specific features of Russia. And it is not a question of names  here, it is simply necessary to take account of the social and  economic features of the country and its national composition:  More than 130 nations and national groups live here.    [Leontyev] And if each national group conceives a desire for  its own statehood, will this not signify a constant struggle for  a recarving of borders and interminable conflicts?    [Lukyanov] There was none of this in the Soviet Union. A  certain consensus was found. Saying that the national-state  division of the country inevitably causes conflicts is, from my  viewpoint, improper. There could be conflicts in certain cases.  But there are political and other solutions also.    [Leontyev] How do you evaluate the present situation in the  country?    [Lukyanov] Extraordinarily complex. A slow-moving civil war  is under way, in the outlying areas particularly. We are  undergoing several revolutions simultaneously: geopolitical,  which has cast Russia to the back of beyond, and social, when 5  percent of the wealthiest strata of society has emerged and more  than 35 percent are on the verge destitution and when Western  individualist and egotistic aspirituality has been foisted on  society. It will be extraordinarily difficult to find general  agreement in this division: There is social discord in society,  and the president, with his statement concerning the need for  social accord and civil peace, may be heard by far from  everyone. Qualitative changes in policy and the abandonment of  shock therapy are essential for such peace to be lasting and  stable.    [Leontyev] How do you evaluate the personality and activity  of the president?    [Lukyanov] I have known him as an individual for a long  time.  As far as the president's activity is concerned, its essence  consists to a considerable extent of the pursuit of a policy  which expresses the interests of the "new Russians" who are  coming to power in coalescence with mafia circles and orienting  themselves toward Western capital. But I do not believe that it  will be that simple to impose the ideas and practice of  capitalization: Russian conciliarism, spirituality, community  living, and collectivism are too deeply ingrained in us. I am  sure that neither American jeans nor European sleeveless jackets  will suit the living mighty Russian organism.    [Leontyev] Will you be running in the presidential  elections?    [Lukyanov] I have given absolutely no consideration to this  step. I am a lawyer. A doctor of legal sciences. Each person  should operate in the sphere he knows best: I am in the right  place in parliament.    [Leontyev] Who might the next president of Russia be?    [Lukyanov] I am opposed to the institution of the presidency  altogether. A collective president, such as the Supreme Soviet  Presidium was, handled these functions. The foisting on Russia  of an independent presidential office counterposed to parliament  and the elective authorities, especially the elevation of the  president above all branches of power, corresponds, from my  viewpoint, neither to national traditions nor to genuine  democratism.    [Leontyev] You believe that the present constitution is of a  temporary nature?    [Lukyanov] I believe that sooner or later the people will  understand that society needs a constitution that is supported  by the majority of the population, not one-third of it.    [Leontyev] How, in your opinion, will events develop  further?    [Lukyanov] It will all depend on how realistically the  government evaluates the current situation and the mood of the  populace and how quickly the authorities understand that it is  essential to change the policy of "shock therapy." Its  abandonment is inevitable. Fundamental changes are needed. The  opposition is not calling for backward moves here but it is  convinced that the reforms should serve the good of the people,  the majority of the people, not their impoverishment.    [Leontyev] What needs to be done for an improvement in  people's lives?    [Lukyanov] The president told us in his message, having  adopted statements that have been made repeatedly by the  opposition: Government regulation of the entry into the market,  government control of prices, if only of the basic prices, of  energy particularly, a strengthening of the social focus of each  step of the state and the reforms, stimulation of the  investments of national capital in the development of the native  economy, not in foreign banks, and protection of the interests  of Russia and its wealth are essential.    [Leontyev] Do you believe in the reconstitution of the  Union,  as before?    [Lukyanov] I am sure that the great community of peoples  living on our territory will necessarily be victorious, will  necessarily be reconstituted, and that there will be a new,  renewed Union. In other forms, possibly, but it will necessarily  happen.    [Leontyev] On what are you working currently?    [Lukyanov] There is much work in the Duma, in the  Legislation  Committee, of which I am a member. Much time is spent on work in  my group of deputies, it being necessary to interact with  various factions. I receive a tremendous number of letters from  all regions, incredible for one man, and I have to work on these  also. In addition, a resumption of the trial is possible. I have  to prepare for this also.    [Leontyev] What were your prison conditions like?    [Lukyanov] I was in Matrosskaya tishina. Perfectly normal  conditions, although I spent six months in solitary. The  attitude was quite calm, restrained, benevolent, and I do not,  therefore, paint prison in total black. Gandhi said: "Every  politician should spent some time in a national prison."    [Leontyev] Who shared your cell?    [Lukyanov] One person, who ultimately said that he had been  planted there specially. We had a normal relationship.    [Leontyev] The downfall of the CPSU and socialism: Was this  logical or historical chance?    [Lukyanov] We need to separate the demolition of the CPSU  from the downfall of socialism. Socialism and communism will  live.... I believe that in our country socialism was realized in  an early phase. Sooner or later a society of social justice will  be built. It will be popular and nonbureaucratized and will have  a democratic system of government. And, generally, what is  currently called the postindustrial society is to a considerable  extent a society that has imbibed and continues to imbibe many  principles of socialism. Production itself, the economy itself  socialize society.    [Leontyev] How do you assess the personality of Lenin?    [Lukyanov] Lenin was a child of his time, and all his  publications, merely a particle of his life. Lenin cannot be  detached from his cause, his gentry family, his beliefs, and his  activity abroad. We must take him as he was. As a whole, he did  for Russia, for the people, a great deal, particularly for the  people who had been humiliated for centuries: for the workers  and peasants.    [Leontyev] Do you idealize Vladimir Ilich?    [Lukyanov] No. I view him objectively: I have been through  many of his documents which are quite frightening, quite  painful. But politics is politics. An icon should not be made of  any politician.    [Leontyev] Do you support Lenin's reburial?    [Lukyanov] This would be blasphemy. Lenin is buried in  practice, his body is below ground level. He left no testament  on this matter. Do people want yet a further inflammation of  passions? The authorities could take this step, of course, but  there would not be the support among the bulk of the people.  There would probably be people who want this, but they would be  the minority.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: An uncertain new year ahead THE 1992 period will probably go down as one of the most volatile years of currency trading since the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates collapsed in the early 1970s, writes James Blitz. In spite of the quiet trading of recent weeks, however, there is no reason to suppose that 1993 will bring a sustained period of calm. For most of the last 12 months, dealers in foreign exchange markets have been obsessed with two burning questions: is the US set for a sustained economic recovery? And will the Bundesbank seriously ease German monetary policy? The first question is finding answers. Every new day brings evidence that the US economy is set to grow this year. This week, the US consumer confidence index rose to 78.3 per cent in December from 65.6 per cent the previous month. The leading indicators jumped to 0.8 per cent in November from October's 0.5 per cent. But the market is as divided over the Bundesbank's intentions as ever. The case for expecting an early easing in monetary policy - and a weakening of the D-Mark - is strong. According to the Ifo institute, Germany is set for a 0.5 per cent fall in GDP this year. In these circumstances, the Bundesbank has strong reasons to cut interest rates early in the 1993 first quarter. 'Failure to do so will intensify the extent of the economic slump in Germany, as well as breaking the current parity structure in the exchange rate mechanism,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London. The spectre of inflation and high monetary growth, however, still hangs over the German central bank. In the spring, few economists would have believed that a  1/4 percentage-point cut in the Lombard rate was all that the Bundesbank would yield by New Year's Day. And even now, it can be argued that monetary easing is as far off as ever. The market was excited by the Bundesbank president's pre-Christmas comment that long-term interest rates could fall to 6 per cent by the end of 1993. But one European central banker said this week that bond dealers would only trade lower long-term rates if they believed the central bank had definitely cracked the inflationary spiral - which may only happen if Germany's short-term rates remain high. He added: 'This Bundesbank president does not want to go down in history as the one who prematurely succumbed to pressure to relax the reins on monetary supply.' As in the case of 1992, the 1993 year may be all about guessing how - and when - the Bundesbank will turn.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Milan magistrates make further arrest Mr Attilio Bastianini, one of three deputy leaders of Italy's small Liberal Party, was arrested by Milan magistrates on corruption charges yesterday, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The arrest of Mr Bastianini, a 50-year-old lecturer at Turin's prestigous Politecnico, was based on allegations of receiving L250m (Pounds 110,000) in relation to a contract with Anas, the state roads authority. Anas contracts now constitute the largest single area of investigation by magistrates nationwide, and this week were responsible for raising to 65 the number of parliamentarians currently under investigation for corruption-related offences. Meanwhile, Belgian justice officials have requested the assistance of their Italian colleagues to resolve the mysterious assassination in July 1991 of Mr Andre Cools, the Belgium Socialist deputy premier. The killing is now believed to be related to a pay-off of L70bn on the L550bn contract to supply 46 Augusta helicopters to the Belgian armed forces. The Belgian authorities have interviewed in recent days Mr Giuseppe Cortese, production manager at the time of Augusta, the helicopter manufacturer owned by Efim, the Italian state holding company controlled by the Socialist Party and now in liquidation. According to leaks from Milan magistrates, Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, is due to be questioned soon about the helicopter sale by Belgian judicial authorities.</p>

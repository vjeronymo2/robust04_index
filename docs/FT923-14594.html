			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (37): 'Everything gets hyped' - Software development THE delegates at a Nato conference in 1968 bequeathed to the computer industry something far more valuable than any item of 1960s hardware. They left a philosophy and a name: software engineering. The chief concern at the conference was how should large scale software systems be built in the 1960s? Significant projects of the day missed their deadlines, sometimes by years, and they often failed to stay within budget. The answer, said Nato, was software engineering, an array of development technologies to make computer programming a true engineering discipline, no longer a black art. Two decades later, the real cost of developing software is still immense. By 1995, world-wide software development costs, growing at about 12 per cent a year, are expected to top Dollars 450m. Even small improvements in productivity can still significantly reduce costs, especially in the area of large real-time systems, those used in avionics and manufacturing systems, for instance. With the emphasis firmly on engineering, rather than intuition, it is not surprising that software developers have now become adept at devising and using software tools to help them in their task. These can be project management programs or relational database management systems, sometimes known has fourth generation languages. However, many programmers put too much emphasis on tools at the expense of the programming methods which they support, methods such as SSADM and Yourden. With greater software developments taking place on pan-European projects, it is in the everyone's interest to talk the same development language, and to this end a Euro-method has been on the table for years. As usual, however, Euro-infighting has stalled any decision. Britain is calling for more elements from the British method, SSADM, while France prefers the chic of its method, Merise. As yet there is no sign of compromise. The most discussed formal programming style of recent months is object-oriented programming which can be used to dived large programming tasks into manageable chunks. It can also 'hide' certain information, generating opaque software bases that do not allow the user to see beyond them. A simplistic view of an object-oriented environment would be Apple Macintosh's graphic user interface, where users can move files and data around without knowing exactly what or where the data really are. Vendors are promoting object-oriented techniques fiercely and this in itself may turn off some potential buyers, says Barry Daniels, head of consultancy at the National Computing Centre's software engineering section: 'I think it has suffered a lot of hype, but it's hype with a bit of substance behind it.' One of the reasons developers feel good about object-oriented techniques is the news that IBM and Apple have committed Pounds 2bn to a joint venture, Taligent, to develop Pink, Apple's previously proprietary object-oriented environment. Other vendors are working on object-oriented development systems, or object-oriented interface builders, says Apple, which only attack one part of the problem. Next's Nextstop environment, for example, is object-based, but only deals with a small part of the application developing the user interface. 'The Taligent system, however, is a whole new environment for developing software but it will be 1995 and beyond before it achieves any critical mass in the market,' says Steve Everhard, Apple's national and corporate marketing manager. Some users might therefore see the venture as an attempt to lock users into Apple or IBM product lines, for fear they will be barred from taking advantage of future developments. Mr Everhard disagrees - 'this is not a market-stalling activity. This is not an architectural announcement that's intended to stifle the market. Quite the opposite. What we're intending to do is give companies and users confidence that they won't be excluded, on a technology standpoint, from what we're doing in the future.' Barry Daniels at the NCC sees the joint venture from a different perspective: 'IBM put the PC on to the market place, but MS-Dos took over from PC-Dos. In addition, OS/2 hasn't taken off and Microsoft's Windows 3 is around. So IBM, corporately, hasn't got much to offer that competition. Then it sees Apple being fairly successful in some markets and maybe that's the answer: an alliance between the two.' In other words, the deal with Apple is nothing more than a quick fix to keep users tied to an IBM growth path. Whatever the industry's view of the IBM-Apple venture, there is little doubt that object-oriented programming will have a large part to play in software development. Oracle, the US relational database vendor, has launched object-oriented extensions to its SQL tools. However, it felt reassurance was in order for users attending the European Oracle Users Group in Cannes earlier this year. 'It is very important, as we move to object-oriented technology, that we do not abandon our user base or the investments already made,' says Larry Ellison, Oracle's president and chief executive. Mr Ellison's point about not abandoning investments is sound, for the investment in developing software is substantial: first, in acquiring the tools and the hardware resources to use them, but also in training time. Investment in a hotch potch of tools, no matter what the vendors say, is wasteful and ineffective. But as long as users listen, the hype will continue, because now, almost 25 years after the Nato conference that created software engineering, the software crisis is still here. There is still a need for better tools, techniques and methods and better education and training. Barry Daniels places much of the blame on the software vendors: 'In a sense, I am disillusioned. Everything gets hyped. People make far too many promises, far too early and perhaps far too optimistic benefits from relatively small advances.' 'That is really the frustration. It's a pity, but it does seem to be a fact of life in the IT world.'</p>

Speaking at the closing session of the nationwide seminar on  `Judiciary Week,' the Ayatollah noted that if faced with any  case of violation of Islamic human rights inside or outside the  country, the commission "will have the authority to use its  capabiities to settle the problem."    Addressing the participants, Yazdi described as "acceptable"  the body's performance in the past five years, adding that the  judiciary system was looking after people's affairs very  actively in the said period.    Further in his talks, the Ayatollah said that fewer cases  were referred to the state Supreme Court in the past five years  and added that some 33,279 inmates have been pardoned in the  said period.

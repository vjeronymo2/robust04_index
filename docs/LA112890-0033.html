			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETS THAT FOCUS ON GIVING  </P> <P> For socially conscious shoppers who just can't bring themselves to bestow  another fruitcake or necktie this year, the San Gabriel Valley offers a number  of alternative holiday markets.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the markets go to a variety of causes such as the preservation of  the world's rain forests, shelter for the homeless and purchase of clean  syringes for Eastern European hospitals and livestock for villages in far-flung  regions of the world.  </P> <P> Gift-givers make a donation in the recipient's name and receive a greeting card  to leave under the tree.  </P> <P> A $3 donation buys a rabbit, $30 buys a box of syringes, and up to $3,750 buys  a year of job training for a disabled Navajo Indian.  </P> <P> Toys and dolls will also be on sale at markets through a group called Third  World Hand Arts.  </P> <P> Following is a list of some alternative marketplaces in the San Gabriel Valley:  </P> <P> All Saints Episcopal Church will feature opportunities to donate to a number of  relief programs around the world and to the church's own charity projects for  the homeless and the needy; 132 N.

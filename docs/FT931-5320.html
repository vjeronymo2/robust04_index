			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / America searches for the right thing to do: President Clinton is proceeding with caution until a solution to the conflict in Bosnia becomes clearer There is a serious public debate in America over what course the new Clinton administration should take towards the war in Bosnia. It has been heightened this week by the first US air-drops of relief supplies into eastern Bosnia, by more vicious Serbian assaults, by the resumption of peace negotiations at the UN, and even by the suspicion, exacerbated by some typically offensive remarks by Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, that the bombing of New York's World Trade Center last week might have its roots in the Balkans. But it is a debate with more opinions than solutions, as President Bill Clinton, no longer a candidate inclined to argue in favour of intervention on the Moslem side, is finding out. This week alone has seen a catholic range of public commentary. 'The main problem with my idea of limited western intervention to create a fair fight in Bosnia is that I can't sell it to anyone in power.' So wrote, despairingly, Les Gelb, the New York Times's foreign affairs columnist. Even if President Clinton bought his arguments to bomb the Serbs and arm the Moslems, he added, 'he would have a very tough time getting western Europe, Russia or the UN to go along'. In the Washington Post, Henry Kissinger, no less, took a more positive view, though with several caveats about retaining the option to use force. The former secretary of state wrote that 'as a way to devise an honourable diplomatic role for the US . . . the Clinton administration's position on the Bosnia negotiations is extremely skilful and deserves support'. An editorial in the Los Angeles Times neither wept nor thundered. 'The time has come to accept the fact that Serb aggression in Bosnia will not be stopped any time soon', the newspaper observed with resignation. Those with intimate knowledge of Bosnia had their say in breakfast briefings. Fred Cuny, the hard-nosed consultant on humanitarian issues who was influential in persuading the Bush administration to intervene in Somalia, reported that the objective circumstances for a settlement in Bosnia still did not exist because all the warring parties 'unrealistically think they can still win'. He would not arm the Moslems, because it would only make the violence worse, but would compel the Bosnian Serbs to stop shelling Sarajevo. General Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser and old Yugoslavia hand, was sniffy about the air-drops and wary about greater US engagement unless the conflict widened. He would tighten the economic screws on Serbia by helping Romania sustain the Danube river traffic embargo. In the Gulf, he argued, US vital interests were clearly seen and militarily achievable: in Bosnia, no way out for the US ever presented itself while he was involved in policy. He thought that President Clinton was coming round to the same conclusion. This proliferation of different advice attests to the lack of any groundswell of opinion behind a particular course of action comparable to that before the Somali and Kurdish interventions. This week, national attention has been diverted by the violent siege of a heavily armed religious sect in Texas. There has been some vivid reporting from Bosnia, especially by John Burns of the New York Times, but the words and pictures have not always commanded the top of the news lists. To a degree the diffusion of argument has helped the administration, which has been given some time to devise its own policies and to concentrate on its first order of business, the selling of the president's economic programme. But, reflecting Mr Clinton's own compulsion to explain everything, it has, unlike its predecessor, not been reticent in talking about its aims. When Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, announced the new US diplomatic and humanitarian approach to Bosnia three weeks ago, he did so after a long preamble covering past mistakes, moral issues, and a very definite assertion of a US strategic vital interest - not because of the importance of Bosnia itself but because it was a part of Europe, and European security was essential to the US. Last week, Ms Jennone Walker, of the national security council, went further in defining the US commitment to European security. She talked of the imperative of engaging Russia as an active military partner not only in the Balkans but elsewhere in continental conflict resolution alongside US troops and in various combinations involving Nato, the Western European Union, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the United Nations. But the hypothetical generalities of a new European security order do not specifically address the difficulties of coming up with a workable and particular Bosnian plan. The air-drops are, the administration concedes, only a supplement to ground convoy relief, though symbolically important because they demonstrate the US willingness to get involved. The New York negotiations are trickier. While assigning Reginald Bartholomew, the veteran diplomat, to participate in the Vance-Owen peace process, the administration is publicly sceptical about the Bosnian 'map' drawn up by the UN and EC negotiators. Mr Christopher bluntly said that it needed simplifying. The moral reservations - that Serbian aggression and ethnic cleansing are being rewarded - are much less than the practical considerations of the extent of the US role in monitoring a peace agreement covering 10 semi-autonomous provinces with disputed borders. Aware of the beckoning quagmire, Mr Christopher insisted that the US contribution to peacekeeping operations might place greater emphasis on air power and not require as many as 15,000 ground troops. But that number is still the minimum working hypothesis in the UN and it represents a US deployment that the administration would find hard to sell politically and to its own military high command. Every time Mr Clinton and his secretary of state are questioned over Bosnia, they are asked about how many US ground forces are going to be put at risk. Mr Christopher has frankly admitted that Serb territorial gains were unlikely to be rolled back completely in any settlement requiring Serb signature. Swallowing this reality might be difficult, but Mr Cuny makes the point, which the negotiators may explore, that the Moslems still hold most of the valuable agricultural, mineral and commercial land, which, if retained, could form the basis of a viable new Bosnia within defensible borders. But a settlement is not in place and is even further from guaranteed acceptance by the warring parties. In its absence, as Messrs Clinton and Christopher repeatedly make clear, the option of doing nothing has been rejected not only for humanitarian reasons but because if the US is not active nobody else will fill the void. Only the US can get a positive Russian contribution: only the US can ginger a rudderless Europe into doing more than mostly wringing its political hands; only the US has the muscle to ensure that the frontline relief work of the UN High Commission for Refugees under Mrs Sadako Ogata, be recognised and lifted above the morass of UN bureaucratic infighting. And, as a moving report by Mr Burns from beseiged Goradze attested, the US is also uniquely qualified to bring hope where it matters most. 'To those who often eat no more than a slice of bread a day, all the cavilling that has greeted the air-drop seems irrelevant.' Yet his newspaper buried his account on an inside page, an editorial judgment which reflects how hard it is for Americans to sense what is the best thing to do in Bosnia. It is no wonder Mr Clinton is proceeding with caution.</p>

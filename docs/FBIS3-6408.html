			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Sin Chong-nok: "The Defense Industry </F> Shaken to the Foundations"]    [Text] "The government should take it over or do something.  We are at the end of our tether," says the owner of a mid-level  defense firm who is up to the ears in trouble these days. He  continues:    "The defense budget cut has led to continuous falls in the  Office of Supply procurement. Exports also have been on the  downtrend since the latter half of the 1980's due to the  technological stagnation and the constant checking by the United  States. We simply cannot make both ends meet. Factories remain  idle but wages nearly doubled over the past few years. Still,  because of the peculiarities of defense industry, we find it  difficult to convert to another industry."    The Korean defense industry is reeling to its foundations.  And academia and research groups are warning, in increasingly  loud voices, that it "must not be left as it is."    According to informed sources, the situation apparently is  more critical than generally thought. The confirmed average rate  of operation of defense firms in 1992 was as low as 53 percent.  The number of workers moving to other industries has also been  on the increase; some 1,500 of them left the defense industry in  1992 alone. They were either separated in reduction-in-force  actions or changed their employment. It is known that many firms  are on the brink of close-down. A well-known company recently  moved part of its operations to the United States to find a way  of exporting to third countries, averting U.S.-imposed  restrictions. Exports, which earned as much as $400 million to  $500 million in the mid-1980's, have plummeted to a $100 million  level in recent years. General trading companies have sharply  reduced their operations for arms and equipment exports.  Currently, while only two or three of them, including Kolon,  maintain their old levels, most of those companies have at most  four or five employees assigned to defense industry export  business.    The government procurement of weapons and equipment from  defense firms in the country was 1 trillion 300-odd billion won  [W] in 1992, a drop by more than 30 percent from the 1991 level.  The downtrend continued in 1993, it is known. The reason is  that, as a result of improvement in the Northeast Asian  situation and further democratization in Korea, which spurred  demand for increased welfare spending, the defense spending was  forced, relatively, to a standstill. Another factor was that as  the Ministry of National Defense [MND] focused on high-tech  equipment in its arms procurement program, purchase orders kept  shrinking for domestic firms whose production capabilities were  limited to basic arms and shells.    This led straight to falls in the firms' sales. The "A"  firm,  a leading shells firm, capable of producing 300 billion  won-worth shells, turned out only 120 billion won-worth in 1993.  The "S" company, a mid-level firm which needs 25 billion won in  annual sales to stay in business, had only 8 billion won in  sales from government procurement in 1993. The plight is the  same of chaebol [conglomerates] defense firms. In the  case of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry Co., mainly producing  T-88  tanks, it had 190 billion won in annual sales from government  procurement until 1992, when the sales fell to 120 billion won.  Its 1993 sales are known to have dropped further.    The situation is worse with exports. The nation's arms  exports once registered more than $400 million in small arms and  shells alone in the early 1980's. It did not include clothing  and other outfits. The amount has continued to shrink since the  latter half of the 1980's, falling below the $100 million mark  in 1992, according to industry estimates. Meanwhile,  defense-related organizations estimate the 1992 exports at $20  million or so. The reported $25 million-worth export last year  of "K-200 Korea-type armored cars" to Malaysia by Daewoo Heavy  Industries turned out to be not an export in fact. The fact,  according to reports, is that the Korean government provided--at  Washington's request--the armored cars in support of Malaysian  combat troops sent to Somalia, and that in doing so, it took the  form of export.    There are, roughly, two reasons for the sharp decline in  exports since the latter half of the 1980's. One is the  increasingly tight restrictions imposed by U.S. authorities on  guard against growth of the Korean defense industry, and the  other is the industry's technological stagnation. In respect to  high value-added equipment, Korea is totally under U.S. control  under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) of the annual  Korea-U.S. Security Consultation Meeting (SCM). In other words,  its access to export itself is blocked. As for lower-class  products such as bullets, Korea had to lose the markets to  developing nations, such as China and Malaysia known for low  labor costs, because of the sluggish technological development  since the 1980's.    These developments are in part attributable to the global  easing of the Cold War. As a result of the easing, the defense  spending has continued to drop the world over since 1990. The  1990 world defense spending marked a 5% drop from the  previous  year, and 1991 marked another 3% fall to $921 billion. The  decline continued in 1992--to an estimated $800 billion.  International arms trade also has continued to shrink by more  than 20% every year. Japan virtually has been the only  exception to the downtrend in defense spending. In major defense  industry countries like the United States, France and Russia,  the large-scale restructuring of defense industry is causing  continued mergers and close-downs of firms. In the maelstrom,  600,000 workers have lost their jobs in the United States since  1989.    It can hardly be denied that the current plight of defense  firms in Korea should be seen in the light of this global  restructuring. At the same time, however, interested parties are  unanimous in viewing the policy shift--away from the defense  industry buildup by the Fifth and Sixth Republic governments--as  the cause directly responsible for the present situation.    The view generally accepted is that the Korean defense  industry was founded in 1970, when President Pak Chong-hui,  stunned by the 1969 commando assault on Chongwadae by Kim  Sin-cho, instructed the formulation of a "10-year defense  industry development plan." The National Defense and Science  Institute [NDSI] was thus established, and the Defense Industry  Council was created under the president's direct control. The  council decided to begin where domestic production was possible,  such as that of ammunition and communication equipment,  selecting 20 firms for that purpose. The industry, combined with  heavy chemical industry development policies in the mid-1970's,  was on the rise. It developed the assembly capabilities for  conventional weapons such as guns, tanks and helicopters in the  late 1970's. It even began exporting products like M-16's and  parts of communication electronics to Iran and the Philippines.  The industry was the "goose laying golden eggs," bringing in big  money.    The trend made a turnaround in the Fifth Republic. The  government, pursuing a basic "economic stability program," saw  the excessive investment in the heavy chemical industry as the  culprit of inflation. As a natural development, the defense  industry was taken off the priorities list. The Defense Industry  Council was dissolved and procurement from domestic firms stayed  flat. Some research institutes went out of existence. The  downtrend is still on.    "In the general view of researchers, the nation's defense  technology today has nothing much different from what it was in  the 1980's. Responsible for this are both the government  remaining indifferent to changes and the defense firms that  spent their earnings of the 1970's not for research and  development but to buy land," says an NDSI researcher.    The problem is that consequences are not confined to  deteriorations in the payments position of some defense firms.  Experts note that even in the basic weapons branch, the  possibility cannot be ruled out of a collapse of an adequate  production capability itself, either for wartime or peacetime.  Further, under the present circumstances, it seems to be  fundamentally impossible to expect domestic defense firms to  perform a positive role in the building of independent high-tech  weapons systems.    Defense industry is a key state industry in most of the  nations, because it not only has big pervasive technological  effects on high-tech industries but also contributes greatly to  creating jobs. This explains why those nations are intensifying  protectionism for their defense industries against the  optimistic trends of the post-Cold War. The U.S. F-17 is about  four times the cost of the Russian MIG counterpart.  Nevertheless, the U.S. Government buys the American product. The  Japanese Government also pays four times the international price  to procure T-17 tanks from Japanese makers. Major Japanese  defense firms such as Hitachi and Mitsubishi receive 400 million  yen to 500 million yen in technology development subsidies from  the government every year.    The Korean defense industry is in a critical conversion  period now. Interested parties are unanimous in pointing out  that it should come out of the conventional manufacturing of  basic arms and convert to high-tech fields for more pervasive  effects in technology. However, firms are already too weak at  the moment to tide over the restructuring period.    Chi Man-won, a military affairs expert, says that "strategy  for the survival of domestic defense firms should be found not  in a hasty push for domestic production but in developing  specialties in the production of parts and tie-ups with foreign  companies." "More important, however," he noted, "is to improve  the administrative system which is now so inefficient that  papers sent to the MND take months to reach the intended  offices."    Paek Yong-hun, director of the Korea Industrial Development  Institute and chairman of the Defense Industry Society, said:  "We are in the Uruguay Round age in which subsidies to protect  domestic industries are totally abolished; however, as far as  defense industry is concerned, subsidizing it is unlikely to  cause any international controversy, because advanced nations  like the United States, Japan and Germany are all subsidizing  their defense industries to protect them." "The government  should not try to cut the defense spending blindly but keep it  at adequate levels and, in particular, increase the budget for  technology development sharply," he stressed.    Currently, there are 84 defense firms in Korea. Cooperative  firms included, the number will be nearly 300. The number of  workers in the 84 firms alone is about 26,000. The Stockholm  International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates the  Korean defense industry manpower at 40,000. The SIPRI number,  however, seems to include NDSI and other researchers plus  employees of some cooperative firms.</p>

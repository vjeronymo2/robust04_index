			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG-DISTANCE ALLEGIANCE;  </P> <P> OWENS VALLEY RESIDENTS TOIL TO REOPEN L.A.'S WATER SPIGOT  </P> <P> It's not that Jim Snead bad-mouths Los Angeles. Still, it's pretty clear that  he doesn't care much for the big city 180 miles south of here, at least not as  a place to live. He tried it, didn't like it and got out.  </P> <P> "Couldn't stand the freeways," he recalled.  </P> <P> That was 25 years ago.  </P> <P> But like plenty of people in the Owens Valley, Snead is an example of how you  can take the boy out of the city, but you can't take the city out of the boy.  Every payday, Snead and about 250 other Owens Valley residents feel a special  allegiance to Los Angeles. What the metropolis gets in return, under normal  circumstances, is water.  </P> <P> Snead is maintenance superintendent for the Los Angeles Department of Water and  Power, and these are not normal circumstances -- not for Los Angeles, not for  Snead, not for Olancha. This speck of a town in the sagebrush nothingness along  U.S. 395 is where nature punished civilization last week with a freak summer  storm that moved millions of tons of the Sierra Nevada down the eastern slope,  burying the artificial river that made Los Angeles what it is today.  </P> <P> Ever since the flash flood hit the night of Aug. 8, it's been up to Snead and  his cohorts to dig the Los Angeles Aqueduct out from under 15 feet of mud,  granite boulders and the occasional splintered pine. A crew of 110 workers have  been toiling round-the-clock to unplug the 76-year-old, 338-mile-long aqueduct  that is supposed to supply Los Angeles with 75% of its water.  </P> <P> At the moment, Los Angeles has been sating its 750-million-gallon-a-day thirst  mostly with water stored in reservoirs south of the aqueduct. The DWP also  temporarily increased its intake from the Metropolitan Water District from 250  million gallons a day to 350 million gallons. The MWD gets its water from the  Colorado River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta state water project.  </P> <P> By Monday or Tuesday, Snead expects to have the aqueduct flowing again. To  laymen who witness the mile of muck, the schedule seems optimistic. But Snead  is confident.  </P> <P> "Our whole purpose being here," he said, "is a day like this."  </P> <P> "You don't wake up saying, 'God, I hope the aqueduct gets filled up with mud,'  " said Mike Daughtry, a 27-year-old DWP worker from Independence. "But I like  to see how hard I can hit it for how long."  </P> <P> Daughtry had just finished a few hours of overtime on what was to be a 12-hour,  all-night shift. Everyone has worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week since  the morning after the flash flood hit, Snead said.  </P> <P> Normally, Olancha Creek comes out of the Sierra as a steady little brook and is  channeled across the aqueduct on a 20-foot-wide concrete bridge called "an  overhead." This time, Olancha Creek was several hundred yards wide.  </P> <P> The night of Aug. 8, there wasn't much to do but assess the situation and get  organized, Snead said. The first call of water spilling over U.S. 395 came at 7  p.m. Within an hour, a DWP foreman was on the scene, and calls were placed to  Los Angeles for more equipment and workers.  </P> <P> "The aqueduct just disappeared," Snead said. "We knew it was down there because  we left it there a couple of days before."  </P> <P> At some places, the 15-foot deep channel held 30 feet of rocks and mud. The  concrete-lined channel was not damaged, but "fossilized," he said.  </P> <P> It was the worst crisis on the aqueduct since a similar flash flood 20 years  ago. A downpour Aug. 10 complicated matters, loosening concrete panels south of  the mud slide and threatening the channel's structural integrity. If the  aqueduct had been filled with water, the pressure would have prevented the rain  from seeping between the earth and the concrete walls of the channel.  </P> <P> The first morning, a command post was formed in an Inyo County road maintenance  yard where the Olancha Volunteer Fire Department is based. A group of DWP heavy  equipment operators came up from Los Angeles to work, their motor homes forming  an impromptu suburb. They dubbed it "Sam's Town" in honor of Sam Bishelli, the  truck and heavy equipment dispatcher.  </P> <P> By reputation, Owens Valley residents are said to resent the way Los Angeles  city slickers took their water rights and built the aqueduct way back when. If  folks here see cosmic justice in the way Olancha Creek stopped the mighty Los  Angeles Aqueduct, Snead doesn't buy it.  </P> <P> "That's a lot of hype," he said. "The response of the whole Valley -- people  offering to help -- has been tremendous. We're all citizens of the county. We  all pull together."  </P></p>

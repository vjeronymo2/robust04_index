			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: JCI group shows sharp increase in earnings LOWER unit costs and a higher gold price helped the three gold mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investments group to a strong advance in profits for the three months ended June, compared with the preceding quarter. After tax and capital spending, group profits rose by 61 per cent to R58.8m (Dollars 17.6m). Western Areas lifted earnings by 102 per cent to R22.2m after tax and capital expenditure; Randfontein rose by 26.7 per cent to R34.4m; and Joel made a profit of R2.2m. The average yield of the mines rose for the sixth consecutive quarter to 4.81 grammes/tonne while unit costs fell to R27,583/kg. The average gold price received rose by 4.2 per cent to R35,181 per kg. For the first time, JCI disclosed its hedging activities. The three mines have hedged about 50 per cent of their production in the year ahead at prices of R36,300 to R37,400 per kg. The current gold price is about R42,440 per kg. Mr Kennedy Maxwell, chairman of the gold and uranium division, said that if current gold prices were maintained, the portion of production hedged would come down 'quite considerably'.</p>

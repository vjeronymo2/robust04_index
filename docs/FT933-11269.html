			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (6): The old order endeth - Japan seeks a new role in the world JAPAN was a sleeping partner in the cold war. It is just starting to wake up to the fact that it is over. Japan's nuclear pacifism meant it was never a direct participant in the nuclear stand off which was central to the cold war. Yet it was active in the wings, as a US ally. The Japanese economy's growth in the 1950s was partly attributable to US spending on the Korean war. In the 1980s the rise in the US federal deficit, partly a result of higher defence spending, also helped the Japanese economy to grow. Throughout the cold war Japan accepted the US foreign policy and security lead. Sheltering beneath this umbrella Japan pursued its main aim to develop its economy. The US accepted that Japan should play this limited role as long as it was a powerful economic and democratic buffer against the expansion of communism in Asia. This rationale for the US relationship with Japan no longer holds good. As a result Japan is having to embark on a painful, slow, highly sensitive search for a new international role. This search involves several components. Most important is a renegotiation of its relationship with the US. This renegotiation has just started with the recently concluded US-Japan framework for trade talks to reduce the ballooning Japanese trade surplus. It may go further into the nature of the security and political alliance between the two countries. The Russian military threat is receding. The US now views Japan as an arch economic competitor. Worse than that there are new tensions in their approach to the post cold war world. The US Clinton administration has championed a more active western engagement with Russian reform. Japan has found this difficult because its territorial dispute with Russian over the islands off the northern tip of Japan is still unresolved. Japan's search for a role is complicated by the changing balance of power within Asia. Japan is more aware of the need for an effective security framework in Asia as the economic and military power of China grows and the fate of communist north Korea remains uncertain. The speed and uncertainty of events in the post cold war world has also exposed Tokyo's foreign policy making. Japan's bureaucracy works best when it has clear precedents to follow to guide its decisions. In the post cold war world of ethnic and nationalist tensions in Europe and Asia such precedents are hard to find or buried in history. So Japan has often been caught out by the speed with which crises have developed, principally the Gulf War in 1991. The immediate focus of Japan's efforts to develop a new world role will be its hopes of becoming a permanent security council member of the United Nations. Japan hopes to gain a permanent seat in 1995. Such a responsibility would force it to make faster, harder decisions about what should be done in moments of crisis. This will almost certainly require more than changes to the way foreign policy is made. It will demand changes of substance as well. Several camps are competing to provide Japan with a new foreign policy lead into the post cold war world. The traditionalists on both left and right believe that Japan is a 'special state'. Its history of wartime aggression and, most important, its subjection to nuclear bombing make it exceptional, the traditionalists argue. They believe Japan should accept as a principle a modest international role because it can never become an international military force, even in the cause of peace. The traders, such as Mr Noahiro Amaya, former vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, see Japan as a commercial democracy. Miti is still the bastion of this view. The traders believe Japan should model itself on the great trading powers of the 15th and 16th centuries, such as the Netherlands. According to this view, Japan is the world's merchant, the US is the world's samurai. Japan should assess diplomatic initiatives against their financial returns. These traditional and trading views of Japan's foreign policy are now being challenged by a new realism, underpinned by a nationalism in Japanese culture, that Japan is different and more successful than many western powers. The new realists are best represented by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-founder of the Japan Renewal Party which made impressive gains in the election. The new realists believe Japan can no longer afford an isolationist pacificism. Its international partners will see it as a free rider, using the world's trading system but doing little to protect it. The realists believe the 1991 Gulf war showed that a cash-based approach to diplomacy does not work. After much debate, Japan contributed Dollars 13bn to a war effort that most Japanese did not support. Yet the nation feels it received only grudging thanks from its international partners, who accused it of dragging its feet. The realists argue that the link with the US should be strengthened: Japan should contribute more to international security through finance, personnel and technology. Japan's political institutions should be reformed to create a two-party political system, which would generate open debate on Japan's foreign policy priorities. Yet, they say, Japan should not simply follow the US. There is a nationalism mixed into their realism. They believe Japan should represent an Asian view of the world, especially on economic issues, where the US and Europe could learn from the Far East's dynamism. The end of the cold war has unleashed nationalism in much of Europe. Such a movement will always remain politically muted in Japan, for fear of rekindling other countries' fears that it harbours imperial ambitions. Yet there is an increasingly powerful sense of national pride in Japan stemming from the contrast between its economic achievements and social stability and America's economic and social malaise, symbolised to many Japanese by the spread of drugs, urban violence and divorce. The Yoshida doctrine was framed when Japan was vulnerable. Japan's future foreign policy, however it is made and whoever will make it, will reflect its growing national confidence. The accession of the new realists into positions of power in Japan will bring benefits and costs for the west. Japan will play a more active world role, but the west will also find it tougher to bargain with.</p>

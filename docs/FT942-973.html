			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Merchant stirs up wool market: Large foreign purchases increase pressure for regulation reform Mr Aidan Walsh, an agricultural merchant from Naas, County Dublin, is causing waves in the British wool market for the second successive year. Last year he bought 100,000 kilos of clip wool - fleeces - directly from farmers. This year he intends to buy 1m kilos, which is about 10 per cent of the total sale in Scotland, where he buys most of his wool. His actions seem certain to increase pressure for the abolition or reform of the marketing arrangements for wool, the last of the commodity markets in the UK to be regulated under laws introduced soon after the second world war to protect food supplies. UK-based dealers are still obliged to buy from the British Wool Marketing Board and are forbidden to buy direct from farmers. Buyers from outside the UK had always been exempt from the marketing board's monopoly. There used to be no point in entering the market, however, because the board controlled prices. But in May last year the Ministry of Agriculture abolished the system of guaranteed prices for farmers. The board nevertheless charges 18p a kilo for sorting, grading, and selling  -and a further 3.5p to collect fleeces from farms. The board's costs have come down sharply since the ending of the guarantee, but they are still substantial. Moreover, the marketing board pays over two years. The farmer, if he drives his fleece to market, is offered a notional 94p a kilo by the board. He pockets 47p immediately, but the second half of the payment depends on next year's price. If the prices rise during the year he may get more than 47p for the second instalment. If prices fall he may get less. Mr Walsh is offering up to 90p a kilo immediately with no risk to the farmer of getting less if the price falls while waiting a year for half the payment. Earlier this year the board was offering cheviot, a top grade, for sale at 112p a kilo - this was the 94p plus its own 18p handling charge. Last year Mr John King, of wool merchants J. &amp; W. Greig of Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, also tried to buy directly from farmers. In July the board won an interdict (injunction) in the Court of Session in Edinburgh preventing him from buying directly. He is trying to get the interdict relaxed, so that his company can act for a Portuguese agent. He said: 'We are sitting here handcuffed and frustrated. You work it out. I buy from the board at 112p a kilo. Mr Walsh buys directly from farmers at 90p. Let's say his transport costs to Ireland then back to Britain for sale to a carpet manufacturer in the Midlands amount to 10p a kilo. He can still undercut me by 12p a kilo - and that is before my costs. 'There is nothing I can do as the law stands.' The ministry and the British Wool Marketing Board believe some form of marketing structure is necessary. Wool, they say, is a by-product of sheep-farming for meat. Unlike milk or eggs, in which the markets have been or are being liberalised, it is produced only once a year, but is sold over 12 months, during which time prices can move substantially. More than half the 93,000 sheep farms in Britain are small and many are in remote areas. The average wool clip is 500 kilos. Small farmers do not have the facilities to grade and sort small clips of mixed wool. Often, they cannot afford to transport it. Mr Ian Hartley, the managing director of the board, has said that if it did not exist many farmers would not bother to bring the wool to market. But in going for 10 per cent of the Scottish market Mr Walsh has clearly raised the stakes. They would be raised even further if other foreign merchants started buying directly in the south of England. Ms Liz Ambler of the marketing board said: 'Obviously there is no room for complacency. But most of the farmers and dealers are happy with the arrangements. 'We have been trying to educate small farmers about costs. They can go up over the year and it is not always wise to sell the entire fleece on day one. It is by no means certain that Mr Walsh will be able to buy as much wool as he wants or to sell it.' The Ministry of Agriculture said there were no plans to change marketing arrangements.</p>

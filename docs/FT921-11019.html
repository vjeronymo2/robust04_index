			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / City status fails to become the talk of the town: This month the Queen is expected to announce the name of the town that will be awarded city status to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession to the throne. Twenty towns are competing. Emma Tucker visits Derby, which was made a city in the Queen's Silver Jubilee year of 1977, to see what - if anything - it has gained from its new status INSIDE the mayor of Derby's stately office a heavy red box conceals a much-coveted document. In ornate script a charter declares that Derby 'shall henceforth have the status of a city and shall have all such rank, liberties, privileges, and immunities as are incident to a city'. 'We still haven't worked out what those are,' shrugs Mr Philip O'Brian, the mayor's secretary. They have had since 1977 to do so. That was when the Queen last granted civic honours to a town - but city status is apparently not all it was once cracked up to be. Indeed the Brightons and Croydons queueing up for the privilege to mark the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession may find the granting of a royal charter something of an anti-climax. There was a time, in medieval England, when a charter gave legal independence and some degree of self-government. Previous charters awarded to Derby gave the town market rights (1154), power to appoint a bailiff and a monopoly in wool dyeing (1204), and power to appoint a coroner (1256). The 1977 charter granting the grander title of city gave no real powers. That is not to say that the people of Derby are indifferent to their enhanced civic status. Councillors and those working in the prosperous business community fall over themselves to tell you what city status has done for Derby. National athletics events and party political conferences have taken place in Derby City, they boast. 'The first ever SDP conference was held in Derby,' says Mr O'Brian. Derby also has enough cinema screens to shame any seaside resort, town or city. Two multiplex centres have given it a total of 20 screens for a population of a quarter of a million. 'Never mind that they all show the same films,' says Mr Paul Farrow, chief executive of the chamber of commerce. At least he can feel safe in Derby, where the movies and 10-pin bowling have kept potential lager louts off the streets. Derby's crime rate has yet to take on city status. Recorded crimes to the end of July were about 16,000. In nearby Nottingham, an old hand at city status, the figure was more than double at 33,173. One thing though, is sure. City status has helped Derby's attempts to escape from under the shadow of Nottingham. 'Derby has always felt inferior to Nottingham,' says Mr Farrow. 'It is much more vibrant and, from that point of view, city status was important. It elevated us to the same level - not the same size, but the same level.' What is more, it has given the once city-less county of Derbyshire a city. Mr Nick Brown, Conservative leader of the city council, believes the title has given the town better economic standing. 'What it has done more than anything is give us more status in economic development and relocation terms,' he says. Next year the prison service will relocate to Derby, generating about 800 local jobs. Toyota, the Japanese car manufacturer, is soon to open a plant there. Derby's status, says Mr Brown, was probably not very significant, but he adds that the Japanese are very conscious of history and culture. Back in the mayor's office, another title is at stake. Derby felt just a little short-changed in 1977 when it discovered that city status did not include Lord Mayor status. So this year it is applying for the title which, if granted, would apparently involve little more than altering Mr Mayor's headed notepaper - the title does not bestow a grander chain or even furrier robes. 'It is a name but it means a lot to us really,' says Mr John Keith, the mayor. 'Derby is the largest-populated city that hasn't got a Lord Mayor.' While the Europeans might not make much of the permutations of mayoral status, Mr O'Brian says the title of city helps when talking to Europeans. 'City gives the impression of infrastructure.' Mr Roger Waterhouse, head of Derby College of Higher Education, says the title is all to do with image. 'Previously you felt that if anybody came here they were doing Derby a favour,' he says. Mr Waterhouse has a vested interest. The college is currently applying for polytechnic status. Under legislation going through parliament, any polytechnic will be able to call itself a university, so the once sleepy town may soon be the proud possessor of the City of Derby University. For all the enthusiastic talk from those running the place, Derby people have a reputation for straight-talking. The mayor warned that out on the street people would be likely to treat city status with healthy scepticism. He was right. 'It hasn't made any difference, to be honest,' said a bemused shop attendant, scratching his head trying to remember 1977. Mr Donald Eddison, who has lived in Derby for 30 years, was less kind. 'City? That's like calling the East Midlands airport international,' he said. WILLIAM HILL, the book-maker, has closed its book on the competition to be a new city. Chelmsford and Brighton are favourites amid rumours that they are the only two to have made a shortlist. The Home Office, which will make the recommendation to the Queen, refuses to confirm that a shortlist exists. It will not discuss the criteria for selection, but three factors will be critical: a population of at least 250,000, some history and trade and cultural significance. Having a cathedral or university is no longer necessary. Other bidders that have had strong backing include Shrewsbury, Blackburn, Wolverhampton, Guildford, Ipswich and Preston. Outsiders include Colchester, Milton Keynes, Northampton, and Croydon. A rank outsider is Telford.</p>

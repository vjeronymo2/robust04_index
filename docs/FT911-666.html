			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / World Trade News: White House recruits key Democrat to 'fast-track' THE prospect for continued negotiations in the Uruguay Round yesterday looked brighter after Congressman Richard Gephardt, the US House majority leader, said he would support President George Bush's request for 'fast-track' negotiating authority. The congressman's support was considered crucial in the administration's embattled effort to get a two-year extension of the 'fast-track' authority, which allows it to negotiate trade treaties the Congress cannot amend. Mr Gephardt said: 'Almost everyone agrees that the Gatt Treaty should be handled expeditiously and without amendments because we recognise that an agreement reached among 107 nations is not amenable to renegotiation.' However, strong opposition has surfaced to giving the president fast-track authority to negotiate a North American Free Trade agreement. Until yesterday, the administration was considered likely to win approval from the Senate, but the result in the House was too close to predict. Mr Gephardt's support was accompanied by an attack on the Reagan and Bush administrations for 'their failure to recognise the world as it is, instead of how their ideologies say it should be.' He insisted the House would renegotiate Nafta if it did not protect US jobs, Mexican workers and the environment. Fast-track progress, Page 14</p>

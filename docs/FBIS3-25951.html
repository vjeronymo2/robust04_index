These procuratorial organs in Shenyang accepted  452 cases of embezzlement and bribes and placed 366 cases on  file for investigation and prosecution. They investigated and  handled 36 economic cases involving party and government organs,  judicial departments, administrative departments, and law  enforcement departments.    (Ma Shiheng), former leader of the armed police brigade  under  the Shenyang city public security bureau, was arrested according  to law on charges of embezzlement for accepting the largest  amount of money ever in the processing of administrative  accounts during his tenure.    On file for investigation and prosecution were cases  involving (Chen Shijie), director of the drug policy and  administration section under the provincial public health  department, and (Liu Shangqian), cadre at the section level of  the provincial public health department, for taking advantage of  their power on numerous occasions to approve new drugs and new  factories in exchange for huge bribes by pharmaceutical  factories and sale centers.

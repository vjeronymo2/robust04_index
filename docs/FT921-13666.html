			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / (CORRECTED) International Capital Markets: European programme trading up sharply Correction (published 22nd January 1992) appended to this article. PROGRAMME trading by UK and continental European fund managers increased sharply last year, and is expected to rise further in the coming 12 months, according to a study from US research and consulting group Greenwich associates. In its latest annual report on the UK and continental broking industries, Greenwich says that nearly a third of UK institutional investors now use programme trading or other portfolio restructuring services. This compares with around a quarter the year before. Greenwich's research also highlights that 22 per cent of British fund managers expect to start programme trading this year. The growth in use of stock index futures by UK institutions has mirrored the growth in programme trading. Research among continental European investors show an even sharper increase. In US shares, some 38 per cent report that they engage in programme trading, compared with only 15 per cent last year. Other findings include: More than half of UK institutions now use soft commission brokers. Last year, the comparable figure was 42 per cent. Greenwich estimates that some 13 per cent of UK equity business is conducted this way. This is up from the 5 per cent of 1989, but still down on the estimated 22 per cent of trades which US institutions channel through soft commission brokers. The decline in net trading by UK institutions has reversed. In 1986, some 46 per cent of trades were conducted net, a proportion which had fallen to as little as 15 per cent three years later. That proportion has increased slightly to 17 per cent. The typical British institution spends almost as much on continental share trades as on British trades. Institutions which contributed to the survey said that last year they spent an average of Pounds 1.1m in commissions on UK trades, down slightly from the previous year and short of the record Pounds 1.6m in 1986. CORRECTION (PUBLISHED 22ND JANUARY 1992). YESTERDAY'S report, 'European programme trading up sharply', was based on research carried out by Greenwich Associates in February and March last year, and the findings related to 1990 rather than 1991.</p>

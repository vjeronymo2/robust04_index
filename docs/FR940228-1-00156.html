What is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix D that isn't in the new regulations already?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New institutions will certify that they will adopt the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulated plan they have in place (that has approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the appropriate State and or accrediting body.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department should reassess the method for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cohort default rate. It is not fair for most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No other criteria is needed.

How should the term ``denial of access to classes'' be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Denial of access'' should mean the student is not given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to equipment or supplies.

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NINTENDO PLANS TO OFFER STOCK TRADING IN HOMES  </P> <P> Fidelity Investments and video game maker Nintendo of America have announced  plans to jointly develop an at-home electronic stock trading service using the  popular video game system.  </P> <P> The new service, expected to become available by mid-1990, is modeled after a  home shopping and information service offered by Nintendo's parent company in  Japan.  </P> <P> The service is based on the premise that the Nintendo game player, which packs  the power of the earliest personal computers yet costs only about $80, can be  used effectively as a home computer when it is attached to another powerful  appliance: the telephone.  </P> <P> Although the stock trading service is the first one to use a video game player,  it is hardly the first at-home shopping and information service. The at-home  market has been tested, with often disastrous results, by a variety of  publishing companies, most of which have abandoned it. The latest venture,  Prodigy, was launched last year by a partnership of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.  and International Business Machines, but acceptance has been slow and the  operation is relying heavily on the deep financial resources of its backers.  </P> <P> The Fidelty-Nintendo venture will give the estimated 20 million U.S. households  with Nintendo game systems access to a wide range of Fidelity's on-line  financial services, including personal portfolio management and stock and  mutual funds trading. Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund operator in  the United States, currently manages more than $100 billion for its mutual fund  and brokerage customers.  </P></p>

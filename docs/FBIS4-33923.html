			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 13 Jun (AFP) -- Official sources in  Port-au-Prince today announced that the Vatican signed an aid  agreement with the government of President Emile Jonassaint (not  recognized internationally). The Haitian Ministry of  Information reported that the agreement, signed on 27 May in  Italy by the Holy See and representatives of the acting Haitian  Government, establishes that the Holy See will deliver 75,000  tons of wheat worth $32 million. A communique issued by the  Ministry of Information states that "the acting president  (Jonassaint), on behalf of the people of Haiti, who have been  subjected to a criminal and unjustified blockade, thanks the  Vatican and Pope John Paul II for their understanding and  growing concern."    According to diplomatic sources in Port-au-Prince, this  agreement recognizes the Haitian regime, installed following a  coup d'etat that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a  priest, on 30 September 1990. The Vatican approved the removal  of Father Aristide from the Salesian Order shortly before he  assumed office "for inciting violence and class struggle." In  1992, the Vatican recognized Joseph Nerette's acting government  (without international recognition).    The Haitian clergy is experiencing serious division between  its hierarchy and some of its rank and file, who are members of  the "Ti Iglesia" and faithful to Aristide. On 7 January 1991,  during a foiled coup attempt led by former "Tonton Macoute"  leader Roger Lafontant, alleged followers of Aristide burned the  Apostolic Nunciature and humiliated the nuncio.    The Catholic Church hierarchy in Haiti has issued periodic  condemnations of the embargo decreed to force Haiti to return  Aristide to power because it believes the sanctions represent  much suffering for the Haitian people.</p>

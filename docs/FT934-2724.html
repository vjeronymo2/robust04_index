			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Come to the 'Cabaret' - Malcolm Rutherford reviews Sam Mendes' new production If this were a real cabaret, you would drop in for the second act which is so incomparably better than the first. Since the Donmar Warehouse is a serious theatre, you have to sit all the way through and take the smooth with the rough. I have been pondering why the first hour or so of this once marvellous musical now seems so passive, yet the second is more explosive than ever. Possibly one reason was first night nerves: there is not much zing in the opening numbers. The auditorium at this most chic of London's theatres has been re-arranged to turn the first rows into cabaret tables. Everything seems to be in place. Then nothing much happens. The master of ceremonies at the Berlin nightclub is played by Alan Cumming, the man who did an electrifying adolescent Hamlet in the same theatre a few weeks ago. He looks wonderful: perfect eye make-up, red around the lower edges. Dressed first in a long black leather coat, only curtailed to give a glimpse of his white socks, then in the black silk underwear of a transvestite, he has kept that finger-wagging approach and way of appealing directly to the audience that he revealed in Hamlet. When he is around all eyes are on him. The trouble is that he is not around all that often. This is a remarkably subdued performance: the MC as the observer rather than the observed. Is that deliberate? If so, it is a triumph of modesty over exhibitionism. Kenneth Branagh in his precocious years would never have been tamed so easily or effectively. Cumming is the new male star of British theatre. Yet perhaps we should pay tribute to Sam Mendes, the young director. It is just possible that he intended the first half to be dull in order to show off later. For perceptions of Cabaret have clearly changed over the years. The story was drawn from the writings of Christopher Isherwood, who lived in Berlin in the 1930s. The original heroine seemed to be Sally Bowles, the girl - drawn from a real-life figure called Jean Ross - who worked the nightclubs in the German capital and wanted to die on the job like her friend Elsie from Chelsea. It may have seemed romantic at the time. Today Sally Bowles looks like a silly, uninteresting little girl, and her American, aspirant novel-writing boy friend, Clifford, less silly but just as stupid. They have moved from being central characters in the show to almost peripheral. There may be some theatrical irony in the casting: Sally is played by Jane Horrocks, the girl who starred in The Rise and Fall of Little Voice. There are compensations in making way for older people. The outstanding character in this production is Fraulein Schneider, played by Sara Kestelman. Those were the days when an unmarried German girl over the age of 15 continued to be addressed as Fraulein ever after. I do not think we ever learn her first name, nor that of her lover Herr Schultz. Fraulein Schneider keeps a boarding house and is not unduly fussy about her tenants, provided they pay the rent and preserve a veneer of respectability. Where she draws the line, as the 1930s advance, is in deciding to break off her engagement to Herr Schultz because he is a Jew, even though German-born. These scenes are vastly more mature than anything to do with Sally Bowles. George Raistrick is a most dignified Herr Schultz. Ms Kestelman plays Fraulein Schneider with an impeccable German English-speaking accent that haunts anyone acquainted with central Europe. And the best songs in the show have become the love duets between them, overshadowing even the theme, 'Cabaret'. The most satirical remains 'If you could see her through her my eyes' sung by the MC dancing with an ape. It has a devastating final line. Cumming performs it to perfection. Donmar Warehouse.

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Plasterboard group rejects takeover bid National Gypsum, the second-largest US maker of plasterboard, has rejected a Dollars 940m hostile bid from Delcor, an investor-group led by the company's non-executive chairman Mr CD Spangler. A special committee of the board said the proposed price of Dollars 43.50 a share was 'inadequate' and the proposal 'highly conditional'. National Gypsum's shares closed down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 7/8 . Delcor, a division of investment company Golden Eagle Industries, owns 19 per cent of National Gypsum, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last autumn. It is supported in its bid by the North Carolina-based investment banks First Union Corporation and NationsBank . The bid is conditional on Delcor 'satisfying itself' on National Gypsum's liability for asbestos claims. A trust fund was set up when the company emerged from bankruptcy to cover such claims. Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group which owns 10 per cent of National Gypsum, recently rejected a joint bid, although it is not clear whether it will be actively opposing it. It had been seen as a possible partner after working closely with Delcor to acquire the stake last year. Mr Allan Cecil, corporate spokesman for National Gypsum, said the company was not talking to any other potential bidders.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: A new force in the contracting marketplace  -The pospects for Trafalgar House a year after the Davy acquisition THE CORPORATE cliche, 'critical mass', is the kind that Mr Allan Gormly, the quietly-spoken Glaswegian who runs the engineering division at Trafalgar House, hates using. 'We need to find a better label for it,' he says. Nevertheless, it is a phrase that is hard for Mr Gormly to avoid when describing the results of Trafalgar House's controversial takeover of Davy, the UK process plant contractor whose disastrous losses on the Emerald Producer rig conversion contract cost it its independence. The takeover created a new force in process plant contracting worldwide, and gave the Trafalgar House engineering division an important new leg in minerals and metals plant contracting. A little more than a year after the agreed deal was announced, Mr Gormly says a number of clients have viewed the enlarged engineering contractor as such a significant player - among the world's top four - that they have come to talk to the company rather than wait for a call. In a competitive global contracting marketplace where business conditions are decidedly mixed, Mr Gormly says that is quite encouraging - 'much better than being number 15 in a bid slate of 20.' None of this, perhaps, is likely to cut much ice with Davy shareholders who have been hanging on for the past year in the hope - now virtually doomed - of receiving their second payment of Pounds 54m from what was originally a two-stage Pounds 114m deal. For Trafalgar House, the surprise result of the takeover has been the extent to which it has been drawn into the legal wrangle over the contract. 'We didn't think we were getting into that sort of drama,' Mr Gormly admits, 'and it has taken up an immense amount of senior managers' time. It will linger on for a while yet, but it is substantially behind us.' In contrast, the rest of the story has gone according to plan. Davy's process plant side has been integrated with John Brown Engineering &amp; Construction - 'You can't see the join,' says Mr Gormly. The stricken contractor's minerals and metals business, meanwhile, has retained the Davy name and become one of the six segments of the engineering division, with 6,000 employees out of 26,000 - nearly half of whom are in the enlarged John Brown engineering and construction business. The integration process has produced few surprises. There is 'more mileage' in some of Davy's process technology than had been thought before the merger, says Mr Gormly, but as expected management systems have been tightened up under the new regime. The main disappointment has been external to Davy - a recession that has proved to be deeper and longer than expected, notably in steel mill work across the developed world. 'I don't think any supplier or client saw as recently as a year ago just how severe the recession, in the case of the metals industry, was going to be,' says Mr Gormly. But this is no reason for having any regrets about the takeover, he says. 'We recognised that the world capital goods side was going to slow down, that was inevitable after four or five years of growth . . . if you wait until you've got Utopia on all five fingers of your hand you'd never do anything.' In fact, one of the key aims of the takeover was to extend the engineering division's reach, both geographically and in business sector terms, to take advantage of the more buoyant parts of a 'curate's egg' market. In geographical terms, the outlook varies from patchy in North America, which is at the bottom of the cycle but starting to show signs of life, to booming in south-east Asia. The story is similarly mixed on the products side, varying from 'bad news almost universally' in commodity chemicals to 'quite strong' and 'fairly buoyant' in pharmaceuticals and power respectively. Inevitably, though, there are nuances within this picture, which the enlarged business is better able to exploit. While the steel business is depressed worldwide, there is work in the former Soviet Union, where money is being made available for steel mill modernisations - right up Davy's street. The contracts are smaller than before the break-up of the Soviet Union, says Mr Gormly, and are being handled in segments of about Pounds 10m apiece. Since the Davy takeover, the engineering division has tied up a number of other important deals. In March, John Brown unveiled a 50-50 joint venture with Austria's Voest-Alpine as a springboard for expansion into Germany and eastern Europe. John Brown's Portsmouth office has also broken new ground this year by signing so-called partnering agreements with ICI and BP Chemicals - long-term arrangements designed to dovetail client and contractor's engineering skills to save time and money. In the case of ICI, for example, John Brown and Foster Wheeler of the US will share all the chemical company's small and medium-sized contracts. Tendering is replaced by a rigorous competition to become a client's preferred contractor. Depending on ICI's investment pattern, John Brown is thus guaranteed a 'solid baseload' of work, according to Mr Ian Robinson, chief executive of John Brown Engineering &amp; Construction. The company is in discussions with other clients on further partnering arrangements. While these deals are potentially significant in the long-term, the Davy takeover is already bringing benefits, raising an obvious question: have Mr Gormly and Trafalgar House got themselves a bargain? 'I really don't know, only time will tell,' says Mr Gormly. 'We paid a fair price, and recognised there was risk in the rig contract, hence the contingent second payment.' According to Mr Peter Deighton at Smith New Court, the deal looks 'very shrewd' from a process engineering viewpoint. 'Davy had taken on a daft contract, but the rest of the company was not in bad shape . . . With the process engineering market beginning to look healthier, and the radical changes caused by environmental legislation, I would have thought (Pounds 60m) was a very reasonable price.'</p>

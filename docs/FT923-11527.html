			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The Spanish two-step Changes in Spanish interest rates do not have quite the same impact on the UK that they might have had when the peseta was at its ERM limit against sterling. It is thus tempting to dismiss yesterday's 60 basis point increase in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate as largely a domestic affair, prompted as much by continuing worries on inflation as by the Bundesbank's recent monetary tightening. Just the same, the UK authorities cannot be entirely comfortable at the growing list of European countries to have reacted to the German move. Besides Spain, these now include Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. Though the latter two confined themselves to technical operations in the money market rather than explicit rate rises, the impression is growing that the trend of interest rates in Europe is upwards. As long as France holds its own rates and Germany does not tighten further, the UK may manage to stay aloof on the grounds of its weak economy and relative success in curbing inflation. But it is still using up its credibility on the foreign exchange market. It has for a long time seemed unlikely that the exceptionally narrow quarter-point differential between German and UK rates can persist once the Bundesbank does eventually decide to relax. At that stage, UK rates will almost certainly have to fall more slowly than German ones. The more immediate danger is that of a Lombard increase after the summer holidays if German money supply growth shows no signs of abating. The UK would then not only be sucked into a further round of European rises. It might have to go further than matching the actions of its partners.</p>

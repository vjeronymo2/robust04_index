			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Mikhail Pogorelyy: </F> "Senators Apparently Do Recognize Need for `Delicate Approach'  With Russia"]    [Text]  <H8>  Offer to Carry Out Russian-American Peacekeeping Force </H8> Training on U.S. Soil    On 31 May, leaders of the Duma defense and international  affairs committees Sergey Yushenkov and Vladimir Lukin and Sam  Nunn, U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, called a  press conference in which they described the results of a joint  session held by the legislators of the two countries. These  members of the legislative bodies listed the problems  constituting subjects of common discussion and shared their  views for resolving these problems. The dialogue, as pointed out  by Sergey Yushenkov, was constructive as well as open.    One of the topics examined was the pressing one of the trade  in weapons produced by our countries. Russia would like to have  a clear indication that the U.S. does not stand in the way of  our making exports to Third World countries. America believes in  the aggressive approach, in that she intends to play by the  rules of a free market, under conditions of stiff competition,  something which as noted by Senator Sam Nunn exists even among  the closest of allies. There is as yet also a lack of unity of  views on the status of Russian Armed Forces units pursuing  peacekeeping missions on the soil of CIS member countries.    Nonetheless, neither the State Duma members nor the U.S.  senators did anything to dramatize whatever differences arose  concerning their opinions and assessments. On the contrary,  their feelings are fairly optimistic, and they intend, as borne  out by their answers to a question put by the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  correspondent, to meet regularly for the purpose of seeking  points of agreement. Senator Dan Coats, one of the guests,  jokingly remarked that the Americans are willing to have Russian  parliamentarians "interfere" on Washington's Capitol Hill, for  an exchange of opinions is useful to both sides.    An example of the above are the results of examining the  situation arising in Russia relative to a plan to carry out a  joint exercise of armed fores peacekeeping units of the two  states in the month of July. According to Vladimir Lukin, the  American senators arrived at a keen understanding of the  difficulties attendant to that, realizing that this is not a  question of disinterest in cooperation, but rather one of  delicate matters, such as national dignity and pride. Sam Nunn  stated that, after completing the trip, he intends to submit a  proposal for carrying out the first of a series of joint  exercises on U.S. soil, on a base located in California or  Georgia.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Hurd denies party 'crisis' THE CONSERVATIVE party is gradually 'coming together' on Europe, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said last night, asserting that there was no 'crisis' at the centre of government. Speaking on the day Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a magazine article to set out his European vision, Mr Hurd told Tory loyalists in Oxfordshire that the party was starting to look to Europe's future rather than raking over the past. This was part of a process in which British politics was returning to normal after the 'horrors' of the past 12 months, Mr Hurd said. 'Normal includes plenty of problems but no crisis,' he said. 'Normal includes the chancellor of the exchequer setting about preparing his Budget in an orderly way.' Initial Euro-sceptic reaction to Mr Major's article in The Economist - in which he ruled out a British return to the European exchange rate mechanism in the strongest terms yet - belied Mr Hurd's remarks, however. Mr Nicholas Budgen, a Euro rebel and Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, dismissed it as calculated 'manoeuvring' in the run-up to next month's Conservative party conference. The government was 'simply working on a different system leading to fixed exchange rates'. Mr Major was making a 'shrewd attempt to try and manage public opinion at the Tory party conference - but it's nothing more than that'. Mr Bill Cash, the arch Euro-sceptic MP for Stafford, said there was nothing in the prime minister's words to suggest he had vetoed a return to the ERM. 'The move towards monetary union is clearly laid out in the Maastricht treaty,' he said. Mr Major's article was widely portrayed as a British attempt to pre-empt further discussion of economic and monetary union at the special European Community summit planned for next month. His advisers hope it will help to marginalise the hard-right backbenchers who have threatened to force a leadership election in the autumn.</p>

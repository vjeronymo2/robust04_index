A statement issued by the "Iraqi National Accord"  Organization said that the masses in Baghdad, al-Basrah,  al-'Amarah, and al-Nasiriyah staged a furious "uprising"  [intifadah] last Thursday. The statement, issued in  Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq, said that the "uprising" began in  the areas of al-Thawrah, al-Hurriyah, and al-Shu'lah and then  extended to al-Taji, al-Dulu'iyah, Samarra', al-Dujayl, and  al-Dawr. The masses managed to control the Baghdad-al-Mawsil  road.    The statement, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT in London, added that some areas in the governorates of  al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah later joined the  "uprising" and that the protesters were in control of several  areas between Baghdad and Samarra' and fought fierce battles  against the Tammuz Division which consists of emergency forces  and Republican Guards -- the forces deployed by the government  in Baghdad since last Wednesday.    Another statement issued by the Organization of "the  Mujahidin of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq" said that the  Baghdad government "has completed preparations for a new attack  on the marshes areas in the governorates of al-Basrah and  Maysan."    The statement added that these preparations followed heavy  artillery bombardment of various areas, using napalm and  incendiary bombs to destroy the plantations which acted as  barriers. It also said that last Wednesday a large armored  force joined the commando units of the 14th Division in some  areas in Maysan.    Government forces had set fire to some areas in al-Hayadir  in  al-Basrah Governorate on 27 February, and the 1st and 2d  battalions of the 47th Brigade moved toward al-Saddah-712 in  al-Hayadir area on 3 March. Fires were seen raging in the  sugarcane fields adjacent to the main road.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Letter: Record shows Treasury never forecast a recession in UK at all Sir, According to the article, 'Treasury models in privatising move' (September 15), by David Goodhart and Peter Marsh, the Treasury 'fail(ed) to predict how protracted the recession would be'. The statement flatters the Treasury's forecasting record because it never, at any stage, forecast a recession at all. The chart shows each of the Treasury's last five forecasts taken from successive issues of the Financial Statement and Budget Report and the Autumn Statement set against the estimated out-turn derived from Economic Trends, together with an estimate for the remainder of 1992 and the first half of 1993 which will not, I believe, be thought controversial. As the chart shows, it would be wrong to think of the Treasury's forecasts as only having been wrong once. The forecasts have been persistently dreadful, invariably in the direction of seeing substantial recovery 'just around the corner' which, of course, never materialised. The scale of the error, looking one year ahead, was generally rather over 4 per cent and it is beginning to look as though the worst of the lot was the most recent forecast made just before the election - this may be as large as 5 per cent. It is very worrying that the government has been so persistently, and so completely, misled by its official advisers. It is even more worrying if, faced with a recession which is going to turn into a regular slump unless present policies are further changed, the government is even now basing its actions on an economic model and forecasting methodology which are utterly discredited. Is the article correct when it says that the Treasury employs 80 economists to do this work? Wynne Godley, Department of Applied Economics, Cambridge University</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not quite so powerful Sir, I fear that your report, 'Gas regulator may act to widen competition' (July 9/10) credits me with more power than I actually have. To say I will use my powers to introduce wider competition '. . .if the government fails to put forward legislation. . .' overlooks the fact that such a move would require a statutory instrument by the secretary of state for trade and industry which would have to be made before parliament and is subject to standard parliamentary procedures. Clare Spottiswoode, director general, Office of Gas Supply, Stockley House, 130 Wilton Road, London SW1V 1LQ</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Welsh Water plan to lease off hotels fails WELSH WATER's plan to extricate itself from the hotel business by signing a 15-year lease for four of its properties with Resort Hotels, and signing a management contract with Resort for a fifth, collapsed yesterday. Following the announcement its shares closed 10p down at 635p. In a terse one paragraph joint statement issued to the Stock Exchange, Welsh Water and Resort Hotels announced that they had decided 'not to proceed with the disposal'. Welsh Water, which revealed the plan in July at the same time as its interim results, says it will be 'taking steps to find a new partner and remains committed to its decision to exit from hotel management.' The day after Welsh Water announced the deal Resort's shares were suspended, Mr Robert Feld, managing director and head of the family which built the group, resigned, and the board said in a statement that it was concerned 'over a number of financing and reporting issues'. Resort's shares remain suspended at 45p. Late yesterday afternoon Welsh Water's management was unavailable for comment and Resort Hotels declined to elaborate on the Stock Exchange announcement.</p>

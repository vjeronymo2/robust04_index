Goplachev; date and place not  given: "The Vigilance of the Procurator's Eye"]    [Text] January and February are the time for summing  up the results of the previous year, including results in law  enforcement agencies. The results of 1993 were summed up by the  republic procuracy.    There was a thorough discussion of the procurators'  performance in overseeing the enforcement of laws and securing  the primacy of laws, the socioeconomic liberties of citizens,  and the rights of the republic. Attention was focused on  shortcomings in the work, unsolved problems, and the means of  solving them.    Procurator R.I. Abazov of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic  was interviewed a few days ago.    [Goplachev] Ruslan Ismelovich, attempts to evaluate the  performance of law enforcement agencies in quantitative terms  usually produce comparatively objective results. What can you  tell us about some of the results of the past year, using these  evaluations as a basis?    [Abazov] I want to start with the following comment.  Everyone  still remembers the tragic events of last year. These events,  which were caused by the confrontation between two branches of  the federal government, certainly could have moved to the  regional level. In our republic this was averted by the efforts  of our leaders and the wisdom of the people living here. Now I  will answer your question in more specific terms.    Procurators discovered 860 violations, challenged 289  unlawful legal instruments, and filed 251 reports for the  elimination of these violations. They instituted 535 suits for  380 million rubles on behalf of state and public organizations  and institutions.    [Goplachev] There is valid public concern about the rising  crime rate in the economic sphere. I have a question about three  aspects of this: the protection of state property and the  violations committed during privatization and in foreign  economic activity.    [Abazov] Equipment, vehicles, and other assets worth tens of  millions of rubles fell into the hands of private firms and  small enterprises as a result of the negligence of some  administrators in maintaining state property and the late  discovery of these incidents by municipal and rayon procurators.  Cases of this were discovered at the Kabbalkproyektstroy  Association, the Baksan Consumer Goods Combine, the Terskiy Meat  and Dairy Product Combine, and other enterprises. Measures are  being taken now to recover the illegally acquired state  property. Procurators conducted 27 inspections of compliance  with state and private property laws, discovered 118 violations,  and filed 15 reports.    The inspection of compliance in the sphere of privatization  was extremely productive. Although the republic managed to avoid  "wholesale" privatization, around 30 violations were found and  18 reports were filed.    Decisions on the sale of state property or other forms of  traffic in this property were frequently made without going  through the proper channels. Municipal and rayon procurators did  not have the necessary information about the state of legality  in this sphere and could not influence the activities of the  rayon committee for the management of state property in  sufficiently effective ways.    A comprehensive inspection in an area as new to us as  foreign  economic activity produced positive results. We were able to  draft specific proposals to improve the mechanism of foreign  economic operations. Many enterprises and organizations engaged  in this activity are not pursuing the goals that were set when  they were founded: the attraction of advanced technology to the  republic economy and the provision of the consumer market with  adequate supplies of goods. The overwhelming majority of joint  ventures and private firms are conducting trade and foreign  economic operations not on a permanent and concrete basis, but  in sporadic barter transactions, frequently ignoring the  applicable limits imposed on export and interregional deliveries  by authorized agencies, including the procuracy.    [Goplachev] How would you rate the state of republic  agriculture?    [Abazov] The state of affairs in the republic agroindustrial  complex is seriously disturbing. The theft and loss of products  and the harvest are still widespread. Just last year around  9,000 head of cattle in the republic died or were stolen. Farms  in Zolskiy, Sovetskiy, Chegemskiy, Urvanskiy, and  Prokhladnenskiy rayons suffered the most damage. The measures  procurators took were far from adequate: Only 37 suits for 1.5  million rubles in compensation were instituted for the dead  cattle.    [Goplachev] How effective has procuracy intervention been in  preventing violations of social laws?    [Abazov] Inspections revealed flagrant violations in the  distribution of housing and telephones in Nalchik. The municipal  procuracy knew about these cases but confined its response to  filed reports. It was not until the republic procuracy  intervened that suits were instituted to invalidate orders and  evict citizens from illegally occupied apartments. The republic  procuracy lodged the necessary protests with the Nalchik  municipal administration, and dozens of citizens lost their  illegally installed telephones.    [Goplachev] How are things with regard to felonies?    [Abazov] Regrettably, I have nothing good to report to the  readers of KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA. Although the overall  crime rate was relatively stable (0.6 percent below the 1992  figure), there has been an increase in felonies in the republic,  including homicide (+57.4 percent), the intentional infliction  of serious bodily injury (+18.6 percent), rape and attempted  rape (+60.5 percent), mugging (+55.6 percent), and vandalism  (+52.2 percent). The number of these crimes has risen in all  cities and rayons in the republic. They now account for 17.9  percent of all crimes.    In all, 7,681 crimes were reported in the republic. An  increase in crime was recorded in Prokhladnenskiy, Terskiy,  Urvanskiy, Mayskiy, Chegemskiy, and Sovetskiy rayons.    Last year was marked by an unprecedented rise in the  homicide  rate (from 61 to 96 cases). Furthermore, one out of every three  has not been solved.    The number of homicides increased most dramatically in  Nalchik--from 19 to 42 (+121 percent); 17 of these, or 40.4  percent, have not been solved. There were more homicides in  Terskiy, Urvanskiy, Mayskiy, Chegemskiy, Zolskiy, and Sovetskiy  rayons.    The rise (73.1 percent) in the number of crimes committed  with the use of loaded firearms (one out of every three  homicides) is particularly disturbing. The weapons generally  come from outside Kabardino-Balkaria, which still has  "transparent" borders, despite the presence of checkpoints on  access roads from adjacent territories.    [Goplachev] How vigilant is the procurator's eye in  discovering wrongful dismissals of criminal cases?    [Abazov] Last year procurators discovered 135 crimes which  were removed from police records by the issuance of unlawful  decisions to drop criminal charges. Procurators filed 173  reports on the violations, leading to disciplinary actions  against 109 officials. The oversight of criminal cases by the  procuracy, however, was also inadequate. This is attested to by  the increasing number of dismissed cases. Procuracy personnel  dismissed 30.4 percent of all cases. This is an impermissible  luxury.    [Goplachev] Children are also involved in crime....    [Abazov] The overall rate of juvenile crime has decreased by  5 percent. There was an increase in Nalchik and in  Prokhladnenskiy, Zolskiy, Sovetskiy, and Chegemskiy rayons.  There are still too many cases in which juveniles are framed for  crimes. A case in Nalchik is a good example: When the 9-year-old  Karatsukov was "railroaded" for 10 thefts of personal property,  including such items as a television set, a rug measuring 3 x 4  meters, and a crate of champagne, no one even wondered how this  "miscreant" could have carried these items.    [Goplachev] The procuracy presses charges, and the criminal  is convicted. Then what happens?    [Abazov] The punishment is usually left up to the courts,  but  the penalty is not always administered in a timely or  satisfactory manner, and laws are sometimes broken during this  phase. The group overseeing corrective labor institutions and  the procurators conducted 87 inspections and filed 33 reports on  the results. There are still numerous violations of prisoners'  rights in camps No 1 and No 3, leading to the commission of  crimes, and the absence of work precludes corrective labor.    There was an excessively formal approach to the oversight of  the activities of the corrective labor institutions department  of the republic Ministry of Internal Affairs, where standards  were relaxed and other violations were committed. These led to  the mass disturbances in March. Then the case of the suspect who  had been held illegally for eight months came to light in  December. The procuracy lodged a protest and the guilty parties  were punished.    [Goplachev] Did the economic reform affect your work?    [Abazov] The intensification of economic reform and the  democratic changes in the society transferred the protection of  the interests of economic entities and the majority of civil  rights to the jurisdiction of arbitration boards and people's  courts, increasing their workload and, consequently, the  possibility of judicial error.    This called for intense work by the Division of Civil Suit  Oversight and by local procurators. The effectiveness of the  appeals process to protest unlawful rulings was improved  slightly.    [Goplachev] Is the procuracy involved in the exoneration of  victims of political repression?    [Abazov] In accordance with the requirements of the Law "On  the Exoneration of Victims of Political Repression," the  republic procuracy has worked with security and internal affairs  agencies to restore the reputation of innocent victims. The  files of 422 people were reviewed. Decisions on exoneration were  made in 289 cases. The majority of exoneration orders have not  been delivered yet, however, and have not been requested,  despite the coverage of the review of these cases on radio and  television and in the press.    [Goplachev] What can you tell us about your personnel  problems?    [Abazov] Six of the ten municipal and rayon procurators are  serving their second constitutional term. Last year three staff  members of procuracy agencies were elected to the republic  Constitutional Court and two were elected to the  Kabardino-Balkar Parliament. We are proud of this. Ten staffers  were promoted to higher offices after their performance  evaluations.    I would like to discuss two extremely important personnel  problems we cannot solve without considerable assistance from  the republic leadership and the Procuracy General. One is the  urgent need for a new building or new premises for the republic  procuracy, because our staff is several times the size it was  when our present building was designed. Besides this, our staff  was increased by another 23 positions in the new year. The  distinctive features of our work, particularly our investigative  work, require each inspector to have an office of his own, but  our present offices have to be shared by two or three people.  Meanwhile, the Nalchik municipal procuracy does not even have a  building of its own and half of its staff has to do its work in  a residential building. We also have no facility for meetings of  the whole staff.    Problems in securing housing for procuracy personnel have  not  been solved either, especially in the city of Nalchik. The Law  "On the Procuracy in the Russian Federation" says that the local  administration must supply procuracy personnel requiring better  living conditions with the appropriate living area as soon as  possible, or within six months in the case of newly appointed  personnel. We have not received a single apartment in the city  of Nalchik in recent years, although one out of every three  members of our staff needs one.    [Goplachev] What would you like to say in conclusion?    [Abazov] I want to express satisfaction with the adoption of  the constitutions of the Russian Federation and Kabardino-Balkar  Republic at the end of last year and the beginning of this year.  These exceptionally important documents will serve as a sound  legal foundation for the stabilization of economic and political  conditions and reinforce the legal system and the administration  of justice. The individual has been granted broader rights and  freedoms.    The Constitution reaffirmed the organizational principle of  the procuracy as a single centralized system. Edicts of the  Russian Federation president assigned the procuracy the  functions of coordinating the activities of law enforcement  agencies in the fight against crime and granted our personnel  various types of social protection.    We will evaluate our own performance from the standpoint of  the requirements engendered by these changes.</p>

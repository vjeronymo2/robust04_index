Our police affairs correspondent Uri-Kohen Aharonov has  just returned from the site and brings us his report:    Tonight was yet another phase in the action by the  authorities against extremist elements in Israel. Following a  series of administrative arrests and weapons confiscations,  particularly among settlers in the territories, police  detectives tonight acted against the two big centers of the  Kahana Hay and Kakh movements in Jerusalem. They locked the  offices of Kahana Hay on Agrippas Street with chains, leaving a  closure order signed by the police commissioner on the door, and  then proceeded to the offices of Kakh on Usishkin Street.    In the closure order, the police commissioner wrotes that  based on Article 6 of the Antiterror Act of 1948 he finds that  these two centers constitute bases of terrorist organizations  and consequently orders their closure for a period of six months  as of this evening, 15 March 1994. We learned from police  sources tonight that other measures may be taken tomorrow.</p>

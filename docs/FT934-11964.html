			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Investors lock in their profits LEADING international currencies reacted to end of the month pressures rather than fundamental economic signals, and trading volumes were light yesterday. But the dollar was helped by encouraging US economic data, while the D-Mark responded to signs that German interest rates might not fall as fast as thought, writes Peter John. Fund managers generally record their performance on a monthly basis and, after a volatile four weeks during which the Belgian franc has swung sharply against the D-Mark and the dollar has risen around seven pfennigs against the German currency, some will have made big profits. Yesterday was the last possible day for ensuring that those currency profits were attributable to October. Consequently, the US dollar was sold down to DM1.6725 during the day as fund managers shored up their profits. Then, news that US durable goods orders rose by 0.7 per cent in September was well received and the dollar recovered some of its momentum to end at DM1.6805 in Europe, only marginally lower than the previous day's close of DM1.6810. It finished New York trading with little further change at DM1.6800. The D-Mark, which had been weaker since the Bundesbank's surprise rate cut a week ago, recovered against most European currencies as investors adjusted their positions. It was given a further lift from a tight Bundesbank repo which drained money from the market and dampened the belief that German rates are poised to fall quickly. That signal was strengthened by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, who said he saw no reason for a further rate cut for the time being. The German currency improved against the pound, Italian lira, Spanish peseta and French franc. However, the French currency was unsettled by the strike at Air France and the possibility that the industrial action might spill over into other areas of the public sector. The franc also traded nervously ahead of jobless figures tomorrow, which could show a rise from the present 11.7 per cent. France has one of the highest rates of unemployment among OECD countries. The Belgian franc headed back towards BFr21.60 to the D-Mark at one point, although this was more a technical correction than a belief that the fundamental problems of high wage costs and high public debt have been resolved. The country's central bank said its foreign exchange reserves fell by BFr8.62bn to BFr214.93bn in the week to October 25, mainly because of intervention in the exchange markets. By the close the currency was slightly weaker at BFr21.69 per D-Mark, compared with BFr21.64 previously. The Taiwan dollar ended slightly lower against the US dollar as investors were reluctant to test the currency's downside aggressively after Tuesday's active intervention to support it.</p>

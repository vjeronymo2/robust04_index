			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lords back claims on Iraq A BILL to deal with compensation claims against Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait was backed in the House of Lords last night. The Foreign Compensation (Amendment) Bill will enable the Foreign Compensation Commission to act in cases where the government receives compensation through international organisations or tribunals. The technical measure was given an unopposed second reading. Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, said the government had 3,000 compensation claims over the Iraqi occupation, of which 2,000 were from individuals and the rest from companies. Lord Judd, for Labour, welcomed the bill and praised the speed with which the United Nations had moved to deal with Gulf war compensation.</p>

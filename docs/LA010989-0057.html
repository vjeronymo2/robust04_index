			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELLIOTT IS NAMED DRIVER OF THE YEAR; BRABHAM ALSO HONORED AT BANQUET  </P> <P> Bill Elliott and Geoff Brabham shared the honors Saturday night at the American  Auto Racing Writers &amp; Broadcasters Assn. banquet in the Spruce Goose  Pavilion at Long Beach.  </P> <P> Elliott was named driver of the year by a panel of 10 racing writers over  Brabham, Danny Sullivan and Rusty Wallace in the closest balloting ever.  Elliott, Winston Cup stock car champion, received the most points in the  1-through-5 voting although Wallace, the Winston Cup runnerup, had the most  first-place votes.  </P> <P> Brabham, International Motor Sports Assn. champion and winner of 8 straight  races in mid-season, received the Jerry Titus Memorial Award for receiving the  most votes in balloting among AARWBA members for the 12-driver All-America  team.  </P> <P> Proceedings were halted for more than an hour when Long Beach police had the  Spruce Goose evacuated after a phone call was received alleging a bomb had been  planted in the gigantic hanger. More than 600 guests took refuge in the Queen  Mary before returning to the awards dinner.  </P> <P> All-America selectees present were Elliott, Wallace, Brabham, Sullivan, Bob  Glidden, Kenny Bernstein, Al Unser Jr., Rich Vogler, Tom Kendall and Robby  Gordon. Missing were Steve Kinser, who is racing in Australia, and Scott  Pruett, whose mother accepted his award. SHAV GLICK  </P></p>

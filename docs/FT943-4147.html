			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Artificial hand will be able to raise a delicate glass A prosthetic hand that will be sensitive enough to pick up a glass of wine without breaking it will be developed within two years, Mr Peter Nurse of the University of Plymouth said at the meeting yesterday. Mr Nurse has already developed a prosthetic gripping device strong enough to pick up an iron bar, and sensitive enough to pick up a paper tube without deforming it. The device, which is being used by a student in Plymouth who has suffered a hand amputation, only has two 'fingers'. The full prototype will look like a human hand. Hand-like prostheses are already in use, said Mr Nurse, but the grip is not easy to control. In order to grip something hard enough to pick it up, they grip until they crush. The new device is able to combine strength and sensitivity because it has a novel sensor that detects both touch and slipping. The closing of the hand stops when it makes contact with an object, but if the object starts to slip, the grip is tightened. The prosthetic hand will grip objects just tightly enough to pick them up. The wearer commands the prosthesis to close or to open by twitching two muscles in his upper arm. Sensors placed over the muscles detect the motion of the skin as the muscle twitches. The batteries in the present model last about six hours.</p>

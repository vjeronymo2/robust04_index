			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: McKay Securities McKay Securities, the property group, remained profitable in the half year ended September 30 1992, but is omitting the interim dividend in the light of discussions with its banks. Its unsecured banking agreements contain a standard covenant relating to the ratio between net asset value and the level of secured borrowings, which has restricted the ability to draw down fully its committed secured facilities. Discussions are going on to amend the covenant and to securing adequate medium-term funding. All banking facilities are expected to be put on a secured basis. In the half year pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2m to Pounds 877,000 after increased interest charges. No development outgoings or interest costs were capitalised, compared with Pounds 564,000. Earnings per share were 2.9p, against 6p on which an interim dividend of 3.2p was paid. Gross rents came to Pounds 4.47m (Pounds 4.68m).</p>

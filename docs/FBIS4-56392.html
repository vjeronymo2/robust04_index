			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil will participate more actively in  the final stage of the UN peace operations in Angola by sending  an Army battalion, military observers, police monitors, and even  a Navy patrol ship. UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  expressed "great interest" in the Brazilian cooperation. The  Itamaraty and the Armed Forces General Staff are analyzing the  request.    Brazil will probably prefer to concentrate its help to the  United Nations in Angola where it has more interest in the field  of foreign policy and trade. The Brazilian battalion will  probably have three infantry companies and one mechanized  company to transport the troops.    In the last few days, the Argentine Government consulted its  Brazilian counterpart about the possibility that the two  countries jointly offer a naval unit comprised of three patrol  ships to the United Nations.    According to an Itamaraty source, the presence of the  Brazilian battalion in Angola would be important "to advance the  peace process in Angola as well as to confirm Brazil's  contribution to preservation of international peace and  security." The United Nations has great interest in Brazilian  cooperation in Angola, particularly because the two countries  share a common language.</p>

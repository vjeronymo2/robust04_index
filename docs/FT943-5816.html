			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Ukraine warning on N-treaty The chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs commission signalled yesterday that the former Soviet republic might delay joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). President Leonid Kuchma (left) has said he will present the NPT, under which Ukraine would give up nuclear weapons permanently, to the communist-dominated assembly in October for approval. President Kuchma is due to visit the US in November, and Washington has put pressure on Kiev to join the pact. But Mr Boris Olinyk, chairman of the influential foreign affairs commission, said parliament would sign up for the NPT 'when we are ready'. 'This won't happen so quickly. This time we have to be careful. One should not make romantic statements about a non-nuclear zone when all around us are nuclear states.' Many Ukrainian leaders, including Mr Alexander Moroz, chairman of parliament, have criticised the US for dragging its feet on a promised Dollars 350m (Pounds 225.8m) in disarmament aid.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOARD SEEKS BROADER PROTECTION FOR TREES  </P> <P> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors has sent a proposed ordinance aimed at  preserving oak and sycamore trees back to the drawing board, urging that it  cover a broader area.  </P> <P> As drafted, the ordinance would have affected 26,000 acres in unincorporated  areas of the county.  </P> <P> Agricultural and open space lands were excluded from the ordinance.  </P> <P> At the urging of several residents and community organizations, the ordinance  will be redrafted to include all unincorporated areas of the county, which  would add an additional 500,000 acres.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance would regulate the removal and trimming of the trees.  Property owners could seek permission to remove trees if they are diseased, in  the way of public utilities or a threat to public safety.  </P> <P> If property owners want to remove trees to build or expand a building, a more  stringent permit process would be required.  </P> <P> Also, property owners would be required to apply for a permit to trim larger  oak or sycamore trees.

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Drug shares decline on downgrade Wall Street A LATE burst of buying allowed US stock markets to recover from early losses and big declines in drug issues and finish the day little changed and still close to record highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.38 at 3,550.93, within four points of the all-time high set in late May. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.86 softer at 449.22, although the Nasdaq composite was down 3.80 at 708.69 after the previous day's record peak. Trading volume on the New York SE was 278m shares. Following Wednesday's gains, when stocks neared, or broke through, record highs, market observers were not surprised when prices fell from the start amid some early profit-taking. It was not until the last hour of trading that prices rallied from their lows amid late buying. The day's economic news was mixed: a smaller than expected rise in weekly jobless claims and a sharp drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's July index of local business activity. Although corporate earnings came in quickly, the day's main story was the drugs sector. Prices tumbled in busy trading after Ms Christina Heuer, the sector analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, downgraded her investment rating on the pharmaceuticals group as a whole from 'neutral' to 'underperform'. Ms Heuer said she believed that some of the big drug companies will cut their dividends to preserve cash, and that equity prices could fall by a further 20 to 30 per cent in the short term. Almost every major drug stock fell sharply on the downgrade. Pfizer shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Merck Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 3/4 , Schering-Plough Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 66 1/8 , American Home Products Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 5/8 , Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 58, Warner-Lambert Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 and Eli Lilly Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 . Another stock to be hit by a downgrade, and disappointing second-quarter results, was Storage Technology, which plummeted Dollars 7 7/8 to Dollars 33 1/4 after Lehman Brothers and Kemper Securities lowered their ratings on the stock and cut 1993 earnings forecasts. Time Warner dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 1/8 after posting a second-quarter loss, although underlying operating earnings were up by 10 per cent. On the Nasdaq market, Scitex plunged Dollars 9 5/8 to Dollars 28 3/8 on a profits warning, and SynOptics Communications slid Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 31 3/4 on disappointing second-quarter earnings. Canada TORONTO ended on a mildly easier note after heavy trading. The TSE 300 index lost 10.4 at 3,931.3 and declining issues outscored rises by 397 to 328. Volume amounted to 65m shares valued at CDollars 732m. Eight of the 14 sub-group indices were lower, with mining down 1.7 per cent and leading the way. American Barrick, CDollars  1/8 up at CDollars 31 1/8 , reported sharply higher second-quarter and six-month earnings and revenues.</p>

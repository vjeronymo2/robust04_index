			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Greater accountability urged for quangos BOARD members of quangos, the unelected organisations that provide many public services, should become more accountable, says a study published by a local-government think tank, John Willman writes. The study by Professor John Stewart and Mr Howard Davis of Birmingham University calls for a code of practice to increase the accountability of quangos, which have taken over areas previously provided by local authorities such as health services. This would include giving details of the membership of their boards, which are appointed by ministers and are supposed to be accountable to parliament, as well as details of their backgrounds and their political allegiances. Quangos might also be required to hold meetings in public, and to provide greater access to information about their workings. The study recommends that quangos should become accountable to their local communities through some form of elections. An alternative would be to make them accountable to elected local authorities. Yet, says the study, their existence and membership are often shrouded in secrecy. The Growth of Government by Appointment.

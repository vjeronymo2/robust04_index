			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (6): Impact of 'little bang' is slightly muted - Choice shrinks for investors Belgium's 'little bang' - the government reforms which came into force at the beginning of last year - was supposed to energise the Belgian financial markets. But external events conspired to undermine some of the effects of the programme.  Whether it can yet be counted a complete success depends, to an extent, on which sector of the financial markets one looks at. Below, Andrew Hill considers its effect on the stock market, futures and options and the bond and money markets THE Brussels stock market has been hit, like most world markets, by the downturn in the global economy. Alas for Belgium's stockbroking community, liberalisation coincided with that slump in volume. Consequently - as everybody from the president of the bourse downwards is prepared to admit - changes to the broking system and improvements in the structure of Belgian commissions have had only a limited effect. This year will be more profitable than last, but Brussels, hampered by illiquidity and a limited range of domestic stocks, still struggles against more active European rivals. Mr Jean Peterbroeck, the bourse president, says part of the reason is that the government gave the bond market a leg-up in the same series of reforms by reducing withholding tax on fixed interest financial instruments from 25 to 10 per cent. Combined with the turbulence of European stock markets, that made bonds much more attractive than equities for traditionally cautious Belgian investors. At the same time, he claims that large Belgian banks did not act on their promises to invest heavily in stockbroking operations. The delay in implementing a Belgian futures and options exchange has also held back the market, and Mr Peterbroeck continues to fight for the abolition of the tax on stock market turnover, which penalises investors up to BFr10,000 for each transaction. There is little the bourse can do to cope with more lasting structural impediments to growth of the exchange. In 1950, for example, there were some 550 Belgian stocks quoted on the exchange; in 1992 there are just 170. They are larger companies, formed from mergers, but the investment choice looks restrictive to buyers who are used to the British or German exchanges. The gradual shrinkage is continuing: for example, had Banque Bruxelles Lambert been swallowed up by the Dutch financial services company Internationale Nederlanden Groep, then the bourse, while benefiting from the short-term takeover excitement, would have lost one of its most heavily-traded and best-known stocks. In the long term, flotation of publicly-owned companies may help increase the liquidity of the market, although the first wave of privatisation is likely to involve sales to single buyers rather than British-style share offers. Brokers are also trying to persuade family companies - for example, the owners of the Stella Artois beer brand - to float some of their shares on the exchange and excite new investor interest. For the future, like other EC stock exchanges, Brussels has work to do to implement changes introduced by EC directives on investment services. In particular, the Belgian exchange will try change to a London-style market-making system by early 1995. Mr Peterbroeck fears the costs associated with introducing such a system might drive more small brokers out of the market, although he hopes to collaborate with other EC exchanges to ease the burden. Even if he seems unhappy about the administrative changes involved, the bourse president agrees that in general a single European market will be good news - it was, after all, what the 1991 reforms were partly meant to prepare for. 'Belgium can only gain. Belgian investors have already invested a lot outside the country - but outside investors have not spent very much in Belgium. The possibilities are great,' says Mr Peterbroeck.</p>

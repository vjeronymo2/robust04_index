			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Rome corruption inquiry extended: Television channel licences investigated ROME magistrates have extended the scope of an inquiry into corruption at the Ministry of Posts to include the controversial granting of television channel licences five years ago. The licences allotted three channels to the state-run RAI broadcasting organisation, the first two channels to be run by the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. The three main commercial channels went to Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group, which has since come to account for nearly 45 per cent of the total national audience, against RAI's 50 per cent share. Over the weekend Rome magistrates arrested for the second time on charges of alleged corruption and illicit financing of political parties Mr Davide Gaicalone, private secretary to Mr Oscar Mammi, the Republican posts minister responsible for the television licensing system. Mr Giacalone is alleged to have taken a bribe from as yet unidentified persons of L1.2bn (Dollars 820,000) for the granting of these licences. Separately it has emerged that when he left the ministry in 1991 Mr Giacalone set up a consultancy, and one annual contract worth L460m came from Fininvest. Yesterday the magistrates heard evidence from Mr Adriano Galliani, the chief executive of Fininvest. He was accompanied by Mr Berlusconi, who appeared voluntarily before the magistrates to provide evidence. Mr Berlusconi, a close friend of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister, has denied any wrong-doing by Fininvest over the handing out of television licences or in the hiring of Mr Giacalone. Until now Mr Berlusconi has managed to avoid being caught up in the corruption scandals - one of the very few big entrepreneur's in such a position. However, his brother, Paolo, who heads construction interests long split from Fininvest, was on Monday sent for trial on charges of alleged illicit party financing relating to waste disposal contracts in the Milan area. Mr Berlusconi is in the spotlight because the licensing system is currently being reassessed and a number of politicians want to reduce his dominant position in commercial television and cut Fininvest's use of sponsorship on programmes. They also believe he has allowed several political parties heavy discounts on electoral advertising. Following April's referendum on electoral reform, the constitutional affairs committee of the Chamber of Deputies has begun sitting to devise a plan for replacing proportional representation with a first-past-the-post majority voting system for the assembly's 630 seats. It has until July 31 to complete its work. If the lower house's committee fails - as several commentators believe it will - Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has vowed to force through an as-yet unspecified government plan.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Books: Literary lollipops NEW WRITING edited by Malcolm Bradbury and Judy Cooke Minerva, with the British Council Pounds 6.99, 389 pages ONE OF Britain's most intangible yet important exports is itself - its cultural richness, its history, its language. No-one can accurately say how much British culture is worth in foreign earnings per annum; a precise financial figure would in any case be irrelevant to the fact that, once Britain has finally settled into its economic place as an ordinary European power, it may nevertheless still deserve recognition as a centre for artistic excellence. If such recognition is forthcoming it will largely be thanks to the evangelising success of the British Council, the government-funded agency which seeks to foster better international understanding of British culture in all its manifestations. The publication of a new anthology of British writing by the Council is thus an occasion for celebration, even though the anthology itself is a peculiar bouillabaisse. Full of succulent spicy extracts, it is also unfortunately laced with some purple, pulpy, scarcely-digestible chunks. The anthology is an entirely new venture for the Council. Previously its literature department was best known for a fine series of pamphlets  - no longer published - under the generic title Writers and Their Work. 'The 'writer and his work' idea is now rather discredited, and we are aware of an overseas demand for up-to-date, contemporary literature,' explains Harriet Harvey Wood, head of literature at the Council's London headquarters. The idea behind the new anthology is to 'get overseas countries to understand the younger writers coming up, those who may one day become the new Iris Murdochs. It's organised on what I call Beecham lollipop principle; the conductor Thomas Beecham would introduce unfamiliar works in amongst the popular classics, or lollipops, and that's just what we are trying to do here, sprinkle some new writers in amongst the famous and familiar names.' The anthology is being sponsored by Whitbread and Booker, the two companies which also provide the biggest annual UK prizes for fiction, and Waterstone's, the bookstore chain. Without their support it would probably not have got off the ground. The Arts Council is providing funding which will go into next year's edition. The only real comparison in the UK is the quarterly magazine Granta, though as Harriet Harvey Wood argues, Granta is more a forum for up-market journalism now than a purely literary magazine. As Malcolm Bradbury says in his editorial, the death of Encounter has left a gap in the market; New Writing hopes to go towards occupying it. Bradbury, novelist and redoubtable supporter of many a British Council venture, and Judy Cooke, a former editor of the now defunct Fiction magazine, will also edit next year's edition before handing over the reins. The aim over the years is to build a changing perspective of developments in British literature. The first volume of New Writing is heavily weighted towards fiction and critical essays. There is no drama, little poetry, and genres which have been undergoing a revival in the UK, such as crime fiction, are unrepresented. One of the problems with the anthology is that it has two readerships. British readers may find the selection of material by such established writers as AS Byatt, Angela Carter, David Lodge, Doris Lessing and Martin Amis a little over-familiar. But such contributors provide a reassuring familiarity for overseas readers, who know what they are getting; solid reliable stuff it is too. The editors hope that the large sample of fresh writing from writers little-known in the UK will entice British readers without discouraging those from overseas. Among the strongest contributions are those by David Lodge, who absorbingly updates his earlier influential essay on the novelist at the crossroads; a new writer, Geoff Dyer, forcefully reflects on Britain's class structure as it impinges on its literary prejudices; and AS Byatt contributes a wrily witty story. There is a handful of good poems, though the principle behind their selection is obscure. But there are also some bad pieces, including a dreadful adolescent rant about the Gulf war from Lucy Ellman, a disappointingly portentous piece from last year's Booker prize winner, Ben Okri, a peculiarly limp short story from Doris Lessing, and an astonishingly predictable story about a piranha fish by a new novelist, Lesley Glaister. Some pieces - such as Michael Ignatieff's essay on the intellectual being of post cold-War Europe - are likely to date very quickly. Moreover, budget constraints have made themselves felt in the book's design; why have the drawings of the Council's London base, Spring Gardens, all lumped together rather than more decoratively spread throughout? In the end, for a little more cash, foreign readers could have been so much more impressed both by the writing and the printing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bundesbank Director Edgar Meister by Sigrid </F> Ulrich; place and date not given: "We Are Not Liable for Damage  Done by Others"]    [Text] [Ulrich] Stock brokers have sensitive noses. They  are afraid that the financial markets will collapse, they smell  inflation. Are they right?    [Meister] Markets tend toward exaggeration. We will do all  we can so that the market remains stable. However, one thing is  correct indeed: The bond markets are currently unstable. Stock  brokers suspect pent-up inflation and thus rising interest rates  in the pipeline. Therefore, they reacted so strongly to the  rising interest rates in the United States and to the  over-20-percent growth of the German money supply. The strong  increase surprised us, too.    [Ulrich] Not only in the view of stock brokers is the money  supply, which is the basis of the Bundesbank's policy, a compass  that reacts to any rusty nail.    [Meister] It is undisputed that special factors have  distorted the real significance for two months now. Innumerable  new loans and refluxes from Luxembourg have inflated the money  supply. The state was also involved because of changed tax  regulations. The money supply is to grow by 6 percent at most  on annual average. I am confident we can achieve this goal.    [Ulrich] Will the Bundesbank now not lower the prime rate  any further?    [Meister] In the future, too, we will sound out any leeway  for lowering interest rates. Three weeks ago we lowered the  discount rate because of the favorable price trend, even though  we had to expect the growth of the money supply to remain high.    [Ulrich] Do you blame the so-called gambler funds from the  United States?    [Meister] You will understand that I do not want to adopt  this term. It is clear that the speculation of these funds  regarding futures and loans puts a strain on the markets.  Basically, central banks need not care about where those  investors, who are bored in gambling casinos, use their money.  However, we will not permit them to endanger the international  financial system.    [Ulrich] Do we have to fear a financial maximum credible  accident, if a large bank miscalculates on the futures markets?    [Meister] One cannot speak of that at all at the moment.  However, it is important that, internationally, complicated  deals in so-called derivatives, that is, options and figures,  are paid much more attention now. The sums that are shifted in  this connection, are gigantic and grow rapidly. The global  players on the financial markets should be clear about one  thing: The Bundesbank will not spread a net to bolster losses  from high speculative deals. Nor are we liable for damage done  by others.</p>

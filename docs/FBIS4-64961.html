			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Forudastan: "Kinkel Urges Turkey To Solve </F> Kurdish Conflict Politically"]    [Text] Bonn, 9 May -- The Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  has supported Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's plea to send CSCE  monitors to Turkey where they could get a first-hand impression  of the Kurdish conflict. Kinkel had advocated this idea in an  interview with FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU. On Monday [9 May], a  Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Kinkel was trying to urge  Turkey to solve the Kurdish problem politically with the help of  the CSCE.    So far, the Foreign Ministry has consistently rejected  sending CSCE observers. Sources in the CDU/Christian Social  Union [CSU] Bundestag Group stated on Monday that Kinkel's  "surprising change of mind" was "quite sensible." Since human  rights violations against the Kurds had increased, "something  has to be done at the international level" now. At the same  time, it was, of course, "rather sensitive" to express distrust  toward NATO partner Turkey by calling for observers. The  government in Ankara denies that Kurds are being tortured and  killed and expelled from villages in the southeast of the  country.    Sources from the CDU/CSU have meanwhile noted that Ankara  would be "well advised" not to object to CSCE observation of the  Kurdish conflict. Rejection would "not cast a favorable light  on a country that wants to belong to Europe even more closely  than in the past." Guenther Verheugen, federal manager of the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], told FRANKFURTER  RUNDSCHAU that he was "most positively surprised" at Kinkel  taking up the SPD's request for CSCE observers. Now the Federal  Government must quickly initiate a decisionmaking process in the  CSCE.    Only recently, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in a letter to  the human rights organization, Amnesty International, expressly  rejected sending CSCE observers to Turkey. This position has  also been taken by other Foreign Ministry representatives in the  past few months, who argued that such a measure would be unusual  in the relationship between NATO partners and would lead to  confrontation with Turkey.</p>

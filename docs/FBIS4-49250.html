			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that the relations between China and  Japan are very good and that the two peoples should live in  friendship from generation to generation.    Extending his welcome to Bunhei Hara, president of the House  of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and his delegation, Jiang  noted that as close neighbors, China and Japan have had friendly  contacts for more than 2,000 years.    Since the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 20  years  ago, great advances have been made in the bilateral friendly  cooperation in every field, Jiang noted.    Speaking of an unfortunate historical period between the two  countries, Jiang said "past experience, if not forgotten, is a  guide for the future."    Leaders of the two countries should take a broad and  long-term point of view and look forward to the future, he said,  adding that they should further promote the mutually-beneficial  cooperation in all fields and contribute to the safeguarding of  peace, stability and prosperity in Asia and the world at large.    Hara told Jiang that his visit to Beijing, Xian and Shanghai  has enabled him to witness the achievements China has made in  its reform and opening-up and economic development.    Hara expressed his willingness to exert himself to the  promotion of the Japan-China ties of friendship and cooperation.    Ye Gongqi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the  Shanghai  Municipal People's Congress, was present at today's meeting.</p>

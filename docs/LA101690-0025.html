			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AROUND THE NATION;  </P> <P> A FIRST: VIRGINIA IS NO. 1  </P> <P> Coach George Welsh, who rescued Virginia's program from college football's skid  row, has moved the Cavaliers atop the Associated Press poll for the first time  in its history.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's like Andy Warhol," Welsh said Monday.  </P> <P> "Maybe this is our 15 minutes of fame."  </P> <P> Before Welsh's arrival in 1982, Virginia had only two winning seasons in 29  years and had not been ranked higher than ninth.  </P> <P> Virginia, 6-0 and ranked No. 2 last week, was a 31-0 winner over North Carolina  State; top-ranked Michigan lost, 28-27, to Michigan State.  </P> <P> "This may last only a week," said Welsh, whose team will be a heavy favorite  Saturday when it plays at Wake Forest (2-4).  </P> <P> Virginia, leading the nation with averages of 48 points and 540 yards, has  outscored its opponents, 288-66.  </P> <P> "I think we had respect nationally before this year," Welsh said. "But the  polls don't mean that much to me. They don't mean anything. They don't mean  anything until the bowls are over."  </P> <P> The Cavaliers are one of three Atlantic Coast Conference teams in the top 25.  Georgia Tech, which will play Virginia at Charlottesville Nov. 3, improved from  18th to No. 11 after beating league foe Clemson. The Tigers slipped from 13th  to a tie for 22nd with Iowa.  </P> <P> Miami is No. 2, followed by Tennessee, Nebraska, Auburn, Notre Dame, Florida  State, Illinois, Houston and Michigan.  </P></p>

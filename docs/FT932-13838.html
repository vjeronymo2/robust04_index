			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Not-so-invisible earnings - Finance and insurance A NUMBER OF financial firms have won export awards, underlining the growing importance of invisible earnings to Britain's balance of payments. They include two merchant banks, an investment management firm and a reinsurance firm registered with Lloyds of London. Banque Paribas becomes the first French bank to win the award, in recognition of its export finance unit in London, which has had particular success in North Africa and Asia. Projects in which it has been closely involved include a large power station in Morocco and the revamping of liquefied natural gas facilities in Algeria. Most of the financings in which the unit were involved were originated by Paribas and were connected with big international projects in energy and heavy industry, such as steelworks. In addition, umbrella facilities such as general lines of credit were established, resulting in the financing of more than 60 UK export contracts, with values ranging from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 12m during the past three years. West Merchant Bank, another City institution, owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank (Europa), won the award in recognition of the two-thirds of its earnings won overseas - from fees for a wide range of advisory services and from underwriting commissions or trading profit on the placement of securities for residents in the US, Europe, Latin America and South Africa. Schroder Capital Management International, a unit of Schroder Investment Management, has been cited for winning significant fund management business in North America to complement its position as a leading manager of UK pension fund assets. It now manages more than Pounds 5bn for 80 clients, and employs more than 60 people in London and New York. R. Mears &amp; Co., the insurance and reinsurance brokers registered at Lloyds, takes a second export award in three years because of the accelerating growth in its brokerage income to Pounds 3.5m last year from Pounds 650,000 since 1987. Nearly all the income is earned overseas from a broadly based portfolio in Europe, Central America, southern and North Africa, the Caribbean, Australia and the Gulf. Anthony Barrow, one of Mears's two founding directors, says the firm has also benefited from the new opportunities for reinsurance in eastern Europe following the disappearance of Comecon, the former Soviet-dominated trade grouping. Mears had already had considerable business in former Yugoslavia, but as 95 per cent of it was in the now independent republic of Slovenia, it has not been affected by the violence which has swept other areas of former Yugoslavia.</p>

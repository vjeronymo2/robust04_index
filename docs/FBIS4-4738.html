			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata on Monday [4 April] called on the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) to promote dialogue with  nonmember nations such as China and Russia, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    Hata said in a 40-minute meeting with OECD Secretary General  Jean-Claude Paye that Japan wants the OECD to offer objective  analysis and direction amid the changing international  situation, the officials said. Specifically, Hata called on the  OECD to provide intellectual support for countries that are  trying to shift toward market-oriented economies, such as middle  and Central European nations, Russia and China, they said.    He told Paye the OECD could provide know-how on  democratization of markets, on beefing up investment  environment, and on banking systems, they said.    Hata pointed out that promoting dialogue with Russia and  China is important as the two nations have large populations and  will affect the OECD nations, they said.    He also voiced expectations that the OECD would promote ties  with the Asia-Pacific region, discussions on post-Uruguay Round  issues, and make further efforts to solve structural problems,  they said.    Paye, on a four-day visit from Sunday, said he agrees with  Hata's views on the OECD's future role, the officials said.    Paye, a French national, told Hata international cooperation  is becoming increasingly important as economic interdependence  grows while political obscurity increases, they said. He was  also quoted as saying it is necessary to study economic problems  by linking them with social problems, citing unemployment as an  example.    Paye is visiting major OECD member nations ahead of the  international body's Council meeting in June in Paris. Earlier  in the day, he conferred with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and the ministers responsible for trade, labor and agriculture.    On Tuesday, Paye is to have talks with Science and  Technology  Agency chief Satsuki Eda, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, Bank  of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and leaders of the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren).</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): AMR declines as crew strike is called off Wall Street Supported by a rally in the beleaguered bond market, most US share prices ended the day slightly firmer, although secondary stocks bounced back strongly from recent lows, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.92 better at 3,674.17. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.90 to 461.03, the American SE composite was up 0.16 at 461.04 and the Nasdaq composite recouped 8.69 at 746.82. New York SE trading volume was 261.6m shares. The stage was set for a positive opening on US stock markets when bond prices rallied in early trading. The benchmark 30-year bond eventually rose more than a point, and its yield dropped to 6.30 per cent. The bond market rally was sparked by several factors, including news of a surprise interest rate cut in the UK by the Bank of England. Financial markets across the globe have been concerned about rising interest rates, and the BoE's move helped to allay some of those concerns, if only temporarily. With bonds rising and interest rates in Europe declining, US equity investors were in more upbeat mood. Although there was some buying, traders said that business was light, primarily because the markets were already winding down ahead of the long Thanksgiving weekend holiday. AMR, parent of American Airlines, dropped Dollars 3 to Dollars 65 1/8 on news that the carrier's flight attendants had ended their strike after both sides were pressured by President Clinton to seek a government-mediated settlement. Investors reacted badly to the news because they feared that the government mediator would force American to dilute its package of cost-cutting measures which analysts had hoped would put the carrier back on the road to long-term profitability. Other airline issues fell along with AMR, which was also hit by a ratings downgrade from broking houses Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. Delta weakened Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 1/2 , UAL Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 136 1/2 and USAir Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 3/8 . Paramount Communications fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 76 1/2 as investors bet that Viacom, in spite of its lower offer, will defeat QVC Network in the battle to take over the entertainment group. On the American Stock Exchange, Viacom 'A' shares were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 and the 'B' stock Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 41 3/4 , while QVC was down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 48 7/8 on the Nasdaq market. News of the UK interest rate cut helped ADRs of British companies, notably British Petroleum, which rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 in heavy volume. Leading Nasdaq technology stocks were mostly firmer. Intel added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 58 7/8 , Microsoft Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 77 3/8 , Borland International Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 16 5/8 and Apple Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 33. Canada Toronto put on a mixed performance in fairly active trading. The TSE 300 index rallied 15.1 to finish at 4,215.3, but declines led rises by 429 to 356 after volume of 61.7m shares valued at CDollars 709m. The pipelines group rose 1.2 per cent.</p>

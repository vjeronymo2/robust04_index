			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> LEGALITY OF U.S. INVASION SPURS DEBATE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration stressed four legal justifications Wednesday for its  invasion of Panama: the protection of American lives, the defense of the Panama  Canal, the backing of the nation's "democratically elected" officials and the  pursuit of an indicted U.S. drug criminal -- namely, Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> International law experts said the first reason is the strongest and the last  the weakest.  </P> <P> "I think they can make a much more plausible case for this than the invasion of  Grenada (in 1983) or the Dominican Republic in the '60s," said American  University law professor Robert K. Goldman.  </P> <P> Because thousands of Americans are scattered around Panama and Noriega's troops  have shown a willingness to harass and even kill them, President Bush had  reason to use military force to protect them, Goldman said.  </P> <P> By contrast, the Reagan Administration justified its invasion of Grenada by  pointing to the danger faced by a small group of American medical students, a  rationale that was rebutted by international law bodies. Critics noted that the  students could have been evacuated without U.S. troops overthrowing Grenada's  government.  </P> <P> Under the norms of international law, nations are justified in using military  force abroad to defend their citizens from hostile military action. But the  response also must be limited to the amount of force necessary to protect the  citizens.  </P> <P> The classic example of such a military move, law experts said, was the 1976  Israel raid on the Ugandan air base of Entebbe. Landing there, Israel commandos  rescued their citizens who had been held hostage and then left, without  attacking Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.  </P> <P> Several law experts, while agreeing on the need to defend American lives in  Panama, questioned whether a full-scale invasion is justified under  international law.  </P> <P> "When you have the killing of a Marine and the beating of the Navy man, some  response was certainly called for," said USC law professor Edwin Smith.  "Whether it rises to the level of a threat to U.S. sovereign interests is  another question."  </P> <P> Columbia University professor Oscar Schachter said U.S. officials must show  that the attacks on Americans were more than isolated incidents.  </P> <P> "I think they need to make a much stronger factual case than they have made so  far," Schachter said. "If you have one man killed, you are not justified in  bombing cities or killing lots of others. But if you can show a pattern of  attacks, then you have a much stronger case. I don't think we know enough at  this point to make a judgment."  </P> <P> Noriega and his few remaining allies would be hard-pressed to argue against the  U.S. invasion in an international legal body such as the United Nations, the  experts said, because he declared last weekend that his forces were in "a state  of war" with the United States.  </P> <P> "That was his biggest blunder," Goldman said. "He badly overplayed his hand."  </P> <P> Justice Department officials made it clear that they still see the pursuit of  Noriega as a criminal case.  </P> <P> Staking out a new legal position last month, Justice Department lawyers said  that U.S. military personnel can track down and apprehend drug traffickers  abroad. In the past, U.S. law was understood to restrict the military from  engaging in criminal law enforcement. But under their new interpretation,  Administration lawyers said, that limitation applies only within the United  States and not beyond its borders.  </P> <P> International law experts scoffed at that justification for the invasion.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine," Goldman asked, "how we would react if another nation  asserted the right to have its military engage in surreptitious kidnapings of  Americans in this country?"  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow contributed to this report.  </P></p>

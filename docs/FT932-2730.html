			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Nuclear jumps to Pounds 66m - Go-ahead for spent fuel dry store will cut reprocessing costs SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company which operates Scotland's two nuclear power stations and generates nearly half of its electricity, more than quadrupled pre-tax profits in the last financial year. Mr James Hann, chairman, said the results were 'still not good enough, but nevertheless a substantial improvement.' The company aims to make further cost reductions and to become 'privatiseable', by which it means healthy enough to be privatised should the government so choose. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.8m for the year to March 31 compared with Pounds 13.7m previously. Turnover increased almost 10 per cent from Pounds 477m to Pounds 524m. Scottish Nuclear's depreciation was Pounds 14m less than it would otherwise have been, due to its acceptance of an engineering study which extended the operating life - from 30 to 35 years - of the Torness power station in Lothian. A similar study is being carried out on the Hunterston B station in Ayrshire. The company's operating cost fell from 3.21p per unit of electricity to 2.98p. The plants had a combined load factor of 68.2 per cent. There is no non-fossil fuel levy in Scotland, unlike in England and Wales, but Scottish Nuclear sells power to its two customers, ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric, at more than the market price. This will fall, in line with an agreed formula, from 1994-95. Scottish Nuclear hopes shortly to receive planning permission from Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, to build a dry store at Torness to hold spent fuel. The store will open two years after planning permission is granted and the company hopes to save Pounds 45m a year in fees that are currently charged for reprocessing at Sellafield, Cumbria, by British Nuclear Fuels. The company also wants to reduce its bill for fuel, which was Pounds 84.4m last year. It is negotiating with nuclear fuel manufacturers - believed to be in France, Japan and the US - as well as with BNF, which is the world's only supplier of fuel for advanced gas-cooled reactors. Scottish Nuclear said it would consider helping finance the construction of an AGR fuel plant by an overseas supplier. Nuclear Electric has appointed Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance as its financial adviser in the forthcoming government review of the UK nuclear power industry. PW will also advise on NE's business strategy, including the options for raising finance from the public sector. Mr John Collier, NE's chairman, reaffirmed its aim of making a profit without subsidy by 1996.</p>

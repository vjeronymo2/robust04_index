			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Liviu Ioan Stoiciu: "Ion Iliescu Attacks From </F> the Rear"]    [Excerpts] We are not doing very well; there is something  "in the air," a kind of nervousness which cannot be properly  explained. [passage omitted] The amazing thing is that our  chosen ones at the top of the political pyramid at home are  doing pretty badly too. Nevertheless, it is not their health  that is giving them trouble! They are faring rather badly in the  "internal" struggle for power that is being waged in silence.  In their endeavors to strengthen their current positions, they  are making the others suspicious! The one who is pulling the  most strings is none other than Romania's big brother, Ion  Iliescu, the republican of the Central Committee of the  "reformed" Romanian Communist Party [PCR], who takes great care  to ensure his certain perpetuation as the country's president.  [passage omitted]    In the last few days, Ion Iliescu treacherously administered  a death blow to his "disciple," Adrian Nastase [speaker of the  Chamber of Deputies and executive president of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] who has grown too big for his  boots, who has become too "famous" (obviously Ion Iliescu has  not forgiven him the fact that he enjoys the most support from  the electorate, as revealed by a recent public opinion poll  widely disseminated in the media -- maybe that was the cause of  all his misfortune), and who has accumulated too much political  capital through his positions in the ruling party and the  Chamber of Deputies, of which he is the leader, something that  makes him omnipresent to the public at large, thanks to  television and radio coverage. Therefore, it is not accidental  that the government took care to splash on the front page of  ADEVARUL of 27 April (when Adrian Nastase was abroad) an article  entitled: "How Mr. Nastase Got Hold of Several Houses." From  that article, we learn that the current president of the PDSR,  of the Chamber of Deputies, and even of the Romanian Diaspora  (reunited at a recent Congress in Baile Herculane -- this is how  far the political paranoia of accumulating as many functions of  president as possible can go!) is nothing but a second rate  Mafioso, who is illegally acquiring villas through intrigue and  is also involved in various profitable shoddy deals -- under the  cover of relatives -- with cosmetics, pubs, and shops, thus  forcing the state's hand!    All of a sudden, the readers realized who Adrian Nastase --  the man who dreams of becoming Romania's president -- really  was: a "cheat with functions," capable of resorting to any  abuses to satisfy his own interests. All of a sudden, we all  reminded that Adrian Nastase (his father-in-law is the former  nomenklatura man of the Nicolae Ceausescu regime Angelo  Miculescu, who is obviously a big businessman today -- you  realize what kind of world Nastase belongs to) is the one who  has definitively betrayed Romania, along with Ion Iliescu, by  signing the perestroyka treaty with the Soviet Union after the  revolution, in his capacity as minister of foreign affairs.  [passage omitted]    Last week, another significant article against him was  published in ROMANIA LIBERA on 4 June by the alleged  "independent" Antonie Iorgovan (another slimy apparatchik,  currently judge at the Constitutional Court) entitled: "About  the Cockiness of the Power's People and Their Lack of  Restraint." [passage omitted] Driven hard into a corner, Adrian  Nastase stated two days later that everything happening to him  is a "new press campaign against me." A press campaign  orchestrated by whom? Does he mean that our larger-circulation  newspapers have also joined the early electoral campaign against  Adrian Nastase and have nothing else to do than tow Ion  Iliescu's line? Well, if this is the case, we are going through  some pretty hard times ourselves. It seems that the Gods are  still deserting us...</p>

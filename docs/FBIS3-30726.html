However, in times of war, particularly in  such times as face our country and people, this way of doing it  is not common in democratic practice. This assembly is sitting  in session, and this government is submitting a report on the  first 100 days of work only about 300 to 400 meters from the  front line, and this in a city in which over the last few days  alone about 100 civilians have been killed and 200 wounded.    Under these conditions, 100 days to the people exposed to  the  horrors of war is a long time, while to the government of the  country facing tremendous problems, it is a short time. There  is a constant race with time.    Esteemed deputies, I would like to remind you that the new  government took up duty under extremely hard conditions,  characterized by a further escalation of the aggression with the  open military engagement not only of Serbia and Montenegro, but  also the Republic of Croatia; the catastrophic humanitarian  situation, caused by the blockade imposed by both aggressors and  the indecisiveness of the international community to eliminate  that blockade; the deadlock of the peace process that is on the  one hand the result of the aggressor's commitment to the war  option, and on the other, the result of the lack of political  will of the most important international protagonists to achieve  the principles they set themselves in resolutions and other  documents, and the devastated economic and financial system, the  destroyed and badly damaged vital production capacities and the  fractured economic ties between various parts of the country.  This difficult situation has been further worsened by the  problems created through the long- lasting obstruction by  certain members of the previous government. This resulted in  confusion and an interruption in the work of some ministries and  certain segments of the government in general, and further  caused the suspension of work of some significant state  institutions at a time when their work was most needed.    Apart from that, there was the attempt at a separatist  putsch  in the Bihac region, and when the putsch was thwarted, the  separatists stepped into open collaboration with the aggressor.  One should certainly say that the formation of the new  government was spearheaded by the consolidation of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, whose new configuration stood  unified behind the concept of preserving the sovereignty and the  territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  -- on that basis -- behind seeking political solutions in the  peace process, while decisively resisting the aggression and  strengthening the army and all the defense potential.    The formation of the new government was the result of such  commitments, which opened the road to the creation of a  qualitatively new atmosphere in the entire state structure.  Under these conditions the government -- although according to  the Constitution it is responsible for the situation in all  spheres of life -- had to determine the priority tasks and  aims, and for that reason it directed its activities in the  following direction: Providing the most urgently needed means  and conditions for the survival of the population during the  winter period; strengthening the overall defense capacities of  the country, with the stress on strengthening and developing the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army as the key factor of defense;  undertaking measures for alleviating the very hard position of  the refugees and the displaced people, and creating the climate  for their return; adapting the economic and financial system to  a war economy footing in order to place all the resources in the  defense of the country and the survival of the population, and  consolidating the state management and judiciary, and the  advancement of justice in general, and particularly the personal  and property security of all the citizens, and the protection of  human rights, which is particularly important in times of war.  Since the establishment of peace is the main, and within this  government's program, the ultimate aim, the government has been  intensely engaged in the efforts to get the peace process out of  the impasse and steer it in the directions that offer the chance  to establish a just and stable peace.    According to everything, the Geneva talks -- which imposed  the wrong concept from the start -- are facing definite collapse  as both the aggressors are using them as a smokescreen, while  their real aim is to conquer and annex through war most of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina territory. I do not intend to elaborate here  on the reasons for the failure of the peace process so far and  the consequences of that failure, just as I will not elaborate  on the concept of the peace initiative to be launched by our  country since that is the issue to be addressed at a special  point on the agenda of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session.    Nevertheless, I would like to say that the government,  within its sphere of competence, has invested enormous efforts  to avoid the collapse of the peace process. Our diplomacy has  been working very intensively in this direction. It sought and  obtained political support and specific help from friendly  countries. It insisted in the United Nations, the European  Union, NATO, and other relevant international organizations and  institutions to carry out the principles that the international  community has set itself. It spread the truth about  Bosnia-Herzegovina, it mobilized the world public to act by  applying pressure against the inertia and hypocrisy of the  political establishments of their countries.    At the same time, we thoroughly analyzed possible solutions  and intensively sought ways of accepting all options that are  offering at least the minimum of justice and prospects for  stable peace. However, at no time have we ever considered  accepting capitulation. It appears that this is what is being  asked of us.    We are deeply aware that with this kind of attitude by  certain members of the international community we have as many  chances of achieving peace as our army and our people  demonstrate strength, decisiveness, and success in the struggle  for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although sincerely committed to peace, we  had to invest the maximum of effort to further develop and  strengthen our defense capabilities.    Within its sphere of responsibility, the government has  taken  specific measures concerning the creation of a unified system of  financing defense and providing logistical support, because the  unintegrated systems in some communes or districts have not only  been ineffective but also suited the unacceptable concepts of  waging a defense war inside the country and within local  communities, while neglecting the global interests of the  country.    Within the development of the global concept for securing  funds for the needs of the defense, at the proposal of the  government we adopted a decision on a tax for defense and  rebuilding of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This tax is  expected to produce significant results, especially in regard to  the material contributions by our workers employed abroad.    The characteristic of this war is that the aggressors have  been attacking civilian targets with all their might, and that  the mass killing of civilians has become an integral part of the  aggressors' strategy. Despite the fact that we have been taking  certain measures for the protection of the civilian population,  it is obvious that this is becoming a task of the greatest  importance. In this respect the government has already set  directives for the work of the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, Civil Defense, and other institutions of the  system.    We have achieved significant results in the development of  our defense forces. We certainly do not want to create  illusions that we are equal to the aggressor in regard to  military equipment. On the contrary, the unjust embargo has  considerably impaired our defense capabilities. However,  regarding manpower, the organization of the system of command, a  high combat morale, and the mobilization of all potentials on  which the defense depends, we created not only a respectable  army but also an increasingly sound system of defense as a  whole. This is of crucial importance for further course of the  war and the further course and outcome of the peace process,  because we take the view, we are sure that a solution can no  longer be imposed on us with the aggressors' military means.  The international community is becoming aware of this, and so  is the aggressor himself. This means that in the future the  peace process must embark on the path of finding a formula for a  genuine peace, and not capitulation.    Regarding the provision of conditions and means for the  survival of the population in the winter period, I must say that  the results achieved so far are not proportionate to the  enormous efforts invested by the government in this respect.  The activities of the government on securing funds for the  survival of the population were primarily directed at the issues  concerning the delivery of humanitarian aid, the mobilization of  natural resources and available facilities for the production  and distribution of food, and finding energy resources.    Through its relevant ministries the government has also  undertaken measures needed to implement the plan for spring  sowing in 1994 and to activate facilities for the quick  production of food. The key causes of the critical humanitarian  situation lie in the fact that the aggressor is using the  humanitarian situation to achieve his war aims, which cannot be  achieved on the battlefields. At the same time, some  protagonists in international politics are using the grave  humanitarian situation as a means of applying pressure on the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to accept solutions that suit  certain powers in this region. We told the international  community this openly at our extraordinary session.    The (?lack) of resolve by the international community to  carry out the resolutions on the military protection of the  convoys and ensure the safety of relief routes, and the  reluctance on the part of UNPROFOR to carry out at least the  measures that it was empowered to do by the otherwise inadequate  mandate, I repeat the inadequate mandate, have contributed  toward the amount of humanitarian aid that has been delivered  being well below the existential minimum.    For these reasons, the government held an extraordinary  session from which it sent a message to relevant international  institutions and the entire world public to prevent a human  catastrophe. This call has met with a positive response and the  first results can already be felt.    After this objective criticism, one should say that we  appreciate the efforts made by UNPROFOR, UNHCR, and other  humanitarian organizations in practice. We are aware that  without them, with their involvement, the situation would have  been much more difficult. I particularly positively assess the  delivery of aid with parachutes. This was the only way to  (?send aid) to some areas that are completely surrounded.  Although the humanitarian situation is critical in almost all  regions that are under the control of the legal organs of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is nevertheless precisely  because of the persistent and organized efforts by the  government that certain progress has been made, and an even  worse situation avoided, at least for the time being, which was  our aim.    In our effort to transform the economic and financial system  with quick and resolute moves, and adapt it to the demands of  the war economy, the government has instructed the relevant  departments to draw up a list of all available resources and  facilities on the free territories in the shortest possible time  so that they could be included in the system of defense for  survival in an organized and coordinated way. Then, they were  instructed to establish our energy resources and the minimum of  needs for electric power, coal, oil, oil products, gas, and  other energy resources, as well as embark on the revitalization  and reconnection of the electric power system.    In addition, the government has outlined complex measures to  identify social capital as state capital in order to protect it  from illegal misappropriation and use it more efficiently for  the needs of defense. These solutions are of a transient  nature. The ultimate objective is the privatization of capital  when objective conditions have been created for it. The tasks  that have been set in this respect have already been partly  accomplished, or work on their realization is intensively under  way.    When the government presented its program in the inaugural  session, we promised that we would approach the issues of the  status and subsistence of the families of our soldiers and the  killed and wounded members of the armed forces, and other  victims of the war, with special attention and responsibility.  In a relatively short period of time we adopted regulations and  secured funds to solve these issues, at least partly, through  special pensions, the payment of pensions and other income in  kind, the establishment of a system of care and education for  the children of members of the armed forces killed, and the  provision of accommodation and other appropriate measures.  This, of course, is only a small part of the responsibility  that we took upon ourselves, and these issues will remain the  priority in the future work of the government.    Regarding refugees and displaced persons, and the creation  of  conditions for their return, we have embarked on the drafting of  regulations and setting up appropriate institutions so that this  complex and long-tern problem could be dealt with systematically  and in an organized way, not only as a humanitarian and social  problem, but as a strategic issue for which the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is responsible.    The issue of organizing the functioning of the health  service in times of war -- the kind of war waged by the  aggressors against the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- is  extremely important. The government has not had much leeway for  solving these issues, as all the problems present in the  humanitarian situation and aid in general are reflected in the  health service. The blocking of the humanitarian aid has had  extremely dire consequences on the health service. The  international community has been tolerating with incredible  indulgence the open threats by the aggressors in connection with  the delivery of medicine, sanitary and medical equipment, and  the evacuation of the wounded. Our doctors and other medical  staff have been working miracles in extreme hardship and without  the most basic conditions. However, thanks to friendly  countries, we have managed to obtain a minimal amount of  medicine and sanitary materials. The arrival of the field  hospital in Mostar will alleviate at least partly the  intolerable conditions under which the wounded and the sick are  treated in the free part of that city.    Esteemed deputies, times of war are not very favorable for  any spectacular moves by the government in the fields of  culture, science, or education. We have tried, through the  appropriate ministries, to maintain the continuity of the  education process in the conditions of war, primarily keeping in  mind the security of the students, as the schools have become  the aggressor's favorite targets. We have also undertaken  measures to protect the staff, equipment, and other facilities  in the sphere of science from further destruction.    As for culture, we have a phenomenon here worthy of  attention. Despite the extremely unfavorable conditions,  cultural life is not only being preserved but is also being  promoted in European and international circles. That is one of  the spheres that the government does not encourage much owing to  its objectively limited resources. However, the cultural  workers obviously understand this and are putting more into it  than could be realistically expected.    As for the sphere of information, the most important  activities of the government have been directed at providing  factual and expeditious information to the domestic and  international public about all the relevant events in the  country. Through staffing, and the financial and technical  strengthening of the media, the government has also tried to  provide for their integration into a overall system. Through  agreements with governments of friendly countries, and countries  that have received our refugees, and through other forms of  support and means, particularly Radio Television  Bosnia-Herzegovina as the most profuse media, the government  will do everything possible under the circumstances to enable  information from the republic to reach the world. This has not  been the case as yet.    Parallel with the intensive engagement in the peace process,  the government has taken into account overall foreign policy,  which is of particular importance under the circumstances. Our  bilateral activities have been very intensive. We have been  visited by the prime ministers of Pakistan and Turkey, foreign  ministers of Turkey, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and  Croatia, and a number of ministers in charge of humanitarian  aid, parliamentary delegations, other prominent politicians, and  other prominent personalities and intellectuals from all over  the world. As prime minister, I have visited Turkey, Pakistan,  the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and  Croatia. Our foreign minister has visited Hungary, Italy,  Belgium, France, Turkey, Germany, and Austria, and has taken  part in the work of the CSCE and the CEI [Central European  Initiative]. The ministers for education, health, economics,  and interior affairs have also made some important trips abroad.  As for the next period, we have arranged visits to our most  important partners, who influence the peace process in various  constructive ways, or who give us their support and aid in  preserving the independence and integrity of our country. The  government has devoted a lot of attention to promoting relations  with other countries. So far 75 countries have recognized  Bosnia- Herzegovina, while diplomatic relations have been  established with 45 of them. Eighteen countries have accredited  ambassadors to Sarajevo. Bosnia-Herzegovina has opened 22  embassies, three missions within international organizations,  and three general consulates. The public knows little about  this, but it is of great importance for Bosnia-Herzegovina that  it has become a member of a large number of international  organizations over the period that this report covers, from  UNESCO, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the  International Organization for Intellectual Property, the  International Organization for Migration, and so on. Our country  is a signatory to 172 international multilateral agreements and  systems of the United Nations, and another 34 are being  processed. The procedure of ratifying 16 conventions within the  Council of Europe is under way. We have recently signed  agreements on friendly cooperation with Pakistan and Turkey,  while activities aimed at signing bilateral agreements with a  number of other countries are in progress.    The government believes that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly  should debate at one of its next sessions the strategic  directions for our foreign policy engagements. The government  will prepare an adequate platform for that. I would like to  point out that over the last three months the government has  undertaken concrete steps on the consolidation of the state's  administration, the judiciary, and the advancement of law. The  government was formed according to the criteria of competence  and ability, but also that of its members' loyalty to the  struggle for the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a  relatively short time the republic's management has been  successfully reorganized, and all the ministries have been  changed to enable them to carry out their duties more  efficiently. We have been working intensively and with some  success on establishing effective vertical links among the state  bodies, starting from the republic, through the regions to the  communes, where the links had considerably weakened, and in some  parts hardly existed. In that sense the establishment of  ministerial coordinators for certain regions has proven useful.  Apart from the constant presence of these ministerial  coordinators, the practice is being established that other  ministers and government officials should also frequently tour  all the territories under our control, that is, under the  control of the legitimate authorities. We will continue to  develop this practice as it is one of the ways of overcoming  occurrences of autarchy, individualist activities of local  bodies, and in some cases disintegrating moves that weaken the  necessary unity.    The government is speeding up its work on preparing  regulations and other measures with which one would carry out  certain changes in organizing the state structure, so that the  state could function in a united way over the entire free  territory and in the enclaves that are difficult to reach or  those that are completely surrounded. We have demonstrated  resolution in suppressing all forms of lawlessness and it is not  immodest if I say that in strengthening the personal security of  all citizens and security of their property, the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, the security organs of the Defense Ministry  and the Army, judicial organs and other institutions of the  system have made radical moves. Of course, I am far from  claiming that the present situation is good, but it is a fact  that there is a positive state of legality and that the state of  personal security of all citizens and the security of their  property cannot be compared with the situation that the  government had been faced with at the beginning.    At the end of this expose, ladies and gentlemen deputies, I  want briefly to present the basic aims of the government in the  coming period. You have been given the program of work of the  government and have the opportunity to observe and assess its  topicality, the volume of work, and the significance of the  (?tasks) that the government is facing. You have also been  given the detailed programs of work as well as reports on the  work of all ministries. We are probably facing a decisive period  in which not only the further fate of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples, but also the fate of every  individual on this territory will depend.    The government is not going to change the basic concept of  its policy. Our intention is to be a government that will  achieve peace. In this respect, we are going to continue to  make efforts and seek solutions that lead to the end of war.  Because, nobody has more interest to achieve peace than we do,  as the war is hitting us worst. In doing so we shall continue  to seek support and cooperation of the international community,  but we also remain open for dialogue with those political forces  in Serbia and Croatia that are not being behind the great-state,  nationalist, and conquering projects involving our republic.  Vital links do not exist only between Bosnians, Croats, and  Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All peoples in the  countries that appeared on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia have interests in peace, prosperity, and mutual  cooperation. This is the meaning of our call to the Republic of  Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro, as well as other  internationally recognized states that came into being in the  wake of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, to make  decisions on mutual recognition. It is on this basis that  everybody is given prospects that would replace war, hatred,  killing, destruction, and poverty.    You are, however, still (?facing) aggression which is not an  ordinary war, but genocide -- a lot has been said about it here  -- and destruction of all civilizational, spiritual, and  material achievements. As long as this aggression is going on  we have to oppose it, we must defend ourselves, because it is  the natural right of every state and every man. We do not need  the army to conquer foreign territories, but are going to do  everything with a view to having an army that would successfully  defend the territorial integrity of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. These are invariable points in the  government's policy, esteemed deputies, which it presents in  this report to you, and I suggest to you to support us in this  respect. Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> GENESIS MAINSTAY PROVES CRAFTSMAN IN OWN BAND  </P> <P> What is it that the bumper sticker says: "When the going gets weird, the weird  turn pro"? If there is any credence to that, the '80s must be one weird time.  </P> <P> In the '70s, Genesis was about as odd and cultish a band as one could ask for,  unless one was into trepanned skull caps and lyrics in Esperanto. Peter Gabriel  sported a reverse Mohawk and sang about playing croquet with human heads, while  the band reveled in quasiclassical art-rock excursions. The closest thing to an  outside career pursued by any of the group was drummer Phil Collins'  polyrhythmic visits with the even more avant-garde Brand X.  </P> <P> Collins has since developed a grindingly effective pop sensibility, and Gabriel  has proved that he can hit the Top 10 while still keeping a foot in uncharted  territory, but it may yet be Genesis' unassuming bassist-guitarist, Mike  Rutherford, who proves the most canny pop craftsman of the bunch. The music his  Mike + the Mechanics brought to the Pacific Amphitheatre on Sunday never veered  from the mainstream of accessible, radio-ready pop, yet the six-piece group  packed a lot of feeling and content into that limited form.  </P> <P> It helped in no small amount that the Mechanics include one of Britain's most  soulful singers, Paul Carrack (the voice of Ace's pub-rock classic "How Long"  and Squeeze's "Tempted"). Combined with fellow vocalist Paul Young (no, not the  Paul Young) and a rich choral backing from most of the band, the emphasis on  voice kept the 13-song set tilted toward the human and emotional.  </P> <P> That was not always without effort. In addition to the electronic drums, guitar  synthesizers and such, many of the songs used pre-programmed bass and rhythm  tracks. While that beefed the arrangements to match the group's studio sound,  it also lent a locked-in, clinical feeling to some songs. But even when  particularly at odds with the feel of the material, as on the ballad "Nobody  Knows," the warmth of Carrack's rough-grained voice won out.  </P> <P> More of an overt showman, Young was best singing on the up-tempo "All I Need Is  a Miracle" and "Taken In." Aside from a loud jacket, bandleader Rutherford was  scarcely less taciturn than when he performs with Genesis, only singing backup  and leaving most of the flash guitar work to Tim Renwick.  </P> <P> When Rutherford did solo, as on "Nobody Knows," it was typically with an  understated melody that served the song rather than stood out from it.  </P> <P> The Mechanics' songs can be fairly devious things, packing more intent than the  standard radio fare. Live, "Silent Running" came off as a forceful, angry  statement against the institutions that control peoples' destinies (curiously,  an encore version of the Beatles' "Revolution" seemed wan and lifeless).  </P> <P> The show's real depth charge was Carrack's vocal on the hit "The Living Years,"  a genuinely touching ballad about bridging the generations. It also presented  the evening's greatest man-vs.-technology challenge, as Carrack had to work  against a pre-recorded majestic chorus that flew in the face of the direct,  "eye-to-eye" message of the lyric.  </P> <P> Outfield, the opening band, had its most entertaining moment during the  Mechanics' performance, when its three members sprinted across the stage in a  bit of last-night-of-the-tour glee, wearing only towels and shaving cream. They  might as well have been wearing diapers during their own set, which sounded  like nothing so much as a watered-down version of the Babys' preambulant pop.  </P></p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BAe in Pounds 500m sale to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is to buy a further batch of about 20 British Aerospace Hawk jet aircraft and a similar number of basic trainers, worth almost Pounds 500m. The aircraft should be delivered from 1997, to train pilots who will fly the 48 Tornado GR1 ground attack aircraft which were ordered from BAe in January 1993. The UK Ministry of Defence said that dates had been agreed for the supply of training aircraft, but did not give any further details. British Aerospace declined to comment. The aircraft thought to be involved are the Hawk 60 advanced jet trainer and the Swiss-made Pilatus PC-9 turboprop basic trainer, which will be supplied through BAe as the prime contractor. Both aircraft are already used by the Royal Saudi Air Force to train pilots for their current fleet of Tornados. Training crew and other support services are included. The purchase will take place under the Al Yamamah II government-to-government arms deal, payment for which is made in oil. Saudi Arabia is thought to have increased the amount set aside for the programme from 500,000 barrels a day to 600,000 barrels when the second Tornado order was placed in 1993. The training aircraft package will be funded through this increased oil barter. British Aerospace has now sold more than 700 Hawks worldwide to 40 countries. It is used as an advanced trainer to prepare pilots for fast fighter jets with the larger Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 versions used as light fighter or ground attack aircraft. Saudi Arabia presently has 30 of the Hawk 60 aircraft, as well as 72 Tornados, which are a mix of ground attack and air defence variants. BAe has some 4,800 staff working in Saudi Arabia supporting the Al Yamamah deal. The Saudi order will secure work at BAe factories at Warton in Lancashire and Brough on Humberside. Work on the Hawk and Saudi Tornado orders is expected to fill a gap in domestic work until production of the Eurofighter 2000 starts in earnest in 1997-98. Al Yamamah contracts are worth some Pounds 2bn a year to British Aerospace. See Editorial Comment</p>

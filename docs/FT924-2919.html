			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Letter: Not a burdensome inclusion in All-Share Index Sir, Mr Martyn Arbib perhaps overstates his case (Letters, December 7) in criticising the inclusion of specialist investment trusts in the expansion of the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index from January 1 1993. The investment trusts that he named, all specialists in overseas markets, have a total market value of less than Pounds 250m - well below a tenth of 1 per cent of the value of the All-Share Index. If these shares doubled while the remaining shares of the All-Share remained in aggregate unchanged, the effect would be an outperformance of the same amount, that is, less than a tenth of 1 per cent. Hardly burdensome] Pursuing Mr Arbib's argument to its ultimate conclusion would, of course, exclude huge swathes of constituents of the All-Share Index. Would he also exclude BAT, Guinness, Reuters, BP - because of their heavy overseas businesses - to name but a handful? The All-Share Index has been expanded to meet a perceived need of a broad cross-section of fund managers and investors. The addition of some 150 stocks will expand the market value of the index by some 1 per cent. Its re-design can never satisfy all - but will, I trust, meet the needs of most.

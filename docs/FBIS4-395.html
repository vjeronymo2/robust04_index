			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Message" by RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe on 10 April; </F> place not given--read by announcer]    [Text] His Excellency Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, the rebel  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] chairman, is alive. In fact, the  following is his message to Rwandans. Let us remind you that  this message was issued yesterday. He begins with the words, 10  April.    [Kanyarengwe] Today, 10 April, I want to send you this  message. Rwandan men and women, we are going through grave  times. Since President Habyarimana and the Burundi president  died in a plane crash at Kanombe Airport on 6 April, it becomes  clearer as the days go by that Habyarimana's death was planned  by those in charge of his security. It is said that the plans  were agreed upon.    Habyarimana's guard troops, (?watchmen), and their  collaborators are the ones who implemented this criminal scheme  of causing bloodshed and mourning in the country. The death  gave them a pretext to kill innocent people and politicians  opposed to the Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic  [MRND-CDR]. The killers had hoped that the massacres would  annihilate the Arusha peace agreement once and for all.    Those who hatched the assassination plot are the very ones  who killed the late prime minister, politicians including  cabinet ministers, and leaders of parties opposed to the  MRND-CDR. They killed the president of the Constitutional Court  with the aim of restoring the former Parliament made up of MRND  members and to establish a puppet government of the CDR militia,  as its self-styled president said himself at the swearing-in  ceremony on 9 April.    Rwandan men and women, these bloodthirsty criminals are  deceiving themselves. They will not win the war they have  plunged themselves into. The affliction and mourning they have  brought to the Rwandan children are about to backfire. Let them  get ready to face the law. This government of killers which was  announced to Rwandans is not legitimate in the country and has  been denounced abroad. We the RPF have vowed to fight it. We  call upon all Rwandans, particularly peace-loving soldiers, not  to be alarmed by or to obstruct the RPF forces. Instead, they  are requested to cooperate with the RPF and all the peace-loving  people to fight these criminals.    Rwandan men and women, we are saddened by the fact that the  youth continues to be deceived into being accessories to these  killings and riots. We call upon the youth to be realistic and  to avoid actions that might have bad consequences for them. Let  them know that those who have deceived them into such actions  have started fleeing the country. Even at this very moment some  of them have fled, while others boarded planes this morning for  foreign countries. These are the same ones who made use of the  Rwandan Armed Forces, notably the [word indistinct], the CDR  militia, and the pro-MRND militia who have started retreating.  We call upon the youth, whether in the National Armed Forces or  in the CDR militia, and the pro-MRND militia to stop the  criminal activities they have been plunged into.    Rwandan men and women, many innocent people have been killed  on a daily basis. These people committed no other crime than  disagreeing with the MRND-CDR, or affiliation to a different  tribe or region. We must all fight rid Rwanda of such shameless  injustice. I am asking you from the depth of my heart to  support all those who have lost family members, to assist and  console them during these difficult times. We are with you all  in these difficult moments. Thank you.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Geza Entz, chairman of the Office for </F> Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, by Jozsef Szabo; place and  date not given: "We Are Not Interfering in Slovak Internal  Affairs"]    [Text] The Slovak Foreign Ministry accused the Office for  Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders of interfering in the  internal affairs of Slovakia and of misleadingly explaining the  debate of the Bratislava Parliament in December 1993 in its  statements connected with the rally held in Revkomarom over the  weekend. State Secretary Geza Entz, chairman of the Office for  Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, spoke to NEPSZABADSAG  about this new misunderstanding and the controversy over the  parliamentary representation of the national minorities living  in Hungary.    [Szabo] What did your office misinterpret?    [Entz] Nothing. We informed the diplomats and newsmen on  the expected events in connection with the rally in Revkomarom  on the basis of the Slovak press reports available to us. One  of the articles in question was published by UJ SZO [NEW WORD]  in Bratislava, and the Slovaks probably misunderstood this  article, although it was an objective one. The Bratislava note  does not mention what "misleading" explanation we provided. We  are not interfering in internal affairs. We are talking about  Soviet-type accusations here. Gromyko used to be a great master  of such things, and it seems that the Slovak Foreign Ministry  has also become a great master in this.    [Szabo] What is your opinion about the parliamentary  decision that made it impossible for the national minorities in  Hungary to come up with individual election lists?    [Entz] The government position was the correct one, of  course. It is difficult to solve the representation of national  minorities in a one-chamber parliament. Their indirect  representation can be solved in an extraordinary way by means of  a strong positive discrimination. The government proposal  wanted this, but the opposition rejected it by bringing up  constitutional arguments. It is not true that the ethnic and  national minorities in Hungary have no representation. There  are several parliamentary deputies who represent the interests  of national minorities by following the program of their party.    [Szabo] Is this the acceptable solution?    [Entz] It is not sure at all that this is the way to solve  the issue of parliamentary representation for national  minorities living in Hungary. In this particular situation, the  issue can also be solved properly by means of the ombudsman.    [Szabo] Will the Hungarians living beyond our borders suffer  most from this decision?    [Entz] The situation of Hungarians living in the neighboring  countries is totally different from the situation of minorities  living in Hungary. There is no positive discrimination there,  because the Hungarians living in the neighboring countries have  political and cultural traditions and they ensured their  parliamentary representation with the help of their voters.    The issue of national or ethnic communities living in a  quantitative minority is the problem of the country in question.  These problems cannot all be solved according to the same  pattern. The 20th century proved this. Individual countries  must not copy their neighbors.    [Szabo] Do you fear any foreign policy consequences of this  decision?    [Entz] The decision will not have serious international  consequences. Every member of the international community that  does not represent a positive position on settling the national  minority issue or displays a withdrawing attitude will make use  of this. They are those who "argue" that Hungary has territorial  demands. The position of the Hungarian Government played an  important role in making sure that the law on national  minorities contains the need for modifying the electoral law.  This is not an issue closed for good. It should not be  interpreted as a factor that hinders the positive settling of  the minority issue in this region.    [Szabo] Does it seem that some political circles will try to  use this decision against Budapest?    [Entz] This is why we wanted this issue settled in the form  of a government proposal. This did not happen, and some circles  will make use of this against us. One should not dramatize this  fact because, if this decision had not been made, they would  find something else.    [Szabo] Do you see any chance of solving the parliamentary  representation of national minorities in Hungary in a proper way?    [Entz] I am sure that this issue will be solved properly,  because the law on national minorities itself settled this issue  from a more essential and thorough viewpoint. The new  parliament will certainly return to this issue.</p>

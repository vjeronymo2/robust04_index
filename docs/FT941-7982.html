			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (8): New team attempts to generate fresh impetus - Privatisation A new team led by Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, is attempting to give a fresh impetus to Portugal's five-year-old privatisation programme, recently one of the centre-right government's least successful ventures. After buyers snapped up companies on offer in the finance sector, three big privatisations launched last year failed. Mr Antonio de Sousa, secretary of state for finance who took office last December, said that his main priorities were to lift limits for foreigners; achieve a wider distribution of shares; and a faster process, with one privatisation a month. The first failure last year was the planned joint sale of the cement companies Secil-Cimentos Maceira e Pataias (CMP), for which the government received no offer. In the cases of the steel manufacturer Siderurgia Nacional (SN) and Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor (BPSM), the government rejected the offers, one in each case, as too low. This meant that the state received a mere Es70bn from privatisations in 1993, instead of the budgeted Es175bn, already revised late in the year from the original Es225bn. Up to 60 per cent of receipts from privatisations may be injected into companies still state-held, while at least 40 per cent of receipts are earmarked for reducing the public debt. Mr de Sousa is confident that privatisations this year will yield the Es200bn anticipated in the 1994 budget presented by Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, the former finance minister. Mr de Sousa says there will be no limits for foreigners in any further privatisations carried out during this government's term in office, which ends in the second half of 1995. The failed sale of BPSM, whose public tender closed last autumn, was in fact the first without such limits, and the same applies for the sale of Secil-CMP, which was launched this month. Mr de Sousa denies that this new approach is the result of pressure from the European Commission. Portugal has been under threat of legal action in Brussels for alleged violation of the European Union's provisions for the free movement of capital. Mr de Sousa argues, however, that these were not yet in force when Portugal launched its privatisation programme in 1989 and that, in any case, the main disagreement with Brussels is not over first, but second sales. Portugal has always maintained that its initial privatisations were intended to restructure national economic groups, which had suffered 'an abrupt break in historic evolution' as Mr de Sousa put it, when they were nationalised after the 1974 revolution. In January, the government announced it was raising the limit for foreigners in second sales of privatised companies from between 10 and 20 per cent to 25 per cent, unless the maximum was higher anyway in the original sale. 'We will probably be able to increase this limit a little more - to 30 or 35 per cent, says Mr de Sousa, adding that each case will be judged individually, depending on whether the companies have had enough time for restructuring. Mr de Sousa's other pledge is to ensure a wider distribution of shares. 'This isn't so much a change of philosophy', he says, 'but more of a practical change to be applied in the upcoming privatisations, which is also conditioned by the type of companies involved.' Mr de Sousa says that abolishing limits for foreigners, which could favour large international shareholders, will not necessarily clash with the idea of widening distribution. He says distribution should be ensured by the statutes of the company in question rather than by legislation. 'There should be clauses compatible with company law, such as limiting voting power,' he says. 'The change in the statutes will most probably be introduced at the beginning of the privatisation process.' However, wider distribution also implies abandoning one of the government's original concepts, which was to strengthen national groups. 'We have to be realistic about the capital involved and the financial capacity of Portuguese groups', Mr de Sousa concedes. There are, however, plans to maintain national control in strategic sectors, such as energy and telecommunications, either by maintaining a majority or a percentage guaranteeing a strong golden share. There are to be no changes in the method of privatisation applied so far. For each operation, the government will decide whether it should be through negotiation, stock exchange auction, or public tender. The next privatisation, the second attempt at selling the state's shares in Secil-CMP, has already been launched, and at least four more are planned for the first half of this year. Mr de Sousa says the first 25 per cent of Portugal's largest cement company, Cimpor, will be sold off 'before summer' in an stock exchange auction with no indivisible block. Ultimately, the government plans to sell a majority and retain a golden share. A second attempt at privatising Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor will also be made. The 7.5 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA) earmarked for foreigners should be sold in April, while this semester is also likely to see the sale of another segment of the national bus network, Rodoviaria Nacional (RN). RN's two remaining sections are likely to be privatised before the end of the year. There will also be an indirect partial privatisation of Banco Fomento Exterior through Cimpor's 30 per cent holding in the bank, and Mr de Sousa says that the privatisation of BFE could go even further at a later stage. There is less certainty for this year in the attractive telecommunications sector. The merger of state-held companies Telecom and Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) which, between them, operate telephone links in Portugal, Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as Teledifusao Portuguesa (TDP), which beams television signals around Portugal, must take place first. No decision has been taken yet on the possible integration of the overseas operator Marconi, which is only 51 per cent state-held. Problems involving three complicated cases are still being resolved. The much-restructured Siderurgia Nacional is in the process of being reassessed, but for Mr de Sousa it is clear that any further restructuring will have to be carried out by the buyers. In the case of the oil giant Petrogal, the government is still negotiating with Petrocontrol, a consortium comprising domestic investors and Total of France. The group bought 25 per cent in 1992, but is refusing to fulfil its obligation to acquire a further 26 per cent within three years, unless the government injects funds. Although Mr de Sousa is confident that upcoming privatisations will prove attractive, the recent difficulties indicate that the government might find it hard to achieve its aim of reducing the weight of the state sector in the overall economy by half, to 8.5 per cent, during the current legislature.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [KYODO embargoes following item for release at 2200 GMT on </F> 20 April]    [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan is unlikely to  respond to fresh prodding from the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) for more steps to boost its sluggish economy, sources said  Thursday [21 April].    "It's hard to think of what we might do," a government  source  said. An international financial source said no new steps are  likely as the effects of measures taken thus far are likely to  be enough.    Coming in a report just days before a gathering Sunday of  finance leaders from seven major industrial nations, the nudge  from the IMF is sure to be a topic at the Washington meeting.    The report sees a mere 0.7 percent real economic growth for  Japan this year, the weakest of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations  and 2.3 percent in 1995. "For the upswing to gain sufficient  momentum, continued fiscal support and a further easing of  monetary conditions may well be required," it says.    Those steps include a record 15 trillion yen stimulus  package  in March and a series of official discount rate cuts to bring  the key lending rate to a record low 1.75 percent a year.    Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied Tuesday that he  is considering cutting the discount rate again and warned about  inflation and overheating from "an over-ambitious macroeconomic  policy to rectify the internal imbalances."    A Finance Ministry official noted that the IMF report says  "bilateral trade and current account positions are clearly not  an appropriate focus for trade policy" and that trade disputes  should be solved "in a manner that is consistent with  multilateral principles."</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Riverbus survives storm at Canary Wharf RIVERBUS, the Thames passenger service, won a reprieve yesterday when Ernst &amp; Young, the administrators of Canary Wharf, said it could continue even though it depends on Olympia &amp; York, which owns the crisis-ridden building, as its main backer. The high-speed service, which runs between Chelsea and Greenwich, is underpinned financially by O&amp;Y and has so far made big losses. Since its launch in the mid 1980s it has needed a Pounds 2.5m injection by a consortium of five property developers and a government grant of Pounds 500,000. Analysts had considered it a likely early casualty once O&amp;Y went into administration. Riverbus is owned by a partnership of O&amp;Y and the property division of P&amp;O, the shipping company, which is the developer of Chelsea Harbour. P&amp;O manages Riverbus via seconded managers, but has no liabilities and owns less than 6 per cent of the issued share capital. P&amp;O welcomed the administrators' decision. It said: 'We are quite happy to leave our manager in there to keep it running . . . It's the only form of commuter transport on the river at the moment.' Instead of marking its death knell, yesterday turned out to be one of Riverbus's best days. Business on all its craft was brisk as Londoners and tourists travelled in sunshine to look at the building which the past week's welter of cartoons and photographs has turned into a famous landmark. One employee said: 'The first boat was full and we had to turn people away in the end because it was so busy. We've been doing extremely well.' It remains unclear how many of Riverbus's passengers were prospective tenants or predators, and how many simply wanted to see the Canary Wharf tower. Docklands may have potential as a tourist destination. The top of the tower was opened to the families of potential investors for a brief period in February and March, when O&amp;Y was attempting to raise finance via a tax shelter scheme.</p>

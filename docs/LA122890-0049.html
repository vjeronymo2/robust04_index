			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHERE ARE THEY NOW? 6 STORIES REVISITED;  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY: LANCASTER LOOKS TOWARD A SPRING OPENING, AND PALMDALE HAS  PLANS FOR A NEW THEATER.  </P> <P> Construction of a 700-seat performing arts theater in Lancaster, featured in an  April article about theaters in the Antelope Valley, has remained almost on  schedule even in the wake of a tragic accident.  </P> <P> In October, during a tour of the construction site by members of the Lancaster  Woman's Club, 87-year-old Viola Parr died after falling 20 feet from a  staircase into the orchestra pit. "The other women who knew her knew that she  was very devoted to the arts," Susan Davis, the city's cultural arts  superintendent, said. "They said there was no way she would have wanted this  project to be stalled by what took place."  </P> <P> Since the accident, there have been no tours of the Lancaster Performing Arts  Center, scheduled to be completed in spring.  </P> <P> Davis was hired in September to oversee operation of the city-owned arts  center. A former management assistant to the city manager of Lancaster, she has  had no previous experience in running a theater.  </P> <P> She said negotiations are under way to bring a one-person show to the theater  for the gala opening, followed by several other acts, including a touring opera  company. She declined to name any of the proposed performers.  </P> <P> Because the theater will be by far the biggest and best equipped in the  Antelope Valley, Davis said she has been besieged with inquiries from community  performance groups, schools, churches and local dance studios. No policy has  been set on how much community groups will be charged to use the facility.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, plans to build a nearly identically sized theater in nearby Palmdale  have been drastically overhauled -- twice. In June, the City Council decided to  scrap plans to build the theater because of the ever-rising estimated cost of  the proposed project, a figure that could go as high as $8 million. Instead, it  voted to renovate a 40-year-old, 400-seat high school auditorium.  </P> <P> But in October community groups convinced the council that the renovation would  cost nearly as much as a new 400-seat theater. The council voted to go forward  with developing plans for the new, scaled-down theater on land donated by a  local developer.  </P> <P> David Milligan, head of the community arts group that used its own money to  hire an architectural firm to do the design, said the next step is to have the  council approve the design. He said he hopes that the Palmdale theater will be  ready to open in two years. DAVID COLKER  </P></p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Exeter Preferred Capital for main market via offer for subscription EXETER PREFERRED Capital Investment Trust, which will invest in the shares of split capital trusts, is joining the main market via an offer for subscription. The new trust has an unusual structure, with Pounds 28.5m of zero coupon debenture stock already being placed with an institution. This stock has a nominal value of Pounds 83m and will be redeemed in 2002, a gross return of about 11.25 per cent a year. The other class of capital in the trust is ordinary shares, of which 22.5m are being offered for subscription at Pounds 1 each by stockbroker Greig Middleton. By investing in the zero coupon shares and high yielding income shares of other investment trusts, the aim is to achieve capital growth on the shares of around 13 per cent per annum. In addition, the trust will pay a modest dividend, which will bring the redemption yield up to 13.5 per cent a year. Exeter Preferred Capital will be managed by Ian Henderson Associates, a group which runs a series of unit and investment trusts specialising in the split capital trust area. The trust is capable of being held in a Personal Equity Plan (PEP), although the low dividend yield means that this will only be suitable for those investors who regularly pay capital gains tax. Applications, for a minimum of 500 shares, must be made by January 23 and dealings will start on January 29.</p>

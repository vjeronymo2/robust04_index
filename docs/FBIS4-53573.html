			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The economy has yet to show  that it is about to recover but the long economic slump is not  worsening, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Friday [20 May].    "Japan's economic growth appears to have stopped weakening,"  the BOJ said in its monthly economic review, using almost the  same words as a month ago. "However, there are no clear  indications of imminent recovery."    Personal consumption, a main engine of growth, "is picking  up  gradually," while housing and public-sector investment are  strong, but corporate capital spending is still falling, the  report says.    Job growth remains slow, the central bank said, but it noted  a halt to the falling ratio of job offers to seekers.    Money supply growth remains low due to weak lending by  banks,  the report asserts, saying rises in March and April to the top  of the BOJ's forecast range resulted from "portfolio shifts  between money and other financial assets" not counted in the  money supply.    On inflation, it says domestic wholesale prices are falling  on weak demand and cheaper imports, service prices are stable  and consumer price increases remain low.    Industrial production "has virtually stopped decreasing,"  the  central bank said, although it noted that the trade ministry  expects declines in April and May in the wake of stepped-up  spending before the end of the fiscal year.    Capital spending continues to fall among manufacturers --  except for such bright spots as semiconductors, liquid crystal  displays and cellular telephones -- and is stagnant among  nonmanufacturers, the report says.    It notes recent rises in Japan's trade surplus but says the  current-account surplus "has peaked" due to "larger deficits in  invisible and transfer accounts."</p>

Saporito, Jr. filed a petition under 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations requesting that the NRC take action against Florida Power and Light Co. as operator of the Turkey Point and St. Lucie nuclear power stations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitioner asks that the NRC institute a show cause proceeding to modify, suspend or revoke Florida Power and Light Co.'s operating licenses and that the NRC take escalated enforcement action for retaliatory actions which were taken against him, a former employee, for engaging in protected activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.7. Petitioner asks that the NRC also take escalated enforcement action against every employee of the company who is found to have been involved in the retaliatory actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to determine which Licensee employees were involved in the relatiatory actions and to assess the overall work environment at the plants, Petitioner asks that the NRC conduct an investigation. In addition to the specific acts of retaliation he claims were taken against him, the Petitioner alleges that other employees have also been retaliated against, creating a chilling effect at the Turkey Point plant beginning in 1988. Petitioner asks that the NRC initiate an investigation into his claims, which involve alleged violations of 10 CFR 50.7 and 19.15 and the Energy Reorganization Act, notwithstanding the fact that they are being pursued within the Department of Labor, because of the asserted public health and safety implications involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitioner's request has been referred to the Director of the Office of Enforcement. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this request within a reasonable time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 24th day of June 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph R.

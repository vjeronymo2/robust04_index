			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled "Own Information" report] </F>   [Text] The Russian Association of Koreans "Bomminren" has  made a statement in connection with recent events concerning the  Korean peninsula which, due to the United States, have assumed a  dangerous character.    Just recently, the statement says, the public greeted with  satisfaction the news of an agreement being reached on a  comprehensive solution for the so-called Korean nuclear  question. Then suddenly the alarming news broke that the  American side, using its dominant position in the International  Atomic Energy Agency, had broken off all these agreements and  made blunt threats against the DPRK which were accompanied by a  stream of lies and slander aimed at North Korea. By so doing  the United States and its allies revealed their true plans:  Using the situation which had developed, they planned to  slander and strangle the socialist state on Korean soil and  prevent Korea's peaceful unification.    The Russian association "Bomminren" resolutely condemns the  Americans' plans. On behalf of the many thousands of Koreans  living in various countries outside of Korea it demands that the  row and provocation connected with the so-called nuclear  question on the Korean peninsula be stopped.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested amending the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;668.23(b)(3) governing reasonable access to an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel to allow an institution the basic right to protect its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest during a compliance review by having an attorney, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management representative, or a tape recorder present when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education conducts an interview with a person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed by the institution. A few commenters suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these provisions violate an employee's constitutional rights to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counsel. One commenter stated that as a minimum, an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should have the opportunity to build its own record and rebut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inaccurate charges by having tape recordings of interviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between its employees and the Department of Education's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives. Several commenters were against the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section that require a third-party servicer, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct of audits, investigations, or program reviews, to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its individual employees_those employees connected with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs_to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questioned in private, without management being present or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the questioning being tape recorded. Many of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters contended that this requirement violated an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual's right to due process. One commenter felt that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary was overstepping his statutory authority in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has already responded to similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments in the preamble to final regulations for parts 600 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 668 that was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 31, 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (56 FR 36682). The Secretary continues to disagree with these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> views and in the three years since these regulations have been in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect has received no evidence that the claims of the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are justified. With respect to third-party servicers, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions simply add requirements for third-party servicers that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parallel current requirements for institutions participating in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters recommended that an institution should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to use a third-party servicer's annual compliance audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report to satisfy the portion of an institution's audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for those areas that the servicer has contracted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer on behalf of the institution. These commenters noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this idea would eliminate duplication of effort by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent auditors auditing a third-party servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary generally agrees with commenters that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution may use a third-party servicer's audit report to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover those areas of an institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs that the institution has contracted with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer to administer. However, if an institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to have audited additional areas of its administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or is required to use different procedures in having the audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed than the servicer then the institution may not be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use fully the results of the servicer's audit. An institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is always responsible for ensuring that a compliance audit of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes all aspects of the institution's participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Forty-three commenters suggested that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ought to be permitted to remain under the biennial audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement if that institution did not have deficiencies in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior audit report of more than five percent of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total Title IV, HEA program funds. Many of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out that this modification would parallel a similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in the proposed &sect;668.15 governing financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. At a minimum, the commenters recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these provisions be modified to reflect that an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had no deficiencies that required a monetary adjustment be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted to remain under the biennial audit requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters asked the Secretary to clarify what are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be no deficiencies and material exceptions. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested specifying certain amounts in the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those terms. Three commenters supported the Secretary's proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide exceptions to the annual audit requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers that administer small amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program funds. One commenter argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers administering less than $250,000 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program funds should not be excluded from having an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual audit performed. One commenter recommended that instead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of requiring third-party servicers to have performed a compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit at least every two years if the servicer administers less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than $1,000,000 in Title IV, HEA program funds, that that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold should be increased to $5,000,000. Three commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urged the Secretary to require all third-party servicers to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an annual audit performed. One commenter suggested defining what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is meant by a material exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has reevaluated his proposal in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 17 and 28, 1994, NPRMs and upon a further examination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 487(c) of the HEA and information surrounding the intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the statute, has determined that the proposals were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with the requirement for an institution to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed, without exception, on an annual basis, a compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit of the institution's administration of its Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs or a third-party servicer to have performed, without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions, on an annual basis, a compliance audit of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's administration of any aspect of its administration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary appreciates the comments and suggestions provided with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the basis for exempting institutions and third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers from the annual audit requirement. While the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot adopt these in the regulations, the Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering them in the development of changes to the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Education's audit guides. These changes are being designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce administrative costs by allowing institutions that meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain performance-based or funding criteria to have performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance audits under a reviewed or compiled basis rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully audited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

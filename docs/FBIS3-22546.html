It is estimated that about 20,000 people  are now infected with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], the  virus that causes AIDS. About 6 percent, or about 1,200 people,  of those infected are expected to develop AIDS (a disease that  weakens the body's immune system). Those who show symptoms of  AIDS require treatment, like it or not.    Data so far gathered by the Department of Health show that  at  the end of last year there were 177 HIV victims, a figure that  rapidly increased to 187. "Clinically, only about 40 of that  number are actually suffering from AIDS," said Dr. Broto  Wasisto, M.D., M.P.H. [Master of Public Health], director  general of medical services of the Department of Health. In view  of this phenomenon, class A and B hospitals throughout Indonesia  must be prepared to treat them. "The Department of Health has  distributed to all hospitals books with instructions on how to  care for AIDS victims," he declared.    Not all hospitals are able to do this yet. In a panel  discussion at RSCM [Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital] last year on  improving capabilities for managing AIDS cases at hospitals  throughout Jakarta, it was learned that hospitals are generally  ready. "The problem, however, is that their perception of  treating AIDS is not yet the same," said Dr. Samsuridjal Djauzi,  an internist who also handles AIDS at the RSCM.    A discussion panel participant from PELNI [Indonesian  National Maritime Company] Hospital admitted, "We feel awkward  explaining AIDS to a patient or the patient's family." Thus,  procedures for the counseling of patients are clearly important,  and not only from the medical aspect. "They are often stressed  and afraid and still consider AIDS a stigma or something  unusual," Samsuridjal said.    Dr. Lukas Mangindaan, a psychiatrist who provides AIDS  counseling at RSCM, said that counseling is necessary in order  to find out how much the patient and the patient's family know  about HIV. "Discussion of sexual matters must be done in a way  that does not embarrass or offend the patient. Questions about  sex need to have a special place in AIDS consultation, because  most transmission of HIV occurs through sexual relations," Lukas  said.    At RSCM, patients infected with HIV, and especially AIDS,  are  treated immediately without the patient being put to the trouble  of administrative procedures and questions of advance payment.  In fact, RSCM also gives basic medicines without charge. These  include antibiotics and lifesaving medicines of an emergency  nature, such as infusions.    The upgrading of hospital facilities to treat AIDS patients  is actually not a difficult matter. Of course, additional cost,  such as for procuring gloves, will be incurred to prevent spread  of the disease. The use of gloves, however, is not just for  AIDS, because there should be safety measures to prevent the  spread of disease between doctors/staff and patients and among  patients. For that reason, doctors, nurses, and cleaning staff  must use gloves.    It is clear that doctors, nurses, laboratories,  administrative staff, and cleaning personnel must be prepared  for treating AIDS patients. Samsuridjal described RSCM's  experience. When an AIDS case was diagnosed, links had already  been established with the clinical laboratory and clinical  pathologist so that when a specimen was taken from the patient,  it was immediately dealt with safely. In addition, within the  AIDS treatment team a doctor must be appointed to be  responsible. When that is not done, sometimes not even one  doctor examines a patient.    "The important thing is the willingness of doctors and  hospitals to treat AIDS patients," said Samsuridjal. There have  been hospitals that for lack of experience have been unwilling  to treat patients and have sent them to RSCM. "That should not  happen," said Dr. Kartono Muhammad, general chairman of the IDI  [Indonesia Physicians Association]. Besides RSCM, other  hospitals in Jakarta are able to treat AIDS victims. They  include MMC [expansion not given] Hospital, PERTAMINA [National  Oil and Natural Gas Company] Hospital, Kramat Hospital, Mitra  Keluarga Hospital, and St. Carolus Hospital.    According to Broto Wasisto, for the treatment of AIDS the  focus is generally on class A and B hospitals, which have  specialist doctors and complete facilities. Many nurses from  class A and B hospitals have been sent overseas to learn how to  care for AIDS patients. "Two years ago Indonesia sent nurses to  Australia, the United States, and Thailand," Broto said.    According to Samsuridjal, AIDS has attacked not only  residents of big cities but people from small cities, too. He  recommended, therefore, that class C hospitals -- which normally  are in the provinces -- also be prepared. Broto said there are  two steps that class C hospitals must take if they receive AIDS  patients: Send them to class A or B hospitals, or bring in  specialists from class A or B hospitals. This is called a  referral system, whether from above or from below, depending on  the situation.</p>

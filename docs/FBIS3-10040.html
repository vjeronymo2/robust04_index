			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ruben Cortes] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 26 Feb (PL) -- Hector Rosada,  coordinator of the Guatemalan Government Peace Commission,  disclosed today that the new date for the resumption of  negotiations in Guatemala resulted from a government-guerrilla  agreement with the United Nations.    Rosada explained to PRENSA LATINA by telephone from  Guatemala  City that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's suggested  dates of 3 through 7 March for a round of talks in Mexico City  was discussed with both sides.    Meanwhile, the political-diplomatic representatives of the  insurgent Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) said  the guerrillas would not agree to hold the round of talks after  28 February.    "In the presence of the United Nations we agreed with the  government delegation during a meeting in Mexico on 10 January  that we would formally resume the talks during the second half  of February. For the URNG there is no other date," explained  Luis Becker, a diplomat for the guerrillas.    Nevertheless, Joe Sills, a UN spokesman, explained that the  summons to a meeting presented by the United Nations to the URNG  "came after negotiators from both sides were consulted."    Meanwhile, Rosada said that the government always considered  it counterproductive for the formal resumption of the talks  (after nine months at a standstill) to coincide with the UN  Human Rights Commission talks under way in Geneva.    National and international humanitarian organizations  attending the meeting in Switzerland are seeking formal  condemnation against Guatemala for its alleged abuses against  citizen freedoms.    To this end, Rosada admitted that during the next  Government-URNG round of talks an effort will be made to achieve  a consensus on citizen prerogatives and a schedule to discuss  other pending issues.    Among the latter are the creation of a commission to  investigate human rights violations, establishment of a  cease-fire schedule, and discussion on disarmament and  demilitarization.    Although the Guatemalan Government and guerrillas held a  preliminary meeting in Mexico City between 6 and 10 January,  they have not held an official meeting since 8 May 1993, when  the talks in Mexico City fell through without any agreements.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL ON TOP;  </P> <P> A WORLD OF CHANGING LEADERS, STRUGGLING GOVERNMENTS AND STRANGE BEDFELLOWS;  </P> <P> POLAND: A TRIUMPH OF MODERATION  </P> <P> For a couple of years, it was the traditional state of affairs: Poles on each  side being maximalists in politics, as in war and romance, demanding  everything, offering nothing, eschewing compromise and practicing the "politics  of the worst," hoping the other side would commit catastrophic errors even if  the whole society suffered.  </P> <P> Forty years of communism had created hostilities so deep that the nation seemed  doomed to suicidal stalemate.  </P> <P> No longer. Sunday, June 4, 1989, is the date that will live in the history of  postwar communism. That was the day when the first relatively free Polish  elections in 42 years were held -- with Solidarity candidates demolishing what  was left of the ruling Communist Party's credibility. That same day, across the  globe on Tien An Men Square, Chinese army tanks and machine guns made a blood  bath of the rising pro-democracy movement .  </P> <P> In historical perspective, those Polish and Chinese events must be seen as the  dawn of a new era.  </P> <P> For Poland, the election results mark the end of four decades of unquestioned  communist domination.  </P> <P> For China, the Beijing massacre represents a tragic chapter in the struggle for  political freedoms, in the same sense Solidarity's brutal but not bloody 1981  suppression by the Polish army was part of the change culminating in its  electoral triumph 7 1/2 years later. China is by no means a freeze-frame.  </P> <P> Poland attained what seemed wholly implausible even in the mid-1980s: the  peaceful emergence of a pluralistic society and a full range of political  liberties in a communist-controlled nation. In the Soviet Union, reform forces  are strong in the new Legislature but the Communist Party itself is not yet  being challenged. Poland is an unprecedented phenomenon in Marxist-Leninist  annals.  </P> <P> Yet the evolution away from communism should not come as a total surprise,  either to those who have watched the unfolding Polish situation or to those who  were not wedded to the conventional Washington wisdom that gradual change  toward freedom in a communist system is an impossible oxymoron.  </P> <P> My experiences in Poland as far back as 1987 (two years is a long time in the  breathless political metamorphosis) bear out the proposition that elementary  logic had to bring together the communist regime and the democratic opposition  if the nation were to be saved from utter collapse, economic and social. The  best brains in both camps had come, however reluctantly, to recognize this  reality.  </P> <P> In 1987 at Gdansk, Lech Walesa, the chief of the then-illegal but enormously  popular Solidarity movement, was already predicting, "Sooner or later, we shall  meet with Jaruzelski on the way to reform." Though the government increasingly  tolerated Solidarity's activities, I was surprised that Walesa was prepared to  deal with Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief who tried to  liquidate Solidarity and who kept Walesa virtually imprisoned for nearly two  years.  </P> <P> Walesa, moreover, expressed no bitterness; in fact, he seemed to have  considerable respect for Jaruzelski, certainly not regarding him -- unlike many  other Poles -- as a Soviet stooge. Seeing Walesa for the first time since  Solidarity's heyday in 1981, he seemed much more mature politically, more  realistic and more moderate than I had expected a victim of Jaruzelski's regime  to be.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that he had lost control of Solidarity's "radical wing" during  confrontations with the government; he implied that moderation was the only way  to keep Poland a viable country.  </P> <P> A separate conversation with historian Bronislaw Geremek, Walesa's most trusted  political strategist (now Solidarity's Parliamentary leader in the Sejm, the  lower house), convinced me that the Polish opposition had begun to think  compromise was the bridge toward a peaceful fade-out of communist supremacy.  </P> <P> Next, I had a two-hour private chat in Warsaw with the general himself. I had  first talked to Jaruzelski in 1982, six months after he imposed martial law in  order to crush Solidarity. He began by telling me, "We have all changed and we  have all learned a lot," and he had fairly kind words for what he called "the  moderate opposition."  </P> <P> Other conversations with members of Jaruzelski's entourage further suggested  that some form of cooperation among rival groups was recognized as vital, and  that the young generation in the Communist Party favored it as well.  </P> <P> But, as usually occurs in such situations, moderates on both sides -- Walesa  and Geremek among the opposition, Jaruzelski and his allies in the fragile  regime -- had to persuade their respective constituencies that compromise was  necessary.  </P> <P> Opposition moderates had to maneuver carefully to retain the support of  confrontation-minded foes of the regime, "the children of Solidarity." Some  young activists abhored any dealing with the government and even suspected the  Roman Catholic Church of collaborationism.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski had support from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev who, unlike  Leonid I. Brezhnev, approved of Polish reform alongside his own perestroika,  but the general had to fight Polish hard-liners who consistently sabotaged  reform.  </P> <P> Widespread wildcat industrial strikes during 1988 -- deplored by the regime,  also deplored by Walesa who risked his popularity by insisting that workers  return to their jobs -- loosened the national paralysis. In the past, strikes  triggered new confrontations; this time they helped pave the way to an  understanding. A new phase opened early this year as regime leaders and  moderate opposition leaders finally determined to meet halfway.  </P> <P> The rest is history. The government and the moderate opposition spent long  weeks negotiating -- itself a giant leap forward -- to produce amazing  breakthroughs. Jaruzelski and his principal advisers agreed to re-legalize  Solidarity and to allow a free press, in exchange for opposition commitment not  to challenge the nominal sway of the Communist Party and to support its  presidential candidate.  </P> <P> Even more spectacular was the agreement on direct elections for 35% of seats in  the Sejm (Solidarity agreed to let the Communists have a strong majority) and  for all 100 seats in a Senate that was being restored as the upper house for  the first time since World War II.  </P> <P> When I saw Geremek in Washington just before the June elections, we reminisced  about our Warsaw chats two years earlier, marveling at how quickly things had  progressed. But he did not expect the landslide that awarded Solidarity and  other opponents 99 Senate seats and all the Sejm seats allotted to them.  </P> <P> Stunning as it was to see these results, with Jaruzelski and Walesa together on  a bench at the Sejm inaugural session (inasmuch as neither ran for Parliament),  Solidarity's next gesture of statesmanship was even more extraordinary.  </P> <P> Aware that a combination of opposition radicals and communist hard-liners had  the power to prevent Jaruzelski's election to the presidency, Geremek and  Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski manipulated the parliamentary voting to  assure his victory on July 19 -- by one ballot. Incredibly, Solidarity handed  power to the man who once tried to destroy it, because the general was the most  promising choice and his defeat could unravel the entire compromise.  </P> <P> The next historic chapter has begun. With a $39-billion foreign debt, shattered  infrastructure and runaway inflation, Poles must now decide how to run the  country, realizing that Western aid cannot perform miracles. Jaruzelski would  like the opposition to join a coalition government, another Polish communist  "first." As of last week Solidarity flatly refused, holding out for a  full-fledged Solidarity government with its own premier. Maximalizing may not  be entirely dead. Yet the Poles have crossed a Rubicon: For the first time in  half a century, destiny is in their own hands.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Binyon report: "Kazakhstan Proposes Security </F> Conference"]    [Text] President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan yesterday  unveiled details of a proposal for an Asian security conference,  a day after depositing with John Major his country's instruments  of ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.    Speaking on the final working day of a visit to Britain, the  leader of the largest former Soviet Central Asian republic said  the proposed conference, modelled on the 1975 Helsinki accords,  would attempt to set up new confidence-building measures at a  time of rising tensions in Asia.    He said 27 nations had shown interest and Kazakhstan was  going ahead with a preparatory conference to be attended by  Deputy Foreign Ministers. Two meetings of experts had been  held, and preparations were under way for a summit of heads of  state.    Among those invited are all the former Soviet republics of  Central Asia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, North Korea,  Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia. He hoped that Britain  and other European nations could also be associated with the  conference, and said Mr. Major had responded positively.    Kazakhstan is one of the world's only nuclear powers  voluntarily to give up its weapons, having scrapped 1,100  warheads. Britain, together with Russia and America, now has a  formal role in guaranteeing the country's non-nuclear status.  Much of Mr. Nazarbayev's visit here has been taken up with the  rapidly expanding business links. New agreements were signed in  Downing Street on double taxation, the protection of Western  investments, economic cooperation, education and science. The  Kazakh government is on the brink of signing a huge contract  with British Gas.</p>

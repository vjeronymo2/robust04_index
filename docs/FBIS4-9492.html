			<p>BFN     [Text] At the start of the news I will read to our  listeners an announcement we received a few minutes ago from our  government reporter, Kalina Stancheva:    At the start of today's cabinet session Valentin Karabashev  submitted to the prime minister his resignation from the posts  of trade minister and deputy prime minister. He said that he  does not accept as well-founded the attacks that Prime Minister  Berov made in his parliamentary statement yesterday against his  work as minister of trade and deputy prime minister, accusing  him of forgetting about privatization and failing to provide  assessment reports on the work of the Trade Ministry. He said  that the cabinet changes envisaged by the prime minister did not  coincide with his own views.    These in short seem to be the motives for Karabashev's  resignation, which will take effect if it is accepted by the  National Assembly.    In this connection, National Assembly Deputy Asen Michkovski  announced that he will propose to the New Alliance for Democracy  parliamentary group to start collecting signatures for a  petition asking for the parliamentary Easter vacation to be  curtailed. In Michkovski's view, the fact is that we are in a  government crisis and the National Assembly should be reconvened  as soon as possible.</p>

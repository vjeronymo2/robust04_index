			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: A pilgrimage to Van Gogh - William Packer visits the little cafe in Auvers-sur-Oise where the artist died AUVERS-SUR-OISE is a village some 12 miles north-west of Paris strung out along the road from Pontoise to the west, with the hills behind it and the river before. The traffic apart, it still retains much of the character that attracted such painters as Cezanne, Bernard, Pissarro and Daubigny, more than 100 years ago. There, for two months in the summer of 1890, came Vincent van Gogh: and there, towards the end of July, in the cornfields above the village, close by the cemetery, he shot himself. He had been staying at the Auberge Ravoux, a small cafe in the centre of the village that let rooms to artists for a pittance. It was to there that he was brought back from the fields, and there, after lying for two days in his tiny room, that he died. In 1985 the house was listed as an historic monument, since when its present owner, a Belgian, Dominique-Charles Janssens, has set himself to its restoration. It opened to the public in mid-September, its ground-floor still a working restaurant, its upper floors converted to its purposes as, in its way, a place of pilgrimage. Van Gogh's own room, on the top floor at the corner of the back stairs, is of course the focus of all interest. It is no more than a cell, truly tiny with its only window high in the ceiling. It has been left entirely bare, stripped down to the grey plaster marked only by the holes of nails long ago knocked in to hold up pictures - the sense of the reliquary to the credulously devout not altogether inappropriate. It is infinitely touching, the judgment not to turn the place into a sort of tableau entirely right. The room next door, which had been taken at the time by another painter, a young Dutchman, Anton Hirschig, who nursed Van Gogh through those last days, is furnished simply with chair and narrow bed to give a scale. The visit ends with a slide-anthology of Van Gogh's Auvers paintings, pointed with quotations from his letters to his brother, Theo. It is very well done, but be warned - so small is the place that visitors are let in only four or five at a time, and the show follows only when a score or so are assembled, which does tend to hold up the queue waiting outside. It is a system that needs radical rethinking. But no visit to Auvers should be to the Auberge Ravoux alone. Entrance is from the lane behind the house that leads on, by way of the wooden steps, familiar from the painting - Vincent produced some 70 paintings during those last two months - through the upper village to the great church of Our Lady at the top. That is the subject of one of the most celebrated of all his works, the monumental pile rearing up red and ochre against the deep ultramarine of the sky. At the very point at which he worked the Commune has put up a reproduction of the work itself, discreetly mounted, just as it has at several such points about the place. But the final object of pilgrimage must be Van Gogh's grave, which we reach by following 'la route de la cortege,' on past the church and up the hill. There on the open plain at the top is the cemetery, from the corner of which we look back down and across the fields, just as Van Gogh did himself, to the roofs of the cottages tucked in a fold in the hill. Vincent lies hard against the far wall, with his brother beside him, who died but six months later. Their graves could hardly be simpler, two low and simple headstones, Ici reste Vincent Van Gogh, Ici reste Theo Van Gogh. And over them both, as over a double-bed, is thrown what can only be described as a dense duvet of ivy, neatly trimmed as though tucked in, grown from a cutting taken long ago by Theo's widow from the garden of Vincent's friend in the village, Doctor Gachet. She had brought her husband's body to France in 1914, to lie beside that of his brother: and ivy is the symbol of brotherly love. Over the wall, the cornfields roll away and the crows hang in the wind, just as they did a century ago. Maison de Van Gogh, Auberge Ravoux: open daily 10-6, entrance FFr25. By train from Paris Nord or St Lazaire, change at Pontoise for Auvers-sur-Oise</p>

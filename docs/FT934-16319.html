			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Lockerbie setback for UN chief MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, told the Security Council yesterday that no progress had been made with Libya on setting a date and place for the surrender of two men accused of the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, Reuter reports from New York. The US, Britain and France now intend to press ahead with a resolution tightening sanctions against Tripoli and hope the Council will adopt it next week. A French official said Mr Boutros Ghali's report, which followed several meetings with Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser, would give Council members the impetus to move the sanctions resolution, introduced last Friday. The allies have been vague about when the resolution would be approved, in an apparent effort to give Libya more time to arrange a handover of the suspects. Libyan authorities can prevent the sanctions by arranging the transfer before the Council votes. But the three nations will require a definite date and place for the surrender, which must fall within a two-week time span. In April 1992 the Council imposed an air and arms embargo on Libya and a downgrading of diplomatic ties. Meanwhile, talks between the UN and Iraq on the sale of Iraqi oil worth up to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) have failed, a UN spokesman said yesterday. Security Council officials said Iraq formally told Mr Boutros Ghali it would not resume the talks on limited sales, last held in July, and instead would try to have sanctions lifted completely - a decision which rests with the Council. According to diplomats, the UN chief told the Iraqis he was not sure they would obtain this. One envoy said Baghdad should release foreign prisoners from jail to 'create a climate of confidence'. Mr Boutros Ghali also recommended yesterday a further six-month renewal of the organisation's Iraq-Kuwait observation mission which monitors a demilitarised zone set up between the two countries after the Gulf war. The UN mission comprises about 250 military observers from more than 30 countries and about 115 engineers, logistics and medical personnel. In a written report to the Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali said the mission's area of operations had been calm during the past six months. But he said this 'should not obscure the fact that tensions persist and full peace has yet to be restored to the area'. Boost for oil, Page 32</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 24 Feb (EFE) -- Bolivian Labor Federation  (COB) Executive Secretary Oscar Salas today began a "dry" hunger  strike (without liquids) in response to the government rejection  of a list of petitions presented by the COB 44 days ago.    Salas and several other COB leaders who joined the hunger  strike are trying to promote labor mobilizations which somehow  have lost the workers appeal, thus reflecting the labor  movement's weakness.    The administration of President Sanchez de Lozada rejected  the economic and social petitions of the COB, which demands a  minimum salary of 1,360 bolivianos (about $300 per month)  instead of the current 135 bolivianos ($30) and ratified its  decision to increase salaries by 7.5 percent.    The government reply to the 30-point list of petitions did  not leave the COB any alternative but to resort to pressure with  "massive mobilizations" and the "paralyzation of the productive  class," the union leaders said.    Salas yesterday resigned because of the "irresponsibility"  of  some union leaders who are not participating in the  demonstrations in demand of wage increases organized by the COB.  Salas nonetheless resumed his post a few hours later to conduct  the struggle.    "I do not think that the decision to begin a dry hunger  strike is the most appropriate," said Minister of Government  German Quiroga, who added that "this type of attitude is never  positive and leads to stagnation."</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Neepsend down 40% despite export lift Increased interest charges contributed to a 40 per cent contraction in interim profits at Neepsend, the Sheffield-based tool, metal processing and DIY products group. Although trading profits for the six months to September 30 were static at Pounds 323,000, interest payable of Pounds 221,000 (Pounds 196,000) left the pre-tax line at Pounds 102,000 (Pounds 172,000). There was an exceptional credit last time of Pounds 45,000. Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman, said the recent reductions in interest rates would help the company in the future. Turnover improved marginally to Pounds 7.86m (Pounds 7.71m), bolstered by improved export sales which jumped 62 per cent against the first half of 1991. Home sales, however, dipped 11 per cent. The interim dividend is halved to 0.25p, payable April 3, from earnings of 0.42p (0.66p) per share.</p>

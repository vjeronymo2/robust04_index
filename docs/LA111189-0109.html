			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS HAIL 'MIDNIGHT CALLER' SEQUEL;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE COMMUNITY THAT PROTESTED THE FIRST EPISODE OF AN AIDS DRAMA  COOPERATES WITH PRODUCERS ON THE SECOND.  </P> <P> Almost a year ago, NBC broadcast a controversial "Midnight Caller" episode  about a bisexual man living in San Francisco who knows he is infected with the  AIDS virus but continues to have reckless sexual affairs -- including an  encounter with the former lover of radio talk-show host Jack Killian.  </P> <P> In an early draft of the script, Killian (series star Gary Cole) was to shoot  and kill the promiscuous man, until angry AIDS activists temporarily halted  production of the San Francisco-based show and persuaded producers to make  story revisions. Then, still unhappy with the changes, the protesters  demonstrated at a San Francisco TV station the night it aired.  </P> <P> The debated episode stirred a hornet's nest of publicity and raised larger  questions about the inaccurate depiction of AIDS by the entertainment industry,  a practice the AIDS community contends leads to widespread fear, discrimination  and violence toward gays and people with AIDS.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, TV viewers will see the sequel to that fateful episode, which won  Kay Lenz an Emmy Award for her performance as the woman with AIDS. But in  contrast to the uproar over the first episode, the offices of "Midnight  Caller," which is produced by Lorimar Television, are relatively quiet this  time around. There are no phones ringing off the hook, no demonstrators blowing  whistles on the set and no temporary restraining orders being issued.  </P> <P> More significantly, the same members of the AIDS community who so bitterly  protested "Midnight Caller" last year are singing praises of the show's  producers this year.  </P> <P> Why the turnaround?  </P> <P> "It was a cooperative effort from the get-go," executive producer Bob Singer  said. "We went to the groups who protested us last year and told them we were  planning on doing a sequel and that we wanted their help."  </P> <P> "At first, I was feeling fairly cynical and wasn't expecting a lot," said  Michelle Roland, a member of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP.  She was recalling her early meeting with Singer and writer-producer Stephen  Zito, who wrote both AIDS episodes.  </P> <P> "Stephen walked in saying, 'I know ACT-UP won't be happy with anything we do  because it's a script about AIDS,' " Roland said. "I said, 'Whoa! You need to  understand, we're happy that people do shows about AIDS. We're not irrational  activists causing trouble because we don't have anything to do.' When we see a  specific concern or problem, we respond to it. But given the chance, we'd much  rather engage in constructive dialogue."  </P> <P> Part of the problem last year was that the cast and crew of "Midnight Caller,"  now in its second season, were newcomers to the Bay Area. They were looked upon  as Hollywood intruders trying to exploit a sensitive community issue. So for  this season's episode, the producers funneled their efforts through the San  Francisco AIDS Foundation, which put them in touch with several AIDS  organizations. Zito spent nearly six months researching and writing the sequel.  </P> <P> "It's such amazingly controversial material," Zito said, "and the controversy  sometimes surfaces where you least expect it -- even over language. To give you  the simplest example, you don't want to call people who have the disease  victims of AIDS, because they don't want to be seen as victims. That's an  important distinction. When you start feeling sorry for them, they cease to  become people. They are people with AIDS."  </P> <P> In the new episode, which Zito describes as a simple love story, Lenz returns  in the later stages of the disease. Of the approximate 100,000 people in the  United States who have been diagnosed with AIDS, about 10% are women, according  to the Centers for Disease Control. To learn what it is like to be a woman with  AIDS, Lenz spent numerous sessions with a female support group -- which also  helped Zito with his script.  </P> <P> "At first, I was very emotional," the 36-year-old actress said. "It was so hard  sitting in the room looking at these women who were total strangers to me,  sharing the most intimate details about themselves. As I spent more time with  them, the emotions died down and I got angry. It's such a tragic illness  because of the prejudice attached to it. It's harder to live with AIDS than it  is with cancer because there is no sympathy, only fear. Women's husbands  abandon them. Their family doctors stop seeing them. Some women don't tell  anybody, even their own children."  </P> <P> "I was impressed by the final script," said Catherine Maier, the support  group's facilitator and women's services program coordinator for the San  Francisco AIDS Foundation. "It was compassionate and speaks to the strength of  these women, and how difficult it is to get through each day. It becomes a  career. The women wanted to make sure that their lives were portrayed  accurately and sensitively. They even visited the set, and they were pleased  with what they saw."  </P> <P> Lenz's premature death in the episode, however, was a tough concept for the  AIDS groups to get behind. With new treatments, many people with AIDS are  living longer, eight years or more. There was concern that compacting the life  expectancy of a person diagnosed with AIDS could prove dangerous.  </P> <P> "To the degree that our society believes that people with HIV infection will  die, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Paul Boneberg, executive  director of Mobilization Against AIDS, a political lobby group. "We're involved  in a strategy of hope, telling people that they need not die. They can fight  and seek treatment."  </P> <P> To help explain Lenz's early death, the story focuses on treatment issues and  access to care. The episode illustrates how rapidly an AIDS patient can  deteriorate without proper life-sustaining medication -- which is often  expensive and difficult to obtain.  </P> <P> "People don't realize that this is not the anguished cries of the doomed they  are hearing," Boneberg said. "People with AIDS can't get to the drug treatments  that might save their lives because there's profiteering by pharmaceutical  companies and gross negligence by the health establishment."  </P> <P> Ordinarily, it's against network policy to negotiate with special interest  groups to determine the content of a show. But executive producer Singer said  that NBC gave Lorimar producers its blessing to enlist the assistance of AIDS  groups, partly because the network wanted to avoid the controversy that arose  last season.  </P> <P> "I think the word negotiation is the incorrect word," Singer said. "That word  has a certain charge to it. NBC wanted something that was accurate and that  they could stand behind. The AIDS community was able to supply us with the  information we needed."  </P> <P> Although the episode tried to address each AIDS group's unique concerns, it did  not meet every agenda. Boneberg and Mobilization Against AIDS wanted Lenz's  character to become a political activist. Roland of ACT-UP said the show used  mostly one-liners to sum up complex issues. And Rene Durazzo, media relations  coordinator for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, points out that by zeroing  in on a woman with AIDS, the episode largely neglects the story of the gay  male, who still comprises about 61% of all reported AIDS cases.  </P> <P> "We have to deal within the dramatic context of our show," Zito said. "I can  only write about relationships that I know. That may be bad politics, but it's  good drama."  </P> <P> Aside from minor differences, the overwhelming response from the AIDS community  is positive. The TV producers and AIDS groups involved expressed hope that this  episode of "Midnight Caller" will establish a precedent in future shows  depicting AIDS. And they all emphasized the need for more programming. There  are projections that the total number of AIDS cases reported since 1978 will  double in the next 15 months.  </P> <P> "The story is extremely passionate and understanding in how it deals with the  whole epidemic," Durazzo said. "This is a very positive model, and a process we  hope other producers will look at doing. Our feeling is that it served the  needs of the producers from the standpoint of developing quality, entertaining  programming. And it served the needs of the AIDS community because it produced  an accurate script that can only foster more understanding in the public."  </P></p>

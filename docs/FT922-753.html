			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Maternity pay plan in doubt PROPOSALS to give women throughout the European Community a minimum standard of paid maternity leave face an uncertain future following the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Wednesday. The European parliament had previously voted in favour of women having at least 14 weeks' maternity leave on 80 per cent of their pay - a measure also backed by the European Commission. However, some countries within the Council of Ministers, including the UK, argued the level was too high and a compromise was reached at the end of last year giving a level of pay equivalent to each country's sick pay provision. Italy decided on Wednesday that this position was unacceptable and wants, instead, to adopt the higher payments put forward by the European parliament.</p>

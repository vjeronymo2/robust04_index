			<p>BFN     [Text] The contract for export of 18 Russian MiG-29  fighters to Malaysia is extremely advantageous for Russia, the  Russian president's representative in the Rosvooruzheniye state  concern, Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov told INTERFAX.    "Arms exports are always beneficial, particularly given the  current state of Russia's arms complex and shortages of hard  currency," he said. He also noted that the Russian-Malaysian  contract was the first step towards the introduction of Russian  weapons and other goods in this region.    He denied reports that the MiG fighters had been sold at  dumping prices. "Simply, part of the MiG fighters' cost will be  paid by supplies of Malaysian goods, including palm oil," he  said.    He said that before the Rosvooruzheniye concern established  its absolute control on the arms market, other agencies had  wanted to sign this contract. So all these accusations came  from the people who failed to get the deal, he said.    The latest contract could be followed by other ones with  Southeast Asian and other countries, said Shaposhnikov.    According to unofficial sources, the contract is estimated  at  600 million dollars. Only 20 to 25 percent of the contract will  be paid in palm oil supplies.</p>

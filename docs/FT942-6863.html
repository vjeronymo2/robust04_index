			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar woes continue The dollar was stable on foreign exchanges yesterday, but showed no signs of rallying from recent lows, writes Philip Gawith. Dealers said persistent bearish sentiment was depressing the dollar, while preparations for the long weekend made investors wary of taking positions. The Bank of Japan was seen supporting the US currency during Asian trading. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6438 from DM1.6447. Against the yen it was slightly weaker at Y104.405 from Y104.455. The Bank of England was reported to have intervened in the market to support the Canadian dollar. The North American currency closed in London at CDollars 1.3862 against the dollar from CDollars 1.3818 on Wednesday. In Europe the drachma and the escudo remained under pressure. The Bundesbank left official interest rates unchanged at its council meeting. Sterling had a quiet day, with the sterling index closing at 79.9 from the previous close of 80. The pound closed at DM2.4821 from DM2.4848, and was barely changed at Dollars 1.51. Looking at the dollar's lacklustre performance, Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said neither growth nor interest rate arguments seemed to offer much support to the currency. 'The only thing preventing the dollar from falling further is the threat of central bank intervention,' said Mr Geddes. He predicted, though, that central bank intervention would only be seen when the market was considered to be short of dollars - not the situation at present. Mr Geddes argued that support for the dollar can only come from concrete trade and market-access proposals from the Japanese government that are acceptable to the US authorities. These would probably be timed to coincide with the G7 summit in Naples in early July. This assumes - a big if - that prime minister Mr Tsutomu Hata will have the requisite authority to deliver substantive change. Dealers said the Bank of Canada had been seen buying Canadian dollars through the broker market. Last week the BOC was seen selling Canadian dollars. Some analysts attributed the currency's weakness to political uncertainty ahead of elections in Quebec and overnight rumours that Canadian debt might be downgraded. Although the BOC is known for its active involvement in the market to smooth the dollar, it was also suggested that being seen to sell its own currency last week had backfired on the central bank. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, disputed this assessment saying: 'By dealing on both sides of the movement, they have shown themselves to be extremely professional.' He described the Bank's intervention as 'well judged, well timed and well conceived.' Mr Parsons predicted that the dollar would probably be volatile in the run-up to the Quebec elections, expected in September. He noted that there had been similar currency volatility ahead of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional accords, in June 1990 and October 1992. In Greece, the prime minister Mr Andreas Papandreou declared victory in the government's defence of the currency. He said: 'The battle for the drachma is continuing and is critical, but it has been won ..I think that essentially the drachma issue is closed.' He said the issue of high interest rates, necessary in recent weeks to support the currency, would be over 'within a few days, or a week or two at most.' Key interbank rates are in three digits, and banks have started to raise rates to customers. The prime minister's optimism was not shared in the markets where traders reported seeing a lot of private individuals trying to get their money out of Greece. Talk of a 15-20 per cent devaluation, in the air at the end of last week, has resurfaced. Dealers said the drachma's woes were spilling over into the escudo. The Portuguese currency closed at Es104.1 against the D-Mark from Es103.5 on Wednesday. In fact, the escudo had been under fire in March and early April, before the drachma. Some analysts said that the weakness of the escudo, drachma and Italian lira  -which closed at L970.6 against the D-Mark from L969 - was the result of investors fleeing the high-yielding Southern European countries for the safety of the D-Mark. The futures market had a calmer day after the recent bout of frenetic trading. The December euromark contract traded 36,000 lots and closed at 94.79, two basis points up on Wednesday. The December eurosterling contract traded nearly 18,000 lots to finish at 93.83 from 93.80. In the German money markets, call money eased to 5.15/5.25 per cent from 5.25/5.35 per cent. The Bank of England, meanwhile, cleared a Pounds 800m shortage in the UK money markets with relative ease. Overnight money traded between 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 per cent.</p>

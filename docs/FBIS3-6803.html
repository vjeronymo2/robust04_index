For North Korea to make such a strong remark proves  that it does not have confidence at home nor abroad.    [Yi So-hang] Such a remark by North Korea is intended to  create confusion domestically by threatening South Korea by  saying that "it will be ready for war." Another aspect is that  North Korea achieved some results on several occasions through  this "threatening policy," since it announced that it will  withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March 1993.    [Kim] If North Korea receives inspection from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and realizes the  exchange of special envoys even for the sake of formality, the  road to improve relations will be opened for the possibility of  holding the third round of talks with the United States.  Nevertheless, North Korea rejected such measures. I believe  that this is because North Korea has not yet provided itself  with a blueprint on opening up. The way to dissolve difficult  problems, such as an economic crisis and international  isolation, is through "partial openness" by improving relations  with the United States. [passage omitted]    [Yi] North Korea's strong strategy is an attempt to make its  nuclear development a fait accompli. North Korea is aware of  the strategy carried out by India and Pakistan. Threatening  that "Seoul will become a sea of fire," is intended to  indirectly reveal that: "We have annihilating weapons."    [Kim] The remark by the North Korean delegate, in a  nutshell, is intended to discontinue dialogue with South Korea.  As everybody knows, the reason North Korea is saying that it  will improve relations with the United States is to introduce  capital and technology from Western countries, including the  United States, thus providing a breakthrough for its aggravated  economy. [passage omitted]    [Yi] The remark by the North Korean delegate can be regarded  as part of a Brinkmanship, which North Korea has been promoting  during the past few years. [passage omitted]    [Kim] In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, I  believe that a thorough analysis is necessary of how related  countries, such as the United States and China, regard their  national interest. [passage omitted]    [Yi] The current government's strategy while dealing with  the North Korean nuclear issue is the appropriate use of the  "carrot" and "stick." Of course there were some results in  using this strategy. However, there were also times when we  emphasized the "carrot" when the "stick" was necessary. That  is, there were times when we took too much consideration in  holding dialogue. For example, when the United States tried to  take strong measures, we put the brakes on the United States by  sticking too much to the fact that "confusion must be  prevented." However, we cannot say that our "North Korean  nuclear diplomacy" has failed. [passage omitted]    [Kim] If the IAEA refers the North Korean nuclear issue  to the UN Security Council after convening a Board of Governors  meeting, the situation will move toward sanctions against North  Korea. Then, the issue of economic sanctions will be discussed  first. However, even though economic sanctions are taken, it  will take about two to three months before it is put into  practice. Therefore, how North Korea will react during this  period is drawing attention. I believe North Korea will take  strong measures until "right before the deadline for applying  sanctions" and then, when it becomes clear that sanctions will  be applied, I believe North Korea will retreat.    [Yi] If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN  Security Council, China's attitude will be a variable. I  believe that ultimately it will be inevitable for China to take  part in the sanctions. [passage omitted]    [Kim] I am of a different opinion. I believe that it will  be awkward for China to take part in the sanctions when  considering North Korea's role as a buffer zone of China and the  fact that China and North Korea are the few remaining communist  countries in the world. However, I think that China will  persuade North Korea so that the situation will not move toward  taking sanctions. Ultimately, it is expected that right before  the sanctions take effect, North Korea will retreat.    What is an important point in future policy on North Korea  is  to develop the passive ROK-U.S. cooperative system into a more  active and voluntary system. I believe for ROK and the United  States to share roles in dealing with North Korea will be one of  the ways to establish an active cooperative system. For  example, the United States should deal only with North Korea's  nuclear issue and let the ROK deal with the issue of economic  assistance to North Korea. Also, the United States should  clearly inform North Korea of this. Then it will be difficult  for North Korea to continue to reject South-North dialogue.    [Yi] When the stick is definitely prepared, will the  effectiveness of the carrot be enhanced? We must not completely  eliminate the carrot, but now is the time to prepare the stick.  Nevertheless, I believe that we do not need to fundamentally  regulate our existing policy on North Korea. Our basic task is  to realize the South-North basic agreement.    [Kim] Completely suspending the South-North dialogue at the  current stage will result in being entangled in North Korea's  strategy. North Korea may be stimulating the South side aimed  at such a measure. It may be intended to hold dialogue with the  United States after rupturing South-North dialogue.    Up until now, in North Korean relations, we established the  nuclear issue as the main variable and economic cooperation as  the subordinate variable. However, I think that it would be  good if we switched positions. We must make the issue of  economic cooperation a more certain weapon.    To achieve this, as I said before, the ROK-U.S. cooperative  system must be further strengthened. Along with this, we must  clearly show the attitude of "superiority in strength in  negotiations [himui uwi son hyopsang]." [passage omitted]    [Yi] North Korea regards economic cooperation with the South  side as a "poisonous carrot," which is recognized as a problem.  As long as North Korea does not change such a thought, it seems  that economic cooperation will be difficult, whatever attitude  we take. If we are to change North Korea's attitude, we must all  the more resolutely establish our negotiating strategy, and  moreover, we must concentrate on uniting opinions domestically  and the people must take vigilance. North Korea's violent  remark, which is like a "declaration of war," at the meeting  place can be a good incentive in awakening the people's  vigilance.</p>

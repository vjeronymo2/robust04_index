			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Another Attempt on a Deputy's Life?"] </F>   [Text] The shooting which occurred on the night of 30  April-1 May involving independent State Duma Deputy Sergey  Skorochkin claimed two victims. Duma Security Committee  Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin informed deputies of this during  yesterday's plenary session of the Federal Assembly's lower  house.    He noted that the reason for the shooting was a conflict  between Skorochkin and a group of people who, according to the  deputy, "did not let the parliamentarian's automobile pass in  the direction of his home" in the city of Zaraysk, Moscow  Oblast. Skorochkin reported that after the conflict had been  resolved one of those who had not allowed the deputy's car  through -- Tbilisi inhabitant Irakliy Shanidze -- started to  take an assault rifle out of his car. But the deputy managed to  snatch the weapon, after which he headed for the local internal  affairs administration to report the incident. However,  according to Skorochkin his passage on the way to the internal  affairs administration was again blocked by Shanidze, who was  carrying another assault rifle. At this time local inhabitant  Oksana Guseva was nearby. Shanidze shot at the deputy, who  managed to get out of the way. But Guseva was killed. In turn  Skorochkin shot and killed Shanidze.    At present, Ilyukhin stressed, the Russian Federation  General  Prosecutor's Office is considering whether Skorochkin acted  within the bounds of necessary self-defense.</p>

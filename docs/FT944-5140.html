			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Finland steps up the pace - European privatisations News late last week that Finnair, the Finnish national airline, plans to raise about FM500m (Dollars 103.3m) through an offer of up to 12m new shares to domestic and international investors has highlighted the attitude of the Finnish government to privatisation. There are a total of 12 groups on the privatisation list, including Finnair. Others are Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group; forestry concern Enso-Gutzeit and Imatran Voima, the power company. The government will not participate in the Finnair issue, which is being co-ordinated by Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, so its stake will be cut from about 70 to 60 per cent. This is typical of the approach the government has taken to the sale of state-owned assets. While other European governments have used privatisation proceeds to bolster state coffers, so far most of the proceeds of Finnish privatisation have gone directly to the companies themselves. This is because heavy debt loads and Finland's deep recession between 1991 and 1993 left the companies with weak balance sheets. Allowing proceeds of privatisation to go to the companies concerned has meant they enter the private sector with strong balance sheets. 'These Finnish companies are now in a very good position,' said Mr Anders Bergendahl, Merrill Lynch relationship manager for Scandinavia. The attraction of Finland for the international investor has been increased by liberalisation of capital markets. Finland has relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership. The Finnish equity market is the most cyclical in Europe, largely due to the predominance of paper, chemicals, metals and capital goods sectors. Some analysts are recommending investors to be overweight in cyclical sectors. Research by Mr Mike Young at Merrill Lynch points out: 'Finnish equities have consistently outperformed during economic recoveries.' He adds: 'Our valuation models suggest the market is anywhere from being the most overvalued to the most undervalued in Europe. Our interpretation is that it is among the most undervalued.' The Finnish government has taken a step-by-step approach to privatisation, gradually reducing its ownership in a number of companies and only moving cautiously below the 50 per cent threshold. The pace of activity has increased in the past 12 months, with a total of FM7.4bn being raised from the sale of holdings in five companies - Outokumpu, the mining and metals group; Rautaruukki, the steel producer; Valmet, the paper machinery manufacturer; Veitsiluoto, the pulp and paper concern; and Kemira, the chemicals group. The most recent move was the initial public offering made by Kemira, which raised FM1.14bn and lowered the state's stake in the company to 75 per cent. The government has parliamentary authorisation to lower its stake further in all five companies. The next company on the list is almost certain to be Neste. Some estimates suggest the company is worth FM10bn, which would make it the biggest privatisation so far. International bankers believe arrangements for the Neste sale are well under way, and expect it to come to market early in the new year. Morgan Stanley is the ministry's adviser and Goldman Sachs is the company's adviser. Bankers believe the government wants to push through a partial privatisation of the company early next year before the March general elections. One reason for the haste is that the elections look likely to return the Social Democrats to power. They have been less enthusiastic about privatisation than the centre-right administration and could try to slow the process, particularly where strategic companies are concerned, such as telecommunications and power groups.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / BR aims for extra routes in strike British Rail said yesterday it hoped to operate more routes during the signalling strike that runs from noon today until noon on Thursday than it has during previous strikes. The routes will include the commercially important London Victoria to Gatwick Airport route as well as London Liverpool Street to Cambridge and Shenfield in Essex. A quarter of services are expected to operate - the same proportion as on 24-hour strike days during the past six weeks. But this week's action will disrupt three days of services for the first time. BR said: 'Some lines will be running virtually normally but others, particularly in Scotland, will be closed for three days. On some routes that are open, there will be no early-morning or late-evening service.' It added that there would be a reduced weekday timetable in most areas this morning and advised passengers to check that they could complete their journey as many services would stop running after midday. In Scotland a special timetable will operate in some areas but many routes will be closed. Thameslink services will not run south of London today. All day tomorrow and Thursday morning, special services will operate in many areas but other routes will remain closed. On Thursday afternoon services will restart in all areas except Scotland. All routes will be open by late that afternoon except the Midland main line from London to Sheffield and Thameslink to Brighton. A number of London commuter services will be operating for the first time since the dispute began seven weeks ago. These are Charing Cross to Orpington and London Bridge to Hayes in south-east London. An hourly service will run from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, first stop Ipswich. Trains will be operating from Moorgate to St Albans and Bedford and from King's Cross to Peterborough and Royston. Services will also run from Waterloo to Woking, Epsom, Chessington, Basingstoke and Salisbury. A substantial number of services will be operating in the Thames Valley from Paddington. Trains will also be running from Paddington to Bristol, Plymouth, Cardiff, Swansea and Cheltenham. There will also be trains from St Pancras to Derby and Nottingham as well as from London Euston to Coventry and Birmingham. Services will be running from Manchester to Stockport as well as from Inverness to the Wick and Kyle of Lochalsh. The Manchester to Edinburgh route will be open as will Doncaster and York to Edinburgh. Trains will be running from Preston to Glasgow, and a number of commuter services will be operating from Manchester to Bolton, Preston, Lancaster, Windermere and Llandudno.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> NASTY BOYS: Watch for another escalation in the explicit-lyric wars this week  after Warner Records (through its Reprise/Cold Chillin' subsidiaries) releases  a new rap collection, "2 Nasty for Radio," which features a host of raunchy  songs -- all conveniently compiled in one package. The album offers such  X-rated items as Roxanne Shante's "Brothers Ain't (Expletive)," Ice-T's "Ladies  LGBNAF" (don't even think about having us spell that out), and Big Daddy Kane's  "Pimpin' Ain't Easy."  </P> <P> (Priority Records has just released a similar package, "Explicit Rap," which  offers nasty-rap from the likes of 2 Live Crew, Geto Boys, Too Short and  N.W.A.) Warner sees its collection as a clever marketing vehicle. But anti-rap  crusader Jack Thompson sees it as a provocation. "This is a purposeful effort  by some corporate wise guys to put all this crap on one album and see what  happens," he says. "What they're saying is, 'We dare you to do something.' And  I think someone's going to take them up on it."  </P></p>

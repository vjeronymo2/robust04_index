			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: TV South West Television South West is close to recommending a reverse takeover to shareholders as the best course to follow after it loses its independent television contract in the new year. In a letter to shareholders Sir Brian Bailey, chairman, said that the alternative would be winding up and a distribution of surplus assets. 'We have been in discussion with a third party regarding a reverse takeover and your board is of the view that this would be the preferred alternative assuming satisfactory terms can be reached.' He added that it was unlikely that any arrangement would be agreed before the announcement of the figures for 1992.</p>

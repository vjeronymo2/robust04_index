			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Z. Fedotova report over video, including </F> interview with Ye.N. Belyayev, chairman of the State Committee  for Sanitation and Epidemiological Supervision (Sanepidnadzor);  from the "Utro" program -- place and date not given; recorded]    [Text] Fedotova: Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, even  last year the number of cases of diphtheria infection increased  to such an extent in the country that medical officials  repeatedly said that an epidemic is at hand. Is this true?    Belyayev: Yes, it is. In fact, as of today we  have registered more than 15,000 cases of diphtheria -- 4,500 of  them are children, and 388 people have already died, including  79 children. So we must talk about the threat of an epidemic.  [video cuts to show hospital, children being immunized]    Fedotova: Yevgeniy Belyayev considers that  science has provided a reliable substance to combat diphtheria.  The disease can be reduced to just a few odd cases while the  threat of an epidemic can be completely eliminated if 95 percent  of children and 80 percent of the entire population of the  country undergo a proper series of vaccinations.    However, only about 72.6 percent of children are being  vaccinated during their first year, and 81.9 percent by the age  of three. What is the reason for these low figures? Yevgeniy  Belyayev thinks there are several. Here are some of them: An  unjustifiably broad spectrum of conditions counterposing medical  evidence in the country's present treatment facilities. In fact  there are eight of them. In the United States there are only  two -- a high fever or some immune deficiency. These are the  only grounds excusing American children from compulsory  inoculation. Another problem is that the annual schedules for  vaccinations of the population have been altered four times in  the past 12 years and this has given rise to shortcomings in the  organization and implementation of the vaccination campaign.  [video again shows Fedotova talking to Belyayev]    And what about those strange parents who prevent their  children from being vaccinated for various reasons. It seems  that this is the way people are -- they wait until it is too  late. As a matter of fact, Yevgeniy Belyayev unequivocally  challenged one of the claims made by recalcitrant parents that  domestic vaccines are of poor quality. He said our preparations  correspond to the requirements of world standards; they have  been tested and recognized and will help stop the epidemic.    Belyayev: Together with scientists and officials  of the Ministry of Health and other interested departments we  developed a federal program of preventive vaccinations last  year. It was approved by the government and it envisages  considerable allocations of funds. We adopted a decision to  inoculate the entire population during 1994-95. The state  recognizes its responsibility to defend you from diphtheria.  You too should accept the responsibility for immunizing your  children. Have them vaccinated this year. This will prevent  you from getting ill. Without detailed, conscientious,  precise, and well-organized work in every polyclinic, every  school, and every adult outpatients clinic we will not solve the  problem. All children's immunization charts and health records  need to be checked.    I would also like to appeal to the producers. We have two  enterprises turning out the vaccines. Do everything to ensure  that we have a sufficient quantity of vaccine this year. You  can do this. I must also appeal to workers of the State  Sanitation and Epidemiological Service. Do not limit yourselves  to helping in organizing this work. To help is your sacred  task. But you, epidemiological physicians, have been invested  with extensive rights. You must perform the function of  supervision. You must demand maximum compliance.    Fedotova: Another thought was expressed during  our conversation.    Belyayev: Recently our service has adopted a  strict policy of strengthening supervisory functions and many  are unhappy about this. They do not like it. Attempts are again  being made to make our service subservient to some other  department, and to belittle its role in society. However this  process is irreversible everywhere in the world. It is a state  service, and that is how it ought to be. Efforts to make it part  of some department are an attempt to curry favor with the shadow  economy and shady people engaged in small business, and I think  that in this case we should take a firm stand.</p>

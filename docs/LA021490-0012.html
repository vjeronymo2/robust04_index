			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES MONEY FOR ADDED STAFF AND FIGHT AGAINST UTILITY MERGER  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council gave tentative approval Tuesday to spending about $4  million to increase its staff, remodel its City Hall offices and continue the  city's legal fight against the merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and  SoCal Edison.  </P> <P> The council members took action after City Manager John Lockwood advised them  that $3.5 million in expenses for acquiring land to build two new police  substations could be deferred until the 1991 fiscal year, and that an  additional $500,000 is still available from the city's unallocated reserve  fund.  </P> <P> His recommendations helped the council escape making the politically difficult  decision of choosing between upgrading their staffs and City Hall offices or  cutting either the police substations or the legal costs related to opposing  the utility merger.  </P> <P> However, the council voted not to hire a $75,000 consultant to help it redraw  boundaries of council districts.  </P> <P> The bulk of the $4 million will go to pay upcoming legal costs. About $2  million will be placed in the city's general litigation fund to cover future  lawsuits, and another $1.5 million will go for legal fees in the city's fight  against the proposed utility merger.  </P> <P> Asbestos removal at city-owned buildings will cost about $137,000, and $100,000  will be used to pay for growth-management consultants.  </P> <P> The rest, or about $331,500, will be used to remodel the council chambers and  council suites, and to hire seven new staff aides for six council members.  </P> <P> Before voting, however, the council was chastised by John McClain, a council  aide in the 1970s, who said the current City Council is spending too much money  on itself and not enough on other city needs.  </P> <P> "None of you need additional staff," he said, noting that in 1970, just one  council assistant served the entire City Council. "If anything, you are  overstaffed."  </P> <P> City Council members now have four to six staff assistants each, and McClain  contended that increasing those numbers reflects "bankrupt leadership."  </P> <P> "Let me be blunt," he said. "You are engaged in empire building, pure and  simple."  </P> <P> But several council members defended the move to increased the staff, pointing  out that the city's population and the city budget have grown dramatically in  the last 20 years.  </P> <P> "Today, I don't think one person can possibly answer the phone in my office,"  said Councilman Bruce Henderson. "It's ringing constantly because constituents  demand service. There's a tremendous amount of work to be done, and we've got  to have the staff to do it."  </P> <P> Added Councilman Wes Pratt: "I don't apologize for the staff assistance I'm  requesting. We need information. We need quality research. I need adequate  preparation."  </P> <P> In giving the temporary nod for the other projects, the council directed  Lockwood to draft an ordinance by Feb. 20 incorporating the spending package.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320) and XINHUA </F> reporter Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- Luo Gan, State Councillor  and deputy secretary of the Commission on Politics and Law under  the CPC Central Committee, pointed out today at the national  conference of the heads of justice departments (bureaus) the  need to give full play to the functions and role of judicial and  administrative work, to vigorously enhance the  reform-through-labor and education- through-labor work, and to  strive to create an excellent social environment for a stable  social order and for reducing contradictions among the people.    Luo Gan pointed out that judicial and administrative work  constitutes an important part of the building of a legal system,  which assumes a heavy task of legal guarantees and legal  services in developing a socialist market economy. The more the  reform is carried out in depth and the more the economy  develops, the more we need an enduring and stable social  environment and the environment of a sound legal system, and the  more we need to greatly strengthen the work of legal guarantees  and legal services.    Luo Gan particularly stressed that since the implementation  of the policy of reform and opening, the work of  reform-through-labor and of education-through-labor has made new  progress and achieved marked results although it has also met  with some new conditions and new problems. To increase the  quality of labor-through-reform and education-through-reform  organs for reforming criminals and personnel undergoing  education-through-labor, to prevent and reduce crime, and to  ensure the enduring stability of the state, it is necessary to  step up supervision over the reform work of reform-  through-labor and to gradually establish modern and civilized  prisons and a system for education-through-labor.    Since last year, various levels of judicial and  administrative organs have stepped up the pace of reforming the  work of legal services and have voluntarily and actively  provided services regarding economic work. Particularly worth  noting is the new progress made in reforming the lawyer system.  Last year the nation saw the establishment of 824 new law  offices, of which 199 were law offices established without the  state's financing. The total number of law offices in the  nation has reached 4,900. With the increase of 20,000 new  lawyers, the total number of lawyers has reached nearly 70,000.  The number of cases in which lawyers were asked to serve as  legal advisers for government organs, institutions, business  units, social organizations, and citizens, and cases in which  lawyers were asked to serve as the criminal defense lawyer and  in civil and business suits has increased by more than 10  percent compared to the previous year.    In his speech, Justice Minister Xiao Yang called on all  levels of judicial and administrative organs to accelerate the  pace of reform in the new year; to do a good job in building  modern and civilized prisons and institutions of  reform-through-labor; to continue deepening reform in the  various aspects of judicial and administrative work; to do even  better work in legal guarantees and legal services; and to  promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy.    Xiao Yang pointed out that prison is not only an organ for  punishing criminals but also an organ for reforming criminals.  He added that prison is also a special school for educating  criminals. The purpose of reform-through-labor and of  education-through-reform is not only to reform criminals and  personnel undergoing education- through-labor into independent  laborers who work honestly and who abide by the law, but also to  reform them into capable persons who are adapted to the  development of a socialist market economy. To that end, it is  necessary to gradually establish a socialist prison and  reform-through-labor system with Chinese characteristics. He  said that the goal of reform-through-labor and of  education-through- labor for some time in the future is to build  prisons and reform- through-labor institutions into modern and  civilized prisons and reform-through-labor institutions in a  steadfast and within-our- means manner.    Xiao Yang also called for enhancing work to resettle,  assist,  and teach those personnel who have been released from prison  after serving their sentences and those personnel who have been  released from reform-through-labor institutions. He pointed out  that doing a good job in this area will have the important  effect of reducing recidivism, of maintaining social stability,  and of safeguarding the development of a socialist market  economy.</p>

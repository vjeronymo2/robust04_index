			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The nomination for essential uses in 1996, 1997 and 1998 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride in analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and laboratory applications is being recommended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology and Economic Assessment Panel for a global exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will not specify the quantity granted to each Party. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TEAP describes the many analytical and laboratory procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which small quantities of controlled substances are now used and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which applications were received, such as: equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration; extraction solvents, diluents, or carriers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific chemical analyses; inducing chemical-specific health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects for biochemical research; and other critical purposes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research and development where substitutes are not readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available or where standards set by national and international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies require specific use of a controlled substance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TEAP recommendation for a global exemption pertains only to 1996,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1997 and 1998 and refers to the manufacture of CFCs, methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloroform and carbon tetrachloride of very high purities to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaged in small containers. Additional detailed information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the purity of the substances and the size of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers being recommended by the TEAP is contained in Appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G to subpart A. In anticipation of the Parties adopting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that a specific quantity of essential-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances for laboratory and analytical use not be designated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In anticipation of a Decision by the Parties at the October  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 meeting that does not specify the quantity of essential use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances permitted for analytical and laboratory application,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but a global essential-use exemption, EPA is proposing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers or importers of the controlled substance require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories certify they are purchasing the designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential-use controlled substances only for laboratory or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical uses, and that the substance will not be resold (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recordkeeping and Reporting in Section C.7.b.). Unlike the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system for the allocation of essential-use allowances for metered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose inhalers and space shuttle solvents, there will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific recipients of analytical/laboratory essential-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances. A person who claims the essential need for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical or laboratory application of a substance that has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phased out will be permitted to purchase the requested quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as long as a certificate is provided to the importer or producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the substance. The certificates will allow EPA to monitor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of phased-out controlled substances that are used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical or laboratory applications domestically. EPA reserves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the right to amend these procedures in the future based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information collected through the certificates and changes made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of the allowances for specific essential uses,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that the recipient of essential-use allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confer to a producer or importer the right to produce or import a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific quantity of the specific controlled substance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company conferring the essential-use allowances must, as in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of laboratories, certify to the producer or importer that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the controlled substance will only be used for the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential use. The producer or importer will report to EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarterly the quantity produced for essential uses, submitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certification from the holder of the essential-use allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the specific nominations of specific substances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific uses, EPA is proposing that inter-pollutant transfers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential-use allowances not be permitted. The application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process described above in which U.S. companies petitioned the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties to the Protocol through EPA for an essential-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption for a specific quantity of a specific substance for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given year indicated that the substance is essential for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific application because no practicable alternative chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists. EPA reviewed these applications and made recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the TEAP, which in turn reviewed the claims that the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance is essential for the application and recommended an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption be given in those cases where experts felt no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute exists. For the same reason, EPA proposes that inter-company transfers of essential-use allowances not be permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because allowances will be allocated based on a company's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application to the Parties through EPA for a specific quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a controlled substance for a specific use. As a result, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also proposing that inter-Party trades not be permitted since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these would be trades between companies internationally and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations being recommended by the TEAP to the Parties for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1994 meeting are country-specific.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> B.

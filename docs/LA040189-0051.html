			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HELICOPTER GROUNDED AFTER BACK-YARD LANDINGS  </P> <P> There are places where helicopter landings are allowed, but Northridge yards  are not among them.  </P> <P> Ezra Raiten, 37, a developer, was cited by the Los Angeles Fire Department on  Friday for landing a helicopter in his back yard without a city permit.  Neighbors complained to police about four takeoffs and landings Friday  afternoon and at least one incident Thursday and another Sunday, Fire Capt.  James Gaffney said.  </P> <P> Fire officials grounded the jet-powered, single-engine Aerospatiale AS-350  helicopter and ordered Raiten to remove it by trailer, Gaffney said. The  French-made aircraft is registered to Raiten Development Corp., he said.  </P> <P> Raiten's purpose in flying the chopper into the quiet residential neighborhood  was not known, Gaffney said.  </P> <P> Raiten had an attorney with him when fire officials questioned him, "and there  wasn't much conversation," Gaffney said.  </P> <P> Fire officials on Monday will notify the Federal Aviation Administration, which  licenses and polices pilots, of the incident.  </P> <P> The likelihood of the city issuing Raiten a permit to use his back yard as a  helicopter pad is nil, Gaffney said.  </P> <P> "There's no way we would allow that," he said. "There's just no way. You just  can't do it."  </P> <P> Aside from the safety and noise concerns associated with landing near homes,  the Raiten property is about 200 yards from Balboa Boulevard Elementary School,  he said. Several people who called to complain about the helicopter were  worried about the safety of children in the area, he said.  </P> <P> Richard Johnson, 14, who lives just north of Raiten's property in the 17000  block of Lassen Street, said the helicopter's passing overhead was "loud enough  to jitter things around" in his back yard. But he said it didn't bother him.  </P> <P> Raiten declined to comment.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead BSkyB, a joint venture with (among others) Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is likely to brighten News International's interim results on Thursday. In December, the satellite company set a monthly record by adding 140,000 new subscribers, bringing the total to about 3.3m. Terry Povey, of Bell Securities, is predicting an Pounds 80m contribution this year to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns 82 per cent of News International, and one of Pounds 140m in 1995. The price-cutting war in the UK - while boosting sales of The Sun and The Times - is likely to cost about Pounds 43.3m in the 1994 financial year. BAA, the airports' operator, is to report quarterly results for the first time. On Tuesday, it is to release figures for the first nine months of the year to March 30. Analysts are shy of forecasting for the third quarter but anticipate that full-year profits will fall between Pounds 312m and Pounds 325m. Again, the main engine of growth is expected to be the retailing side although improved productivity and cost-cutting throughout the group will have their impact. Flat earnings' growth is being forecast for Fyffes, the UK and Irish fresh fruit distributor, which is due to reveal results for the year to October 31 on Wednesday. Stockbrokers in Dublin anticipate pre-tax profits of between IPounds 29.5m and IPounds 30.5m, up from IPounds 28.5m in 1992. This would be the equivalent to earnings per share of 5.9p to 6p (5.9p). Softness in banana prices and falling interest rates  - the latter affecting income from the company's IPounds 95m cash hoard - are viewed as the main factors holding back growth. Numbers are expected to be of little importance at ML Laboratories, which announces its final results on Monday. Of far more interest will be ML's distribution plans for the renal dialysis drug which last year won its UK marketing licence. Investors are also likely to focus on just how much cash there is in the bank at the bio-tech company, which has not made a profit since its float in 1987.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commercial Union set to choose new headquarters COMMERCIAL UNION, the insurance company whose London headquarters were badly damaged 10 days ago by an IRA bomb which killed three people, expects to move into the Cutlers Exchange building which has been empty since it was finished nearly a year ago. CU is expected to sign a two-year lease for 46,000 sq ft of the 67,000 sq ft building in Cutlers Street in the City 'within the next few working days'. The rent CU is likely to pay, close to the asking price of Pounds 27.50 a sq ft, reflects a near-halving of City rental prices over the past three years. Greycoat, the building's developer, said the lease was in solicitors' hands and it hoped to complete the deal by the weekend. Some 450 of the 650 staff displaced from the CU tower, who have been working in branch offices in Croydon and other properties in London, are expected to move to the new premises by the end of next month. Mr Richard Owen, one of the CU executives supervising the company's response to the bomb, said CU would be unable to return for over a year to its head offices on 10 floors of the CU tower.

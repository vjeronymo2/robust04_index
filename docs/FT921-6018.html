			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bad buys in the transfer market - Think hard before opting out of occupational pension schemes THERE IS growing concern about employees who are persuaded to transfer valuable pension rights from good occupational schemes into personal pensions. The Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) reports an increasing number of cases in which inexperienced or unscrupulous insurance salesmen are arranging transfers that are detrimental to the client's interests and serve only to line the salesmen's pockets. Such transfers are complex transactions and require professional assistance. Lautro lays down strict guidelines on what personal information must be included in a salesman's 'fact-find' about the prospective client. These guidelines have not always been followed, Lautro says. It adds: 'Sometimes, it is because the representatives have not been trained regarding how and why they should undertake such an analysis. Sometimes, they have been adequately trained but nonetheless chose to ignore the requirement.' This problem is compounded by the failure of insurance companies adequately to monitor the fact-finds which are submitted by salesmen before the sale is completed. Lautro says companies should identify and intercept inadequate fact-finds but, in some cases, are not doing this. These cases represent the tip of the iceberg, Lautro says, because most individuals do not understand the implications of transferring out of occupational schemes into personal pensions and do not report the problem. 'Cases of this type inevitably cause the complainants considerable anxiety, together with anger that someone should appear to gamble with one of the most important areas of their financial arrangements. 'Even so, in view of the limited understanding of the complex subject of pensions among members of the public, the level of complaints received on this score may well understate the scale of the potential problem,' Lautro says. Personal pensions, introduced in July 1988, were never intended to be used as an alternative to good occupational schemes. Rather, they were designed to give a greater choice to individuals whose employer does not run a group scheme and who had to belong automatically to the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). Even in these limited instances, there is evidence of mis-selling on a vast scale. A recent report from the Equal Opportunities Commission identified 250,000 women who were sold personal pensions when they would have been better off in Serps. In the 1988-89 tax year, the Department of Social Security said 63,000 women who were sold personal pensions had no earnings during this period and, therefore, did not qualify for any pension at all. Transfers from occupational schemes to personal pensions is the fastest-growing market for many insurance companies. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) reported a 35 per cent increase in single premium business for 1991. A large proportion of this business, which was worth almost Pounds 4.2bn, will have come from transfers, with most cases running into tens of thousands of pounds. Salesmen receive at least 4 per cent commission on these transactions - often more - while the insurance company itself will deduct charges for administration and insurance management. In most cases, transfers take place after a change of job. Employees who were members of the former employer's scheme for more than two years cannot take a cash refund on contributions. Instead, they can leave the benefits with the former scheme and draw a pension on retirement. This is known as a 'preserved' or 'deferred' pension. Employees have two other options. The first is for the benefits to be transferred to the new employer's scheme. The second is for the preserved pension to be converted into a 'transfer value,' which can then be invested in a personal pension or in a similar insurance product known as a buy-out bond. Employees in the public sector get the best deal on transfers because all pension benefits are index-linked, even on preservation. The public sector also operates the 'transfer club,' which allows employees to change jobs within the system and receive like-for-like benefits in the new scheme. Outside the public sector, preserved pensions and pension transfers may be more a question of damage limitation than real improvement. Most people lose out simply because, once an employee leaves a scheme, the value of the pension is no longer linked to real earnings' growth; instead, annual increases are capped at 5 per cent. This is known as limited price indexation (LPI). If a previous employer provides increases in excess of this, as well as good dependants' benefits for spouses and children, the preserved pension is likely to be the employee's best option. In other cases, a transfer to the new employer's scheme could be the right choice if more generous benefits are offered. Normally, one of these two options is likely to offer a safer alternative than a move to a personal pension. The problem with transferring to a personal pension is that it is difficult to compare like with like. Most good occupational schemes in the UK operate on a final-salary basis, so that each year of service builds up to provide a maximum pension at retirement of two-thirds of final salary (subject to certain limits for high earners). Personal pensions are money purchase plans, which means that the value of the pension at retirement will depend on the investment returns of the chosen fund. There are no guarantees. Martin Slack, a partner with actuaries Lane Clark &amp; Peacock, says: 'There are two stages in any transfer question. First, it is important to assess whether it is worth moving the preserved pension. If so, it is vital to get professional advice to get a meaningful comparison between the options. 'Many advisers and salesmen simply don't bother to ask the first question at all. Nor do they fully understand the nature of the preserved benefits that are being given up when the transfer is taken.' It is not just job-changers who are being persuaded to put occupational pension benefits into personal pensions, though. Lautro quotes a case where several salesmen from the same branch of an insurance company transferred a number of employees systematically out of a particularly attractive group scheme and into personal pensions. Unless there is a serious problem with an occupational pension scheme, it is rarely good practice to transfer to a personal pension. The loss of that vital link of the pension to final salary is most unlikely to be replaced by a money purchase plan. Furthermore, most employers do not contribute to personal pensions if they operate a good group scheme. Lautro's point about the vulnerability of consumers in relation to sales of complex pension products is a very real concern, and one which the Financial Services Act has failed adequately to regulate. Unfortunately, the new pensions ombudsman, who has statutory power to force miscreants to put right errors and compensate victims, is barred from investigating unscrupulous sales of personal pensions. Instead, this is left to the insurance ombudsman and to Lautro, neither of which has statutory powers. And there is a limit on the compensation that can be paid to victims of sales abuses under these complaints schemes.</p>

Official Arturo Yero might be being held hostage at the  Cuban  diplomatic offices, according to the organization of Cuban  exiles, Cuban Democratic Solidarity, which did not rule out the  possibility that Yero could have found "safe haven."    Sources in the Foreign Ministry in Quito unofficially  confirmed the disappearance of Yero and his wife but denied an  asylum request had been filed.    Some 10 Cuban diplomats and journalists have deserted in  Ecuador in the past few years, including intelligence officers.    According to Jesus Cruza-Flor, president of Cuban Democratic  Solidarity, Yero is actually "a captain of Castro's intelligence  forces" who reportedly received an order to return immediately  to Havana, "which he refused." Cruza-Flor said the  disappearance of the official, which is the second such case at  the Cuban Embassy in Quito, "confirms that Fidel Castro's regime  is inevitably reaching its end because of the overall discontent  of the people, who flee Cuba as soon as they find an  opportunity, leaving everything behind and risking it all."</p>

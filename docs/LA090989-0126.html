			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHERMAN RUNS FOR 136 YARDS; EDISON TOPS EL MODENA, 21-14  </P> <P> There was enough ebb and flow, and change in tide and momentum to make a fan  seasick in the season opener between Edison and El Modena Friday night.  </P> <P> Edison's running game, led by Shane Sherman's 136 yards, finally proved to be  the difference in a 21-14 victory in front of 2,000 at Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> Both teams were effective mounting long drives.  </P> <P> On its first possession, El Modena took over at its 19 following a Chargers'  punt and marched 81 yards for a quick touchdown. Quarterback Adam Garcia hit  Graham Brown with five- and nine-yard passes in the series. But the big play  was a 33-yard touchdown run by sophomore tailback Tom Mazzone.  </P> <P> Edison came right back and mounted a nine-play scoring drive. Sherman started  the Charger series with a 25-yard run to move his team to El Modena's 45.  Quarterback Donnie Smith had six and nine-yard passes and a nine-yard run.  Craig Shusterick finally ran it in from the five to tie the score, 7-7.  </P> <P> Edison sacked Garcia for a nine-yard loss on the opening play of El Modena's  next series, pushing the Vanguards back to their 15. El Modena's Mike  Vermillion eventually was forced to punt from his end zone. Edison ended up in  excellent field position at El Modena's 38 and scored nine plays later. Shane  Sherman carried the ball six times in the drive for 22 yards and a one-yard  touchdown.  </P> <P> The teams traded touchdowns in the second half with Edison scoring first on a  22-yard Smith-to-Brian Higgins pass for a 21-7 lead.  </P> <P> The Vanguards came back early in the fourth quarter on the strength of Garcia's  arm. He hit passes of 13 and 24 yards to Ron Murrietta and capped the 8-play  drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Gavin Brown.  </P> <P> "We didn't quite put them away when we had a chance," Edison Coach Dave White  said. "El Modena is a good team. I think it was more to its credit.  </P> <P> "It kind of flowed back and forth. Neither team really dominated," White said.  </P> <P> But the Chargers' Sherman certainly did, carrying the ball 23 times and scoring  one touchdown. That, coupled with 25 yards rushing from the versatile Smith,  gave Edison the edge.  </P> <P> Smith was six of 10 for 50 yards and one touchdown and one interception. Not  exactly dominating but, along with his running, he got the job done. "We didn't  throw a whole bunch but we're more of a running team, a play-action team,"  White said. "He's (Smith) a leader and that's the most important thing at the  quarterback spot."  </P></p>

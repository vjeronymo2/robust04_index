			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / London Markets: The spectre of a debtor's prison Peter Martin, Financial Editor NEAR the FT's office stands an old-fashioned undertakers, all black marble and gloomy solicitude. In brass lettering, the shop-front offers you a choice of conveyance - 'Horses, Motors' - for the final journey. Such a choice, the markets seemed to be saying this week, lies ahead in Thursday's general election: different ways of reaching the same place, with discretion limited to speed and style rather than destination. The likely destination can be found, appropriately enough, just behind the undertakers' premises, the site of the old Marshalsea debtor's prison. Long vanished, it is still vividly alive in Dickens's novel, Little Dorritt. The 20th century equivalent of the Marshalsea is the bind in which the likely course of government borrowing threatens to leave the British economy. Moaning over a vanished investment, one of the novel's improvident speculators sounds as pitiful as any Treasury knight: 'I have gone over it since it failed, every day of my life, and it comes out - regarded as a question of figures - triumphant.' Regarded as a question of figures, alas, there is little triumph to be found these days. In the March 1991 Budget, points out Nicholas Knight, Nomura's market strategist, the public sector borrowing requirement in the next half-decade was put at Pounds 26bn; now, the government hopes to keep it to Pounds 118bn - a rise of over Pounds 92bn in just 12 months. William Dorritt spent a lifetime in the Marshalsea for less. These figures derive from last month's Budget, and explain the slide in share prices since then. This week, there was a sudden worsening in both stock and bond markets: the FT-SE index closed down 65.2 points on the week at 2382.7, and gilt yields have risen from 9 1/2 to 9 3/4 per cent since the campaign started. Among shares, there were some specific factors at work. A Pounds 216m loss from Speyhawk, the property developer, sent its shares down 66 per cent on the week, to close at 3 3/4 p. Bank shares suffered from this and other property news, and dropped 7 per cent. But the main influences were political: opinion polls showing a clear Labour lead. It was always likely that UK investors would be spooked by this. But the market's judgment also reflects the growing sense that whatever party forms the next government will be faced with difficult decisions on economic policy. There are some positive signs in the short term. Institutional investors, both in the UK and abroad, seem to regard the UK markets as undervalued at their current level. The charts show why. On the left, the spread between gilts and German bunds has widened to levels that make the UK securities appealing. On the right, the ratio of the interest rate on gilts to the yield on ordinary shares has dropped enough to make equities look more attractive. Neither of these indicators is yet flashing an unambiguous buy signal: but they are both providing strong support once the election uncertainties are out of the way. A clutch of UK institutional investors told one equity analyst this week that at current prices they would be buyers of stocks after the election regardless of the outcome. The problems lie further ahead, and can best be examined by looking at the City consensus on three possible outcomes of the election: Conservative minority government. Such a government would be looking for a quick boost to the economy, followed by a second election. It might just possibly be tempted into a devaluation this year, if the signs of recovery seen in the past few weeks failed once again to translate into a real pick-up in activity. Labour majority government. With a workable majority, Labour would be settling in for the long haul. It would be interested in building a solid basis for recovery, to allow it to be re-elected in mid-decade. So no quick boost to the economy, other than the limited amount provided in John Smith's shadow Budget. Enacting Labour's tax plans might prove slightly negative for economic activity, if it proved as damaging for the south-east as some economists expect. There might be a possibility of a devaluation later in the government's life, if stagnation continued long enough to threaten re-election. Labour minority government. Expecting a quick second election, and perhaps also dependent on Liberal Democrat votes, it might choose a modified version of the Smith tax plan, hitting high-earners less severely. The short term boost to the economy might be greater than under a Tory minority government, but devaluation would almost certainly be ruled out this year. In all three outcomes, the risk is of slow growth in the medium term, accompanied by a rising PSBR and increasing difficulties in reconciling domestic economic policy with membership of the European Monetary System. The ultimate manifestation of this would be the strain of getting government borrowing down below the level needed to qualify for monetary union. Any future Chancellor might find his European colleagues lecturing him much as the luckless Pancks is bullied in Little Dorritt: 'You must be much sharper with the people, sir. You don't squeeze them. Your receipts are not up to the mark. You must squeeze them, sir . . . Duty, duty; squeeze on Monday, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze]' Happy voting]</p>

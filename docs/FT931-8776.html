			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Oce drops 14% to Fl 87.3m OCE-VAN DER Grinten, the Dutch copier and office systems maker, said net profit for the full year 1992 fell 14 per cent due to the weak economic climate and unfavourable currency exchange rates, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. The company said net profit for the year slipped to Fl 87.3m (Dollars 48m) from Fl 100.9m a year earlier. The company said it was pressured by greater competition, lower margins, and a strong guilder. Meanwhile, net profit per share fell 16 per cent to Fl 5.49m a share from Fl 6.58 a year ago. Oce said a dividend totalling Fl 2.25 per ordinary share, unchanged from 1991, would be paid. Sales increased 3 per cent to Fl 2.66bn from Fl 2.58bn. This growth was due in part to a broader range of goods, which Oce had been building up over previous years to broaden its market share. Oce noted that weakness in the US market had an unfavorable impact on Oce Office Systems, its US division. Although interest income from leasing activities rose 52 per cent, to Fl 72.9m from Fl 47.8m, that increase was in part offset by higher financing costs, which rose 6 per cent to Fl 82.8m from Fl 76.5m. ***** BP Oil Espana, the Spanish unit of the oil company British Petroleum, has agreed to sell 30 per cent of Productos Quimicos del Mediterraneo SA (Proquimed), its chemical subsidiary to Ube Industries, the Japanese industrial group, AP-DJ reports from Madrid. The sale will take place this year. No financial details were given. Proquimed is Spain's sole producer of the chemical caprolactam, used in making synthetic fibers. Ube Industries is a world leader in caprolactam production, BP Oil Espana said. It acquired Proquimed in 1991. ***** Allianz, the German insurer, said its expansion plans would be focused on east and south-east Asia in geographic terms and on lifting its position in industrial insurance, Reuter reports from Munich. 'We want to expand our basis in Asia,' Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, the managing board chairman, said. Allianz has subsidiaries in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand. 'But that is not enough,' he said. ***** Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, has bought 30 per cent of the shares in Indelec, a Spanish mobile phones and transmission equipment maker, Reuter reports from Stockholm. No financial details were disclosed. Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish state telephone company which owns 30 per cent of Indelec, will have to sell its stake by 1995 to comply with European Community rules. Ericsson would then probably be able to increase its stake, according to Ericsson.</p>

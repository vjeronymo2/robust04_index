			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Deputy Premier Aleskandr </F> Shokhin by unidentified OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, date and  place not given: "How I See this Newspaper"]    [Text]    [Question] You were the first one who supported OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA's initiative to create a CIS international publication.  It was precisely at the session of the Consultative Committee  that the formulation about organizing the economic weekly SNG:  OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: COMMON MARKET] based on OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  was adopted. Why did you support this idea?    [Shokhin] The CIS institutes are still not working  effectively, particularly due to lack of professional  technology, first of all information technology. Such  operational information on the situation in each of the  countries which it is now possible to receive is insufficient.  In addition, meetings on a bilateral and multilateral basis  often arise but the large apparatus of state employees and  business people who, according to their activity should be privy  to these mutual relations, do not have reliable sources of  information. Of course, a newspaper cannot be the only source  and we are trying to create other systems, particularly computer  systems for exchanging information. But if an economic weekly  were published, which knew how to give professionals not only  food for thought but also for action, I think that would be a  big step toward real strengthening of our mutual action.    [Question] Of course, the features of a newspaper take shape  gradually. But it is already possible to determine its basic  direction. First of all it is a comparative analysis of the  situation in one country to another according to various  parameters.    [Shokhin] It must be said that if a comparative economic  analysis can be introduced successfully as one of the basic  ideas of the newspaper that would be excellent. If we know how  to give a professional analysis and the corresponding prognosis  on various themes, be they banking affairs, financial  management, the consumer basket, inflation, etc., the newspaper  would be able to exert a strong influence on life.    [Question] Does possible jealousy not embarrass you?    [Shokhin] So as not to use politicized terminology, it is  possible with a comparison of a specific set of economic policy  measures and an evaluation of their short, medium and long-term  consequences to prove of great use to our colleagues and  neighbors, rather than by pinning on labels. If an element of  envy enters the professional channel then it will not be an  element of envy but rather a moment of truth, which leaders need.    [Question] One of the basic directions of the new  publication  should be integration in the broadest sense of the word: from  economic union, ensuring a unified economic space, free movement  of goods, services and capital to the reestablishment of  traditional economic ties and the search for new companions.  What can the new weekly do that can be useful in developing this  process?    [Shokhin] The very name of the newspaper already proposes  that it should propagandize four freedoms: the freedom for  movement of capital, work forces, services and goods. Now, when  we are trying to build a program of practical steps, not just as  the basis for these freedoms, but also for their practical  realization, it is important to understand the consequence of  these actions. The matter is that even on the highest political  level the plans on how to proceed toward economic union have not  been charted. At one time a somewhat simplified approach  prevailed. It was enough to display political decisiveness and  everything would be reestablished. Now it is clear that to  reestablish economic links and to remove barriers which have  appeared in recent years is more easily done through the  resolution of specific questions than through universal outlines.    It would be desirable if the newspaper could help strengthen  production links between potential partners. Here is an  additional field of activity for the paper. The search for  partners and the corresponding propaganda can give an additional  impulse to this work: the newspaper should not rely on the  budget all the time. It should become self-supporting.    [Question] The state of economic and ecological  fragmentation  tragically affects the problems, the resolution of which is  possible only through common efforts. How can the newspaper  help here?    [Shokhin] I cannot say that these general state projects are  not found in the field of vision of the CIS governments. There  is the Caspian, and there is Chernobyl. It is impossible to say  that they are being resolved effectively. It is difficult to  say to what decree the newspaper is able to help them. More  likely, by mobilizing various types of resources, inasmuch as it  is impossible to resolve these problems solely on the basis of  state financing. For example, we have the Yelabug project; the  agreement on creating an interstate consortium was signed a year  ago and the CIS countries are participating. If the newspaper  could attract the most varied investors, or foreign  capital...Perhaps there could be a possibility to hold a contest  for interstate projects. The newspaper could draw attention to  these projects and help decide them.    [Question] What kind of readers do you see for the new  newspaper?    [Shokhin] I think that a certain stratum of state employees  has already formed which handles the problems of the CIS. The  population is also interested in knowing what is happening in  interstate relations. I think that Russian businessmen should  know what investment conditions exist outside the borders of  Russia, in the near abroad, how to protect their capital  investments there, and so forth. The newspaper could be an  irreplaceable source of such information. I hope that it will  really become one of the first international newspapers,  although several publications are contending for this title with  us.</p>

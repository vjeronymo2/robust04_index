			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hyundai buys NCR chip operations from AT&amp;T Hyundai Electronics America, a US subsidiary of the Hyundai group of South Korea, has agreed to acquire the semi-conductor operations of AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, formerly called NCR, for more than Dollars 300m. The acquisition is the largest of its kind by a Korean company in the US, Hyundai said. AT&amp;T announced in August that it was seeking a buyer for the NCR chip operations. With sales last year of Dollars 372m, the unit employs about 1,850 people at two semiconductor plants in Colorado as well as a plant in Wichita, Kansas, that makes circuit boards for personal computers. The division is profitable and its sales have been growing at about 25 per cent per year, AT&amp;T said. Hyundai Electronics said it would retain the current management of the NCR division, which would operate as an independent, autonomous subsidiary. With estimated world sales of Dollars 1.05bn in 1993, Hyundai Electronics is the third largest Korean semiconductor manufacturer, after Samsung and Goldstar. Hyundai's semi-conductor revenues are expected to more than double this year to about Dollars 2.5bn. To date, however, Hyundai's semiconductor operations have been heavily concentrated on memory chips, used in all types of computers. 'The acquisition is a strategic move to expand Hyundai Electronics' strong presence in the global semiconductor marketplace from a volume-driven memory business to the high value-added integrated circuit business,' said Mr YH Kim, chief executive of Hyundai Electronics America. The NCR Microelectronic Products division produces specialised microchips, including application-specific integrated circuits.</p>

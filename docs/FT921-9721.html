			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Italy to boost Algerian gas A PROJECT aimed at virtually doubling gas exports from Algeria to Italy, has been given the go-ahead with the approval by Sace, Italy's export credit guarantee agency, of credits worth Dollars 127m (Pounds 70m), writes Francis Ghiles. Delayed for months because of political uncertainty in Algeria, the approval of the first tranche of finance for the project means work can begin on the Trans-Med gas pipeline, to run from Algeria to Italy. The decision follows last week's visit to Rome by Algeria's foreign minister, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, and confirms that for Italy - Algeria's largest natural gas customer - it is back to business as usual. The total cost of the project, which will increase the volume of natural gas exported to Italy from an annual figure of 14.2bn cu ft to 25bn cu ft, is estimated at Dollars 5.8bn. The pipeline will link Mazara del Vallo in Sicily to the distribution point near Bologna. Italy's state electricity company, Enel, will buy 6bn cu ft of the extra gas for the fast-growing electricity generation sector.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The final defendant to be sentenced for robbing a Lodi city councilman's wife  during a mugging was sentenced Friday to two years in state prison and ordered  to pay the victim $10,000.  </P> <P> Probation was denied for William Austin, 20, of San Diego, whose mother and  sister were in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Marjorie Reid, 63, was beaten unconscious and robbed Oct. 16 at a Mission  Valley hotel parking lot while her husband, Fred Reid, 66, attended a League of  California Cities convention here. She suffered head injuries and a broken hip  and knee, and was robbed of $200 in cash, her credit cards and a pair of  diamond earrings.  </P> <P> Austin pleaded guilty March 27 to second-degree robbery and could have been  sentenced to three years in prison.  </P> <P> Two other defendants, Dwayne Elliott, 21, and Willie Rankin, 22, were sentenced  previously. Rankin received three years and eight months in state prison after  being convicted April 25 of being an accessory to robbery and receiving stolen  credit cards. Elliott was sentenced to one year in jail.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez sentenced Austin, and gave him  credit for time spent in jail. Rodriguez said there was a likelihood that  Austin would pose a danger to others if not imprisoned. He cited Austin's  record, which included convictions for assault and weapons charges.  </P> <P> Marjorie Reid did not testify because her injuries caused a memory loss.  </P></p>

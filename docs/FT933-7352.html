			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Gardening: Climbers which make an impression IN THIS sudden week of heavenly weather, an image of the painter Monet keeps returning to my mind. At this moment, the nasturtiums must be flowering along the path of his garden at Giverny, in France, recently recreated for visitors. Perhaps there are still some water lilies, and possibly the agapanthus are as good as mine and almost as good as the most valuable agapanthus in the world, which Monet painted in his 80s and which now hangs in the basement of the Marmottan in Paris. It is not for these reasons, however, that I am thinking of him. He used to say that nothing else in the world interested him except his painting and his flowers. I have moments of envying his nerve in saying this, and rather more moments of reminding myself why I disagree. Then, I look at the newly-built arches in my garden and picture him again, the patron saint of arch-building, which has continued to be a craze after his death. At Giverny, above the nasturtiums, the managers have reinstated wide arches for their roses (the colours of some are better than others). Monet himself first added these arches to his garden's metalwork in 1891 when he was 51. I am pleased to discover that he painted them a bright and leafy shade of green. My arch-builder painted mine in my absence and did not forewarn me that he was thinking on Monet-coloured lines. I had expected something darker, but the grass-green is already fading gently and I can tell myself that I now have a true Impressionist colour, chosen carefully for all Monet's arches, shutters and woodwork. Nowadays, many companies will sell you arches in sections and some will even send adequate notes on how to assemble them. I have always found it cheaper to hire a local blacksmith and buy any materials from him. I have also hired a friend's trained metalworker, who saved me the aggravation of erecting an Agriframe and put up my arches instead. They went up in June and I think they are the reason non-gardeners are so sure that, this year, the garden has taken a great leap forward. Quietly, they have been waiting for me to go Sloane. They would be even more impressed if only I could decide what to put on them. Sometimes, readers send me a good idea: you first sent me the yellow-flowered clematis for the hot south wall and the best red rose, Etoile de Hollande, for a wall facing east. We all know about arches of laburnum, which look spectacular if you use the vossii variety. We also know about wisteria, and it is now worth studying The Plant Finder for the best whites, the Chinese form called Caroline, Black Dragon, and the others which I used to think had disappeared. I find that the lovely Multijuga variety is too much on a normal arch because its wonderfully long flowers dangle for several feet and close it off. Fewer people know about the Judas Tree, which will also cover an arch. It flowers sparsely, but its leaves are pretty and can be eaten in salads early in summer. Otherwise, if you want to be showy and original, where should you look? On my dry, stony soil, it is no use relying only on roses: they grow wretchedly and develop black spot by midsummer. On happier soils, I still think that the pale pink-white New Dawn is in a class by itself on an archway. In general, I prefer repeat-flowering climbers with big flowers to the rampant, once-flowering ramblers which are recommended most often. I prefer anything to the newish, pink Sophies Perpetual. I find its colour beastly and I am struggling to stop its harsh flowers from appearing throughout the year. Mrs Herbert Stevens is a lovely double white and, in sunny, sheltered places, my beloved apricot, Lady Hillingdon, is excellent because her flowers tend to droop and thus appear through the ceiling of the arch. What, though, if roses dislike you, or you wish to vary the scene? I am sure of one thing which Monet never knew. The outstanding clematis on an arch is Perle d'Azur, which is at its best now and is so wonderfully vigorous that it will thrive and flower unstoppably. Otherwise, where do we look? In mild gardens or expatriate bunkers, I would go straight for the lovely white Solanum jasminoides, but it will not survive hard winters in open ground on a British arch. White jasmines in Britain are usually rather scruffy, with more leaf than flower. I could live with an entire arch of honeysuckle, but most of them will not live with anything else because they throttle it and reduce you to their single season. The better-behaved varieties, Dropmore Scarlet and the scented Graham Thomas, are not at their best in full sunlight. The main point of an arch is to cast shade in an over-exposed position: the climbers have to be able to take full sun on their heads, and some of the honeysuckles will turn brown. Passion flowers, golden hops and Chinese gooseberries are all a mess. After studying lists of climbers, I am inclined to abandon them and consider training and pruning particular trees. At Kiftsgate Court, in Gloucestershire, the rose garden is rounded off by a fine arch of whitebeams, trained together and clipped hard. At Greys Court near Henley, Oxfordshire, you can see an airy arch of pink-flowered acacias. Hazels are worthy, but very dull. My present thought is that the neglected staphylea might be the answer for those who want a change. It carries hanging bunches of white flowers, in its better forms, and it comes at that awkward moment in late May. I will report on progress. Monet, I suspect, would say that the answer was obvious and the correct decision is to plant more wisterias. They grew to look superb on his wide Japanese bridge. Somehow, though, I do not wish to be obvious and will probably live to regret it: hold fast for news of a staphylea, unless you come up with a better idea.</p>

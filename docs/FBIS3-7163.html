Security  Council is expected to adopt a resolution on the North Korean  nuclear situation around the end of this month, a Foreign  Ministry official said Friday.    "The five permanent members of the council are in the middle  of actively exchanging opinions on the content and strength of  the resolution right now. They're almost finished and the  resolution is likely to be decided soon," the official said.    The content is said to be rather weak so that China will not  exercise its veto power, the official said.    The key point in the resolution is the International Atomic  Energy Agency's additional demand to inspect two sites inside  North Korea's radiochemical laboratory, believed to be a nuclear  reprocessing facility, that were sealed off from earlier  monitoring.    "The general feeling is that adoption of the resolution  should not be too late," he said.</p>

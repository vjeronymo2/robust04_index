			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barrs shrug off board's franchise warnings The board of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, whose voting shareholders are split by a family feud, yesterday warned that the motor side of the group could lose its distribution franchises. The board said that two car manufacturers had threatened to terminate franchises if rebel shareholders vote down its proposals to enfranchise the non-voting A shares. These shares, owned almost entirely by institutions, yesterday fell 21p to 263p, while the ordinary voting shares closed 15p down at 540p. The motor distribution division is expected to account for 70 per cent of the leisure and motor group's profits this year. The family feud broke out last month when Nicholas and Robert Barr asked their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, to step down as chairman of the group. The brothers, who claim majority support among voting shareholders, have also requisitioned an EGM to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance director. They say they can unlock shareholder value by splitting the group's two divisions into stand-alone businesses. However, the board has called another EGM to vote on enfranchisement on November 25, one week before the rebels' EGM. Enfranchisement would reduce family control from about 55 to 18 per cent. The board seems likely to lose both EGM votes after Mr Kerry Firth, a Barnsley-based businessman with 16 per cent of the ordinary shares, re-affirmed his support for the rebels yesterday. Mr Firth, who was asked by the board to referee a meeting with the Barr brothers this week, said: 'Whatever support the board may have had from me in the past, they will not get in the future. 'The company has underperformed under the present chairman. That is why there is discomfort among shareholders and why they are giving their votes to the brothers.' Attempts to hold a meeting between Malcolm Barr and his nephews broke down on Tuesday in a row over correspondence from the car manufacturers. Nicholas Barr yesterday condemned the warnings over the distribution franchises. 'This is a blatant attempt by the board to safeguard its own position at the expense of shareholders,' he said.</p>

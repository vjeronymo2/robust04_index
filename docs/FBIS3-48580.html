			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of closing speech by Do Muoi, party general </F> secretary, at the MidTerm National Party Conference in Hanoi on  25 January -- read by announcer]    [Text] Dear party Central Committee advisers; Comrade  Nguyen Huu Tho, president of the Vietnam Fatherland Front [VFF]  Presidium; former members of previous Central Committee  Political Bureaus; and conference delegates.    The Midterm National Party Conference [MNPC] accomplished  its  duty and achieved fine success after six days of urgent work  with a high sense of responsibility to our revolutionary  undertaking, the fatherland's destiny, and our national future.  The delegates contributed their best to the success of the  development of the democratic spirit in party activities. They  expressed their agreement with the party Central Committee  political report. They also took part in lively discussions and  provided many important and correct opinions.    The delegates carefully selected qualified people to  replenish the party Central Committee, which increased the  strength of the leading party organ. This is the first time our  party held a midterm national conference according to  stipulations set forth in the party statutes.    Many new issues have arisen, including challenges,  opportunities, difficulties, and advantages, in an international  background and national situation of many changes. These issues  have come up after only a little more than two years after the  Seventh National Party Congress [SNPC]. They require the entire  party's intelligence to evaluate the implementation of the SNPC  resolution in the past, to review in one step our renovation  cause since the Sixth National Party Congress, to analyze the  current situation, to outline major policies and measures, and  to replenish party cadres to the party leading organ. This will  meet the current demands of our revolutionary stage and heighten  the willpower and strengths of our entire party, Army, and  people for the continuous advancement of our revolutionary cause  and for the accomplishment of the goals, directions, and duties  outlined by the SNPC.    The MNPC resolution concretizes and develops the spirit and  content of the SNPC resolution in the new situation. We must  quickly organize practical activities to disseminate and  understand the resolution after this conference. Party  committees at all levels must closely supervise the resolution's  implementation together with the satisfactory organization of  their midterm delegate meetings to accelerate control work,  develop positive aspects, and quickly correct shortcomings and  mistakes.    The government urgently must institutionalize the resolution  content. Governments from the central to grass-roots levels  must introduce detailed plans to quickly execute the resolution.  Fatherland fronts and mass organizations must engage deeply to  motivate the public, to strengthen the national unity block, to  develop their existing emulative movements, and to organize new  movements in order to widely gather and motivate everybody to  enthusiastically transform the SNPC goals and major MNPC duties  into realities.    We must strive to build clean and strong party and state  mechanisms in order to satisfactorily implement the SNPC and  MNPC resolutions and to ensure a correct direction for  development. We must also improve leadership capacity and  management efficiency. Our party is the party of the workers'  class and a loyal representative of the interests of the  workers' class, laborers, and entire nation. Since its  formation, our party always holds the national flag high and  fights determinedly for the fatherland's independence and the  people's freedom and happiness. The past 60 years of history  prove that our party is a vanguard fighting force for the entire  nation. Our party is resolute about accomplishing this  important duty in the new stage. All party cadres and members  must earnestly study to improve their knowledge, quality, and  morality; fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; and  continue their sacrifice and struggle for the revolutionary  undertaking, thus deserving to be considered the people's loyal  servant as Uncle Ho used to teach us.    We must study Marxist-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought and  correctly apply and develop them in the new situation. We must  preserve, inherit, and develop our national characteristics and  quintessence. We also must study and selectively acquire  mankind's achievements and other countries' experiences to  correctly and creatively apply them to Vietnam's real situation.  We must not copy dogmas. All dogmas from this side or the  other side will cause damage to the national revolutionary cause.    The MNPC calls on the entire party, Army, and people to  develop our ancestors' fine tradition in national construction  and protection. We must heighten the willpower of independence,  sovereignty, and self-reliance; exercise diligence; practice  frugality; instigate honesty; and uphold righteousness for the  construction and protection of the fatherland and the party. We  must work for the development of our economy, culture, and  society; and we must strengthen our national defense and  security to protect the regime that our people built with so  much effort and the blood and bones of many generations.    The MNPC calls for the increase of unity and unanimity to  fully exploit opportunities; eliminate dangers; overcome  challenges; proceed with the national industrialization and  modernization; take our renovation cause to new heights and  depths for the goals of a rich population, strong nation, and  just and civilized society; and gradually and successfully build  socialism.    On the new year of 1994 and on entering the Year of the  Monkey, I wish party Central Committee advisers; Comrade Nguyen  Huu Tho, president of the VFF Presidium; former members of  previous Central Committee Political Bureaus; conference  delegates; and all comrades good health and more contributions  to our party and people's revolutionary undertaking.    Our MNPC hails comrades who, for health reasons, voluntarily  resigned from the party Central Committee to create favorable  conditions for the appointment of younger comrades to the party  leading organ. It is hoped that they will continue to actively  contribute their experience to the party and state's common  tasks.    On behalf of the MNPC Presidium, I declare the Midterm  National Party Conference closed.</p>

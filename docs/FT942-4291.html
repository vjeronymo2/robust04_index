			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Observer: Perfect incoherence Invisible exports will never be quite the same again - Britain has managed to sell its controversial new system of vocational qualifications to Oman. It's the first time the system - which rewards an individual's ability to do a job rather than assessing his or her knowledge about a task - has been sold lock, stock and barrel. The UK's NVQs have been unfavourably compared with their Continental counterparts. But John Hiller, who helped devise the system, says that 'the Omanis are as realistic as the rest of us . . . they recognise that no system is perfect, and that there is hardly a country in the world with as coherent a system. The fact that it isn't perfect is less important than its coherence.'</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria blames interest costs for plunge into red FONDIARIA, the big Italian insurance group controlled jointly by Ferruzzi and the Gaic holding company, reported a group loss of L494.4bn (Dollars 4.55bn), compared with a net profit of L68.8bn in 1991. The group, which this month sold its 21 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs of Germany for DM985m (Dollars 604m), attributed the loss to interest costs on borrowings to finance its ambitious expansion, notably into Germany via AMB. Among other factors cited were losses in re-insurance business, underwriting losses at some subsidiaries and write-offs on the book value of other group companies. The poor results, which had been widely expected, have triggered strong rumours that Fondiaria may be sold or split up. However, Mr Carlo Sama, a senior Ferruzzi executive, said yesterday that the company was not for sale. Outlining restructuring plans, Fondiaria said it would sell a variety of non-strategic assets and re-examine its activities in a variety of areas not strictly linked to insurance, leading to speedy disposals. The disposals would be restricted to assets outside insurance, or other activities which were not majority-owned by the group.</p>

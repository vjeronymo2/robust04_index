			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Channel 5 Sunday at 3 p.m.) The original 1956  sci-fi classic, directed by Don Siegel, is about a small community whose  inhabitants are being taken over by alien "pods." Serves as an effective  parable on the hysteria of McCarthyism and stars Kevin McCarthy and Dana  Wynter.  </P> <P> The Wages of Fear (TNT Sunday at 11 p.m.) The 1952 H. G. Clouzot suspense  classic focuses on four truck drivers transporting nitroglycerin across a South  American backwash. Yves Montand and Charles Vanel star. Remade grandiosely by  William Friedkin in 1977 as "Sorcerer."  </P> <P> The Big Clock (Channel 5 Monday at 4 a.m.) Reworked -- or rather overworked as  the 1987 "No Way Out," this taut, witty 1948 thriller involves an innocent man  (Ray Milland) trying to avoid becoming a prime suspect in a murder while  pursuing the actual killer. Directed by John Farrow and co-starring Maureen  O'Sullivan, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester.  </P> <P> McCabe and Mrs. Miller (Channel 13 Saturday at 2 a.m.) One of Robert Altman's  very best, an ironic, many-layered 1971 frontier saga in which a cocky but  fundamentally naive opportunist (Warren Beatty) sets about opening a bordello,  with Julie Christie as its madam.  </P></p>

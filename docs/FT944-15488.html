			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kelt Energy buoyed by lower interest A sharp reduction in interest charges helped Kelt Energy, the oil and gas producer and explorer, increase interim profits in spite of lower oil prices. Profits after tax for the six months to end-June rose from Pounds 2.54m to Pounds 2.77m after a reduced interest charge of Pounds 523,000 (Pounds 1.05m). Strong operating cashflow enabled the company to repay fixed interest loans of Dollars 15.2m (Pounds 9.6m) and Dollars 6.97m and to reduce gearing to 4 per cent (9 per cent) in spite of acquisitions in Gabon and heavy investment in its Colombian wells. Turnover was down at Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 18.2m), with the profit improvement being achieved in spite of oil prices on average Dollars 3 per barrel (15 per cent) lower than in the first half of last year. The price fall was, however, partly offset by higher production, with daily output running 17 per cent above that achieved last year. Earnings per share were unchanged at 1.8p.</p>

According to  various estimates, the radioactive sensitivity of mollusks is a  factor of 20-30 lower than in mammals. Consequently, the  processes of radioactive adaptation in their populations may be  governed by different rules. The study was done in the summer of  1991. Polluted samples were taken from the Pripyat River 15 km  upstream from the Chernobyl plant. Control samples were obtained  from the Krutynya River in Poland. Ground pollution levels and  the content of radioactive isotopes (Cs, Sr) were analyzed.  Adult mollusks were exposed to gamma radiation and observed. Two  distinct mortality processes were found. This indicates the  presence of two independent reactions to radiation with  different mechanisms, each of which is fatal. The first occurs  fairly rapidly, the second, more slowly. The Pripyat samples  withstood the first phase better. In the second phase, the  control samples fared better. Mollusks surviving the first phase  produced viable eggs. The appearance of mutations is discussed.  Figure 1; table 1; references 6 (Russian).</p>

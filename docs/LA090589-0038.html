			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GERALD WILSON IN CONCERT AT LACMA  </P> <P> One day shy of his 71st birthday, Gerald Wilson, the Mississippi-born composer  and band leader, offered an afternoon concert Sunday at the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art that was nearly as hot as the mid-day sun.  </P> <P> Working with a youthful and exuberant big band (familiar faces such as  trumpeter Snooky Young and saxophonist Harold Land Sr., have been replaced with  "guys ready to move," according to Wilson), the band leader waved the 17-man  ensemble through an opening set that barely scratched the surface of his  compositional breadth and scope.  </P> <P> Wilson's credits are as profound as his efforts, and an opening "You Better  Believe It" displayed the late-'40s style he provided for Count Basie that,  Wilson recalled Sunday afternoon, Basie "made millions off of."  </P> <P> Kicked off at an easy pace, the tune displayed all of the precision swing and  dynamic variance that the Basie outfit came to embrace. Added features to this  outing were solos by alto saxophonist Danny House (himself an alumnus of the  Basie band) and bassist Louie Spears.  </P> <P> Wilson next turned his attention to Duke Ellington, another of the famed band  leaders for whom Wilson wrote and played, and offered an arrangement of  "Sophisticated Lady." The familiar melody received unique treatment, becoming a  great and rousing powerhouse of a vehicle for tenor saxophonist Carl Randall.  </P> <P> Moving forward in music history to the Miles Davis book, Wilson next featured  the searingly creative trumpet of Oscar Brashear and the trombones of Thurman  Green and Randy Young on a reading of "Milestones." The tune burned at a  breakneck tempo provided by bassist Spears and drummer Mel Lee and featured  some deft piano work by Brian O'Rourke.  </P> <P> Closing out the set was Wilson's "Blues for Yna Yna," a tune that gained hit  status by both Stan Kenton and Art Blakey in the early '60s. A waltz, the tune  loped gently along and displayed Wilson's penchant for dynamic variation. A.  JAMES LISKA  </P></p>

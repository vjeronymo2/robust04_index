Yoshifumi Tsuji told a news conference in Nagoya that the  company has no intention of cutting wages, but freezing the wage  scale is one option.    Tsuji added that the company has no plan to review the  present system for negotiating summer and year-end bonuses in a  package. It will continue production cuts in the early part of  fiscal 1994, starting April 1, as it is doing in the latter half  of fiscal 1993.    His remark indicated that the company will give five to  eight  extra days off to workers during the April-September period.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Latin American fortunes shift to Chile  -William Cochrane reviews last month's performance of the world's emerging markets Shifting fortunes in Latin America, a further slide in Turkey and equity fever in India were key features in the world's emerging markets in February. Currency movements were a parallel consideration. In Latin America, Chile seems to have come back to life, with a local currency gain of 15.1 per cent, rising to 17.3 per cent in dollar terms. Santiago was put in the shade by some of its Latin American counterparts last year, but it still registered a gain of 90 per cent in dollar terms against the region's 125 per cent average advance. After a rise of 124 per cent in dollar terms to its peak on October 6, Chile fell away on profit-taking, and then in January, says Mr Michael Raynal of BZW, institutional investors sat on their hands, and their profits. A revaluation of the peso in January encouraged them to return to equities. In February, institutional investors, mainly pension funds, came back in force: daily turnover in Santiago rose from between USDollars 5m and Dollars 6m at the beginning of the month to between Dollars 9m and Dollars 13m at the end. The combination of a strong currency and a booming domestic economy has given it attractions which are unusual in global, as well as South American, terms. Brazil's climb was stalled by the drop in the cruzeiro, according to indices published by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank. In contrast, Chile's local currency advance appreciated in dollar terms. After gains in dollar terms of 44.9 per cent in December and 37.6 per cent in January, Brazil's equity market declined by 0.5 per cent last month, says the IFC, although it registered a 23 per cent rise in local currency terms. Turkey turned in the worst performance among emerging markets last year, say Kleiman International Consultants of New York. After a slight rise in January it was on its way down again last month, falling 30 per cent in dollar terms. Investors, says Kleiman, are waiting for long-promised structural reforms: '. . . settlement problems and insider trading are still rampant, and non-bank brokerages are not subject to capital adequacy requirements and sufficient disclosure. Analysts estimate that the top 10 houses account for 70 per cent of trading activity, raising concern over potential disaster should the market decline dramatically, putting broker solvency to the test.' A review of the Indian stock market will appear on this page later this week.</p>

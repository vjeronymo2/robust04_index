			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Strength in 3M sets tone for upturn Wall Street US equity investors went bargain hunting yesterday, lifting share prices across the board after a string of soft sessions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 22.21 ahead at 3,908.46, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.18 at 473.14. On the Big Board, advances led declines by 1,315 to 806 after volume of 296m shares. The American SE composite edged up 0.19 to 455.51, while the Nasdaq composite again outperformed the rest of the indices, climbing 5.02 to 769.30. The day's second-tier economic news was virtually ignored. The focus was still set squarely on today's report on August producer prices. The market awaited the report with a mixture of resignation and quiet confidence. On one hand, most investors expected to be handed clear evidence of accelerating inflation. Analysts were forecasting an increase of about 0.5 per cent in producer prices, or about 0.3 per cent excluding the volatile food and energy sectors. But there was also a consensus that the data would not prompt the Federal Reserve to bring forward its next monetary tightening, even if it came in stronger than expected. After losing ground in four of the last five sessions, the market appeared to have already factored some bad inflation news into stock valuations. As a consequence, the stage was set yesterday morning for investors to bid up stock prices in response to a firming trend in bonds and improvement by the dollar in the foreign exchange markets. Later in the day, bonds wavered but the bellwether Dow industrials remained well above the 3,900 level. Among the blue chips, 3M set the pace with a rise of Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 56 3/8 . The stock, which had receded over the past fortnight, forged ahead after the company predicted that its earnings per share would improve by 10 per cent annually over the next three years. In retailing, Sears Roebuck moved forward Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 5/8 , while Kmart added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 18 in a muted reaction to the company's decision to close 110 stores and cut its management ranks by 10 per cent. The rally in technology stocks - the biggest surprise of a rather predictable week - stretched into a second session. Texas Instruments, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 77 1/8 , led the semiconductor sector, while Compaq, Dollars 1 stronger at Dollars 36 5/8 , was to the fore in computer makers. On the Nasdaq, Microsoft put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 57 7/8 and Atmel rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 3/4. Canada Toronto rallied as investors were heartened by the results of an opinion poll showing the ruling Liberals ahead of the Parti Quebecois for the first time in the Quebec election campaign. The provincial election takes place on Monday. The TSE 300 index ended 15.31 points firmer at 4,354.38 and rises outscored falls by 396 to 340 after volume of 67.5m shares valued at CDollars 798.3m. Nine of the 14 sub-indices were higher, led by mining, consumer products, financial services and forestry products. The golds index, after recent strength, slipped 0.52 per cent.</p>

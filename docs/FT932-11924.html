			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Tiphook Tiphook was clearly trying to contain scepticism about the company's trading prospects with its profits warning. But the wholesale dumping of bad news has done little to reassure the market - as yesterday's 22 per cent fall in the share price demonstrates. While the sale of 9,500 trailers reduces the fleet during the continental recession, the management has simultaneously committed itself to a Pounds 378m order for 11,000 trailers over the next five years. It will be vindicated if markets turn up in 1980s-style. If not, Tiphook is avoiding pain today by buying more expensive pain tomorrow. With its largest competitor TIP Europe being acquired by General Electric Capital Corporation, it will face opposition from a company backed by a deep-pocketed parent. Tiphook has high operational and financial gearing, while its interest cover is likely to fall to 1.6 times by the year end. Most of its banking covenants become operable at a cover of 1.25 times, but there are a few set at 1.5 times. The company can repay its more stringent borrowings from other cash reserves if necessary, and is increasing the proportion of unsecured loans in its debt portfolio. Yet gearing of over 300 per cent with such low cover does increase the financial risks. Investors might be more reassured if the mangement's sunny disposition had not proved over-optimistic in the past. By the conventional yardsticks of multiple and yield, the shares are cheap. With the market nervous about trading prospects, they are likely to remain so.</p>

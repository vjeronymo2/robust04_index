			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference today the PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] said that since the inception of a state of emergency  violence had increased in the Natal Province, and called on the  government to lift the state of emergency. PAC President  Clarence Makwetu said the state of emergency involved the  suspension of basic human rights and would not lead to a free  and fair election. He said the aim was not to solve the problem  of violence but to pressurize kwaZulu into talking.    [Begin Makwetu recording] The decision of the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council], the ANC, and the regime, to  declare a state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal is politically  wrong and tragic. This can only exacerbate a social tragedy,  that is, military, security power remains with the ruling  regime. [end recording]    Mr. Makwetu also said that the PAC wouldn't oppose a  postponement of the April elections provided it applied to the  whole country. He objected to the elections being postponed  only in kwaZulu-Natal.</p>

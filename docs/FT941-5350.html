			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Robert Wiseman Dairies likely to have Pounds 60m value Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish milk company which concentrates on supplying branded milk in cartons to stores in Scotland, is coming to market towards the end of this month via an institutional placing by Panmure Gordon which is likely to value the family-owned company at about Pounds 60m. The placing should raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 16m, leaving 75 per cent of the company in family hands. It comes to the market at a time of big changes in the UK milk industry. Later this year the government intends to abolish the milk marketing boards, which have a monopoly on buying milk from farmers. Dairy Crest, the milk processing and supply subsidiary of the MMB in England, is also likely to be floated. Whereas in England nearly 60 per cent of milk is still delivered to the customer's doorstep, in Scotland most people buy it from a supermarket or corner shop. Early recognition of the trends which produced that state of affairs lie behind Wiseman's fast growth. It is now expanding in northern England, where doorstep deliveries are also in decline. Wiseman, as a traditional dairy company which processed and delivered milk to the doorsteps around Glasgow, became convinced by the late 1970s that doorstep delivery was dying out. 'Increasingly the Scottish housewife was going out to work, leaving home before the milkman had come, and found it easier and cheaper to buy milk at a shop,' says Mr Alan Wiseman, the 43-year-old executive chairman. He and his brother, Robert, run the business which was founded in the late 1940s by their father, also called Robert. Wiseman decided to concentrate on the wholesale market, and invested in systems for providing milk in non-returnable containers to supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco under their own labels. However, this meant that Wiseman's own identity was disappearing, so in 1989 it launched its own brands of liquid milk and put its black and white logo on its cartons and big trucks. Wiseman claims to have 22 per cent of the Scottish milk market and to be its second largest processor and supplier, coming after Scottish Pride, the Scottish Milk Marketing Board's offshoot. More than half Wiseman's milk goes out under its own brand. Its doorstep deliveries are franchised to self-employed milkmen. The proportion of Scottish milk delivered door to door is now only 22 per cent, having fallen from 44 per cent in 1983. In England that proportion has declined from 86 per cent in 1983 to 58 per cent last year. Wiseman's turnover grew by 44 per cent between 1991 and 1993, when it reached Pounds 46m. Pre-tax profits in 1993 were Pounds 3.3m. Turnover for the year to March 31 1994 is expected to be about Pounds 60m and pre-tax profits to be about Pounds 4.5m. Last year the chairman and his brother were paid Pounds 885,000 in salary and bonuses, making them among the best paid directors in Scotland. But the way they are remunerated will change as the company is restructured for flotation.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR LEADER;  </P> <P> REFUSING A HONDA MADE AUTO WORKER PAM RICHARDS A UNION HERO  </P> <P> It's been a month since Pam Richards turned down a Japanese car on an Ohio  lottery TV show because the car wasn't union-made, and still the adulation  continues. Talk about twin peaks. She's not only the heroine of American  organized labor, she's the darling of the American auto industry.  </P> <P> She's been given two new cars and a third is on the way. She's done more than  100 radio, television and newspaper interviews. Her phone answering machine and  mailbox have been jammed with hundreds of chunks of poignancy. People send her  union caps, lapel pins, pictures of their unionized factories, $5 bills with  notes urging her to have lunch on their tab. All that's left is for Johnny  Paycheck to write and record "Take This Car and Shove It."  </P> <P> Not bad for a $13.86-an-hour Chrysler steering column assemblywoman from  Risingsun, Ohio, a tiny working-class community 30 miles south of Toledo.  </P> <P> "I've made out like a bandit," Richards said with a laugh.  </P> <P> All because on Aug. 3, when the master of ceremonies for "Cash Explosion Double  Play" informed her that she'd landed on the "bonus square," entitling her to a  $17,600 Honda Accord, Richards said:  </P> <P> "I don't want that Honda. I'm union."  </P> <P> In the withering ranks of organized labor, so often on the defensive and so  desperate for heroes, what Pam Richards did is being compared to Rosa Parks'  refusal to take a back seat on a segregated bus or Ed Murrow's courage in  standing up to Sen. Joe McCarthy.  </P> <P> She put herself on the line, her compatriots say admiringly. Symbolically, she  stood up to the Japanese auto makers, who have eaten away at domestic car  manufacturers' dominance and have kept prices low in part by fighting off  unionization. The car Richards turned down was built at Honda's Marysville,  Ohio, plant, where organizing drives by her union, the United Auto Workers,  have failed.  </P> <P> Unwittingly, the producers of the television show gave even greater voice to  Richards' message.  </P> <P> They censored it.  </P> <P> Explaining that they did not wish to offend Honda, the producers edited out her  reason for declining the car. On the tape, aired the next night, Richards'  mouth moved but there was no sound. Then the announcer informed the audience  she would take a $1,000 cash prize instead.  </P> <P> A Toledo newspaper broke the story two days later, and a few days after that,  the whole world seemed to land at Richards' doorstep.  </P> <P> "I thought that it would last, you know, maybe a couple of days," she said. "It  hasn't. It's been going like crazy."  </P> <P> Richards has become so celebrated that last week she effortlessly bridged the  chasm between her union and the Big Three auto makers -- General Motors, Ford  and Chrysler -- which are in the midst of tense negotiations on a new  three-year contract covering 450,000 auto workers.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, less than three weeks before the current contract was due to  expire, UAW leaders announced they were designating GM as their first target in  contract negotiations. The UAW said it would demand unprecedented "job  security" guarantees from GM, which has closed five plants in the last three  years, laying off tens of thousands of workers. Industry analysts warned that  GM, having lost much of its market share to the Japanese, was in no position to  be generous.  </P> <P> That morning, union leaders from Toledo brought Richards to Detroit, where  presidents of scores of UAW locals were being briefed on negotiating strategy.  The presidents gave her a standing ovation.  </P> <P> Later that day, she was taken to Chrysler headquarters in the Detroit suburb of  Highland Park, where executives presented her with a new Plymouth.  </P> <P> Heck, this was becoming old hat.  </P> <P> It all began the day after the lottery program aired throughout Ohio.  </P> <P> Richards went to work at Toledo Precision Machining, a Chrysler subsidiary,  where she has worked for more than half of her 39 years. She was working a  Sunday overtime shift. Everybody wanted to know why she'd been edited. When she  told her co-workers, they were outraged. The workers told supervisors. The  supervisors put congratulations on the factory marquee the next morning.  </P> <P> A few days later in Washington, Tom Donahue, the AFL-CIO's secretary-treasurer  and one of the most fiery speech writers in the ranks of labor, read a  newspaper article about Richards.  </P> <P> Suddenly, "this building just went ga-ga," said AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty.  The AFL-CIO, a federation of 90 unions with 14 million members, decided it  would give Richards a car of her choice. Representatives called her. She didn't  think they were serious. They called back. OK, she said, I'll take a red Dodge  Dakota truck to replace the old truck her husband, a Chrysler supervisor,  drives. Fine, they said, we'll fly you to Washington this week.  </P> <P> Before she could get there, a man called from Huntington, West Virginia.  </P> <P> "He says, 'Hi, don't hang up,' " Richards recalled, laughing. "He says, 'This  isn't a prank. This is Frank Horney. Now, don't hang up.' I said, 'Surrrre.' He  says he owns a Chrysler dealership and wants to give me an Acclaim to drive for  a year. I told my husband. He said, 'Hang up.' But he kept calling back.  Finally, he says, 'I've decided not to give you Acclaim.' I thought it was a  joke. He says, 'I'm going to give you a Chrysler Imperial (a $28,000 car) for  your loyalty."  </P> <P> It was no joke. Frank Horney does exist. He flew Richards and a daughter to  West Virginia. They stayed at the home of Horney's vice president and drove  back to Ohio in the dusty-rose Imperial, stopping at pay phones along the way  to check messages and call back the various radio stations begging for  interviews.  </P> <P> As soon as they returned to Ohio, Richards flew to Washington to receive the  Dodge Dakota -- technically, to pose with a model of a truck that is still on  order. Richards held a press conference with AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland.  She had so many TV interview requests that labor leaders asked her to stay a  second day. She said she couldn't; she hadn't brought any clothes. The labor  federation took her out to buy a dress stitched in a union shop.  </P> <P> "I didn't intend to insult Honda," she told one television interviewer. "I'm  union. I buy what I build."  </P> <P> Didn't she think her union was using her? one TV reporter asked.  </P> <P> "I am the union," she said.  </P> <P> Richards is pure rank-and-file. She's never been an officer of her UAW local.  She's known her husband, Mike Richards, from childhood, but they went on to  marry other people. Both subsequently had two children, both got divorced and  six years ago they got married to each other.  </P> <P> She has a good-natured appreciation of her sudden role.  </P> <P> "I'm glad for it. I'm really proud of it. People need to know. I like to buy  union, or buy American. This is how I feel about it. I feel that the union has  given me a lot through the years. I was laid off five years, and my union got  four years and some odd months of that credited to me for seniority. Without  the union, I wouldn't have the wages I do, or the health benefits."  </P> <P> Ask her about the nerves she has touched -- why the television producers felt  compelled to bleep out her declaration of union solidarity, why her union  brothers and sisters regard her with such admiration -- and she's pressed to  put it into words.  </P> <P> "I keep wondering about that," she said. "They (the producers) stepped on a lot  of people's toes."  </P> <P> The unspoken explanation is that Pam Richards fell into a clash of two  cultures, the culture of unionism and the culture that regards unions as passe.  Neither side talks much to each other anymore.  </P> <P> The proportion of Americans who are union members has shrunk so drastically --  now about 16% of the work force -- that the word union is often viewed with the  disdain reserved for a cult.  </P> <P> Many Americans regard organized labor as a campaign of greed, an entrenched  special interest trying to get more. Many union members, meanwhile, have come  to view themselves as defenders of a diminishing breed, the  non-college-educated American middle class, the people who have managed to work  their way up to a $13.86-an-hour job with only a high school diploma. Japanese  competition -- leaner, more efficient -- has encouraged American employers to  hold hourly wages below the pace of inflation, to cut the size of their staffs  and contract work to cheaper non-union or part-time workers. Unions, their  power eroding, have been so busy backpedaling that the notion of fighting these  trends has almost been lost.  </P> <P> Into this breach walked Richards.  </P> <P> "She stole our hearts," said Lloyd Mahaffey, assistant director of a UAW  regional office in northwest Ohio, who jokes that he wants to become Richards'  agent. "What she did had so much impact because it came from an ordinary union  member, not a labor leader. The feeling has been that somebody had to speak  up."  </P> <P> On Friday, Richards was a guest in Chicago's Labor Day parade. Today, she'll be  the toast of Toledo's parade. When the phone rings, she and her husband joke  that it's Johnny Carson. She has yet to go back to work. She's been on unpaid  leave since the uproar began. The day she held a press conference in Washington  with AFL-CIO president Kirkland, somebody asked her just when she planned on  getting back to the plant.  </P> <P> Kirkland, a smooth, avuncular man whose polish defies the public stereotype of  a labor leader, leaned forward.  </P> <P> "Her job will be there for her," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTTOLA AND MUSIC  </P> <P> Minor quibbles with your article on Tommy Mottola:  </P> <P>  -- He sang a line in the song titled "Gino (the Manager)" on the Hall and  Oates album called "Daryl Hall and John Oates."  </P> <P> (The jacket insert includes the line, "And introducing Tommy Mottola as 'Little  Gino.' ")  </P> <P>  -- Hilburn's analysis of "Cherchez la Femme" is all wrong: Tommy is "alone, no  woman and no home" at the end of the first verse, and the boyfriend of Miggie  Bonija is the one working at two bars on Eighth Avenue in the second verse.  </P> <P> I sure hope the rest of the article was accurate.  </P> <P> CARLO PANNO  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

Early elections at the  time being "would hinder Romania's political and economic  functioning," opined Adrian Nastase.    The PSDR leader said also that the PSDR could reasonably  consider the opportunity of local elections as much as certain  political forces were asking for general elections. By the time  of the local elections of February 1992, the PSDR had not been  formed yet, reminded Adrian Nastase. As the local authorities  are the ones to administer the general elections, the ruling  party would have no degree of involvement in the territory in  case of early parliamentary elections, said Nastase. The PSDR  would therefore assign a higher priority to early local  elections, ahead of general elections.    The PSDR leader reminded also that the recent polls  confirmed  that the PSDR had maintained its popularity with the electorate  as revealed by the past parliamentary elections of September  1992, some 28 percent.</p>

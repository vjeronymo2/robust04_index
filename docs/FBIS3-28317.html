Yakovlev made the remarks in a meeting with Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Yakovlev also told Hata that pessimistic views abroad about  Russia's situation following December 12 parliamentary elections  are not true, the officials said.    Hata told Yakovlev that Japan is closely watching  developments around Russia's reforms, which he hopes will  succeed, they said.    Yakovlev was here to attend a trilateral meeting of  academics, government officials and military brass from Japan,  Russia and the U.S., which ended Wednesday.    Earlier in the day, Hata met participants -- Deputy Foreign  Minister Georgiy Mamedov, Gen. Andrey Nikolayev, head of the  Russian Federal Border Service and Commander-in-Chief of the  Border Forces and Col. Gen. Vladimir Zhuberenko, deputy chief of  Joint Staff of the Armed Forces.    Mamedov told Hata that the two-day gathering allowed the two  nations to confirm common interests on broad international  problems, the officials said.    He was also quoted as saying that President Boris Yeltsin's  visit to Japan last September and the recent meeting boosted  close dialogue and deepened bilateral ties.    Mamedov welcomed Hata's visit to Russia, and Hata replied he  wants to visit after studying results of bilateral working-level  talks on a territorial dispute later this month in Moscow, they  said.</p>

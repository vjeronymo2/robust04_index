			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Germans and Swiss in pitch for WTO Switzerland and Germany, the two contenders to host the new World Trade Organisation, set out their respective stalls for Geneva and Bonn yesterday with a tempting array of financial inducements, benefits and privileges for the organisation and its staff. Members of the preparatory committee of the WTO, which is scheduled to take over from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on January 1 1995, agreed yesterday to aim for a consensus decision by July 15. Geneva, now home to Gatt and several United Nations agencies, remains the clear favourite. But the possibility of losing the WTO to Bonn, with the risk that this could start an exodus of international organisations from Geneva, has goaded the Swiss government into unprecedented generosity. Germany, which is moving the seat of government to Berlin at the end of the decade, is meanwhile mounting an aggressive campaign to attract international organisations who could fill empty government offices and provide substitute jobs and incomes. If the WTO were to choose Bonn, others might follow. Both offers include splendid rent-free accommodation (in Bonn the federal parliament buildings from 1998, in Geneva Gatt's lakeside headquarters) and conference facilities. Bonn is offering to meet removal costs and installation expenses, but Geneva is offering a building to house the diplomatic missions of least-developed countries, which would greatly reduce the costs to them of WTO and UN representation. Geneva also has the advantage of a concentration of international organisations, including some with which the WTO will need to work closely such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the UN Conference on Trade and Development, the UN Environment Programme and other environmental groups.</p>

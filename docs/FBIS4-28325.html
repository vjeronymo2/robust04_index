			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 8 KYODO -- North Korea has virtually  finished removing fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, defying  demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to stop  refueling, an IAEA spokesman said Wednesday [8 June].    IAEA inspectors on the spot have confirmed the situation,  the  spokesman said.    The IAEA submitted a report last week to the United Nations  Security Council saying Pyongyang has made it impossible to  determine whether plutonium has been secretly taken from the  fuel rods to manufacture nuclear weapons.    An IAEA Board of Governors regular meeting now in session in  Vienna is expected to resume debate as early as Thursday, and is  likely to demand that North Korea accept inspections of its two  undeclared nuclear facilities as a possible alternative means of  judging if it has been developing nuclear arms.    The undeclared sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex 90  kilometers north of Pyongyang are suspected of being secretly  used to develop nuclear arms.    North Korea has rejected the IAEA's demands to stop removing  fuel rods from the 5-megawatt reactor, also in Yongbyon. The  nuclear watchdog said removal would spoil chances to determine  if plutonium has been diverted for nuclear weapons.    IAEA Director General Hans Blix said at the IAEA Board of  Governors meeting Tuesday that it is now impossible for the U.N.  agency to know whether North Korea is developing nuclear arms.    Blix also said inspections of two unreported sites suspected  as nuclear waste facilities are now "even more important" and  urged Pyongyang to cooperate.    Yun Ho-chin, North Korean delegate to the IAEA in Vienna,  said Tuesday that North Korea will "never" allow special  international inspections of the undeclared nuclear facilities,  adding that the organization can carry out satisfactory  inspections by checking the removed fuel rods.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> HOUSING PROPOSAL TO GO TO COUNCIL  </P> <P> After weathering four drawn-out hearings by the Planning Commission, a massive  new housing development proposed by the Irvine Co. finally goes to the City  Council next week.  </P> <P> If approved, the Westpark II development would add 3,626 homes to the existing  Westpark village, increasing the city's population by about 7,250 residents.  That would be the equivalent of about 7%, and to accommodate such a growth  spurt, the development would include two elementary schools, five parks and two  child-care centers.  </P> <P> The project, which would be built by the Irvine Co., cleared an important  hurdle Thursday night, when it won approval from the Planning Commission after  a series of public hearings. That sent the measure to the council, but final  action is not expected soon because of the complexity and size of the project.  </P> <P> A variety of issues have dogged the proposal from the beginning, and the  Planning Commission on Thursday addressed the question of how much housing  should be reserved for low-income families.  </P> <P> City planners had suggested that commissioners require at least 5% of the units  in Westpark II to be affordable to families earning half the median county  income or less, with another 5% built if the city provided the financing.  </P> <P> But Commissioner Lowell S. Johnson proposed eliminating the 5% requirement, a  move the commission approved by a 3-2 vote. Under Johnson's recommendation,  which must be reviewed by the City Council, the Irvine Co. would have to make  10% of the units affordable to low-income buyers, but only if the city provides  financing.  </P> <P> Commissioners Effat Mansour and Kate Clark, who have argued that the  requirement is needed if the city hopes to increase its low-income housing  supply, voted against Johnson's change.  </P> <P> Requiring low-income housing without providing the financing would only  increase the price of all homes in Westpark II, Johnson said. The Irvine Co.  would have to subsidize the lower-income units by raising prices on the rest of  the homes, he said.  </P> <P> "Saddling future residents with a large bill to accommodate affordable housing  is not fair or equitable in my eyes," Johnson said.  </P> <P> A fairer way of providing low-income housing would be to sell municipal bonds,  spreading the cost to all city residents instead of concentrating it on new  homeowners, he said.  </P> <P> Besides low-income housing, commissioners also have questioned whether there  might be health hazards created by 220,000-volt electrical power lines along  Harvard Avenue. The board also raised concerns about noise from Marine  helicopters flying over the area.  </P> <P> In both cases, the city and Irvine Co. agreed to compromises that they say will  protect residents while still letting the development proceed.

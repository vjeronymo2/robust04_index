			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Kravchuk confident of nuclear accord President Leonid Kravchuk claimed last night that an agreement had been reached with the US and Russia to dismantle Ukraine's nuclear arms - but Washington was more cautious, saying only that progress had been made. Mr Kravchuk told reporters: 'We have already agreed with the US and Russia that there will be a tripartite agreement on compensation, (security) guarantees, technical and scientific aid.' He said he and US Vice President Al Gore discussed the agreement during a brief meeting in Budapest on Saturday. But the Ukrainian leader did not say when such an agreement would be signed. A Ukrainian government official said at the weekend there was preliminary agreement with Russia and the US on the idea of compensation for Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. Mr Kravchuk's reference to security guarantees and dismantlement aid went much further. The Ukrainian parliament, during its ratification of the Start-1 nuclear arms reduction treaty last month, put three main conditions on relinquishing all its 176 long-range missiles and 37 strategic bombers: uranium compensation, dismantlement aid and security guarantees. Parliament has not retreated from its conditions and at a session yesterday it questioned the government's decision to take 17 nuclear missiles off military alert without parliament's approval. On Monday Ukraine announced that 20 of its 46 modern SS-24 missiles would be deactivated by year's end. The rest could be taken off military alert by the end of 1994. Ten of Ukraine's 130 SS-19s have already been dismantled. Officials in Washington said that although significant progress had been made in the talks between Ukraine, Russia and the US in recent days, Mr Kravchuk's comments last night represented a wish list rather than an agreement. Mr Strobe Talbott, the State Department's special adviser on the former Soviet Union, said that he was 'somewhat encouraged,' but that the talks so far could not be described as reaching a final agreement. 'The two sides are moving closer together,' he said. Ukraine has told Russian and US envoys that it wants a formal document spelling out the compensation and security guarantees it will get in exchange for giving up the nuclear weapons on its territory, but Russia would like a less formal understanding. While Russia believes its own security guarantee should be enough for Ukraine, the Kiev government has asked the western nuclear powers for a commitment, since it is reluctant to accept a guarantee from the nation it views as the greatest threat to its security. But the US is unlikely to agree to anything as binding as a treaty commitment to defend Ukraine in the event of attack. US officials have held out the carrot of financial aid, but they argue that Ukraine must first dismantle the missiles on its territory, as it has already promised to do, before such aid can start to flow. President Bill Clinton phoned Mr Kravchuk last month to express disappointment that the Ukrainian parliament voted for only partial implementation of Start-1. But US officials were more encouraged this week by Mr Kravchuk's decision to deactivate some of Ukraine's SS-24s. Double trouble, Page 11</p>

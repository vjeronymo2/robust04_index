Bank of Zambia Governor (Thomas  Mulansha) says the measure will come into effect tomorrow. The  Bureau will not be expected to sell foreign exchange to a person  unless his passport bears an immigration reentry stamp and the  last purchase of hard currency. Mr. (Mulansha) said the Bureau  will be expected to verify each passport to ensure a person is  illegible to buy foreign exchange.    Presently, Zambian residents are free to buy up to $4,000 of  which $2,000 can be used for [words indistinct] and the other  $2,000 for purchase of goods.</p>

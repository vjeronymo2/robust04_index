I believe there is no reason why any good  theater should be bottle-necked in New York and Hollywood. I believe in a  dramatic map for America that will include great native playhouses in every  town large enough to want one."  </P> <P>  -- Margo Jones, 1944, quoted in Helen Sheehy's "Margo: The Life and Theatre of  Margo Jones"  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: Our eggs are in several baskets Sir, You carried a small news story, 'Investment performance' (April 29) which regurgitated performance details from institutional managers gathered by Equity International. It should come as no surprise to a newspaper of your standing that institutional managers did not out-perform the FT Actuaries All Share Index last year. The principal reason for this was that we were not investing to beat that index. Pension funds are correctly and wisely broadly diversified with investment in many parts of the world. Over the long term, this is expected to reduce risk and enhance performance. We do not put all our eggs in one basket and I am most surprised that you then expect us to beat that basket. Colin Day, Henderson Pension Fund Management, 3 Finsbury Avenue, London EC2M 2PA</p>

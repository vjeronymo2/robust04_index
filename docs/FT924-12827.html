			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major's medium term MR JOHN Major faces the most critical week of his political career. Having lost overboard his foreign and economic policies in the ERM storms of mid-September, his plans to close over half of Britain's coal industry have brought something close to mutiny. This has perhaps less to do with the plans themselves than with the fact that they come at the depth of a recession to which people can see no end. He now faces calls not only to remove his chancellor, but also his trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, whose department is responsible for coal. Something close to hysteria has swept through the conservative shires, and normally loyal supporters are openly querying his ability to lead the government. Amid this clamour, it is worth recalling the judgments the Conservative party and the country made in electing Mr Major to Number 10 Downing Street only six months ago. To his party, Mr Major promised to heal as best he could the schism over Europe, to scrap his predecessor's disastrous poll tax and to continue the medium-term quest for a low-inflation base for a competitive British economy. To the country, he offered a less divisive tone than Mrs Thatcher, a renewed emphasis upon the quality of public services and a low-tax alternative to a Labour party which was still not trusted. Above all, Mr Major acquired a striking personal popularity, based upon three aspects of his 'honest John' character: an instinctive aversion to the more rabid ideologies; a doggedness to see through calmly a difficult task; and a low-key, plain-speaking manner which proclaimed integrity and realism. These qualities were especially admired during the Gulf war and the election campaign itself. It was clear from Mr Major's press conference in Birmingham after the European summit last Friday that this is the style of leadership he intends to continue to offer. Complex task He deeply regrets the pain caused by the pit closures, but there is no medium term future in piling up millions of tons of un-saleable coal at the pithead. The prospects for the economy remain difficult, especially given deteriorating conditions in Germany and Japan, but there is no medium- term future in attempting to dash for growth, only to reel backwards into stagflation. On the EC, Britain must remain an important member while using its influence to ensure that the Community neither recklessly pursues political and economic ambitions beyond its means, nor turns its back on the rest of the world. When it comes to the coal industry, Mr Major is right to assert that the British economy cannot afford, medium term, to carry the costs of uncompetitive energy. If Germany thinks it can, then let it continue doing so as long as EC law permits. It is, of course, true that the pressures on coal have been intensified by a mishandled privatisation which created an inadequately competitive electricity industry. But it is also worth remembering that it has taken all the privatised utilities and their regulators a period of years to feel their way towards more efficient arrangements, a complex task which is far from complete; in British Telecom alone, this process has cost 80,000 jobs since privatisation. Coal miners have a unique place in the affections of the British people and many of their communities are uniquely exposed to a single industry. This is why there is such widespread anger at the government's failure to justify more persuasively the speed of the cuts, which may even now have to be spread over a longer period. But even emotion fanned by the moral indignation of bishops cannot alter the laws of economics. Sense of direction The question is: can Mr Major meet the challenges he faces? There is no doubt that his credibility has been severely damaged. The manner of Britain's exit from the ERM and the memory of his chancellor's promises of imminent economic recovery have combined with the fear or experience of unemployment to make the British people doubt that Mr Major can deliver. Partly this is a question of political skills and the prime minister needs, as he did during the election campaign, to take more of the burden of persuasion upon himself. But the central question is whether Mr Major has what it takes to lead; to weld a fractious party which has been so long in power into an effective force with a clear idea of what it wants for the future; to put an end to the feeling that his government is merely responding to events; to demonstrate that he has a sense of direction . To this end, he must now recognise that having lost the credibility of the ERM, the country requires a medium-term strategy for the economy in which it can learn to believe. So far, his unwillingness even to acknowledge the debate about institutional reform of the mechanisms for setting monetary policy suggests that he is not truly engaged in the thinking needed to support his stated political and economic objectives. Such a strategy also implies a clear view on the balance between fiscal and monetary policy, involving lower interest rates and, if necessary, higher taxes. That we are still so far from a credible economic package of this kind is Mr Major's most grievous failure in the last month. If he can show that he is capable of filling this vacuum firmly and swiftly, he will deserve support. His backbenchers should then recognise that the accomplishment of this task is more important than anything else.</p>

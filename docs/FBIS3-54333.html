As a result, overseas assets by the 22 Arab League members  have far surpassed their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at a time  when they badly need funds to finance reforms, said Usamah  al-Faqih, chairman of the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF).    By the end of 1992, Arab investments abroad, mainly in Japan  and the West, exceeded 650 billion dollars while the combined  Arab GDP stood at a round 450 billion dollars, he told a  conference on Arab economic reforms here.    "Despite economic achievements made in some Arab countries  due to the reform programmes and efforts being exerted in  others, our stock markets still need a comprehensive structural  development," he said.    "There is a general weakness in the legislative and  organisational structures in the markets as well as the absence  of secondary exchanges, market-makers and qualified personnel in  the financial, auditing and legal functions associated with the  stock markets."    Only 10 of the Arab states have official exchanges but  activity in such markets have remained relatively small due to  political instability in some members and lack of incentives and  information about trading institutions.    In the oil-rich Gulf, turnover in most of the stock markets  is among the lowest in the region due to high government  ownership, a tendency for long-term investment and restriction  of dealing to nationals.    Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco and other Arab nations have  embarked on reforms to heal their economic problems, mainly  large foreign debt, slow growth, low investment, unemployment  and deficits in their budgets and balance of payments. The four  countries owe more than 70 percent of the total Arab debt of  over 150 billion dollars.    The problems have persisted though Arab states have received  more than 370 billion dollars in loans and other forms of cash  over the past two decades. Experts blamed instability,  mismanagment of funds and state control.    Al-Faqih, a Saudi, said his Abu Dhabi-based Fund was setting  up a data base to link Arab stock markets, where around 1,100  banks and companies trade their shares, with a market  capitalisation of 35 billion dollars in 1992.    He said the base, which would provide information on trading  institutions in all member states, would start operation this  year. He urged Arabs to step up reforms and those without stock  markets to open floors.    "Despite reforms by some members, chronic deficits in the  internal and external balances remain an obstacle for growth,  and even stability, in Arab economies, with the latest figures  showing the deficit in Arab budgets reaching around 15 percent  of the GDP," he said.    "This underscores the need for redressing financial policies  and developing stock markets in the Arab world in order to  create a framework capable of attracting national and foreign  investment and stimulating the private sector to play a greater  role in economic and social development."    United Arab Emirates (UAE) minister of state for financial  and industrial Affairs Ahmad al-Tayir, who opened the two-day  conference, said financial policies in the region needed to be  improved to ensure the success of reforms and cushion foreign  influences on the domestic economy.    "Arab states, including those in the Gulf, should give  financial instruments a greater role in economic growth and in  reducing the impact of foreign factors like the decline in  demand for their exports," he said. "This could not be done  without upgrading their stock markets."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- A China Southern Airlines  Boeing 737 passenger jet with 131 people on board was hijacked  by a male passenger to Taiwan on Monday [6 June], landing safely  at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport at 7:55 p.m.    The airliner had been en route from Fuzhou to Guangzhou.    It was the 12th mainland airliner hijacked to Taiwan since  April 1993.    The incident came on the heels of an airline crash in  Mainland China on Monday that took 159 lives, including that of  a Taiwan tourist.    The International Airline Passengers Association earlier  this  year rated Mainland China as one of the most dangerous countries  to fly following five crashes which killed 76 people and the  frequent air piracy incidents.</p>

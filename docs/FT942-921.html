			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Observer: Diouf's manna Almost six months after taking over as director-general of the UN's largest specialised agency, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation, Jacques Diouf has just met the press. He announced a shake-up for the FAO, with plans to winkle out 200 of the FAO's 1,500 Rome-based experts from their dolce vita, shifting them to the capitals - and, horror of horrors, perhaps even the fields - of Africa and Asia. Could Diouf be implying some criticism of his long-standing predecessor, Edouard Saouma? asked one diffident hack. Hardly: 'I am not here to make judgments,' replied Diouf. Not even about the sense of keeping the remaining 1,300 experts beavering away in Rome?</p>

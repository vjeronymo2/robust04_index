			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, May 6 (XINHUA) -- China's rapid economic  development and political and social stability have attracted  strong foreign investment.    A recent national working meeting on the registration of  foreign-funded enterprises here disclosed that foreign  investment is expanding from the coastal areas to interior parts  of the country.    A survey shows that China had 25,389 registered  foreign-funded enterprises in 1990. Included were only 333,  accounting for 1.3 percent of the total, in central and western  parts of the country, and the Tibet Autonomous Region was a  virtual blank check regarding foreign investment.    By the end of 1993, however, the number of foreign-funded  enterprises in central and western China had climbed to 4,913,  accounting for 2.9 percent of the total.    More and more large foreign-funded projects were begun in  China starting from 1991.    At present, China has more than 7,000 large projects each  with an investment of at least 10 million U.S. dollars.  Included are about 4,000 set up last year.    These projects are mainly involved in the fields of real  estate development, communications, telecommunications, basic  industries and high-tech projects.    According to the meeting, the proportion of enterprises  solely funded by foreign business people in the foreign-funded  sector has risen remarkably since 1991.    By the end of last year, China had 20,047 registered  enterprises solely funded by foreign business people, accounting  for 24 percent of all foreign-funded enterprises registered on  the Chinese mainland.    According to the meeting, foreign business people have  widened their business scope over the past 14 years from hotels,  electronics, building materials, machinery, textiles, light and  textile industries, medicine and agriculture to energy  development, transportation and telecommunications, basic  industries, science and education, the arts, banking and  insurance.    In the past three years, the volume of foreign investment in  service industries has increased remarkably.    Most of the foreign-funded projects are productive  industrial  enterprises.    A survey shows that foreign-funded enterprises had an  average  investment of 2.28 million U.S. dollars each by the end of 1993,  and 92 percent of the 167,000 enterprises had an investment of  less than five million U.S. dollars each.    To better draw foreign investment, the Chinese Government  has  approved the establishment of 54 economic and technology  development zones and 13 bonded parks. Recently it permitted  Singapore to set up an eight-square-kilometer science and  industry park in Suzhou, an economically-booming city in east  China's Jiangsu Province.    While improving investment conditions, the Chinese  Government  has paid attention to the formulation of laws and regulations,  thus enhancing the confidence of foreign business people in  making investment in the country.    In addition, China's abundant labor and technical forces,  the  improved industrial foundation and the vast domestic market have  drawn the interest of foreign business people.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEADERS TAKE STEPS TOWARD MORE UNITY FOR COUNTY  </P> <P> How can Orange County effectively build a major road running through several  cities when at each border the project is completely re-evaluated by a  different set of planners and politicians?  </P> <P> And how can Orange County's mayors and supervisors prevent state and federal  officials from deciding what developments should or should not be built, all in  the name of air quality?  </P> <P> And what about such issues as fireworks, which have been banned by most  municipalities in Orange County even though the effect is significantly  compromised because several cities still allow sales?  </P> <P> These are some of the mega-issues shared by every local government in Orange  County -- all 28 cities, their more than 200 elected officials and the five  county supervisors. Orange County is a patchwork of municipal fiefdoms, but  many of its problems saturate the area without regard to municipal borders.  </P> <P> To address these issues, city and county leaders are talking, in a surprisingly  quiet way, about an unprecedented move that could rewrite the political science  books on local government and represent a historic step toward Orange County's  future.  </P> <P> The officials have tentatively agreed to create a new organization -- called  the Orange County Assn. of Governments -- that would bridge jurisdictions  inside the county and present a stronger, more united Orange County voice when  dealing with Sacramento and Washington. The idea has a two-fold purpose, one  internal and one external.  </P> <P> The association -- which would be led by a board of 10 mayors and the five  supervisors -- has already been approved by the county's League of Cities. The  supervisors endorsed the idea last week. The bills that would create the  association, now pending in the Legislature, were authored by state Sen. Marian  Bergeson, R-Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "More and more we are recognizing that Orange County is a very influential and  political power in the state, and we have a need to do good planning that . . .  doesn't treat Orange County as a suburb of Los Angeles," said Ronald Bates, a  vice president of the Orange County League of Cities and a councilman in Los  Alamitos. "The real benefit . . . is the potential for coordinated countywide  planning."  </P> <P> Norm Grossman, a slow-growth leader and co-author of the county's growth  management plan, said: "In my mind, it's a kind of new form of government, and  it is an experiment. I think it's clear that the area is developing quickly and  it is too large to worry about city by city."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Solve Biggest Problems  </P> <P> Throughout the county, politicians and planners have seen how the Assn. of  Governments could help solve some of their biggest problems. But the idea is  clearly still in an embryonic stage, and some elected officials worry that they  may be creating a political Frankenstein.  </P> <P> The most sensitive question is whether individual cities or the county might  lose some sovereignty to the new body. And at the county level, there are  concerns that someday this organization could even replace the county  government.  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said at a recent meeting -- only  half in jest -- "This is an emotional decision because we might be voting  ourselves out of a job." Later, he said he had overstated his true opinion.  </P> <P> But Grossman said, "I don't think there's any question it would" replace the  county government. "The Board of Supervisors will be out of the land-use  business in 10 years. With the (association) taking over transportation, that  doesn't leave the board with much to do. I think the supervisors have good  reason to be concerned."  </P> <P> With the supervisors in a minority on the board of directors, for example,  would the association be able to overrule a county government decision? Or  could it even influence a supervisors vote by applying political pressure?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Giving Some Concern  </P> <P> "I think that's what's giving some of us concern," said Supervisor Roger R.  Stanton, who voted for the concept last week. "I'm not sure what the final form  should be, but I'm pretty convinced we need something that represents our  region."  </P> <P> Asked if he was concerned about the association's powers, Supervisor Don R.  Roth, who voted for the idea last week, said: "Sure I'm concerned about it. I  think we are trying to improve the efficiency, but we don't want to throw the  baby out with the bathwater."  </P> <P> Proponents of the idea have emphasized that the organization will not have any  statutory powers that could usurp the authority of a city or county government.  They describe it as a forum for countywide discussions on important issues and  an organization that could provide research, statistical information and  planning for the county.  </P> <P> It could issue recommendations about how regional problems should be solved,  they say, which local governments could then use as a reference in making their  own decisions. The association could also play a key role in dealing with  several districts, agencies and regional authorities.  </P> <P> The whole idea began with a move by the county to combine the Orange County  Transit District -- which operates county buses -- and the Orange County  Transportation Commission -- which plans new roads and mass transit solutions  to traffic problems. The combination, it seemed, would make a more streamlined  and effective agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Involved in Feud  </P> <P> At the same time, the county has been in a feud with the Southern California  Assn. of Governments -- a regional agency that covers a six-county area -- over  its inattention to Orange County and its allegedly inaccurate statistical  information about the area.  </P> <P> Bergeson has also introduced a bill that would allow Orange County to gather  its own demographic research that would then be turned over to SCAG for  inclusion in a regional plan. The proposal for an Orange County Assn. of  Governments was born when the transportation merger and the SCAG proposal were  combined.  </P> <P> Under Bergeson's legislation, the Orange County Transportation Commission would  be abolished and a subcommittee of the Assn. of Governments would operate the  OCTD bus system.  </P> <P> In addition, the legislation says the new Assn. of Governments "would assist  the cities and the county of Orange in addressing urban problems of a  multi-jurisdictional nature such as -- but not limited to -- transportation,  air quality, water, housing, waste management and growth management."  </P> <P> Another significant role for the new association could be in distributing  special tax money.  </P> <P> The county transportation commission is planning to ask voters for a half-cent  sales tax to pay for more than $3 billion in road and highway improvements  throughout the county over the next 20 years. If the measure is approved, the  new association might be the organization to distribute the money to local  governments throughout the county. Officials are discussing the possibility of  using local agencies to distribute gas tax money, a duty that the association  could perform.  </P> <P> Proponents said the association is not intended to have the power to coerce  through any powers to distribute taxes. But, realistically, Grossman said, "if  a city wants to go it alone, it can pay for it alone. The reality is, though,  that it won't be able to."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lever Against Interference  </P> <P> Tony Carstens, associate county administrative officer for monitoring and  forecasting services, said, however, that the most important use of the  government association would not be a force against Orange County cities, but  as a lever against interference from outside governments.  </P> <P> Carstens said that under the proposed Air Quality Management Plan, for example,  it is possible that state or federal officials could come into Orange County  and prevent commercial or residential developments that they consider a threat  to regional air quality.  </P> <P> Carstens said an organization of Orange County governments could adopt a  countywide development plan that would satisfy the air quality concerns,  keeping the decision-making closer to home.  </P> <P> "I think everybody wants to have minimal authority, but what authority there  is, they want to keep it here, close to home," Carstens said. "If authority is  at risk now of being lost to the state, the (association) could head that off."  </P></p>

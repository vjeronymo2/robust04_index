			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: SHAW'S BLAND ART CAN'T LIVE UP TO OVERBLOWN INTERPRETATION  </P> <P> Somewhere between Reesey Shaw's understated art and Dave Hickey's overstated  catalogue essay lies a middle ground of eloquence, self-confidence and  appealing energy. Rarely, however, do Shaw's forms and Hickey's words meet  there.  </P> <P> "Reesey Shaw: Selected Works 1980-1990," at the Mesa College Art Gallery  through April 6, traces the evolution of the artist's style from blithe  decoration to austere formalism. "Trinity," representing the earlier phase, and  "Nature" the more recent, together mark this shift in clear, before-and-after  terms. Both are wall-mounted wood constructions, painted in encaustic, a  combination of pigment and wax fused to the painting surface while warm. In  "Nature," Shaw also uses oil paint.  </P> <P> In "Trinity" (1982), overlapping planes of cream and pale mauve form a  modest-size rectangle, a stage for three floating crescents, one each in light  blue, drab green and white. A band of light blue, speckled with green, crowns  the ensemble. Quiet to the point of blandness, "Trinity" occupies its space  with demure politeness. Its title hints at spiritual meaning, but its form  retreats shyly from any such commitment.  </P> <P> "Nature," begun the same year but completed in 1989, assumes a grander posture  and achieves a far more powerful presence. Over six feet tall, the work's three  separate but adjoining vertical bands echo the scale and rigidity of the  upright human body. Here, the title and green, white and blue bands suggest the  earthly triumvirate of land, air and water, and the fluid, relatively flat  surface of "Trinity" has given way to one more heavily textured, scraped and  melted smooth.  </P> <P> Like many sculptors in the late 1980s -- such as Mark Lere and Jene Highstein  -- Shaw, a local artist and curator, has struck a winning compromise between  the geometry of minimalism and the idiosyncrasies of organic form. Her  "Untitled Plank" (1986) and "Flat Mantis" (1986) deviate just enough from the  basic and blocky to suggest animate energy. Their surfaces, too, have been  individualized, personalized, unlike the uniformly slick skins of minimalist  sculpture.  </P> <P> In about half of Shaw's recent works, this sublimation of organic elements is  performed with grace and elegance. The others, such as the works related to  head forms, lack both the purity of their peers and the whimsical, albeit  shallow, character of their precedents. They protrude clumsily from the wall,  heavy and mute.  </P> <P> Dave Hickey, a gifted writer and critic, presents quite a different artist in  his catalogue essay, one whose work offers a profound meditation on the nature  of loss and decay, or its converse, the process of becoming. Such depth can be  found in "Nature," or perhaps in "Flower," another of the tripartite works, but  most of Shaw's wall sculpture cannot sustain such ambitious interpretation.  Ultimately, the imbalance in tone is flattering to neither subject nor author.  </P></p>

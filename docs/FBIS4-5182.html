			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sheri Prasso] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 8 (AFP) -- Australia's foreign  minister arrived here Friday expressing support for the  Cambodian government's sovereignty, as Cambodian Foreign  Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut hinted at UN Security Council  (UNSC)action against Thailand for its alleged support of the  Khmer Rouge.    Cambodia has accused Thailand on a number of occasions of  continuing to support the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in their war  against the elected Phnom Penh government. The Thai government  denies it, but acknowledges its (?military) has business links  with the guerrillas across the border in Cambodia.    "As for Thailand, my prime minister is not happy," Prince  Sirivut said at the airport while awaiting the arrival of  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans.    "If we must go to the Security Council, we will go," he  said,  without stating what kind of action, whether resolution or  sanctions, against Thailand would be appropriate.    Asked if the Cambodians would ask Evans' support for such a  move, Prince Sirivut said: "I ask everybody to support the  Cambodian Royal Government and not the Khmer Rouge."    France already indicated support for action against Thailand  during a visit last week by deputy premier Simone Veil.    Evans said he believed the Thai government was "absolutely  sincere" about its resolve "not to give aid, comfort and  support" to the Khmer Rouge, but that central control may not be  total.    "I mean, there may be some individuals who continue to play  some kind of a supporting role in the Thai business community  and some areas of the Thai military," he said. "That's  perfectly possible, because that's historically been the case,  and it's not always easy to address these issues."    He said he discussed Cambodian border issues with Thailand's  top officials during a recent visit to Bangkok, but that it was  not for Australia to interfere.    "I think it's an issue that has to be resolved bilaterally  between the two countries, and the sooner they get into a frank,  comprehensive dialogue on the issue, with all the necessary  mechanisms and strategies that go with that... the better,"  Evans said, expressing support for Cambodia's government elected  by the UN peace plan that he was instrumental in putting forward  in 1991.    Evans, due to leave Sunday, also announced a doubling of  foreign aid to Cambodia over the next four years in line with  pledges made at previous aid conferences in Tokyo.    Areas of concentration include building bridges, demining,  human rights promotion, English-language training and health.  Australia will also provide 2.5 million to three million  Australian dollars for defense cooperation, part of which will  go to Cambodia's demining coordination agency.    Evans was also scheduled to meet co-premier Prince Norodom  Ranariddh, acting head of state Chea Sim and deputy premier Sar  Kheng.    He was also scheduled to open the Australian Centre for  Education, which teaches English to Cambodians.</p>

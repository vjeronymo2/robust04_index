			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Gilt dealers looking for a tight Budget  -Government bonds At a time when children are busy compiling their wish-lists for Santa Claus, gilt market participants have drawn up their own wish-list for Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, ahead of tomorrow's UK Budget. To be sure, gilt analysts' and traders' hopes for a market-friendly Budget, containing spending cuts and a reduction in the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), are high. 'True to the gilt market's hair-shirt mentality, the feeling is: the tighter the Budget, the better,' says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. 'Most people are looking for fairly severe fiscal tightening on the tax and spending front.' On the revenue side, the market is keen to see the tax increases announced last year implemented in April. The planned measures include a cut in the tax rate for married couples' allowances and mortgage interest relief to 15 per cent from 20 per cent, and an increase in the value-added tax on household fuel and power to 17 1/2 per cent from 8 per cent. Observers also hope Mr Clarke will rule out any tax cuts before spending and government borrowing are brought further under control. Meanwhile, the combination of faster economic growth and lower inflation are likely to cause a drop in spending. This summer, official PSBR forecasts for this year and next were cut by Pounds 2bn on account of the rise in tax revenue following the economic upswing. Mr Ifty Islam, an economist at Merrill Lynch, estimates that the Treasury will be able to cut the control total (public spending excluding cyclical social security and debt interest payments) 'by at least a further Pounds 3bn this year and around Pounds 4bn in the financial year 1995 - 96 on the back of reduced assumptions on inflation'. In addition, there is widespread talk that a cut in the 'contingency reserve' - a sort of war chest to cover unforeseen expenditures - could sharply reduce government spending. The reserve has been set at Pounds 7bn for 1995-96 and at Pounds 10.5bn for the following year. Indeed, some argue that the reserve has outlived its usefulness and should be abolished altogether, sending a clear warning to government departments not to overshoot their spending limits. Mr Simon Briscoe, an analyst at SG Warburg, favours such a move: 'When you look at the record of the last few years, the extra money has rarely been needed.' Reducing or abolishing the reserve could take a large chunk out of the PSBR, which would cheer the gilt market considerably. As a result of spending cuts and rising tax revenue, the current year's PSBR forecast, which was cut this summer to Pounds 36bn from the original Pounds 38bn, is expected to be revised downward further, some say as low as Pounds 31bn. The 1995-96 PSBR forecast is expected to be lowered to around Pounds 20bn from the current Pounds 28bn estimate. Other specifically gilt-market related goodies might include an announcement of a fully-fledged market for gilt repurchase agreements, or repos, and a move to pay gilt coupons gross of withholding tax. The two are closely linked, for many say that a move to gross dividend payments would facilitate the establishment of an efficient repo market, which in turn would boost market liquidity. Gross coupon payments could also increase gilts' appeal to overseas investors. Currently, only some gilts are issued free of tax to residents abroad (Fotra); if non-residents buy non-Fotra gilts, they have to go through a time-consuming procedure of reclaiming the 25 per cent withholding tax. A move to gross coupon payment would open up the whole market, rather than just a segment of it, to overseas investors. However, any promise to establish a repo market is unlikely to be translated into immediate action. 'It would take some time - possibly up to a year - until the market was operational,' says Mr Shepperd. Any measures which will keep a lid on inflationary pressures will also be warmly welcomed. 'The government should not shoot itself in the foot by raising taxes to such an extent as to boost inflation,' warns Mr Briscoe. Amid concerns over the inflationary effect of rising petrol duties, there has been market talk that some normal increases in drinks duties may not be implemented. Although a tight Budget would favour gilts over the longer term, it may not provide much near-term support. In part, that's because much of the good news - if it materialises - has already been priced into gilts, which have put on a strong performance in recent weeks. Indeed, some warn that such a Budget could prompt a 'buy on the rumour, sell on the news' response. Moreover, the political risks attached to gilts will remain, even if - as expected - Prime Minister John Major wins today's parliamentary vote over higher contributions to the European Union. The December 7 gilt auction, which was announced on Friday afternoon, is also likely to cap any Budget-induced rally. The biggest risk, however, would be if a tight Budget this year were seen as a prelude to a loose one next year. 'If fiscal prudence is a tactical ploy to set up a pre-election windfall, rather than a genuine long-term attempt to cut borrowing, the response is at best going to be a half-hearted two cheers,' cautions Mr Shepperd.</p>

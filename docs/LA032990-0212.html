			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> WOMAN CONVICTED IN THRIFT CASE  </P> <P> A federal jury in Santa Ana today found Janet Faye McKinzie guilty of  racketeering, conspiracy and fraud in connection with the 1987 failure of North  America Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> The verdict came after a 2 1/2-month trial in U.S. District Court in which the  defense argued that McKinzie was duped into carrying out the fraud because she  was involuntarily intoxicated by drugs provided by the thrift's chairman.  </P> <P> McKinzie was a confidante of the thrift's former chairman, Dr. Duayne  Christensen, a dentist who died mysteriously in a car accident hours before  federal regulators took over the thrift. The institution's collapse cost  taxpayers more than $120 million.  </P> <P> The six-man, six-woman jury deliberated for nearly two weeks before finding  McKinzie guilty on 22 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, wire fraud, bank  fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property. McKinzie faces a  possible sentence of up to 180 years in prison.  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Co-op Bank owner considers proposals for sell-off plan The sale of part or all of the Co-operative Bank is being considered by its owner, the Co-operative Wholesale Society. SG Warburg, the investment bank, has the commission to examine selling shares in the bank to another co-operative financial institution. Since last year, contact is believed to have been made with co-operative banks in Canada, Germany, France, Belgium and Switzerland. The CWS board discussed a paper on the bank's future last week, but decided to take no short-term action. The Manchester-based bank is a small player, with only 3,500 employees and 2 per cent of the UK retail market. However, it is strong in two niches: gold cards and local government accounts. It has also attracted customers by refusing to do business with companies that it considers insensitive to environmental issues. The Co-op Bank's asset base was Pounds 3.4bn in its accounts for the year to January 8, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.8m. The CWS was founded in 1863 and set up the bank nine years later. As owner of 100 per cent of the equity, the CWS has to guarantee the bank's capital base. Returns have been poor because the bank has had to retain profits to keep its base strong. An alternative recommended in last week's board discussion paper was to transfer ownership to the Co-operative Insurance Society, although this would be unlikely to be approved by the Bank of England. The bank's chairman, Mr Tom Agar, former chief executive of the Lincoln Co-operative Retail Society, was unable to attend the meeting and Mr Terry Thomas, chief executive, does not have a seat on the CWS board, which is elected by the co-operative movement. Mr Thomas, who joined from Barclays Bank, has played a key role in the Co-op Bank's recent emergence. The CWS came close to selling 49 per cent of its equity five years ago to DG Bank of Germany. The deal depended on the Co-op Bank winning the competition for Girobank, which the government unexpectedly sold to the Alliance and Leicester Building Society.</p>

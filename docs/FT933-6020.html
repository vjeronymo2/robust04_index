			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Wreckage of ERM may signal end to era of easy profits IN THE wake of the widening of the exchange rate mechanism's bands earlier this month, European political leaders - and in particular the French - have talked of getting their own back on the speculators who sabotaged their cherished system. But the politicians may not have to wait very long before they get some revenge. Over the last year, currency dealers have made substantial profits by taking successful one-way bets on the devaluations of sterling, the Italian lira, and the Iberian currencies. But the latest ERM crisis does not appear to have been a source of unqualified joy for foreign exchange players. Unexpected exchange rate movements in the French franc and Danish krone have trimmed some of the profits of speculators who were selling these currencies. At the same time, the greater fluctuations now seen in European exchange rates have forced some speculative players to abandon long-standing techniques for making huge profits out of Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate system. In recent weeks, some dealers in London and New York have talked of how movements in European currencies have taken them by surprise and caused them to give back some of their profits. The French franc has performed far more strongly against the D-Mark than had been anticipated when the ERM bands were first widened. Instead of the immediate move down to FFr3.60 against the D-Mark that had been expected, the franc bottomed out at FFr3.5300 immediately after the ERM bands were widened. The franc has been supported by France's policy of slowly reducing interest rates, and analysts think that the French currency will soon be forced to new lows against the D-Mark. But some traders who borrowed francs and sold them near the FFr3.5300 level have closed their positions and taken a loss. A number of US investment banks have operated funds in recent years which allowed customers to use low interest rate currencies, like the US dollar, to invest in high-yielding ones like theDanish krone and Spanish peseta. These investments were bound to lead to high returns because there was little chance of a depreciation in the value of the currencies that had been purchased while they were in the narrow bands of the ERM. Using the technique of margin trading, an investment bank could enhance profits by taking positions in these currencies which were up to 10 times the size of the original sum deposited by clients. But the recent changes in the ERM, and the greater volatility in exchange rates, has made these funds far riskier to operate. Last week, Bankers Trust, the US investment bank, revealed that it was seeking a vote from investors to liquidate a fund called 'The Diversified Currency Management Fund' which had made substantial gains by investing in European currency markets. Bankers Trust said it was also seeking to change the nature of operations of another fund which had gained from differentials in interest rates. Its investment objectives were now to become more 'opportunistic'. Both funds had assets of Dollars 640m invested in them by the bank's customers. The funds were used to take leveraged positions up to 10 times that size, and could therefore have been responsible for pushing as much as Dollars 6bn through the currency market. Mr Bill Tazza, managing director at Bankers Trust, said the investment bank had been 'pro-active' in its decision, and that the widening of the ERM bands had made this interest rate play more difficult. He said the decision to change the nature of these funds had not been taken against a background of losses. 'There are quite a number of these sorts of fund in the market place,' he said, 'but the risk/reward ratio of this trade has now changed considerably'. European governments should not take the view that the crisis in the fixed exchange rate system was entirely in the interests of currency speculators. For some players in this market, the wreckage of the ERM may have signalled the end to an era of easy profits.</p>

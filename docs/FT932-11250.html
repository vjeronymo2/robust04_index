			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Sir Roy Watts found dead in Thames THE BODY of Sir Roy Watts, chairman of Thames Water, was recovered from the River Thames yesterday, nearly a week after he disappeared. As a postmortem examination began to establish the cause of death, former colleagues paid tribute to his career in the water and civil aviation industries. Mr John Bellak, chairman of Severn Trent Water, said Sir Roy had been a driving force behind the privatisation of the water industry. 'He had a major part in sparking things off, having felt that government control didn't do anyone any good,' said Mr Bellak. Scotland Yard said yesterday that a Thames barge spotted the body at 8.47am at Kings Reach, about 50 yards from Westminster Bridge. It was taken by a police boat to Poplar Mortuary where it was identified by dental records. Police said the body, which was partly decomposed, had been in the water for 'some days'. They added that they were not treating the cause of death as suspicious. Sir Roy, 67, had last been seen at 2pm on Tuesday, April 27, when his driver took him from Thames' central London offices to his Battersea flat. Thames said it believed Sir Roy had been diagnosed on April 13 as having Parkinson's Disease. His wife, speaking from the family's Oxfordshire home, said he had suspected the illness for months. Water industry colleagues added that he had nevertheless seemed depressed at the diagnosis, which was compounded by the death of his close friend and former colleague in aviation, Mr Charles Stuart, on April 6. Before joining Thames in 1983, Sir Roy was chief executive and deputy chairman of British Airways where, with Mr Stuart, he helped launch the 'shuttle' concept. Mr Mike Hoffman, Thames' chief executive, said yesterday that Sir Roy had already told the board that he would 'hang up his boots' at the company's annual general meeting in July because of his age and health worries. Thames is expected to announce a new chairman - an internal appointment - within days. An inquest opens tomorrow at Poplar coroners court. Obituary Page 9</p>

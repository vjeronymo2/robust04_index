			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rapid development for a bright idea - Andrew Bolger looks at Menvier-Swain's growth SAFETY LIGHTS are poised to go on all over Europe, thanks to rapid expansion by Menvier-Swain Group, a USM-quoted company based in Banbury, north Oxfordshire. Menvier, which also makes fire and security alarms, is the leading UK supplier of emergency lighting for commercial and industrial premises, with 30 per cent of the British market. Its latest French acquisition, Nugelec, was funded this month by a Pounds 9m rights issue, and expands the group's European network, which stretches from Denmark to Portugal. Since being floated in 1986, Menvier's market capitalisation has grown from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 82.8m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.64m on sales of Pounds 12m post-flotation, and analysts now expect the group to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 7.3m on sales of Pounds 51m in the current year to April. The success represents the fulfilment of a youthful dream by Mr Roger Fletcher, 44, the group's chief executive. While studying electronics at Southampton University in the late 1960s he became friends with an electrical engineering student, Mr Christopher Swain, whose father Charles had built up an electrical contracting business in Banbury. Mr Fletcher said: 'Like all students, Christopher and I used to sit up late at night drinking coffee and making plans. I always wanted to branch out on my own.' Instead, Mr Fletcher joined Marconi and worked for five years on defence-related electronics. His opportunity came in 1975, when the Swains approached him and said they could not obtain a decent emergency light. The Swains invested Pounds 2,000 and Mr Fletcher started working, assisted by two women, in the attic of one of the stores. Together they developed a converter enabling a florescent light to switch to battery back-up after an electricity failure - a product which gave the group eventual leadership of the UK market. In 1988, Menvier bought Blessing Electronics, a Netherlands emergency lighting group, and has since made acquisitions in France, Portugal, Denmark, Greece and Italy. Most of the deals have been relatively small, although the group's first French acquisition, Luminox, was funded by a Pounds 6.6m rights issue in 1989. Menvier turned to Europe, both because it saw limited scope to increase market share in the UK, and because the unified European market seemed to offer exceptional opportunities. EC directives require all new buildings to be fitted with adequate emergency lighting from this year, and all existing buildings in northern Europe will need to be upgraded before the end of 1995, with Greece and Portugal being allowed a further two years to upgrade. Not all Menvier's overseas ventures have been successful. In 1987 it bought a Boston-based emergency lighting company, but sold it in 1991, having lost about Pounds 700,000 in what Mr Fletcher now characterises as a useful - if expensive - learning process. 'We thought we knew better than all the other British companies who have had their fingers burnt in the States. Over there, all people seemed to be interested in was the price of our product, whereas in Europe people are more interested in whether it will do the job.' The Boston company was a loss-maker, and Menvier has since then avoided turnrounds. Instead, it has concentrated on buying profitable European companies with good market positions, offering the vendors earn-out agreements and shares in the UK group. Mr Fletcher said Menvier tried to impose very light controls on its subsidiaries at the operating level, although all must file weekly reports of sales, cash and stocks. Each country's regulations differ, requiring particular product adaptions, and Menvier allows individual subsidiaries to keep their own names and choose whether to identify with the group. Although the bulk of Menvier's business still comes from emergency lighting, the group is expanding its fire alarm activity and has identified security alarms as the 'third layer' which it has started to move into. Menvier's share price has tripled since early 1991, as institutions have supported the group's overseas strategy and welcomed the increasing liquidity of the stock. Mr Christopher Swain, who emigrated to Australia two years ago, sold his near-20 per cent stake. His father, who last year stepped down from being executive chairman to become life president, placed a 16.7 per cent stake this month, but still holds 3 per cent. Analysts like the company, which now employs about 1,000 people, but are concerned that the spread ot its activities might stretch management resources. Menvier has recognised the concern, and said the group would concentrate for the next year on consolidation, rather than further acquisitions. Mr Fletcher, who has been national champion of the UK's most powerful class of powerboats for three of the last four years, believes that Menvier can continue to make headway against the tides of recession. More than half the group's business comes from continental Europe, and he is even growing more optimistic about the UK: 'We are at last seeing clear signs of recovery.'</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LEBANON;  </P> <P> 30 KILLED, 40 HURT IN RENEWED FIGHTING  </P> <P> A tentative cease-fire between rival Christian forces erupted into open  warfare, leaving at least 30 people dead and 40 others wounded.  </P> <P> A hail of shells pounded the Christian enclave in East Beirut and ignited a  ring of fire in the fiercely contested mountains surrounding the Lebanese  capital. A cease-fire had been in effect since early this month between Samir  Geagea's Lebanese Forces and troops loyal to renegade Christian army leader  Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. He and Geagea have been locked in a bitter power  struggle since Jan. 30 for control of Beirut's 310-square-mile Christian  enclave. During that time, more than 800 people have died, most of them  civilians.  </P></p>

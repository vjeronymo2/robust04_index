			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Race body aims to boost impact The Commission for Racial Equality yesterday announced a new structure aimed at making better use of resources and meeting Citizen's Charter standards. Staff will be deployed to work more closely with other agencies as part of a promotional drive. Mr Herman Ouseley, commission chairman, said racial discrimination was 'subtle, covert and sophisticated'. The restructuring was intended to make the commission more responsive and effective, and to bring it closer to its clients - both the institutions that came to it for guidance and the victims of discrimination.</p>

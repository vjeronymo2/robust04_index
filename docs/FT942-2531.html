			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Go private - if you can - Why it can be hard to get medical insurance Scare stories about age discrimination in NHS hospital treatment may be making more elderly people think about private medical insurance. Yet, while the government has encouraged this in recent years by offering tax relief on medical premiums for those over 60, the last Budget cut the relief available to a maximum of 25 rather than 40 per cent. Medical insurance will be hit also by the 2.5 per cent tax on all insurance premiums due to be imposed from October this year. But one spot of good news for pensioners is that the tax is added before relief is calculated - so you end up getting tax relief on the tax element, too. Relief is available to whoever pays the premiums, whether they are themselves the policyholders or are paying for elderly relatives. The rules about which insurance schemes qualify for relief are fairly strict. Any plan which offers cash benefits for nights spent in NHS hospitals, or covers GP or dental treatment, will not qualify. Changes announced last week mean that plans covering occupational therapy and a few other treatments are no longer excluded, but any scheme including alternative medicine will not be eligible. Jan Lawson, a specialist adviser on medical insurance with the Private Health Partnership, says the biggest barrier for over-60s seeking medical cover is not finding a policy which qualifies for tax relief but getting cover for existing conditions. By the time they reach their 60s or 70s, many people have minor medical problems which, in themselves, are not likely to lead to any claims but could contribute to future problems that would require surgery or other treatment. These include such conditions as mild high blood pressure and arthritis which, if it deteriorated, could require a hip replacement. Most insurers operate a moratorium policy: if you have had a medical problem in the past, but have not seen a doctor about it, taken medication or had any other form of treatment for it in the five years before joining the insurance scheme, any recurrence will be covered immediately. If it has been active within five years, you need to be free of the problem for at least two years after joining the scheme before it will be covered. But if you have high blood pressure, and are taking daily medication, you will never have a two-year period without treatment. Thus, the insurer can refuse to pay for anything needed to correct problems that could be traced back to this condition. Ignoring medical advice and failing to take the pills will not help you, either. Some insurers are more sympathetic than others, however, so using a specialist broker could be a good idea if you have had any health problems. Medical insurers often refuse to accept new customers in their 60s or older because they are seen as high risk. Clinicare, one of the few insurers which will underwrite existing conditions (for a higher premium) rather than imposing a moratorium, does not usually take on new clients over 64. Since tax relief was introduced, though, many other insurers have introduced special policies for retired people and have increased their upper age limit for new business. WPA offers one policy that accepts new customers up to age-75, and another which has no age limit. PPP also sets no limit, while Bupa will take new customers up to 75 in most of its plans. Obviously, cost is an important consideration, but many factors will dictate which scheme is right for an individual - including how flexible it can be if circumstances change. Pensioners can choose from plans with no-claim discounts, high excesses, six-week waiting list systems, and a myriad other ways of cutting premiums. But as long as insurers impose such strict conditions on covering a person's medical history, the best advice seems to be to sign up for insurance while you are young and healthy. Otherwise, when you need it, you could find you are too late.</p>

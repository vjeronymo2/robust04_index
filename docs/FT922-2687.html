			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BET profits fall sharply to Pounds 18.5m BET, the business services company, yesterday reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 217m to Pounds 18.5m after writing down its assets and substantial reorganisation provisions. At an operating level, profits in the year to March almost halved to Pounds 146.1m as the recession continued to bite, particularly in the UK personnel, joinery and plant hire services businesses. The pre-tax profits fall, after a higher-than-expected exceptional charge of Pounds 89.8m, led to a cut in the final dividend to 2.25p and to the total payment being more than halved to 6.5p. Earnings per share fell from 18.5p to a loss of 0.9p after payment of the preference dividend. Mr John Clark, chief executive, said he spent much of his first year trying to refocus BET from a financial holding company to an operating company after years in which acquisitions drained the company of cash. BET also became one of the first FT-SE 100 companies to make extensive use of new guidelines on goodwill suggested by the Accounting Standards Board. Following the ASB's Urgent Issues Task Force guidelines, BET made a Pounds 477m extraordinary charge relating to goodwill on businesses which have been sold or are to be sold. Some Pounds 405.6m related to goodwill written off in respect of under-performing businesses which are to be sold and which was written off the balance sheet at the time of acquisition. The charges nevertheless highlight the true scale of losses on some of the 170 businesses bought by the previous management and which the new BET team considers do not fit in the group. The Pounds 90m exceptional charge related to a net Pounds 21m of reorganisation costs, following a fundamental rethink of BET's strategic direction, and a Pounds 69m write-down of assets and deferred costs. BET also proved strongly cash generative during the year, reducing debt from Pounds 425m to Pounds 107m and gearing to 25 per cent excluding Dollars 500m of auction-market preferred shares (AMPS). This cash generation was flattered by the tight control taken on capital expenditure which at Pounds 109m including the proceeds of disposals was substantially less than depreciation of Pounds 179m. BET shares fell 4p to 136p. Details, Page 24 Lex, Page 22</p>

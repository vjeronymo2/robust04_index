			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Swiss prove they are not beyond passion: Outbursts of emotion mark a referendum on closer ties with Europe reliability, tolerance, self-discipline - but not for outbursts of emotion. Thus, when one Swiss farmer calls a federal cabinet minister a traitor, and another tells a francophone Swiss minister that he has no right to speak publicly in German Switzerland unless he uses a Swiss German dialect, it is apparent that something unusual is happening. What it is is a political campaign for a national referendum this Sunday on whether Switzerland should join the European Economic Area (EEA), an expanded free trade zone uniting the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), including Switzerland, and the European Community (EC). The Swiss themselves are surprised at how passionate the debate has become. 'It is the first time I have ever been interested in politics,' says Ms Monika Ziegler, a Zurich hairdresser who keeps a briefing paper at her side to answer customers' questions on the subject. Opponents claim ominously that the EEA is the first step down the slippery slope to membership in a centralised EC and the loss of cherished Swiss independence, neutrality and prosperity. Advocates believe just as passionately that it offers the best chance to avoid a stifling isolation that would gradually sap the vigour of the country's economy and peoples. Coming at a time when the country's economy has faltered badly, the issue has sent normally self-assured Swiss citizens into turmoil about which way to vote. Opinion polls show sentiment evenly split overall, but with a large proportion of voters, about 20 per cent, still undecided. Tension is added by the requirements for not only a national majority in the referendum but also a majority in at least 12 of the 23 cantons for the treaty to be ratified. Another worrisome feature is the unusually sharp difference in sentiment between the German-speaking majority, which tends to be uneasy about closer ties with the EC, and the French-speaking minority, which favours them. Government leaders admit that in the event of a rejection of the treaty the country's delicately balanced political system would be thrown into crisis. For those outside the country with interests in Switzerland, the importance of the vote should not be exaggerated. Existing free trade and several other treaties between the country and the EC will carry on even in the event of rejection. The near-term impact on the economy will be marginal. The big Swiss banks and multinational companies will be unaffected either way as they already have established bases in EC countries. And a political crisis would undoubtedly be defused in due course. The spectre of a break-up of the confederation and the creation of a separate French-speaking state is a non-starter, given the economic weakness of the six francophone-dominated cantons. But for the moment, the country is in an uncharacteristically feverish state. Mr Jean-Paul Delamuraz, the minister who was criticised for not speaking Swiss German in Schaffhausen three weeks ago, laments: 'Reason and truth do not seem to have a place in this debate any more.' Although the campaign had been in the offing for months, it got seriously under way only about four weeks ago. The government was quietly confident of victory, having assembled an extraordinary alliance of the leadership of nearly every important branch of society - banks, industry, trade unions, even farmers. But in the initial weeks of the campaign, the opponents made all the running, conjuring up visions of floods of immigrants and domination by the insensitive Brussels bureaucracy. Two weeks ago, a poll showed a clear plurality of voters against the EEA and the anti forces gaining ground. Alarmed, the pro camp rolled out its big guns. Brown Boveri, the engineering group, wrote to its suppliers warning of loss of business if the treaty was rejected. Roche and Sulzer, two other big companies, said they would cancel investment projects in Switzerland. In one of the most moving appeals, Mr Walter Frehner, chief executive of Swiss Bank Corporation, said in Zurich last week: 'I am against the offshore mentality being promoted by the EEA opponents. I want to leave my children a Switzerland whose strength is not just its neighbours' weaknesses, a Switzerland which does not consist only of hotels, banks and holding companies.' By the end of last week, polls indicated that, while the number of undecided voters was still high, there had been a decisive swing, with 46 per cent in favour and 38 per cent against. If the treaty is accepted, the turning point will probably be seen as the night when two cabinet ministers faced a hostile public in a nationally televised debate at Schwyz, the central Swiss town where the confederation was formed in 1292. After the ministers spoke in the hall holding the sacred federal archives, a farmer stood up and called them traitors. The outraged ministers dropped all pretence of civility and responded so vigorously that, by all accounts, they won sympathy throughout German Switzerland. For the Swiss, the most controversial element of the EEA treaty is the obligation to take on the EC's so-called four freedoms - of movement of capital, people, goods and services. Anti-EEA campaigners have been able to appeal to the deep seated fear in most Swiss of foreigners over-running the country, some taking jobs away from locals by accepting lower wages, others buying up every available Alp. In fact, in the past couple of years, as a result of recession, there has been a net outward flow of people to EEA countries, and this is likely to persist. EEA advocates say that the real beneficiaries of freedom of movement will be the Swiss who will be able to study and work freely in other EC countries. Research-oriented Swiss companies fear they will not be able to attract talented scientists if the treaty is rejected. Another troublesome element of the treaty for the Swiss is the supremacy of EC law in all of the areas covered. Opponents have emphasised how the Swiss will no longer be able to have the final say through plebiscites on every important issue. Advocates counter that the EEA is nowhere near as intrusive as EC membership would be. The EEA has no impact on heavily subsidised Swiss agriculture, except insofar as it should bring about a reduction in the cost of imported machinery and other farm inputs. And it does not threaten Switzerland's monetary independence or bank secrecy. Nor does it cover defence, and so does not undermine Swiss neutrality. As Sunday approaches, the tide seems to be firmly in the direction of approval of the treaty. But swinging a majority of cantons into the 'yes' camp still looks difficult because of the large number of small cantons in the German-speaking part of the country. Also, the external environment is not exactly helpful. Seldom have European institutions looked so unattractive.</p>

Commenting on the  resignation of the Belarusian parliament speaker, the  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes: "Specialists and  politicians will repeatedly examine the results and consequences  of Stanislav Shushkevich's resignation.    "But the first conclusion can be drawn even now: The actual  omnipotence of one political force has been again regained from  this time. The parliamentary majority led by premier Vyacheslav  Kebich will not have any more 'a whipping boy' in the face of  the former speaker. The party of power headed by the government  will be now obliged to assume full responsibility for the  republic's future."    The same newspaper deals with the Azeri-Armenian conflict  over Nagorno-Karabakh in another article. "While Moscow and  Yerevan continue to make conjectures on how Aliyev (Eds: the  Azeri president) managed to consolidate the army in such a short  period of time, Baku continues to keep mum and is in no hurry to  refute reports by some Russian media that Afghan mujahideen make  up the core of the renovated army.    "Moscow's insistent call to stop combat operations put a  difficult dilemma before the Azeri leader: either to make  concessions and agree to talks with the Armenian side, or to  ignore the Russian side's diplomatic pressure.    "In the first instance, Aliyev risks to lose support of  Azeri  population, in another, to force Moscow to look for other  methods of pressure on the present Azeri leadership.+    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Aleksandr  Dzasokhov, member of the state Duma (lower chamber of the  Russian parliament) from North Ossetia, who says: "The state  Duma has gathered a motley, and nevertheless, political elite of  the Russian state, especially from Moscow.    "If this is the case, it should conduct affairs in a  responsible way, as an elite should do. This is especially  important, since a democratically elected parliament is being  formed for the first time.    "This is the start of a truly multi-party system, and  parliament will be responsible for how it will work."    According to the TRUD newspaper, "social tension at mines of  the Kuznetsk coal basin has become dangerous from the beginning  of the new year. Workers refuse to go to work in some or other  mines.    "The reason for such a sitution is not only months-long  delays with payment of wages and unfulfilled promises by the  government. Lack of funds prevents miners from purchasing the  most necessary equipment to carry out mining operations and  (what's the most dreadful thing) to ensure labour safety."    The IZVESTIYA newspaper focuses on the rouble's rate.  "Relative stability of the rouble over the past few days," the  newspaper writes, "gave a brief respite to all money dealers.  There is a chance now to cast a retrospective glance and to draw  some conclusions.    "The most important of them evidently is that times have  passed for good when the government could artificially fix an  exchange rate between the rouble and the dollar. The situation  is quite different these days: The rate of the national monetary  unit is now among the main indicators of the efficiency of the  government's activities."    The same newspaper runs an article by state Duma member  Vasiliy Lipitskiy advocating an amnesty to members of the state  emergency committee and detainees of the Lefortovo prison (eds:  members of the State Emergency Committee engineered an abortive  state coup in 1991. They are now on trial but released from  prison. Lefortovo detainees started a state coup in Moscow in  October 1993 and are under investigation now).    "Such an amnesty, in Lipitskiy's opinion, could draw a line  under the past and become a step to national reconciliation,"  the newspaper notes.    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes about breakdowns and  emergencies in the Russian federation last year. "The year 1993  witnessed over 1,200 serious breakdowns and emergencies in  Russia, which claimed the life of 1,100 people.    "The unstable social and economic situation in the country  indicates that the number of breakdowns, disasters and other  emergencies will be at least the same this year," the newspaper  notes.    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper examines the problem of  piratic fishing by foreign ships in Russian territorial waters.    "The solution of the piratic fishing problem faces the  following question: Will Russia be a powerful state which will  be reckoned with by close and distant neighbours?" asks the  newspaper. "The process is reverse for the time being," it adds.    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA newspaper carries an interpellation by  legislator Vasiliy Starodubtsev advocating the interests of  Russian peasants. He notes: "Peasants have no hard currency on  their bank accounts as well as villas in California.    "Their homes are here, and they will do their best to  survive  and to feed urban population. But if, God forbid, hunger strikes  any place, the blame will fully rest with Misters Gaydar,  Fedorov and other enemies of the Russian countryside.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / CBI fears US tax increases FEARS of large tax increases on British companies operating in the US are to be voiced by a senior delegation from the Confederation of British Industry in meetings with US government officials this week, writes Tim Burt. Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, and Mr Howard Davies, director general, are flying to Washington today to seek clarification from the Clinton administration about how corporate tax changes unveiled in last week's State of the Union address could affect UK companies. With investments totalling Dollars 106bn (Pounds 74.6bn), UK companies are the largest overseas investors in the US. Initial fears that President Bill Clinton was aiming to raise Dollars 45bn in additional taxes over four years eased when the figure was revised down to Dollars 3.8bn over six years.</p>

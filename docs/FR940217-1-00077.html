			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, this section would be amended to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional steps that the Secretary may take to insure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of any liabilities that are owed. Under this section, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution or third-party servicer owes funds, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may determine that an administrative offset (as provided for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 34 CFR 30.28) is an appropriate alternative to collect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of an institution or third-party servicer that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides surety or a guarantee for the benefit of the Secretary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as a bond or letter of credit, the Secretary may determine it is necessary to collect from that surety or guarantee before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the procedures under subpart H of this part are completed, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances warrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary would collect a surety or guarantee before all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available appeal procedures are completed_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Where the need to provide relief to students or borrowers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the institution's or third-party servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, as applicable, that led to the assessment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability, is more important than deferring collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities until after the completion of appeal proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (for example, when unpaid refunds to the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are identified, the Secretary may collect in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance of a final determination or exhaustion of appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, as the harm to students outweighs deferring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where the conditions under which a surety or guarantee are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held do not provide adequate assurances that the surety or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guarantee will be available for collection through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of available appeal proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These modifications would provide clarification in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations of the Secretary's existing practice and authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect from sureties or guarantees in accordance with their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms, prior to final determinations of liabilities or exhaustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of appeal procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to make clear that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is responsible for repayment of any funds owed by its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer until those funds are repaid by the servicer. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary considers this provision necessary because an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is always responsible for the actions of its agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that if a determination is made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess a liability against a third-party servicer, the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to notify each institution under whose contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer was assessed a liability of the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination. The servicer would also be required to notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every institution that contracts with the servicer for the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service that the Secretary determined a liability is owed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final consensus on this particular language was not reached  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as negotiators believed that this provision essentially requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notification of all institutions with which a servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts. Negotiators objected to a notice being provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that a servicer contracts with that would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly affected by a determination from the Secretary to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability. A number of negotiators opposed this language on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground that such a blanket notification unnecessarily damages a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's reputation among unaffected institutions. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary believes that an institution that contracts with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer should be informed of determinations by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education that the institution's servicer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improperly administering the Title IV, HEA programs, especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given the potential liability exposure to the institution. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification requirements would arise only if the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that a third-party servicer owes a liability based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an audit finding, after providing the institution or third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer an opportunity to respond to an audit report response. By limiting the requirement for notice provided by a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer to institutions receiving the same service for which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability was assessed, the Secretary believes that he has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responded to any legitimate concerns raised by the negotiators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.25 Contracts between an institution and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.25, governing loss of institutional eligibility, as &sect;668.26  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to add a new &sect;668.25 that would establish minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for contracts between an institution and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer. Proposed &sect;668.25 would allow an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to contract with a servicer to administer aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the extent that the servicer's eligibility to contract with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that institution has not been limited, suspended, or terminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the proceedings in Subpart G (as proposed to be amended).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, under these proposed regulations, a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer is considered eligible to contract with an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to administer aspects of the institution's participation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program to the extent that the servicer is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found to exhibit indicators of questionable past performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indicators of questionable past performance would be_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A limitation, suspension, or termination action by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary against the servicer within the preceding five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] The Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw has begun an  investigation into irregularities committed by employees of the  Finance Ministry in setting the price of shares of Bank Slaski.    As we were told by prosecutor Ryszard Kucinski, who is  leading the investigation, these are, for the time being,  proceedings in a case and not against any specific people.    The prosecutor's office decided to begin an investigation  only after two months from the date that the Confederation of  Republicans tabled a formal notice regarding the crime. In the  opinion of the confederation, the price of the Bank Slaski  shares had been seriously lowered and the Treasury had been the  loser.    A second motion asking for an investigation was tabled on 26  January by the Inspection Office of the Stocks Commission. This  motion concerned the possible overestimate of the market price  of shares at the first two sessions.    Another line of investigation is to answer the question of  how the process of setting the share price was carried out.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: MoDo has no plans for rights issue MoDo, Swedish forestry products group, does not plan to go ahead with any rights issue, in spite of shareholder approval to launch one, Reuter reports from Stockholm. As a result of speculation about a possible rights issue, the company's board has decided that the authority granted for a rights issue at an ordinary shareholders' meeting on May 26 will not be used, MoDo said. The shareholders' meeting gave the company authority to make an issue of up to 4m B shares between that meeting and the 1995 annual shareholders' meeting. The company also addressed another subject of market speculation - its plan to consider building a third newsprint machine at its Braviken paper mill. It said that a final decision in principle would be taken at a board meeting planned for November 24.</p>

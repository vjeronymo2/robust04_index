			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Thousands cheated of Russian vouchers RUSSIAN investors yesterday blocked roads in St Petersburg demanding their money back from fraudsters who have cheated a third of a million of the city's inhabitants of privatisation vouchers. It is the first big scandal to hit Russia's mass privatisation campaign. Investors demonstrated near the offices of companies that promised big returns in exchange for the vouchers but which have since disappeared. At least 350,000 people are believed to have lost their vouchers this way. The vouchers entitle holders to Rbs10,000 worth of shares in privatised companies. Five or so companies, one of them called Revenge, collected the vouchers late last year with a promise to return them in February with a Rbs12,000 bonus. But when the individuals, one of them an engineer at the Lomo optical plant who recalls giving away a kilogramme of sausage to jump the queue to sign up to the scheme, went to pick up their vouchers and money, the companies had vanished without at trace. Police, overwhelmed with claims from the victims, have appealed to the population for patience while Mayor Anatoly Sobchak has promised people will get their vouchers back. 'Look after your vouchers' screamed a frontpage headline this week in the St Petersburg Gazette, which published a list of the eight licensed investment funds allowed to invest vouchers on behalf of ordinary citizens. The free distribution of vouchers to every Russian citizen was completed last month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Due to the economic difficulties in the country, the  financing of military orders and research in Russia has been  reduced approximately 10-fold. Some enterprises are simply  refusing to produce military equipment. At the request of our  correspondent, Colonel General Sergey Mayev, deputy commander in  chief of the Russian land forces, comments:    [Begin Mayev recording] Russia will be able to maintain its  position among the leading manufacturers of new types of  weapons. What is my conviction based on? First, the fact that  we have always had very powerful scientific and technical ideas  and our military industry is very powerfully developed. [end  recording]    As for the drop in financing, the general said that it is  always 1.5-2 times lower than in the advanced Western countries.  The difference has of course now greatly increased, but this  gap, in the view of the general, can be bridged by the internal  resources of defense enterprises. General Mayev does not reveal  what resources they are, but he thinks that they include the use  of high- technology, the search for unconventional production  and scientific solutions, and the best possible implementation  of conversion.    As for the types of weapons which are a priority in the  Russian Army and the defense industry, according to Gen. Mayev,  deputy commander of the Russian land forces, it is a queston of  two areas: The development of traditional types of weapons and  the creation of promising systems. He said that the latter  included high-precision weapons, means for gathering  intelligence and managing forces. This is the principled  approach taken by the Russian military toward the weapons issue  within the new Russian military doctrine.</p>

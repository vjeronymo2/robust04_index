Janata Dal MP Nitish Kumar said, "we came back with  impression that the President had been kept in the dark" by the  Government on the GATT agreement. He felt the Government should  have briefed the President about it.    The NF-LF delegation told the President that the Government  had "betrayed the country and let down Parliament" since with  the endorsement of the Dunkel proposals "India's freedom had  been mortgaged to the dictates of the industrial powers,  particularly the US."    They urged him to use his office to persuade the Government  to reject the Dunkel draft. Prominent among those who were in  the delegation included Sharad Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan, S.  Jaipal Reddy, Nitish Kumar, Srikant Jena, George Fernandes,  Devendra Prasad Yadav (all JD), [Janata Dal] Somanth Chatterjee  (CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist], Balayogi (TDP)  [Telugu Desam Party] and M. Maran (DMK) [Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam] (Dravidian Progressive Foundation).    Later, talking to the newsmen Ram Vilas Paswan and Nitish  Kumar said the Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao had no moral  right to continue in office after having signed the Geneva  agreement.    During the debate on the Dunkel draft in Parliament,  Government posed the issue as if it were one of a choice between  two evils: To be in GATT or to be out of it. "We reject this  formulation. If the membership of the new GATT is tantamount to  compromising with the sovereignty of our country, then India  must be out of it," the delegation told the President in a  memorandum.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Ladin under the "Events and </F> Commentaries" rubric: "One `Noose' Is No Longer Enough"]    [Text] A law and order operation codenamed "Noose" was in  effect throughout Kazakhstan for more than a week. It was  carried out at the initiative of the Republic's President  Nursultan Nazarbayev.    No state of emergency was imposed in Alma-Ata [Almaty] or  the  other cities, Kairbek Suleymanov, state councillor of the  Republic of Kazakhstan, underlined in his interview for KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA. But the rising crime had become so "burning" an issue  that the situation called for tough measures, which proved  sudden to some extent. The first unusual thing was that  substantial law and order forces, including internal troops,  were brought in to impose order in towns and populated centers.  No Army units were deployed.    The job done is not small. According to the state  councillor, 50,428 people came under scrutiny of the patrols and  militia bodies during the week. Naturally, those are people  only detained for offenses.    During the week 333 kg of narcotics were seized. The  militia's "hauls" were sometimes between 0.5 to 1.5 kg.  Suleymanov does not dispute that some regular routes for drugs  coming from Tajikistan were discovered, but in 11 instances the  "goods" were carried by citizens of that Republic.    Some 1,500 illegally stored weapons were seized. Militia  seized a submachinegun and a "Mukha" hand-held grenade launcher  from Oleg Osadchiy, a military officer, who was attempting to  sell them.    The operation is over. On the whole it yielded the expected  results while one cannot say that crime in Kazakhstan has been  finally defeated.</p>

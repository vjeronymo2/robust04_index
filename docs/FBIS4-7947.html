			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 6 (CTK) -- Information given to  CTK by Slovak National Party (SNS) deputy Marian Andel  concerning participation of SNS Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar in  the World Pan-Slav Congress in Moscow is erroneous, Molnar told  CTK today.    On Sunday Andel said that "neither himself nor SNS honorary  Chairman Jozef Prokes knew about Molnar's visit to Moscow to  attend the congress organized by Russian ultra nationalist and  Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Zhirinovskiy.  SNS Chairman Jan Slota said on Monday that Molnar was sent to  Moscow by the SNS leadership as an observer. Molnar said that  although Andel could not know about his visit due to illness,  Prokes was informed about it.    According to unofficial announcement provided by the SNS  today it neither had established nor intended to establish  contacts with any liberal party as it does not share liberal  values. Informal and unofficial consultations with LDP  representatives could not be considered the SNS's orientation  towards the LDP's political line just as the presence of Peter  Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) at the  Bratislava Central Market place cannot be considered proof of  the SDL's inclination towards a market economy, says a SNS  statement.    Molnar declined to answer the question of whether or not he  would meet Zhirinovskiy during his anticipated visit to Slovakia.</p>

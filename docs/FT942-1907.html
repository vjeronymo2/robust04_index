			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Urban scheme 'failed to halt decline' Government policies for inner-city regeneration in the late 1980s failed to arrest the decline in the centres of England's largest cities, says a report published yesterday by the Department of Environment. It says the Pounds 10bn spent on more than 20 programmes under the Action for Cities Initiative between 1988 and 1991 achieved a 'measurable positive impact'. The gap between the 57 urban priority areas targeted and other urban areas had narrowed. But in many of the most intractable inner-city areas conditions continued to decline in spite of the investment of large sums in regeneration. Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne, Hull, Coventry and London boroughs such as Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Lambeth were among those that received the highest level of resources under the initiative, yet showed the poorest outcomes in terms of jobs, new businesses and other regeneration indicators. The report says: 'Local analysis shows that there are growing numbers of areas (in very large cities) that are disadvantaged and that the districts are the home of a growing share of disadvantaged people.' The report, by independent researchers at three universities, makes five recommendations to improve the effectiveness of urban regeneration. These include better co-ordination between the programmes and a stronger role for local leadership, particularly by local authorities. The environment department said yesterday that changes in policy since the end of the Action for Cities initiative had effectively implemented these recommendations. The creation of a single regeneration budget would improve the coherence of programmes, while new government regional offices would encourage the formation of local partnerships.

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Japan chemicals group favours UK The UK has emerged as the favoured site for the first international research centre outside Japan for Takeda, Japan's largest pharmaceuticals group. 'The UK is becoming the centre of the European pharmaceuticals industry,' said Dr Masahiko Fujino, general manager of Takeda's discovery research division. 'We are looking at other European locations but the UK is most suitable.' The initial investment would be small, perhaps Y300m (Pounds 1.95m), said Dr Fujino, but would expand later.</p>

The head of  the Romanian delegation, Florin Radulescu-Botica, was elected  one of the Assembly's vice-presidents on the first day of the  session.    Radulescu-Botica speaks in an interview with the daily  DREPTATEA about the willingness of the Romanian Parliament  members to be active in the Council of Europe. He specifies  that Romania is no exception in being applied Directive 488 (for  control of the fulfillment of the commitments assumed when it  was given the status of Council of Europe full member). It  shares this with other newly received members, such as  Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the  procedure is going to be used also for the countries to be  admitted from now on. Radulescu-Botica announced that Mr.  Koenig, Council of Europe rapporteur for Romania was going to  arrive in Bucharest at the end of March. The Romanian vice  president of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly said  he hoped that Romania would be able to present positive data on  its efforts at all levels, made in order to meet the commitments  it made when it entered the European body.    During the debates on the situation in former Yugoslavia,  Romanian parliamentarians in the Council of Europe Assembly  pointed to the difficulties encountered by Romania in order to  enforce the embargo imposed to rump Yugoslavia. They opined  that the sanctions would not trigger a solution of the crisis in  the area. Deputy Dumitru Buzatu showed on that occasion that  the figures on Romania's losses in consequence of the  enforcement of the embargo are higher than those in the report  presented to the Assembly, they amount not to three but to  $7,000,000,000. "The sum results from both direct and indirect  losses in import-export activities and are based on data on the  evolution of the economic relations between Romania and  Yugoslavia over 1989-1992," he said. For his part Senator  Adrian Paunescu opined that a solution has to be sought for the  crisis in Yugoslavia not by enforcing embargoes and restrictions  as "this affects nations and not governments." He has  underlined that no foreign intervention can lead to a viable  solution, adding that "all foreign interventions, irrespective  of when and where they are made, have to be understood as civil  war."</p>

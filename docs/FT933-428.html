			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / People: UES Holdings to do without chief executive Graham Mackenzie, chief executive of UES Holdings, is leaving the Rotherham-based company following a reorganisation intended to give greater autonomy to the three operating divisions - steels, forgings and subsidiaries. The surprise announcement, which takes effect immediately, is a result of the amalgamation of the company's executive committee into the board structure - a move inspired by British Steel, which owns 60.9 per cent of UES Holdings, and GKN which owns the remaining 39.1 per cent. It leaves UES in the unusual position of operating without a chief executive. The company said yesterday that, in view of current market conditions, the flatter management structure would better enable it to cut costs and improve profits, and provide a more direct interface between the UES businesses and the two shareholders. UES stressed that there had been no boardroom row, and that Mackenzie, who was made chief executive in 1990, was leaving by mutual agreement. UES, formerly known as United Engineering Steels, says that Don Ford, 64, who was appointed chairman last year, will devote more time to the company's affairs. Ford, a former British Steel executive, is also chairman of Twil, the wire rope joint venture between British Steel and Bekaert of Belgium. David Stone, managing director of the steels division, and John Dawson, managing director of the forgings division, have been appointed to the UES Holdings board. Yesterday's announcement comes less than a week after UES revealed plans to close the smallest of its three steelmaking plants, at Templeborough in Rotherham. Separately, GKN says the cost for UES of the proposed closure would not be significant. GKN's share of the exceptional charge this year would not exceed Pounds 10m.</p>

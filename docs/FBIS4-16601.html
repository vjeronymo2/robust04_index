			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] An extraordinary session of the government has  passed amendments to the law on foreigners and stateless persons  entering and staying in Latvia, and related to this law addenda  to the law on police which envisions the creation of emigration  police within the framework of the state police. Inese  Birznietse, the Saeima human rights commission chairperson,  explained that the amendments passed in accordance with the  rules provided for by Article 81... apply to persons who arrived  in Latvia illegally, and have been passed with an eye to  improving the procedure for their expulsion from the country.  The amendments to the law were fully agreed on with the CSCE  mission but their final version have not been passed in Latvia,  for which reason it has been impossible today to find out  exactly what the expulsion procedure is and how one can appeal  against it. Still, according to Birznietse, mass deportations  are out of the question because the amendments also contain a  reservation that they are not applicable to persons whose legal  status in Latvia has not been determined and in whose regard  legislation has so far not been brought into line.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Probes into Chilean trading losses urged Pressure was mounting on the Chilean government yesterday to urge UK and US regulatory authorities to investigate alleged 'irregular' metals futures trading that led its state copper company, Codelco, to incur heavy losses last year. Two opposition deputies, who recently visited London and New York, have demanded a probe into the part played by foreign brokers in the loss of up to Dollars 270m. An investigation in London could be mounted by the London Metal Exchange, Serious Fraud Office or Securities and Investment Board, Mr Luis Valentin Ferrada, one of the two deputies, said. His visit had 'established indubitably that a foreign investigation was possible'. He said that, if the Chilean government approached authorities in London, 'I have absolutely no doubt' that proceedings could begin. It was in London's interests to 'protect the transparency and control of its market', he said. Other commentators, however, thought it unlikely that proceedings would start unless strong evidence of foul-play was produced. So far, little, if any, has come to light. Speculation about irregular transactions has resulted largely from statements by Mr Jose Benquis, a Chilean judge, that of 8,000 futures operations conducted in 1993, 400 were 'strange'. Ernst &amp; Young, the British consultancy employed by Codelco to study the case, told Reuters last week it 'had no direct evidence of any irregularities'. It said yesterday that the investigation had 'moved on', but it would be 'unhelpful' to comment further.</p>

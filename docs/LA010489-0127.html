			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ENGINEERS BLAME SHODDY HIGH-RISES FOR ARMENIA'S QUAKE TOLL  </P> <P> Engineers back from the Armenian earthquake zone today blamed the poor quality  of newly constructed high-rise apartment buildings for the tremendous loss of  life in the Soviet disaster area.  </P> <P> Entire blocks of the buildings, most about nine stories tall, were leveled by  the 6.7 quake. The engineers said widespread use of concrete columns and beams,  as well as poor workmanship, led to the massive death and destruction Dec. 7.  </P> <P> "If that type of construction were found on a private job, or even a government  job, in the United States, the inspector would make the contractor take it down  and do it over," Loring Wyllie, a structural engineer and chairman of the board  of H. J. Degenkolb Associates of San Francisco, told a news conference.  </P> <P> Wyllie was one of 18 American engineers and seismologists assembled by the  National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Geological Survey who traveled to  Leninakan, Spitak and other cities in Armenia to help Soviet authorities.  </P> <P> He told of the inadequate finishing of critical joints in the fallen buildings,  poorly laid concrete and creative but crude attempts by builders to fix design  flaws.  </P> <P> "This was a disaster of new buildings," said Fred Krimgold, an associate dean  at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.  </P> <P> Krimgold said most of the high-rises were weakened by the quake's initial jolt  and flattened by a shock about three minutes later. Many of the victims,  alarmed by the first jolt, were found in stairwells, Krimgold said.  </P> <P> After studying earthquakes in Mexico City and other places, Krimgold said, "We  thought we had written the book on search and rescue. What we learned in  Armenia is that we had only written Chapter 1."  </P> <P> He said concrete floors in the collapsed buildings, most of which used concrete  support columns and beams, fell like pancakes -- leaving no sanctuary for  people caught in their path.  </P> <P> "Most of the buildings in Leninakan came straight down in compact levels of  rubble," Krimgold said. "Usually there are voids."  </P> <P> He noted, however, many older buildings of only one or two stories were left  standing by the quake, and Wyllie said high-rises that used a combination of  concrete floors and inner walls for support suffered less damage.  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Buy-out by Williams as profits rise 21% WILLIAMS Holdings yesterday announced the acquisition of Thorn EMI's portable fire extinguisher business for Pounds 41m as it reported a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. Profits from the industrial conglomerate rose from Pounds 133.2m to Pounds 161.3m as sales edged up to Pounds 1.03bn from Pounds 1bn. The comparative figures were restated because the latest accounting standards require profits or losses from disposals to be taken above the line. Under the old rules Williams would have reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 167.3m to Pounds 155.2m. In order to keep borrowings down, Williams funded its acquisition by placing new shares at 345p. Its shares yesterday fell 5p to 355p. Net debt is around Pounds 170m, representing gearing of just under 40 per cent. However, with long-term borrowing facilities of Dollars 370m (Pounds 255m) Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said Williams was 'ideally positioned to continue to expand through infill acquisitions without going back to the market'. Since October 1991 the group has spent more than Pounds 65m on acquisitions. It expanded its range of brands for the DIY market by buying Hunting Specialist Coatings, which trades principally as Hammerite, for Pounds 17m. The profit before tax is after an exceptional credit of Pounds 6.1m, representing a loss of Pounds 5m on the disposal of Spencer Clark Metal Industries and a book profit of Pounds 11.1m on the sale of its investment in Racal Electronics. In 1991, on a comparable basis, there was an exceptional net charge of Pounds 34.1m, comprising a Pounds 20.8m deficit on disposals of discontinued activities and Pounds 13.3m in respect of the bid costs for and the write-down of its investment in Racal. The group will no longer offer post retirement medical benefits to its US employees because of spiralling medical costs. Although companies do not have to reflect the costs in their accounts until 1994 Williams decided to adopt the new rules in 1993. This likely to lead to an additional charge to pre-tax profits of between Pounds 3.5m and Pounds 4.5m. Earnings per share rose to 19.1p (from 15.2p). The final dividend is increased to 7.5p (from 7.35p) giving a total of 12.5p (up from 12.35p). Lex, Page 16; Further details, Page 18</p>

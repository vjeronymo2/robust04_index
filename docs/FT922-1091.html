			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Move on MPs' interests endorsed NEW PROCEDURES to ensure that MPs elected to the chairmanships of Commons committees do not have business interests likely to conflict with their parliamentary duties were backed from both sides of the House last night. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, hinted that the government is likely to favour arrangements which make it unnecessary to adopt a proposal requiring committee chairmen to divest themselves of any pecuniary interest which may be thought to influence their judgment. He promised to consider the views expressed by MPs in a short debate on a report by the select committee on Members' interests before reaching any final decision on how the House should be asked to implement its recommendations. Mr Terence Higgins, chairman of the Treasury committee in the last parliament, agreed that MPs elected to such positions were in a different position from their colleagues. While committee chairmen should be subject to more stringent rules on the disclosure of their outside interests he believed it would be wrong to insist that they should have none. To take such a step, it was argued, would be to impose a penalty which was not imposed on other MPs. Mr Higgins, who has also served as chairman of the liaison committee which co-ordinates the work of the Commons committees, maintained that the best people to judge whether the outside interests of the chairman were likely to conflict with the work of the select committee were the other members of that particular committee. He argued that there was no need for specific requirements to be imposed by a special resolution of the House.</p>

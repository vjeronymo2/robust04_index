			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Austrian banks in takeover struggle CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, is in a stiff fight for its independence following a hostile takeover bid launched last Friday by Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich (RZB), the clearing house for a large group of rural Austrian savings banks. RZB said it had offered to buy at least half of the 70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt (CA) held by the Austrian Ministry of Finance. It would propose then to sell itself to CA in return for enough shares to give the Raiffeisen a majority holding - in effect, a reverse takeover. The proposed merger would create Austria's largest bank, with assets of Sch703bn (Dollars 63.2bn), compared with the Sch544bn balance sheet of Bank Austria, itself the result of a merger in September 1991 between Landerbank and the Zentralsparkasse group of savings banks. Both CA and the Raiffeisen have large non-banking activities, CA mainly in industry and the Raiffeisen in insurance and retailing. CA said in a terse statement it did not see 'any compelling need for growth via mergers'. The bid comes against the background of a long period of severe trading conditions in the Austrian banking industry and the need to reduce the excessive number of banks, branches and employees in the largely publicly-owned sector. The country has one bank branch for every 1,340 people, more than double the ratio in the UK. The pressure for rationalisation has been intensified by the government's desire to sell its holdings of bank shares and to liberalise laws and regulations affecting banks. The Raiffeisen, with 1,700 outlets and only Sch185bn in assets, is one of the groups most in need of rationalisation. CA, by contrast, has only 201 outlets and assets of Sch518bn in assets. However, it has been hard hit by loan losses in recent years, initially in international lending, but latterly in the domestic market. Its provisions last year amounted to Sch5.7bn. The government has been searching for strategic partners for CA, and last year there were contacts with General Electric of the US. Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, CA's executive chairman, has said he would prefer to see the government's stake dispersed among institutional investors.</p>

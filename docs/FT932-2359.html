			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (7): Lessons of Mersey oil spill - Profile, Shell A sunny August weekend in 1989 has proved a turning point in one company's attitudes towards the environment. A corroded pipeline carrying thick, Venezuelan crude oil from Birkenhead to Shell's refinery at Stanlow, Ellesmere Port, burst. The spillage of 157 tonnes into an already badly polluted River Mersey was tiny by the standards of an Amoco Cadiz or an Exxon Valdez but it soon assumed massive proportions. The pipeline was 17 years old and could not accommodate modern 'pigs' - pipeline inspection gadgets sent down the inside to test it with scanners. Shell engineers made a temporary repair and then - against the advice of the emergency services - tried to empty out the rest of the oil by pumping it past the leak. If it had worked, hindsight would have classified the decision as sound and professional. But the repair burst and the fire brigade videoed the consequences as a fountain of 40 tonnes of oil sprayed onto the Mersey foreshore. The video ended up on television and as evidence in court six months later. Shell pleaded guilty to polluting the Mersey and was fined Pounds 1m, the largest penalty levied in an English court in a pollution case. Mr Justice Mars-Jones said human error was to blame and Shell had not discharged its duty to the community. Only the company's support for arts and worthwhile projects in the region - plus Pounds 1.4m paid without question for the ensuing clean-up - had saved it from a penalty of several million pounds. Shell paid up and shut up. Only now - and for the first time - has it been prepared to talk about the impact of the incident, and the far-reaching consequences it has had on the company. Immediate action included modifying the pipeline so it could take 'pigs' to enable modern testing. The previous method - filling the pipe with water, increasing the pressure and waiting to see if it held - could not predict failure. The Pounds 100,000 cost of modification was probably cheap, as another fault was discovered, enabling another potentially fracture to be averted. But this was firefighting - and no different from what Shell had been doing at Stanlow for years. Management responded to incidents after they had occurred. There was an acceptance that pollution was inevitable; there would always be spillages into waterways, black emissions up chimneys, and bad smells to annoy local residents. Everyone knew how these things happened, but the cost of the Mersey clean-up and the opprobrium attaching to the Pounds 1m fine made Shell realise it had to start asking why. As Mr John Davies puts it: 'As a site we had a severe waking-up. We looked hard at ourselves and realised management systems were either poor or inefficient. This was something of an admission for something of our size. We were managing things as they came up.' Mr Davies is in charge of Shell's anti-pollution drive but the significance of this can only be appreciated from his overall role in the business - he is total quality services manager and one of Stanlow's most senior figures. Above him is Mr Dominic Boot, director and general manager. Mr Boot, who is from the Netherlands, became Stanlow's chief executive after the oil spill and has experience of the much tougher environmental regimes of France and Germany. Initial suggestions for eliminating pollution were to spend, but Stanlow's management soon ran into a problem. Founded in 1922, the gigantic complex grew by adding on plant from 1948 to reach its present throughput of 10m tonnes of oil a year. This history of piecemeal development makes it harder to achieve the overall operational standards of its more modern counterparts, so although it is one of the largest refineries in Europe, Stanlow struggles financially. Big spending on anti-pollution equipment that offered no return on capital was going to be very hard to justify, especially in a recession. 'The message from the top was that we had to make what we had work properly, rather than spend money we had not earned,' Mr Davies says. Mr A. 'Jag' Jagannathan, technical development manager, echoes this: 'Throwing money at the problem is not enough. Merely correcting mistakes is not the answer; it's not making the mistakes in the first place.' Mr Boot, who was clearly brought in to shake the place up, says: 'It's all in the mind in the end. The perception was that the oil industry had to be dirty; that unless you had dirty boots and dirty fingernails, you were not doing a proper job. But I had seen how the industry was elsewhere. A refinery could be clean.' Stanlow now is, because attitudes have changed from the top of the company down to operator level. Mr Boot elevated the whole status of the environment as a management responsibility, ranking it alongside quality, health and safety. Environmental policy, and how to plan it properly, became a standard agenda item at weekly management meetings. Mr Boot associated himself personally with the change, committing his reputation to new standards that he wants achieved. The objective is to make Stanlow hydrocarbon-tight. To achieve it, Mr Boot says 'management has to be serious. The environment is not just a public affairs issue.' If the workforce did not take this seriously at first, attitudes changed after management shut down one plant when equipment stopped adjusting the acidity of effluent in the way it was supposed to. It took a week to solve the problem, but the action demonstrated that the environment was as important as safety in deter- mining whether things could go on if they were not right. Mr Mike Sparshott, environ- mental manager, now has the figures to prove that the policies are working. For example, oil lost to effluent - in effect dribbling into the Mersey - is down from an annual 390 tonnes to 130 tonnes. The loss of biological oxygen caused by effluent is down 12 per cent. Incidents of smoke emissions are down 15 per cent but the aggregate time of emissions has been halved - meaning that operators act faster than in the past to stem any trouble. This is borne out by complaints about smoke dropping by nearly 40 per cent - suggesting many incidents that attracted attention in the past are being nipped in the bud before anyone outside notices. The key outcome, however, is that Shell now feels any money it spends on environ- mental improvements - and it could be up to Pounds 75m - will not be wasted. Without a change in corporate culture and attitudes, however, Shell would have had to spend much more - and with less certainty, as old attitudes and practices would have continued to create potentially worse pollution problems at source. This might even have raised questions about whether Shell should persist with Stanlow at all. Just as important as any environmental improvements, however, is that Shell has decided it should talk about it. It has not tried to pass off the Mersey oil spill as bad luck, even though there was an element of chance involved, but has admitted the more important part played by bad management. It takes courage to eat humble pie and admit past errors so openly. Other oil and chemicals companies may well shudder at this, just as they did when Shell's pipeline burst, for something similar could have happened to almost any of them. Quietly, but urgently, they also modified old pipelines to take 'pigs'. Shell at Stanlow now appears to have given another type of example to follow.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MAJOR GALLERY IN HUMBLE SURROUNDINGS;  </P> <P> ART: THE VINCENT PRICE GALLERY AT EAST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE IS ONE OF THE FINEST  OF ITS KIND. BUT MANY OF THE TREASURES ARE STORED FOR LACK OF EXHIBITION SPACE.  </P> <P> It sits like an artistic oasis in a desert of beige institutional buildings,  right down the street from a public housing project. Here, in this largely  undiscovered exhibition hall, generations of students have viewed their first  works by Picasso and Delacroix, and they have gone away touched and inspired.  </P> <P> Quietly, with a big assist from an actor popularly known more for his horror  movies than for his art expertise, the Vincent Price Gallery at East Los  Angeles College in Monterey Park has amassed one of the finest art collections  of any community college in the nation.  </P> <P> "The public of Los Angeles doesn't know a thing about it," Price said in an  interview from his Beverly Hills home. "It's never mentioned in the newspapers  because I felt, and I think quite rightly, that people would think I was doing  something for publicity."  </P> <P> Instead, the genteel actor and art connoisseur, who started donating to the  college after he addressed students there in 1951, has allowed the collection  to stand on its own merits.  </P> <P> His initial gift consisted of about 90 rare artworks, including an original  19th-Century print by the French illustrator Honore Daumier, a 16th-Century  woodcut by the German master Albrecht Durer, an assortment of African artifacts  and some 1,000-year-old pre-Columbian fabrics from Peru.  </P> <P> On prominent display is "The Eyebrow Pencil," an exquisite 1928 Japanese  woodcut by Ito Shinsui, which depicts a delicately drawn woman draped in a  loosely fitting blue garment against a solid, tomato-red backdrop. Thomas  Silliman, director of the gallery, calls the piece the most important Japanese  woodcut of the 20th Century.  </P> <P> The gallery, whose entire collection is donated, also contains original works  by Giovanni Piranesi, one of the original modern architecture illustrators,  Rufino Tamayo, considered by some the foremost Mexican artist alive today, and  Howard Warshaw, an important contemporary American artist.  </P> <P> The idea was to provide a hands-on "study collection" full of works from  various schools and types of art, Price said.  </P> <P> "This is something students can actually take and touch and feel and do what  they want with," he said. "Too much art is rarefied. A gallery is meant to  serve the community. There isn't another museum or gallery in our community  that does that. Certainly the Getty doesn't do it."  </P> <P> Added Silliman: "This is the real thing. And to be turned on by art, you've got  to see the real thing. A picture in a book in which a painting is reduced to  dots on a page can only remind you of what you saw. This is the first time many  people have seen this stuff. We have an obligation to turn them on."  </P> <P> Over the years, the gallery, which charges no admission, has inspired a few  people who have gone on to achieve national recognition. One is actor Edward  James Olmos, who starred in the TV series "Miami Vice," the motion picture  "Stand and Deliver" and the Broadway play "Zoot Suit." Olmos said the Vincent  Price Gallery was his first real exposure not only to rare artworks but to  artistic genius and individual potential.  </P> <P> "It definitely molded and shaped my career," Olmos said. The years that he  spent at East Los Angeles College (1964-66) rank among "the most influential  moments of my life, especially having access to the kind of artworks that I was  exposed to. It really elevated my awareness. What that gallery has meant to the  community in the east part of Los Angeles has been overwhelming. It has created  some extraordinary people."  </P> <P> Now, the collection may be on the brink of moving out of community college  obscurity. At a meeting of the gallery's foundation earlier this month, Allen  Bassing, director of the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in  Washington, said the Smithsonian may agree to jointly sponsor a traveling  exhibition of the gallery's works.  </P> <P> "I think it would be very important for the collection at the gallery to have  national exposure," said Bassing, who was invited to the college by Dean of  Instruction Kenneth Hunt. "This is a unique facility. It's comparable to a  collection at a very well-endowed university art gallery. It's obvious to me  that Vincent Price has a real eye for art. He's able to look at material and  separate the dross from the real thing. There are very few people who collect  with such an international sphere."  </P> <P> The gallery now owns approximately 1,500 pieces of art -- about three-fourths  of it donated by Price -- with an estimated value of more than $5 million,  Silliman said. Other significant donations have come from Mexican art  connoisseurs Stephen Lafer and Bernard Lewin. Lewin is owner of B. Lewin  Galleries and a prominent dealer in Mexican art. Screenwriter William Link and  rock musician Graham Nash have contributed to the collection as well.  </P> <P> But such acquisition success has its drawbacks. The gallery is now bursting at  the seams, unable to display or properly light many of its masterworks. A  sampling of the gallery's finest art hangs in a small, 25-by-25-foot original  showroom, and the balance of the vast collection must be stored in the  college's old library stacks, which now serve as a makeshift vault. A newer  50-by-50-foot space, opened in 1986, is used for current shows, but it is  lighted by ultraviolet-emitting fluorescent lights that rob paintings of  brilliance and slowly fade the original colors to bluish shades.  </P> <P> "The gallery has never been funded properly," said Silliman, who has taught  classes in art appreciation and display techniques, in addition to his gallery  duties, since arriving in 1957 while still a UCLA graduate student. "It's  always been out of my pocket or somebody else's pocket."  </P> <P> "We're very concerned about the lack of ability to support the gallery at a  higher level," said Omero Suarez, East Los Angeles College president. "It's a  tremendous showpiece, a jewel in East L.A., and we need to expose it more to  our community. We need a new facility; we need to upgrade the building that  houses it, but the resources are not available."  </P> <P> Indeed, funding was spread so thin after passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 that  the gallery was forced to close in 1979 for a year. The college administration  budgeted $11,400 for the gallery this year -- the first such appropriation  since Proposition 13, Silliman said. The college, which has about 14,000  students, has a budget of $18 million this year.  </P> <P> To protect the collection and help raise money for a new building, the Los  Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees last June established the  Vincent Price Art Gallery Foundation, said Wallace Albertson, chairwoman of the  new foundation and former president of the community college board of trustees.  Albertson said one of the foundation's first priorities is to put together a  brochure and cover letter from Price to send to potential supporters. The other  is to solve the lighting problem in the showroom.  </P> <P> "We see this collection as being not only a resource to this campus but to the  other eight campuses in the Los Angeles Community College District. There have  been cooperative showings with other institutions, but nothing as major as  there could be if we really get our act together and get organized," said  Albertson, widow of actor Jack Albertson.  </P> <P> A jointly sponsored traveling exhibition, such as one with the Smithsonian,  could generate rental fees from participating museums and galleries around the  country, said Hunt, the dean of instruction.  </P> <P> Even on a shoestring budget, the gallery has racked up a number of  achievements. In 1981, it sponsored the first show by Mexican artist Tamayo in  the United States, Silliman said. The gallery co-sponsored the first  state-funded Chicano art exhibit in 1975, and in 1968 it was the first gallery  or museum in the nation to show cinema as an art form, he said.  </P> <P> The gallery, as part of an ongoing series of one-man shows titled "Coming Home  Again," plans to feature the art of East Los Angeles College alumni, including  Gilbert Lujan, Kent Twitchell and Gronk, who have become accomplished artists.  Last semester, the gallery staged a retrospective of works by alumnus George  Yepes, the artist known for his cover of the Los Lobos album, "La Pistola y El  Corazon," and his darkly passionate and dreamlike interpretations of such  primal themes as death, lust, decadence and pride.  </P> <P> The gallery's most popular shows have attracted more than 25,000 visitors from  the college and surrounding community during the exhibits' four- to six-week  runs, Silliman said.  </P> <P> And, inevitably, some puzzle over the Vincent Price connection.  </P> <P> "When I first came here in 1957, my first comment was, 'What is Vincent Price  doing with an art collection in a dump like this?' " Silliman said. "And it  still applies. But the question is the answer: It's really needed here. That's  been my whole cause, and Mr. Price's too -- accessibility to art. If it's not  at the community colleges, then Jesus God, where is it going to be? There's  still a kind of barrier. Art museums tend to be elitist. It's the fur coats who  get invited to the openings."  </P> <P> Price's introduction to the college came when he was invited to speak there in  1951 about "the aesthetic responsibility of the citizen." Challenged by the art  department chairman to initiate a collection there, he and his then-wife did so  because they were impressed by students' interest "in something as foreign and  as far away from the necessities of life to them as art," Price said.  </P> <P> His affection was cemented a few years later after several works of art were  stolen out of a storage closet. The art department posted a sign reading: "Mr.  and Mrs. Price gave this collection for all the students."  </P> <P> The thief returned the art.  </P> <P> "That," Price said, "endeared me forever to it."  </P> <P> * THE VINCENT PRICE GALLERY  </P> <P> The Vincent Price Gallery is located on the campus of East Los Angeles College,  1301 Brooklyn Ave., Monterey Park. Its next show, "Some of Our Favorite  Things," featuring masterworks from the gallery's collection, will open Feb.  20. During the exhibition, the gallery's hours are noon to 3 p.m., Monday to  Friday, other times by appointment. The phone number is (213) 265-8841.  Admission is free.  </P></p>

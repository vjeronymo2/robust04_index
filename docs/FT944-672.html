			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / International Company News: Matif clears hurdle in its bid for UK recognition Matif, the French futures and options market, has cleared an important hurdle in its bid to gain recognition as an investment exchange in the UK. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, said yesterday that two features of Matif, while potentially anti-competitive, did not have that result at present. The OFT said it would keep 'under review' the effects of the two rules, which cover a limit on membership numbers and the capital requirements upon them. It nevertheless recommended that Matif be granted permission to operate and thereby cleared the way for Matif futures and options to be offered on electronic trading terminals in the UK. Trading on Matif takes place on an exchange floor using 'open outcry'. Out of hours, however, Matif products are bought and sold on the Reuters Globex system and recognition will allow UK traders to use this facility. From the end of 1995 two Matif contracts are scheduled for quotation on terminals of Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures exchange. If both Matif and DTB gain formal status in the UK, products from both exchanges will also become available on-screen in the UK during working hours. Liffe, the London exchange, said recognition of Matif was an inevitable consequence of the opening of European markets. It said it was in close discussion with the Paris authorities on winning reciprocal access in France. Futures traders said the spread of terminals of different exchanges would help them save costs by concentrating execution of transactions in fewer hubs. The Globex system has lacked liquidity and the inclusion of Matif products will increase its attractions to users.</p>

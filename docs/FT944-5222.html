			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Wind shear The first commercial aircraft with instruments to warn the pilot of potentially fatal wind shear flew from Washington to Cleveland last Wednesday. Wind shear is a sharp difference in the speed of air movement from one spot to another nearby. It becomes a hazard to aircraft, primarily on take-off or landing. By the end of next year, every airliner - domestic or foreign - landing in the US will be required to have similar equipment. 'This is a significant step forward in aircraft safety,' said Chuck Miller, president of AlliedSignal, which makes electronic systems for aircraft. The system has been three years in development. Continental Airlines flight 1637 had little use for its bad-weather instrument on the maiden flight last week. If there had been turbulence containing microbursts - brief, powerful gusts of air, usually moving straight down - the pilot would have had up to 90 seconds' warning, enough time to avoid wind shear.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLLING PLACE GUARDS  </P> <P> I believe that the district attorney's office made a mistake in investigating  the 20 security guards involved at the Santa Ana polling stations. It was a  waste of time because the guards were hired and were following orders from the  Orange County Republican officials, headed by Tom Fuentes. These are the people  to be investigated.  </P> <P> What an excuse by the Republican Party. It's outrageous. This means that the  party can take the law and play judge, jury and executioner. Hasn't Tom Fuentes  heard that we have police and sheriff's departments to handle such supposed  incidents?  </P> <P> Orange County Republican officials made a grave and, I am sure, an intentional  mistake. They should pay for it.  </P> <P> VIC PENA  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

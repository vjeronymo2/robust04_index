			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Senate has suspended the impeachment of  [Supreme Court Justices] Edgar Oblitas and Ernesto Pope.    Senate President Juan Carlos Duran has stated that the  impeachment was suspended in compliance with a decision by the  Congress stating that the two houses cannot work separately. A  few days ago the Chamber of Deputies declared a recess until 6  June, and the Senate had to follow suit and thus suspend the  impeachment process. [passage omitted]</p>

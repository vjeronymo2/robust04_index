			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean earthquake threatens banana trade THE world banana trade faces severe disruption following the major earthquake which struck the Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica and Panama last Monday evening. Approximately 35 per cent of the world's banana exports originate in the zone worst affected by the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. Some 25,000 hectares of bananas are planted in Costa Rica and 8,000 hectares on the Panamanian side of the border. Bananas are the principal export of both countries. 'It is too early to say yet how long production will be disrupted. We are still assessing the damage,' said Mr Joe Hagan, the vice-president of corporate affairs for the Cincinnati-based Chiquita Brands International company. Chiquita is one of the world's leading banana producers and is a major exporter from both countries affected by the disaster. The economic infrastructure of the region has suffered extensive damage: roads, railways, ports, water and electricity supplies have all been severely disrupted, according to Costa Rica's National Emergency Commission. The two banana-exporting ports of Puerto Limon and Almirante have suffered considerable damage and have suspended operations. According to one eye-witness 'containers and railway trucks were thrown all over the place'. However, Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's foreign trade minister, said that the Moin quay at Puerto Limon - which is the main banana-loading wharf - 'has not suffered major structural damage'. The principal problem there appears to be a reduction in the depth of the water in the harbour because of the upheaval of the seabed. According to Mr Antonio Restrepo, the spokesman for the Union of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB) based in Panama, one and a half million boxes of bananas are shipped from Puerto Limon every week, and a further 300,000 boxes every week from Almirante in Panama. Even if the ports can be put back into operation reasonably quickly, access will be difficult because of the severing of road and rail links. The epicentre of the earthquake occured 40km south-east of the port. Damage to bridges along the main highway to Puerto Limon 'may take a week to repair, but those to the south will take much longer as many have fallen into the rivers. It could be quite a while before exports can be resumed,' said Mr Rojas. A Costa Rican pilot who has been flying rescue missions to the earthquake-hit border region between Costa Rica and Panama said: 'Huge trees look as they have been pulled out by the roots. All the bridges between the frontier and Puerto Limon are out and the road is destroyed. There is no way to get the maturing bananas out'. Adding to the difficulties, many of the plantation workers' homes have been destroyed or damaged, along with administrative buildings and packing plants. It remains unclear to what extent the plantations themselves have been affected, but it is possible that many banana trees laden with fruit fell to the ground during the earthquake. It takes between six and nine months for a damaged banana tree to produce a new stem.</p>

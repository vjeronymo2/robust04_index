			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF: GLENDALE;  </P> <P> POLICE FIND BODY OF MAN, 67, IN HOUSE  </P> <P> A blood-stained car in a Van Nuys parking lot led police Thursday to a Glendale  house where a 67-year-old man was found dead, authorities said. "We think it's  a homicide, but we haven't done an autopsy yet," said Bob Dambacher, spokesman  for the county coroner's office.  </P> <P> Dambacher said the man's identity was being withheld until his family could be  notified. He said the man was a resident of a one-story duplex in the 1400  block of Wilson Avenue where the body was found. Glendale police said the  investigation originated in a Van Nuys restaurant lot, where Los Angeles Police  Department officers were summoned to examine a suspicious vehicle at 7 a.m.  Thursday. The car was registered to a Glendale resident, and officers went to  the Wilson Avenue residence in an effort to find the car's owner. Officers  entered the house and found the victim inside, the report said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Uzbekistan President Islam  Karimov said Wednesday [18 May] that his central Asian nation  and Japan can both profit from increased economic cooperation.    Karimov, who is on a four-day visit to Japan, said at a news  conference that Japan can use advanced technology and know-how  to help Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, develop its vast  mineral resources such as gold, copper and oil.    "We are having talks with Japanese leaders of various fields  here. I think bilateral economic cooperation will increase at a  rapid pace," he said.    As one effort to promote economic cooperation, Karimov said  Uzbekistan is ready to open air links with Japan.    In talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday,  Karimov  said that both leaders discussed the possibility of opening an  air route between the two nations.    On domestic issues, Karimov said Uzbekistan, which became  independent in August 1991, will hold a parliamentary election  in December to elect 150 new legislators.    Rejecting the view that his government has oppressed  opposition groups, Karimov said under the constitution all  existing parties in Uzbekistan can take part in the election, to  which he said the United Nations did not raise any objection.    The president also stressed the importance of the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as having served to  prevent the former Soviet republics from falling into civil war.    "I see the future of CIS depends on its power to integrate  (its members) economically," Karimov said.    Karimov will leave for home on Thursday after visiting the  ancient capital of Kyoto in western Japan.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Abu Dhabi shares contested A FEDERAL judge in Washington has been asked to order the Abu Dhabi government to hand over shares of First American Bankshares, the US bank illegally controlled by the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). The unusual legal wrangle was instigated by lawyers acting for Mr Harry Albright, the independent trustee appointed last June after the Federal Reserve Board ordered that First American be sold. This move came after BCCI admitted its guilt in secretly controlling First American. Mr Albright said the court action was 'essential' and followed 'long and continuous negotiations' that failed to persuade Abu Dhabi to hand over the shares. Mr Sandy Martin, a partner at the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs and Blow, representing Abu Dhabi, said the First American shares had been registered in Mr Albright's name. However, some of the shares are held by Abu Dhabi as security on a Dollars 9.5m loan, 'we believe that unless we are told otherwise by a court it is our obligation to retain possession of the certificates', he said.</p>

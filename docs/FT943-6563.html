			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Saudi gems theft linked to saga of assassination: Diplomat has issued ultimatum and linked Thai killings to palace theft It is an extraordinary tale of theft, assassination and corruption on a grand scale that has shredded the reputation of the Thai police and caused a bitter diplomatic row between Saudi Arabia and Thailand. In the latest twist to the five-year-old saga, Saudi Arabia said last week it believed the murders of three of its Bangkok embassy staff and the disappearance and presumed murder of a Saudi businessman in Thailand were linked to the theft of jewellery worth millions of pounds from a Saudi palace. 'They were all killed because they had information about the jewellery,' Saudi charge d'affaires Mohammed Said Khoja said last Friday, adding that detectives from his country had determined the link. Mr Khoja, who directly accused Thai police of one of the killings, said he was due to discuss the issue with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai this week. 'Frankly I am fed up and the government of Saudi Arabia cannot wait any longer,' he said. In 1989 a Thai servant stole Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) worth of jewellery from a Saudi palace where he was employed. He fled back to Thailand and was arrested in 1990 and jailed. However, much of the jewellery returned to Saudi Arabia was fake. Shortly afterwards, the wife of the director-general of police, General Sawat Amornwiwat, was pictured in the local press wearing a necklace remarkably similar to one of those stolen from the palace. But as recriminations flew, hitmen started killing Saudi diplomats. Between 1989 and 1990 three diplomats were gunned down, apparently by professional killers. As relations with Saudi Arabia spiralled downwards, Thai authorities put forward a number of contradictory and sometimes unlikely explanations for the murderous campaign. Religious zealots, drug dealers, business conflicts, Mafia-style gangsters and terrorists were all suspected. But Saudi unhappiness reached its nadir with the revelation that a businessman close to the Saudi royal family, Mr Mohammed Al-Ruwaily, who disappeared after the murder of the diplomats, was probably abducted by a group of Thai policemen. The police officer who led the investigation into the murder of the diplomats, Lt Col Somkid Boonthanom, was later accused of Mr Al-Ruwaily's murder, but the case was dropped in September 1993. The links between the three cases - the theft, the embassy murders and the abduction - remain obscure. No fewer than three parliamentary committees and two police committees were set up to look solely into the Saudi grievances. But even now, Thai inquiries have still run into difficulties. Mr Khoja, an urbane 60-year old diplomat, was posted to Bangkok three-and-a-half years ago either to wrap up the murder and theft cases or to close down the embassy. The Saudis have stopped issuing work permits to Thai nationals, at an estimated cost to the economy of up to Dollars 1bn a year in lost remittances. Under prime minister Mr Chuan Leekpai and a respected new police chief, Gen Pratin Santiprapop, some progress has eventually been made. But Thailand is still a long way from repairing relations with Saudi Arabia.</p>

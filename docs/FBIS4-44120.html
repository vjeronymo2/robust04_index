			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said that he  learned in Corfu that the European Union [EU] intends, once  certain difficulties are overcome concerning the accession of a  new group of countries, for Cyprus and Malta to be included in  that group. In a statement at Larnaca Airport after his return  to Cyprus, President Kliridhis said these difficulties are not  concerned with the Cyprus problem but with internal EU issues.    Referring to developments in the Cyprus issue, President  Kliridhis reiterated that the Greek side is adhering to the 21  March document and does not accept anything done after that at  consultations held without its participation. President  Kliridhis further said that he found understanding from his  interlocutors in Corfu that there should be progress with regard  to both the substance of the Cyprus issue and the  confidence-building measures.    Regarding his meeting in Athens with the Greek National  Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, President Kliridhis said he  was fully briefed on Mr. Arsenis' contacts in Washington.  Kliridhis noted: The United States never raised any questions  about the Greece-Cyprus defense doctrine.</p>

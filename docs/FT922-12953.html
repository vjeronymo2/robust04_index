			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: Boeing and GEC to study defence systems link-up BOEING of the US and Britain's GEC group are to study collaboration in defence systems in response to shrinking military markets. A broad agreement covering 'selective aerospace business opportunities' has been signed between Boeing's defence and space division and GEC-Marconi, the defence equipment arm of the British group. Although described as a wide-ranging strategic alliance, the agreement is expected to be of limited scope, at least in the early stages. GEC-Marconi indicated that any co-operation was likely to focus initially on maritime surveillance, with a view to upgrading or replacing the RAF's current Nimrod patrol aircraft. However, the two companies said they aimed to pursue possible joint projects in a range of areas. These could include missile systems. The precedent for an open-ended collaboration agreement of this kind between US and British defence companies was set two years ago by British Aerospace and General Dynamics. However, their association has so far failed to produce significant concrete results.</p>

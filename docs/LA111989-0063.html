			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: FRIEDEN UND FREIHEIT:  </P> <P> Graham Nash's last solo album featured a barbed broadside about the Berlin Wall  titled "Over the Wall." After the historic events of the past week, Nash feels  the song is more timely than ever. So he's rushed Steve Stills and David Crosby  into the studio to redo the song's vocals, CSN style. Nash says the song will  be out as a single within 10 days. "We're signed to Atlantic, so I'd like them  to put it out," he said. "But if they don't want to get involved, we'll just  press up 1,000 copies and send them out to radio ourselves." Nash added that  CSN will begin recording a new album in January, with a proposed April release  date, to be followed by a four-month summer concert tour.  </P></p>

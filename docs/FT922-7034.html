			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Italy must act to meet Emu goals, say EC ministers ITALIAN economic policy is in danger of sliding out of control, European Community finance ministers said yesterday. They called on Italy's caretaker government to take drastic and immediate action 'to put the Italian budget back on the track' towards economic and monetary union (Emu). In a strongly worded communique, the ministers said there would be 'significant adverse repercussions throughout the Community' if Italy failed to meet the economic convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty by 1996. They added: 'Strong measures cannot be further postponed, as the size of the emerging slippage is such as to undermine the credibility of Italian economic policy.' Italy presented plans to improve its budget deficit and reduce inflation last November, but EC ministers are worried that not enough has been done since to meet stated targets. They estimate that a L30,000bn (Pounds 13.5bn) package of spending cuts and reforms is needed if Italy is to meet its 1992 target of reducing the deficit to L127,800bn. Mr Guido Carli, Italy's finance minister who lost his seat in the recent election, said priority should be given to reforming healthcare and pensions once a new government was formed. Finance ministers also expressed their concern that German plans to meet the Emu targets might be over-optimistic. Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, said inflation - 4.7 per cent in April - could come down to 3.75 per cent by the end of this year. He added that the general government deficit would rise from 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product last year to 3.1 per cent this year, before returning to 2.6 per cent in 1993 - well inside the Emu target of 3 per cent by 1996. But Mr Waigel's figures contradicted those approved by the ministers, which indicated a deficit of 4.1 per cent in 1992, dropping to 3.3 per cent in 1993 and 1.9 per cent by 1995. Mr Waigel tried to reassure fellow ministers that central government would be able to hold in check spending by the Lander and municipal councils. But Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, afterwards voiced other ministers' scepticism about the German plans and effectiveness of economic co-operation between Bonn and the Lander. His own country has imposed much stricter budget deficit targets than Germany. Spanish threat, Page 2 Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

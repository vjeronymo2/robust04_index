			<p>BFN     [Text] Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, and Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Chairman Miro  Lazovic held talks today in Zagreb with Croatian Assembly  Chairman Stipe Mesic. The main topic was how to preserve an  integral Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nada al-Isa reports on these talks:    [Begin al-Isa recording] Stipe Mesic listened with pleasure  to the information provided him by Messrs. Pejanovic and Lazovic  after their return from Moscow, where they went as members of  the Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They stressed  that they had held talks in Moscow with Vitaliy Churkin, who  said for the first time that Russia, too, wanted to preserve the  territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He openly said  that he no longer trusted Karadzic.    Pejanovic and Lazovic discussed Croatian-Muslim relations,  that is, the future federation, with Stipe Mesic. Messrs.  Lazovic and Pejanovic addressed the same issues at today's news  conference in Zagreb. In order to help improve relations  between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Stipe Mesic accepted the invitation by  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic to visit  Sarajevo soon. He will come, he said, as soon as this week's  assembly session was over.    As is known, the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] has  been  announcing that it will seek Mesic's removal at the session.  However, Mesic says: I will remain the chairman of the assembly  even after the session. They will not manage to remove me, even  though they are hoping to. Mesic revealed specially for Radio  Television Bosnia-Herzegovina the latest news from the Croatian  political scene, which, by the way, has still not been announced  in Zagreb. The entire Zagreb county, the largest one in Croatia  and politically the most attractive, has left the HDZ and joined  Mesic's Party of Independent Croatian Democrats [HND]. Mesic  says that, because of that, many HDZ members in Zagreb will not  be able to sleep tonight.    Finally, Stipe Mesic told the Sarelians that he will come  and  visit them very soon, in his position as assembly chairman -- he  claims -- and he does not believe in the rumors that the UN  Protection Force [UNPROFOR] is creating transportation problems  from Zagreb to Sarajevo, as some claim in the presidential  quarters in Zagreb.

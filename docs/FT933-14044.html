			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Italians calm row over role in Somalia THE Italian government yesterday sought to calm the row over the role of its 2,600-strong peacekeeping contingent with the United Nations in Somalia. In an effort to restore a dialogue, Italian diplomats will meet representatives of the UN and the US State Department in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, today. A senior official will also go to New York in the next few days. 'We must try to lower the temperature of the argument as soon as possible,' Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the Italian foreign minister, told parliament. He said he had been in close contact with Mr Warren Christopher, his US opposite number, in an attempt to defuse tension over Italy's criticism of US military tactics in Somalia. 'We are in Somalia and wish to remain there,' Mr Andreatta added. 'We are well aware that one has to shoot and use force. But it is still the sovereign right of a government to have differences of view on these issues.' It is the first time in recent years Italy has been in such open disagreement with allies and an international body such as the UN. The row led Mr Kofi Annan, in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, to call for removal of General Bruno Loi, the Italian commander, for defying UN orders. The Italian government replied by giving full backing to Gen Loi and threatening to pull out of Somalia. As a gesture of support for Gen Loi, it was announced yesterday he would be visited by Gen Mario Buscemi, deputy chief of staff. The UN yesterday sought to patch up its strained relations with Italy but still insisted on the removal of Gen Loi. Mr Joe Sills, a UN spokesman said that he understood Gen Loi would leave 'fairly quickly'. Mr Sills also confirmed that the Italian peacekeepers could be redeployed away from Mogadishu as soon as replacements were assembled.</p>

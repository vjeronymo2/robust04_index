At the end of the event, UCC President Carlos del Campo  said:  "We hope to materialize a new political party of national  interest." Del Campo met with the media accompanied by PN  President Enrique Schilling, who attended the assembly in his  capacity as a guest.    The two politicians agreed on the principles that unite  their  respective parties, and voiced their pleasure with the request  by a group of independent liberals headed by Luis Claro  Lagarrigue to join the new group.

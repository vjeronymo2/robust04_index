			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast, under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directed to carry out those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, the HSWA applies in authorized States in the interim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's amendments are not imposed pursuant to HSWA. The rule changes, therefore, will become effective immediately only in those States without interim or final authorization, not in authorized States. The effect of the rule changes on authorized State programs is discussed next.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Effect on Authorized State Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule will not be effective in authorized States since the requirements are not being imposed pursuant to HSWA. Thus, the requirements will be applicable only in those States that do not have interim or final authorization. In authorized States, the requirements will not be applicable until the State revises its program to adopt equivalent requirements under State laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and must subsequently submit the modifications to EPA for approval. However, it should be noted that authorized States are only required to modify their programs when EPA promulgates Federal standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than the existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. See 40 CFR 271.1(k). Today's amendments to &sect;261.4 reduce the scope of the existing Federal requirements. Therefore, authorized States will not be required to modify their programs to adopt requirements equivalent or substantially equivalent to the provisions proposed today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as noted above, States are required by &sect;271.21 to revise their programs to reflect Federal program changes. 51 FR 33722 (September 22, 1986). A number of States qualified for final authorization prior to being required to adopt the redefinition of solid waste rulemaking of January 4, 1985 (50 FR 614). Since the January 4, 1985 rule is more stringent than the rule under which such States were authorized, such States were required to revise their programs in accordance with Part 271.21. Today's changes will not preclude EPA's ability to authorize States which have subsequently adopted the January 4, 1985 rule since it would reduce the scope of the Federal requirements. However, certain aspects of the State's regulation will be broader in scope than the Federal program and therefore not part of the authorized State program. This means that while they are enforceable under State law, they are not subject to Federal enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 271.21(e) provides for extensions of time at the discretion of the Regional Administrator for States to adopt changes to their regulations and/or statutes to conform to change in the Federal program. The question arises, however, of whether States which have not yet adopted the January 4 rule must adhere to EPA's published compliance schedules for such adoption. Where States have delayed rulemaking pending today's rulemaking clarifying the impact of the court's decision, the EPA Regional Administrators may be flexible in further extending the modification deadlines. EPA Regional Administrators should take into account the States' regulatory and/or legislative procedures in deciding what further extensions may be warranted. However, any States which have delayed rulemaking should now proceed to expeditiously adopt the January 4, 1985 rules as amended by today's notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XII. Regulatory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Regulatory Impact Analysis Pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order No. 12866 [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)], the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), requires Federal regulatory agencies to consider the impact of rulemaking on ``small entities.'' If a rulemaking will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, agencies must consider regulatory alternatives that minimize economic impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rulemaking does not have a significant impact on any small entity. Rather, it excludes from the definition of solid waste certain petroleum materials being recycled within the petroleum industry. Accordingly, this deregulatory action will not add any economic burdens to any affected entities, small or large, and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Therefore, the Administrator certifies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because today's amendments reduce the scope of the Subtitle C regulatory program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA must consider the paperwork burden imposed by any information collection request in a proposed or final rule. This rule will not impose any new information collection requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

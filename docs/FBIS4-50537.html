			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak today asserted the importance of resuming the Middle  East peace talks till peace is established.    Speaking at a press conference he gave here together with  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mubarak said the  U.S. official had briefed him on efforts made over the past two  days during his talks with Syrian and Israeli officials.    "We are working along with the U.S. for settling the Syrian-  Israeli problem," he added.    On the situation in Yemen, Mubarak said that he had warned  against resorting to force. "Force will not solve any problem,"  he stressed.    In a speech delivered at the beginning of the press  conference, Mubarak said that both Syria and Israel are badly in  need of establishing peace. "Time has come to solve any  outstanding problems hindering establishing peace between the  two countries," he noted.    Christopher, who arrived here earlier today, spoke highly of  Egypt's role in the Middle East peace process. He also said  Syria has an important role to play in the process.    The U.S. official said he had conveyed Israeli views to  Syria  on settling their disputes, and is waiting for a solution  acceptable to both sides.    Christopher is on his third Middle East shuttle since  December.    Syria and Israel have exchanged proposals for a  land-for-peace deal. Under the formula, Israel should withdraw  from the Golan Heights it occupied in the 1967 Middle East war  in return for recognition, peace and guaranteed security from  Syria. Issues of dispute between the two sides include the  timing of the withdrawal, security guarantees, the fate of  13,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan, and normalization of  relations under a peace treaty.</p>

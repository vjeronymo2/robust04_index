Additionally, this notice proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Drake Field, Fayetteville, AR. The development of a new Microwave Landing System (MLS) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing the MLS SIAP at Drake Field, Fayetteville, AR.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before February 2, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to Manager, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Docket No. 94&hyph;ASW&hyph;19, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530.

Additionally, the FAA is considering an amendment to the Class E airspace, controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL, which currently overlies Drake Field, Fayetteville, AR. The development of a new MLS SIAP to RWY 34 has made this proposal to establish Class E airspace and to amend existing Class E Airspace necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the MLS SIAP to RWY 34 at Drake Field, Fayetteville, AR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace area designated as an extension to a Class D surface area are published in Paragraph 6004 and designated Class E airspace area extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

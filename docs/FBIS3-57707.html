This was said to Interfax by a  high-ranking official from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry.    Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk called upon the  parliament to ratify the START I and to sign the treaty on  nonproliferation on January 24.    According to the diplomat, the parliament's plenary session  may finish on Monday with no decision made on the president's  proposal. This will mean that the settlement of the issue will  be deferred for an undetermined period of time.    "The Russian president suspended the Supreme Soviet's powers  and assumed its authority for the period of transition," the  diplomat remarked. "However, the Ukrainian Constitution does not  mention the right of the president to sign documents on joining  international treaties in the period of parliamentary  elections," he emphasized.    Deputy Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasuk said that  the  withdrawal of nuclear military charge from Ukrainian territory  would continue until the guaranteed terms for their utilization  expired.</p>

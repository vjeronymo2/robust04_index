			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada Toronto closed higher in quiet post-holiday trading, but the rise was tempered by falling gold issues and a severe drop in Newbridge Networks' stock. The TSE 300 index gained 15.3 at 4,194.3 and advances outnumbered declines by 373 to 346. Volume was 49m shares valued at CDollars 624.3m. Newbridge plummeted CDollars 17 7/8 to CDollars 40 3/8 after the company warned on Monday that its earnings for the fiscal first quarter would fall short of analysts' estimates. The gold sub-index hampered the market with the day's biggest decline of 2.0 per cent as the price of gold bullion fell USDollars 4.70 an ounce to USDollars 379.15 in New York. Among gold stocks, Placer Dome shed CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 28 1/8 after its Placer Pacific subsidiary reported an explosion and fire at the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea.</p>

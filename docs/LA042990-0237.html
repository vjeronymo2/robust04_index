A Horned Rhinoceros beetle? Maybe  a lavender grasshopper? Cathy Endfield can help.  </P> <P> In film and video circles, she's known as the butterfly lady. Endfield is a  specialist in insect art. Her Sherman Oaks home is crammed with insects --  thousands of them, stashed in drawers, mounted and hoarded in bags. Endfield  rents her bugs to film studios, special-effects shops, photographers and anyone  else with such a hankering.  </P> <P> Recently Endfield supplied insects for "Arachnophobia," an Amblin-Hollywood  Pictures production. But creating art pieces by incorporating these creatures  into collages and assemblages is her true avocation. "I'm into insect art," the  butterfly lady says.  </P> <P>  For further information, telephone Cathy Endfield; (818) 783-4357. DENISE  HAMILTON  </P></p>

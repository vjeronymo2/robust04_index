			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD: CHIEF EXECUTIVES WILL NEED GLOBAL VIEW IN THE 1990S  </P> <P> America's chief executive, President Bush, has gained considerable mileage from  his vision of a "kinder, gentler nation." CEOs of American business, however,  should prepare for a tougher, more turbulent marketplace in the decade ahead.  </P> <P> The men and women who pilot American companies in the 1990s aren't likely to be  any smarter or more ambitious than their current counterparts. But tomorrow's  superior companies will be led by a new breed of chief executive -- one who is  knowledgeable on global issues and their application to marketing strategy, is  adept at anticipating change, acts swiftly and communicates those insights and  actions to employees and shareholders.  </P> <P> Five major challenges confront the CEO of the '90s:  </P> <P> Acting globally: In the '80s, only the brightest American corporate leaders  considered the global market for their business. In the '90s, corporate leaders  can't just think globally, they must act globally, and in every aspect of their  businesses. In fact, CEOs who have not yet addressed the impact and  opportunities of global markets in corporate planning are already lagging  behind their competition.  </P> <P> Many companies today pay lip service to being multinational when, in fact, they  are actually a cluster of unrelated worldwide entities contributing to the same  bottom line. To leverage off the global presence of their companies, CEOs must  forge a unification of disparate company entities while recognizing the  peculiarities of the individual markets.  </P> <P> The Pacific Rim emerged in the '80s as a source of competition and a trove of  opportunities for U.S. business. The unification of the European Community in  1992 also presents comparable opportunities, to say nothing of a rapidly  opening Eastern Europe. The smartest CEOs must thoroughly understand the  cultural and business differences among -- and in -- each of these foreign  markets.  </P> <P> The best CEOs will recognize the potential of millions of consumers and vast  raw materials in these markets. Thoroughly assessing foreign markets and  developing new ways of doing business in foreign operations will be  prerequisites for success.  </P> <P> Using technology to gain competitive advantage: The implementation of  information technology is changing the way companies operate today. However  technology is used, it will play a critical role in a company's success or  failure. CEOs must consider advanced technology not as an added luxury but as a  necessity.  </P> <P> Effectively competing in the global arena will require integrating technology  into all aspects of a company's operations, with a corporate commitment to  maintaining sophistication.  </P> <P> Competing against non-traditional forces: Competition will emerge not only from  foreign markets but also from the new companies formed by mergers and  acquisitions. In addition, companies that were once customers may become  competitors.  </P> <P> With few exceptions, industry leaders in the '90s will not be well served by  competing on price alone. Quality -- in both products and services -- will  become an essential way that companies will attempt to differentiate  themselves. Many firms today have established mandates to improve quality at  every level in the company. Motorola, Xerox and Westinghouse Electric, for  example, have been nationally recognized for achieving progress through a  top-down commitment to quality.  </P> <P> Approaching the new labor force: The CEO's role as coach and manager will  evolve in the next decade as he or she tries to direct, without dissuading, a  new breed of manager that is more entrepreneurial in nature. As the corporate  organizational structure of the '90s becomes increasingly flat, CEOs must be  able to effectively direct fewer management levels with more multifunctional  positions.  </P> <P> The changing profile of the American family and the average life style will  also necessitate how the CEO views the work force. The way that the CEO  addresses such issues as child care, parental leave, flex-time schedules and  fitness facilities will affect the loyalty of all ranks within organizations.  </P> <P> Changing the profile of mergers and acquisitions: Mergers and acquisitions will  continue, but progressive CEOs will increasingly look to those that enhance  existing capabilities or provide access to new markets and services. As  business leaders wisely move away from the "scorched earth" cost-cutting  policies of the '80s, the measure of corporate financial performance will shift  from short-term profit gains to the improvement of company and shareholder  value created by strategically formed alliances.  </P> <P> The most effective CEOs will be those who recognize the priority of identifying  value in their companies. They will concentrate on profitable activities while  reducing marginal business. They will set ambitious yet obtainable goals and  will communicate their progress and optimism to the financial community and  employees.  </P> <P> To say that the role of the CEO in the '90s will be more difficult may be a  gross understatement. What is certain is that corporate success will depend on  the CEO's ability to adapt effectively to a rapidly changing business  environment.  </P></p>

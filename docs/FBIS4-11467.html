			<p>BFN     [Text] Manaus -- As of 23 April, the Colombian Army has  been deporting Brazilian gold miners who are mining illegally in  Colombia. According to the Amazonia Military Command (CMA),  during the past few days 300 Brazilian gold miners have been  repatriated through the town of Tabatinga (AM) [Amazonas State],  some 1,500 km from Manaus, on the border with Leticia, Colombia.    The CMA reported that it is supporting the Brazilians,  lodging them at the 8th Jungle Infantry battalion in Tabatinga.  A FAB [Brazilian Air Force] plane was sent there to bring the  gold miners to Manaus. Federal Police also are participating in  the operation.    According to the CMA, 84 gold miners already have been  transported to Manaus in a FAP Buffalo plane. A Colombian Air  Force plane today will transport another group of 90 Brazilians  to Leticia. There have been no reports of any discord between  the Colombian military and the gold miners.    The Brazilian Army also has carried out operations with the  Venezuelan National Guard to repatriate Brazilian gold miners.  According to Itamaraty, within the next few days the two armies  will repatriate 136 gold miners from the Roriama  State-Venezuelan border.</p>

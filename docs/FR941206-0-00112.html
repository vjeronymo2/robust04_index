			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of programmers have expressed the view that the cable industry's ability to create new programming networks that can benefit consumers depends on operators' being able to offer new services in packages of programming. These programmers urge the Commission to provide increased incentives to cable operators to offer such packages of new programming services. Other commenters suggest that a marketplace system is preferable to regulation in certain programming and tiering decisions. In addition, as reflected in the record, many  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  comments support the adoption of rules allowing operators to establish tiers of new services priced at market rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is concerned, based on the comments filed by operators and programmers, that the current rules may not provide sufficient incentives for operators to expand capacity and provide new services to consumers. Accordingly, the Commission is establishing a new category of CPST_an NPT_that will provide additional incentives for operators to provide new services to consumers because operators will be permitted to price these tiers as they choose. The new rules also will help programmers by encouraging operators to add new attractive programming to NPTs in order to induce customers to subscribe to the NPTs. NPTs are, by definition. ``cable programming services'' under the 1992 Cable Act, because NPTs are composed of video programming provided over cable systems that are not carried on the BST and are offered in a package rather than exclusively on a per channel or per program basis. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  47 U.S.C. 543(1)(2). The Commission therefore has a duty under the 1992 Cable Act to ensure that NPTs are not unreasonably priced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the FCC Forms 1200 and 1210, however, channels that are on an operator's NPT will not be considered regulated channels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that, so long as the conditions set forth below are met, the rates for NPTs will not be unreasonable. The conditions set forth below will ensure that subscribers may choose to subscribe to BSTs, NPTs, or CPSTs or combinations of those tiers and, that as a result, NPTs will face competition from BSTs and CPSTs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, operators offering NPTs are prohibited from making fundamental changes to what they offer on their BSTs and CPSTs on September 30, 1994. This requirement is necessary to ensure that cable subscribers continue to receive basically the same cable service they now receive at prices the Commission has set pursuant to its rate regulations. This requirement, however, is not intended to freeze BSTs and CPSTs. Operators remain free to move channels from the existing tier to a single channel offering or drop channels entirely, so long as the aggregation of such changes does not constitute a fundamental change of their BSTs or CPSTs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, operators may not drop channels from BSTs and CPSTs and move them to NPTs (including time-shifted, slightly altered or renamed versions of channels offered on other tiers), if the channels were offered on their BSTs or CPSTs on September 30, 1994. This will protect consumers by ensuring that operators electing to provide NPTs do not dilute the BSTs and CPSTs that are currently available to consumers. This will also help ensure that BSTs and CPSTs provide a competitive option to NPTs. A channel that occupied a BST or a CPST part-time may be offered full-time on an NPT, as long as it continues to be offered on the BST or CPST under substantially the same conditions as it was offered on September 30, 1994. If a channel occupies a BST or CPST full-time, however, and is subsequently reduced to part-time on the BST and CPST, that channel may not be offered on an NPT full-time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, BSTs and CPSTs must continue to be cognizable services. That is, the operator must continue to market its BSTs and CPSTs so that customers are reasonably aware of: (1) The availability of those tiers to the public; (2) the names of the channels available on those tiers; and (3) the price of the tiers. Within 30 days of the offering of an NPT, operators shall file with the Commission a copy of the new rate card that contains the following information on their BSTs, CPSTs, and NPTs: (1) The names of the programming services contained on each tier, and (2) the price of each tier. Operators also must file with the Commission copies of notifications that were sent to subscribers regarding the initial offering of NPTs. After this initial filing, cable operators must file updated rate cards and copies of customer notifications with the Commission within 30 days of rate or service changes affecting the NPT. This information will help the Commission ensure that operators are complying with our conditions for NPTs. No prior regulatory approval, however, is required to offer an NPT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, in accordance with the 1992 Cable Act's prohibition on negative option billing, an operator may not charge any subscriber for an NPT unless the subscriber has requested the NPT by name. Moreover, fundamental changes to an NPT must be approved by subscribers in accordance with the negative option billing rules. Channel changes involving relatively few channels generally will not change the fundamental nature of a tier and thus will not implicate the negative option billing rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

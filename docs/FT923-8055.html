			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Observer: Audit trail Smart money is on Andrew Foster to replace Howard Davies as controller of the Audit Commission. The commission is expected to announce later today that the 47-year-old ex-social worker who has worked for two formerly loony-left London councils is to head up the local government watchdog. The appointment will be seen as a further attempt by the commission to mend its bridges with local government. Under Howard Davies, the commission appeared increasingly critical of government policy, especially on the introduction of the poll tax. A recent report on housing was delayed until after the election, so unfavourable were its conclusions for Whitehall. Foster is clearly from the local government world; he was assistant director of social services for Haringey, north London, and director of social services for Greenwich, south London, and the county of North Yorkshire. Equally important for the commission, which is responsible for NHS efficiency, Foster has health service experience as general manager of the Yorkshire regional health authority. He has been deputy chief executive of the NHS Management Executive since last year, working under Duncan Nichol to see through the government's health service reforms. Perhaps his chief attraction for the headhunters Spencer Stuart and Associates was that he has never worked for McKinsey, the management consultants. (Howard Davies and his predecessor Sir John Banham both came from the McKinsey stable.) Whether Foster will follow both of them to become director-general of the CBI remains to be seen.</p>

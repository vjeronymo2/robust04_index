			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED REVIEWS FOR STANLEY CROUCH  </P> <P> Stanley Crouch's singular goal appears to be to perform some sort of a  sadomasochistic ritual on the black race, in particular black literary figures  ("Crouch to the Contrary," May 21).  </P> <P> Nothing is cheaper than an analysis of a problem with no problem- solving plan  of action behind it. Crouch's observations have degenerated to so much  gibberish, given the absence of any solutions. Rather than offering solutions,  he is spewing a form of literary cancer exactly like the forms he attacks --  i.e., works emasculating the black male.  </P> <P> MARGIE FAIR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

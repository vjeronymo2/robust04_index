			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi has categorically told Washington that  bilateral trade disputes should be resolved at the multilateral  level and not through unilateral actions. The commerce minister  stated in the Rajya Sabha when members drew the attention of the  house to the reported U.S. threat of invoking Special 301  provision of its Trade Act. Replying to a question, Mr. Pranab  Mukherji ruled out granting product patents with retrospective  effect and said these can be considered only after the World  Trade Organization agreement comes into force. He said the  government intends to set up an expert group to suggest changes  needed in the Indian Patents Act. He made it clear that all  patents are to be granted under our own legislation and not  under the provisions of the global agreement relating to Trade  Related Intellectual Property Rights.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Viswam: "N-Proliferation Can't Be </F> Stopped--PM"]    [Text]London, March 15--Nuclear proliferation could  not be stopped nor clandestine activity prevented without a  global non-discriminatory regime, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, said here on Tuesday.    In an exchange of views with the leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), Mr Paddy Ashdown, who called on him in  the morning, the Prime Minister took the view that the basic  issue in regard to proliferation was whether or not measures to  prevent it was discriminatory or universal.    The nuclear proliferation theme, which figures for the first  time in his talks with British leaders during the Prime  Minister's current visit, was referred to by Mr Ashdown who  enquired whether it was possible to have non-proliferation on a  regional basis. Mr Rao's response was that it all depended on  how a particular region was defined. In India's case, for  example, both China and Russia had to be included. This was  patently because the impact of certain countries extended far  beyond their regions.    Significantly, apart from Mr Ashdown, none of the British  leaders with whom Mr Rao has had discussions so far has referred  to the subject of nuclear proliferation and India's approach to  that question.    The better part of the discussions with Mr Ashdown was  devoted to India-Pakistan relations in the specific context of  their normalisation and India's ongoing economic reforms. Mr Rao  explained to Mr Ashdown that while India's efforts to restore  the political process in Kashmir continued, so also did  Pakistan's efforts to sustain terrorism in the Valley continue.  However, despite this, India acknowledged that Kashmir was its  responsibility and consistent with that responsibility, India  would do whatever was possible and necessary to normalise the  situation in Jammu and Kashmir.    Mr Rao recalled that immediately after elections in  Pakistan,  he had suggested to the Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir  Bhutto, that a dialogue between the two countries should take  place. If the issue relating to Kashmir proved intractable,  India had made it clear that constructive dialogue could be  undertaken on other bilateral aspects. The picture, however, was  not good right now.    Pakistan's response to India's six proposals as basis for a  dialogue also had not been favourable. It seemed as if Pakistan  wanted to close the doors whereas India wanted to and was trying  to open them. From Pakistan's side, everything seemed to be done  to cause rifts, the Prime Minister said.    Mr Rao made a similar assessment in his interview to the  British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) here, in which, in an  obvious reference to Pakistan, he said that terrorism was being  thrust upon India. "Both the gravity and intensity of the  situation are worsening," he felt. The Prime Minister elaborated  in the interview upon the theme of preparing for the restoration  of the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir which he had  referred to in his talks with the British Premier, Mr John  Major, on Monday. He said that the government was in touch with  everyone who was interested in peace in Kashmir. Consultations  were being held both at the national as well as the local level  in Kashmir, he said. Mr Rao added that it was not a question of  contacting the right people alone. The foremost question was of  alleviating the situation. There was no dearth of democratic  buffers in Kashmir. New alliances and parties would come up in  the State once elections are held under the provisions of the  Indian Constitution. He did not rule out the participation of  the old democratic leadership in the political initiative. There  were parties and leaders who had run governments in the past and  are capable of running them in the future.    The Prime Minister, however, ruled out the possibility of  early elections in the State. "We would go for it fully prepared  as the consequences of hasty election can be disastrous," he  said. Mr Rao cited the example of Punjab where an abrupt  decision of holding elections in 1991 had led to the killings of  as many as 27 candidates. Things could not be set right by  pushing a button.    In his talks with Mr Ashdown, the Prime Minister said that  the government wanted the economic reforms' benefits to  percolate to the village level and not just stay in some  localities spread over some parts of the country. India had  embarked on a large programme of rural development. He felt that  his government had struck the correct balance between fiscal  prudence and social priorities.    Mr Rao emphasised the importance of striking such a balance  in his address to scholars and India specialists later at the  Nehru Centre. He said that it was a cause for satisfaction that  the desire for peace, harmony and socio-economic development  among the Indian people had prevailed over false religious  slogans and tactics. But this had to be consolidated. In the  final analysis what needed to be done was to tackle the causes  of social unrest, most of which were quite unrelated to  religion. "We want rapid industrialisation, full employment,  meaningful induction of science and technology to subserve our  social goals, and a general raising of the living standards, in  which I insist on, including the imbibing of the country's  immanent value system and cultural moors. The economic reforms  we have undertaken are tailored to those objectives and are  irreversible," he said.    In the process of change and adjustment, which India has  undertaken, three postulates constituted the essential  ingredients. First, that the economies of all nations needed to  be globalised. Second, that the market was the best available  instrument for achievement of the most efficient allocation of  resources and that market forces should be generally relied upon  to impart dynamism to the economy. And third, the role of the  State needed to be reconsidered. Every society had to determine  its own set of ends and means. Today, the issue of the means has  been largely settled in favour of market forces and freer trade.  But the issues regarding the ends, in other words, the  determination of the core content of development, remained. In  India's conditions, an equilibrium had to be achieved among  three factors. First, that level of material benefit which is  necessary for a human being to achieve his full creative  potential, second, the level of exploitation of nature that  would be consistent with the needs of nature to replenish  itself, and third, the need to ensure a comparable benefit to  the vast masses of people in countries where there are no  welfare doles possible. To achieve and maintain such an  equilibrium should not be considered stagnation. This level  would depend upon and be pre-determined by the natural resources  and the technology available at any point of time. To maintain  economic activity at such a level, till technological progress  achieved by the country raises the level itself, should not be  considered a curtailment of the free play of market forces. This  should be our considered approach--"the approach, if I may so,  of variable constants."    Striking a realistic note, Mr Rao reminded his audience that  there could never be a restful moment for India. "We are  condemned and privileged to hard toil perpetually."    The Prime Minister was the guest of honour at a luncheon for  him by the Indo-British Parliamentary Group, addressing whom he  said that the courageous and right-thinking people, whether in  Britain or in India were ranged against the challenges of the  modern quick changing world. There was poverty and  underdevelopment, the inescapable spectre of conflict in many  parts of the world. International terrorism, drug trafficking,  epidemics like the AIDS and the worldwide threat that religious  fundamentalism and fanaticism posed. Through their elected  Assemblies, India and Britain stood against the tides that  threatened to flow over our hearths and homes. India and Britain  could together be a positive force for international peace and  stability. Together India and Britain could be a greater force  in the areas of global trade, industry and advanced technologies.</p>

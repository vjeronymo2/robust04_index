			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Remploy staff vote for strike Unionised employees of Remploy, which was set up in 1945 to give work to disabled people, have voted by a large majority for strike action over pay for the first time in the company's history. Remploy, which employs about 8,000 workers making army uniforms, furniture and electrical goods, receives an Pounds 80m-plus annual government subsidy. It was recently at the centre of an argument about the compatibility of its status as a priority government supplier with European Union subsidy rules. Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, ruled that the priority status was contrary to European rules, but the European Commission has suggested that companies employing disabled people are exempt. A meeting on the issue held in Brussels yesterday had to be cancelled because Mr Portillo is unwell. The GMB general union, which represents about 4,000 of the 6,000 unionised workers, said yesterday that more than 70 per cent of its members had voted for strike action on a turnout of nearly 80 per cent. The other unions are expected to report majorities in favour of action today when all the unions meet. Industrial action could not begin before September 23. The unions argue that a tougher management style emphasising efficiency rather than welfare, introduced two years ago, is driving out the most severely disabled workers. Mr Phil Davies, GMB national officer, said this style was exemplified by a new productivity scheme requiring workers to be able to work at least 40 minutes per hour rather than the present 28 minutes. The union says that the company is making payment of a 2.5 per cent increase on basic pay dependent on acceptance of the new productivity scheme and more flexible working. The company says that it simply wants to talk about productivity.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Kingfisher in merger talks with French retail chain KINGFISHER, the UK retailer, and Darty, the French electrical goods chain, announced yesterday they were in merger talks. A takeover by Kingfisher, which could value Darty at Pounds 1bn, would create a significant Anglo-French alliance as Europe's retailers look towards cross-border expansion. Darty, with 130 stores, is one of the best-known names in French retailing. UK-based Kingfisher encompasses the Woolworth, Superdrug and B&amp;Q chains as well as Comet, Britain's second-largest electrical retail chain. Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, said the two groups had been aware of each other since 1986. They had first talked about co-operating four years ago and began 'talking seriously about this transaction last summer'. Kingfisher's shares fell 20p to 538p yesterday as the London stock market worried about the cost of the deal. Mr Whittaker said Kingfisher's gearing was low. He would not comment on terms but countered suggestions that Kingfisher might be tempted to overpay to gain a foothold in continental Europe. 'If we are going to do this deal, it has to make sense on its own merits,' he said. The purchase price is expected to be much less than that implied by Darty's share price, plus its debt, and may involve deferring part of the consideration. Darty's shares were suspended at FFr519 in Paris, valuing the group at FFr7.9bn (Pounds 1bn) . Darty has about Pounds 500m of borrowings. Only 4.7 per cent of its shares are listed after a management buy-out for FFr7bn in 1988. Any deal would include an offer to the minority shareholders. Darty is under financial pressure because of the slowdown experienced in the French economy, intense competition in the household goods market and the burden of the debt that has been incurred to finance the buy-out. Darty warned shareholders last week that it faced a fall in pre-tax profits in the current financial year from the previous FFr1.07bn. Kingfisher's pre-tax profits in the last financial year, to February 1 1992, were Pounds 207.1m, and stockbrokers expect a modest increase in the year just ended.

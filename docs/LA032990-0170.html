Sponsored by the Marina del Rey  Anglers, the event allowed catches from either private or chartered boats.  </P> <P> A total of 17 fish tagged by the Department of Fish and Game were hooked. The  department paid $5 for each tagged catch.  </P> <P> Top winner was Robert Loll of La Habra, who landed a 29-pound, 4-ounce  specimen. He received a trip for two to fish the Great Barrier Reef in  Australia.  </P> <P> Second place went to Steve John of Westminster who hooked a 25-pound, 3-ounce  halibut. He won a fishing trip to Alaska.  </P> <P> Gary Rozsa of West Los Angeles finished third and was awarded fishing tackle  for his catch of 24 pounds, 3 ounces.  </P> <P> The derby banquet will be held April 5 at 7:30 p.m. at the Doubletree Marina  Beach Hotel.  </P> <P> Gear up for shallow rock cod fishing at San Nicolas Island.  </P> <P> The fourth annual "Fishing For the Homeless" charity event is set for April 7  aboard Capt. Russ Izor's boat, First String. According to organizer Tony Salas,  last year's trip paid for more than 8,000 meals at the Los Angeles Rescue  Mission. The cost for the event, which includes more than $1,000 in prizes and  drawings, is $75 per angler. Call Salas at (818) 244-5348.  </P> <P> Three Avalon siblings dropped their lines at Little Harbor while aboard their  boat, May Time, and found plenty of action.  </P> <P> Ryan Kerr got a bite from a 40-pound sand shark just as his sister, Justine,  hooked a 14-pound halibut. Meanwhile, brother Phil tossed a line baited with  squid overboard and got an immediate tug from a 16-pound white sea bass. All  three catches were landed.  </P> <P> Ron Hardcastle of San Pedro, fishing from a skiff outside the kelp beds near  Pt. Fermin, caught a 10-pound halibut, then moved out to deeper water, tossing  baited jigs in search of small calico bass. The fish refused to bite, so he  removed the jig and inserted a hook with live squid. He reeled in a white sea  bass that weighed just under 12 pounds.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Tom Honaker of Long Beach, fishing aboard the City of Seal  Beach at the Oil Rigs, caught the whopper of the week, a 36-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> The cows were out of the barn again last week. Sandy Bross of Redondo Beach,  fishing aboard the Blackjack at the Cherry Bank, won the jackpot with a  25-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> John Nance of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught a 19-pound  cow cod at San Nicolas Island.  </P> <P> And James Tani of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Southern Cal at Catalina  Island, won the jackpot with a 19-pound cow.  </P> <P> Fish reports: Local fishing is improving because anchovies are more available.  Island boats using squid for bait report some barracudas have showed up. But  most are refusing to take the bait. Anglers are making the maximum on cod  fishing on most trips.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay during the halibut  derby and had a count of 16 halibut, seven sole and 30 sand bass.  </P> <P> The Happyman took a half-day trip and anglers returned with 30 sand bass, 20  sculpin and eight halibut.

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (1): Hard times at bay - The recession has crept into the service sector, as well as manufacturing. And while the city waits for an improvement in the economy, a programme to redevelop its decaying docklands has recently suffered a setback in parliament. SINCE THE middle of last week, the centre of Cardiff has been bedecked with bunting and flags - the blue flag of the European Community, with its 12 yellow stars, vying for place of honour with the red, white and green Welsh dragon. It is Europe Week in the Welsh capital, a festival launched to place the city firmly in the heart of the EC. Behind the festival, though, lie a number of fears. Cardiff is suffering its worst economic setback since the early 1980s. Unemployment has been rising, and the economy has slowed down. 'There was a fundamental shift in business confidence between last August and the end of the year,' says Nigel Guy, director in Cardiff for 3i, the venture capital group. 'Cardiff, like South Wales generally, entered the recession later than the rest of Britain, but then the wheels fell off. This came as a great surprise to a business community that had experienced five good years, and didn't quite know how to handle a downturn.' Mr Guy's opinion is backed by others. Hugh Thomas, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, says that business has been 'very quiet' since the end of the year, with many concerns 'fighting to stay alive'. And David Phillips, director of the Cardiff Chamber of Commerce, who says that after having ridden the storm better and longer than the rest of the UK, the situation in the city is now exactly the same as elsewhere in the UK. 'Most worrying, future investment plans are down yet again in both the manufacturing and service sectors,' observes Dr Phillips. 'I have never seen such a depressing picture.' There are tentative signs, according to Mr Guy, that the bottom may have been reached: 'I don't think it will fall further. But when the upturn will come is another matter.' Dr Phillips foresees an upturn 'well within the next 12 months. Confidence among companies about increased turnover and profitability is evident.' However, the manner in which the recession has crept into the service sector, as well as manufacturing, is disturbingly ominous. Cardiff draws much of its wealth from its offices, shops and administrative services. Its great strength in recent years has been as a centre of government. A major government department, with a secretary of state who has a seat in the cabinet, overlooks Cathays Park in the civic centre. Only Edinburgh, and to a lesser extent Belfast, outside London enjoy this privilege. Nearby Bristol, for instance, a regional centre of government and a city about a third larger than Cardiff, has one under-secretary as its senior civil servant. Cardiff has not only a secretary of state, a minister of state and a parliamentary secretary of state, but also a permanent secretary, two deputy secretaries and 11 under-secretaries, as well as a raft of assistant secretaries. This is an enormous weight of administrative fire-power. Recent years have seen this strength supplemented by the growth of an important financial-services industry. Since Sir Julian Hodge, in the 1960s, formed what has now become the Bank of Wales - 75 per cent owned by the Bank of Scotland, which is bidding for the remaining 25 per cent - there has been a steady infusion of financial companies into the Welsh capital, and the workforce in the sector has grown strongly to 18,000. Though manufacturing industry has declined severely since the mid-1970s, two highly important new arrivals have been Bosch, making alternators for the auto industry; and British Airways, which is to service its fleet of Boeing 747s, the jumbo, next to the airport. BA chose the site in preference to Liverpool and Singapore, and work starts soon on a building that will be one of the largest in Europe, employing at least another 1,200 people - the same number as Bosch expects to employ fairly soon. The momentum generated by the inflow of investment is being backed internally by a programme to redevelop 2,700 acres of Cardiff's decaying docklands. This redevelopment, the estimated cost of which is more than Pounds 2bn, is the largest urban regeneration programme in Europe after London's docklands. The scheme would bolt on to the city a 21st-century addition, and bring work for over 30,000 jobs in the next 10 to 15 years, according to Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. Some Pounds 250m of investment has already been carried out by Tarmac Beazer, Westbury, Crest Nicholson and Barratt. The proposed centrepiece for the whole development, though, is an opera house, a home for the Welsh National Opera Company, costing perhaps Pounds 40m, on the water's edge within a development being undertaken by Grosvenor Waterside, Associated British Port's property arm in Cardiff. 'We are virtually ready to go on the Pounds 150m scheme,' says Mr Freddie Watson, Grosvenor Waterside's director in charge of the project: 'It is now simply a matter of getting sufficient commitment to ensure a start will be made soon.' But the strategy behind the redevelopment of the docklands suffered a setback last month. A locally-sponsored private parliamentary bill, to allow a barrage to be built across Cardiff Bay, creating a non-tidal 500-acre freshwater lake, collapsed on its last stages of a three-year passage. At an all-night sitting, a group of Labour MPs made long speeches and raised persistent objections. They oppose the scheme on environmental grounds, though a number of them would also prefer to see any government money spent elsewhere in Wales. The inability of the government to shepherd the private bill through parliament was a nasty political blow for the Welsh secretary, David Hunt, and for Mr Inkin, who had failed to neutralise the opposition to it. Yet the chances of the Pounds 125m barrage (the largest civil-engineering project in Europe, after the channel tunnel) coming into being may possibly have been strengthened by its failure as a private bill. The government has promised to introduce a bill of its own, and get it through quickly. But can this be achieved in the present session of parliament, or before a general election? If it cannot, the measure would have to be brought in again - though another government might not have the same commitment to the whole scheme. Meanwhile, the institutional investors who are necessary to fund the huge projects, having burnt their fingers on the present recession, are sitting on their hands. They will need rather more certainty about the barrage project before they commit themselves to positive decisions. The bay scheme, the developments announced by NFC, Grosvenor Waterside, Tarmac, Laing, Carla Properties and Charnwood Holdings, the imminent arrival of other financial institutions, the likelihood of more hotels being built - all these augur well for Cardiff. First, though, the city must climb out of the recession. Until that happens, perhaps in nine months to a year's time, much of the next phase of economic advance will remain on hold.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: New Zealand chemicals group advances 59.9% FERNZ Industries, the New Zealand-based chemical and fertiliser group, yesterday reported a 59.9 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars NZ25.28m (US13.8m), in spite of lower than expected profits in its Australian operations. Turnover rose 26.7 per cent to NZDollars 379m, of which NZDollars 139.41m was generated in New Zealand, NZDollars 205.45m in Australia and NZDollars 34.21m in other markets. Recovery in New Zealand agriculture saw fertiliser output rise 20.3 per cent to 332,259 tonnes. Directors said demand accelerated in the second half, due to rising farm incomes. Turnover in the company's industrial chemicals business rose 37.8 per cent to NZDollars 66.79m. The main contributing factors were a second chlor alkali plant in west Australia and the Kinleith chemical complex in New Zealand which saw increased demand for its preservative chemicals. Turnover in agricultural chemicals and animal health products rose 28 per cent to NZDollars 230.6m. Directors said the majority of that business was conducted in Australia and earnings were complicated by fluctuating exchange rates. International sales rose by NZDollars 10m last year. However, Australian profits were affected by the most severe drought in Queensland and New South Wales in 10 years. Directors said that although business opportunities improved in the second half, sales there for the 12 months were ADollars 7m (USDollars 5.2m) below forecast, due to competition. Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to 48 cents. The directors recommended a final dividend of 13 cents a share, up from 12 cents last year.</p>

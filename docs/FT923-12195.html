			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Textiles group attacks Pakistan EUROPE'S largest textiles and apparel companies have called for a 'test case' investigation into alleged Pakistani abuses in a swingeing attack on misuse of export subsidies among five leading third world textiles exporters. Europe's Largest Textile and Apparel Companies (Eltac), an umbrella grouping for the European industry, is also asking for a joint committee on subsidies to be set up with the European Commission. Eltac complains that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European Commission - the two main watchdogs for abuse of subsidies - are 'largely ineffective'. In a study of government support for textile exporters in Pakistan, India, Indonesia, China and Turkey, Eltac says Pakistan is 'clearly the worst offender'. It endorses the view of the Asian Development Bank that the Pakistan government's policy of providing cut-price raw cotton to textile manufacturers 'has reached such proportions as to be branded an economic nonsense'.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SOUTHEAST;  </P> <P> MISSISSIPPI STATE SNAPS LOSING STREAK IN BIG WAY, 42-7  </P> <P> They had to go back -- to 1916 -- in the football record books to match what  happened Saturday night at Mississippi State.  </P> <P> Ending a 10-game losing streak, Mississippi State used two-touchdown  performances by Orlando Wade and Kenny Roberts to beat Vanderbilt, 42-7, in a  Southeastern Conference opener at Starkville, Miss.  </P> <P> It was the largest victory margin ever for Mississippi State in the  Southeastern Conference, which was formed in 1933, and the largest over a team  now in the SEC since 1916, when Mississippi State routed Mississippi, 36-0.  </P> <P> Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said: "We wanted to get off to a good  start and we did. This was a mighty big football win for us because it's that  positive start we've talked about.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be close, nothing like this."  </P> <P> The victory ended an 0-7 drought in the SEC over two seasons for Mississippi  State and was only the Bulldogs' fourth win in the SEC in four seasons.  </P> <P> The loss was Vanderbilt's sixth straight, including the final five games of the  1988 season.  </P> <P> After building a 14-7 halftime lead, Mississippi State, a four-point favorite,  scored on its first four possessions of the second half.  </P> <P> Wade ran for touchdowns of one and eight yards to cap third quarter drives, and  Roberts, a redshirt freshman, raced 37 yards for a touchdown late in the third  quarter and 87 for another early in the fourth.  </P> <P> Tennessee 17, Colorado St. 14 -- In Earle Bruce's first game as the Colorado  State coach, the Rams gave the Volunteers a scare before falling at Knoxville,  Tenn.  </P> <P> Tennessee scored the winning points on Greg Burke's 21-yard field goal with  8:37 left for a 17-6 lead.  </P> <P> Colorado State got close on Kevin Verdugo's two-yard touchdown run and a  two-point conversion pass from Verdugo to Sean Willis. The touchdown came four  plays after Bob Stratman recovered a fumble at the Tennessee 37.  </P> <P> Late in the third quarter, Colorado State lined up with 12 men on the field on  a Tennessee punt, allowing the Volunteers to keep possession. They scored seven  plays later on an 11-yard run by Greg Amsler.  </P> <P> The Volunteers scored first on a 21-yard run on a fake reverse by Reggie Cobb.  </P> <P> Mississippi 20, Memphis St. 13 -- John Darnell passed for 255 yards and one  touchdown as the Rebels won at Memphis, Tenn. Darnell's touchdown pass play to  Willie Green covered 53 yards and gave Ole Miss a 17-3 lead.  </P></p>

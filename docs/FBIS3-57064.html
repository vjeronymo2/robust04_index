The conservatives state  that after Lithuania's official statement on its intention to  join NATO, new steps will undoubtedly be taken. As Russia's  foreign policy toward the Baltic states is becoming ever more  aggressive, the political council of the party of conservatives  believes that during the upcoming visit by Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas to Brussels and the signing of the document  on cooperation for peace, the president should ask for  consultations with NATO, provided by this document to Lithuania,  as a partner who is facing direct threat to its territorial  integrity, political independence, and security.    The political council of the party of conservatives is  convinced that the NATO political consultants and observers  should be working in Vilnius.</p>

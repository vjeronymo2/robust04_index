			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Australian SE put on the spot by News Corp plan - A look at the dilemma facing the ASX over the thorny problem of super voting shares PITY the Australian Stock Exchange. Today it is due to release a discussion document on the thorny matter of 'super' voting shares, an issue which has arisen in the context of News Corporation's desire to create two classes of shares with different voting rights. While the paper itself will come to no firm conclusion - merely outlining the options and asking for formal comment  -many observers think that the exchange is in a bind. Since News Corporation's chairman, Mr Rupert Murdoch, first announced the 'super share' plan at the company's annual meeting last month, there have been no official details of how the scheme would work. Nevertheless, it seems that existing shareholders would receive the new shares pro rata to those already held - perhaps one for 10. Each new share would have multiple voting rights - say, 25 votes. Whatever the precise mathematics, the multiple voting rights would only apply to the new shares so long as they were not transfered. In short, Mr Murdoch - who currently speaks for about 33 per cent of News Corp's equity, either directly or through the family company, Cruden Investments - could enjoy creeping control over time, as other investors sold out. He could also raise money by selling ordinary shares, without risking significant dilution. The problem for the stock exchange is that, if it endorses the principles involved in this scheme, it moves against the trend in some other international markets. In London, in particular, there has been a steady effort to weed out differential voting structures, with big companies - like Hammerson, the property group - making the switch to a one-vote, one-share system. Moreover, the stock exchange would have to make super share schemes available to all and sundry. Already, one corporate lawyer in Sydney says her clients have been tentatively exploring their options should a green light given to the News Corp plan. But if the ASX turns the scheme down, News Corp could move overseas, delisting from the Australian market in favour of a more tolerant regime. At the annual meeting, Mr Murdoch noted that 'similar arrangements have long been in place in many of the great media companies of the US and Europe'. Although he did not mention specific companies at the time, the statement would be true of Dow Jones or Pulitzer Publishing. News Corp's departure would have a significant impact on the Australian stock market. In terms of market capitalisation, the company accounts for almost 8 per cent of the All-Ordinaries index. Last month, trading in News Corporation shares represented 7.62 per cent of the market's total turnover. Only one company - Broken Hill Proprietary - is more important to the market on these measures. The fund management community has not made the ASX's position any easier, by indicating its qualms over the News Corp plan. The Australian Investment Managers Group says it has reservations about the principles involved and will now poll members, in order to deliver a formal submission to the ASX. Mr Ian Matheson, executive director of AIMG, expects a fairly unanimous result: 'My feeling is that there is an overwhelming opposition to what is being proposed,' he said yesterday. Remarks at the weekend by the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the large US institutional investor, also decrying the principles involved, may be more helpful. At least they suggest that News Corp might not have a universally favourable reception if it did contemplate a shift to the US. Meanwhile, super voting shares will not be the only matter dealt with in today's discussion paper. The ASX is also expected to look the issue of 'targeted shares' - which are designed to reflect the performance of one specific division within a company. In this case, the question arises in the context of New Zealand-based Fletcher Challenge, which is seeking to create a class of shares which would be tied to the performance of its plantation, forestry and log trading businesses in New Zealand and Chile. These, it hopes, would trade on the ASX as well as the NZSE and the New York SE. To date, 'targeted shares' have been a US practice, featuring companies like USX and General Motors. However, even bankers who have promoted their use there, admit that targeted shares tend to be most useful where a full 'demerger' of the division in question is not possible. To date, companies which have pursued this road can be counted on the fingers of one hand. That said, such schemes do raise questions over the allocation of voting rights - that is, how these should be divided between the different stock classes. However, their contentiousness fades in comparison with that of non-transferable 'super voting' shares. There seems little doubt which issue will give the ASX a bigger headache.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Workers give job security lower priority JOB SECURITY has a relatively low priority for employees in the south of England, a survey published yesterday by the Industrial Society shows. The survey was released as Manpower, the employment services company, forecast that the recent gradual upswing in confidence about job prospects would continue into the last quarter of the year in spite of rises in unemployment in July and August. The organisation's regular quarterly survey of more than 2,000 employers showed that 23 per cent forecast job increases and 16 per cent job losses. The Industrial Society survey shows that enjoyable work, good pay and a sense of achievement rate more highly than job security among employees. It found that one in three employees in the south are dissatisfied with their work. Public-sector employees are most satisfied and those in the financial services and engineering sectors least. Only 17 per cent of employees said they could contribute to their full potential at work. Ms Christine Garner, head of the society's southern region, said: 'Job security is a concern for everybody, but not an expectation for anybody. People know they no longer have jobs for life.' A good relationship with the boss, good terms and conditions of employment, a good working environment and status have even lower priority than job security. Manpower said: 'Overall the trend which emerges from the forecasts of this quarter continues to bear a distinct similarity to the same period 10 years ago, when the UK was emerging from the 1979 recession.' The survey showed that only one region, East Anglia, was forecasting a decrease in job levels for the last quarter, compared with six regions for the same period last year. The public sector was the worst-affected sector for job prospects for the seventh consecutive quarter, with the service sector the most optimistic. The manufacturing sector saw the greatest improvement over last year with a swing from a net balance of minus 4 per cent to a positive net balance of 7 per cent. It is 11 times harder to get a job now than when Mr John Major, the prime minister, left school in 1959, a Labour party survey says today. Mr Frank Dobson, employment spokesman, says research shows there were two people after every job then. The figure is now 22.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japan's trade ministry  Thursday [19 May] unveiled a program to build a society that is  highly information-oriented toward the next century.    The program emphasized the need for the government to  augment  ongoing efforts in the private sector for realizing such a  society, in particular through integrated networking of computer  and telecommunications systems.    Specifically, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) called for promotion of such networking in five  sectors -- education, research, medical and welfare services,  administrative operations and public libraries.    The task, however, will be impossible to achieve unless the  government makes efforts to improve business, technical and  social conditions in these areas, the program said.    It said the conditions include computer standardization,  establishing security systems in computer-related business,  protection of intellectual property rights, deregulation of  various rules and upgrading telecom-related infrastructure, the  program said.    MITI said the program was formulated to give concrete shape  to policy measures recommended last June by the Industrial  Structure Council, an advisory body to the trade minister.    In the past year, a drive to build information-oriented  societies has been accelerated on a global basis, including the  national information infrastructure scheme proposed by the  United States and the trans-European network program by Europe.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (5): Manufacturers have forged ahead - Wide-bodied aircraft Deep recession in the civil aircraft industry has not modified the longer-term expectations of the big three manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas - for continued growth in air travel and demand for new commercial jets. Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of airliners, is now forecasting new aircraft deliveries totalling more than 12,000 jets valued at Dollars 815bn over the next 18 years. The European Airbus consortium estimates demand for 13,500 aircraft over the next 20 years, while McDonnell Douglas is forecasting a total requirement for 14,000 new jets during the same period. All three manufacturers also expect bigger wide-body aircraft to take an increasingly large share of total deliveries over the next 10 to 20 years. In its latest study of the market, Boeing says larger aircraft will account for 58 per cent of all seats delivered between now and 2010, and that the average size of airliners will grow from 176 seats in 1980 and 193 seats in 1992 to about 227 seats by 2010. This trend towards larger wide-body airliners is essentially driven by two factors: long-range, non-stop travel is expanding while on shorter routes big aircraft are seen as a way of beating congestion at busy airports. Although the turmoil in the industry has forced manufacturers to cut production following a wave of order cancellations and deferrals from financially hard-pressed airline customers, all three big manufacturers have forged ahead with development of new, large wide-bodies. The Airbus A340 entered service with Lufthansa and Air France this year. This four-engine wide-body boasts the longest range of any civil aircraft; it is capable of flying non-stop with a full load for 16 hours or more. The aircraft, which is also extremely quiet, has been designed for very long routes such as London-Johannesburg or Paris-Singapore. Airbus will also start delivering to customers later this year the first A330s, the twin-engine sister of the A340. Boeing, which has dominated up to now the long-haul wide-body market with its 747 jumbo, is in advanced development of the 777, a new family of twin-engine wide-body airliners with versions for medium-range flights and others for long routes. McDonnell Douglas is competing against both Boeing and Airbus in this market with its MD11 three-engine jet. It has plans to stretch this and also develop a new, bigger, four-engine jumbo, the MD12. However, these plans hinge on the Long Beach, California, group being able to complete the restructuring of its commercial aircraft activities and find new international partners to invest in these operations and help fund the costly and risky development of a new large aircraft. The Russian aircraft industry, long present in the very large jet segment of the market, is also vying for a slice of the new wide-body business by attempting to forge alliances with western partners to develop new aircraft for both the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as other world markets. The first concrete example is the new Ilyushin 96M four-engine wide-body with seating capacity for 386 passengers. The aircraft, which will compete against the A340 and the 777, made its maiden flight at the end of March. It is the product of close co-operation between the Russian industry and US manufacturers. Ilyushin's main partners on this ambitious project are Pratt &amp; Whitney, the US aero-engine group providing the power plant for the new aircraft, and Rockwell-Collins which is supplying the avionic equipment and systems. But perhaps the most significant development of the past few months is an agreement between Boeing and the four Airbus partners (Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace, and Casa of Spain) to study jointly the development of an extra-large aircraft, or super-jumbo, capable of seating between 550 and 800 passengers. This unusual collaboration between traditionally fierce competitors reflects a general feeling among manufacturers that the development of a super-jumbo, whose cost aerospace industry analysts estimate at more than Dollars 10bn, can only be viable through the broadest of international partnerships. Indeed, other manufacturers could ultimately join the Boeing venture with the Airbus partners, including McDonnell Douglas and the Russians. The industry believes there will be demand for a super-jumbo by the turn of the century. Airbus says that the development of an ultra large-capacity aircraft is the 'next big challenge' facing the commercial aerospace industry. But it also agrees with Boeing that there is unlikely to be room for more than one project. Several airlines have already shown interest in such an aircraft, especially in the Asia-Pacific region which is expected to continue showing above-average air travel growth during the next 10 years. British Airways, which is also interested in the super-jumbo concept, has already done some studies on the configuration of a very large aircraft and the new facilities it could bring to travellers - including lounges and exercise rooms - to make long-distance flying more enjoyable. At Long Beach, McDonnell Douglas has a mock-up of its MD12 super-jumbo concept. On the top deck, it has fitted a small gymnasium as well as a business centre where passengers could send faxes and use computer facilities while flying on very long routes. But apart from the huge cost of building such an aircraft, the development of a new generation of super-jumbos will also require significant new airport infrastructure to accommodate these jets at airport gates. Airports will also have to adapt their facilities to cope with much greater flows of passengers disembarking or boarding such aircraft. With congestion becoming an acute problem at a growing number of large international airports, demand for wide-body aircraft is expected to increase over the next few years. In the shorter term, this demand will be met by the new big twin-engine aircraft such as the Boeing 777 or the Airbus A330 now in advanced stages of development. In the longer term, the super-jumbo could become a familiar sight at leading airports.</p>

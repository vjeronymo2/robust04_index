			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- This afternoon,  committee members to the Second Session of the Eighth National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] held group discussions to deliberate the  "(Proposed Draft Amendment for) the CPPCC Constitution." The  participants held: The amendment further specifies the CPPCC's  nature, position, and role in state politics, thereby  specifically stipulating the CPPCC's key functions; and  designates the principal content, format, and procedure for  political consultation and democratic supervision. It has  importance significance for regulating and enhancing political  consultative tasks.    It has been learned that the "CPPCC Constitution" adopted in  1982 has been a good one. The constitution has played an  important role in initiating people's political consultation in  a new era. As a result of continual progress in China's reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization drive, as well as  continual development in the people's political consultative  tasks, we need to make necessary amendments to certain  provisions of the constitution in accordance with different  actual conditions.    Committee members held: It is appropriate to add a provision  in the general program, namely: "The CPC-led multiparty  cooperation and political consultation system shall prevail and  develop for a long time." The new provision, connected with the  proposed amendment for the Constitution adopted by the First  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], embodies  the characteristics and superior features of China's socialist  political system. To further specify and enhance the CPPCC's  duties, committee members have added clauses that stress the  leading position of the theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and socialist basic line during the  primary stage of socialism including, "regarding economic  construction as the central task"; "enhancing the socialist  spiritual civilization drive"; and "promoting the development of  a socialist market economy."    Committee members held: Adding clauses to the general  provisions on the CPPCC's tasks -- including "political  consultation means that we hold consultation before making major  decisions on general and specific state and local policies, and  on other important political, economic, cultural, and social  issues, and that we also hold consultation on important issues  while implementing policy decisions"; and "democratic  supervision means that by making suggestions and criticisms, we  carry out supervision over the implementation of the state  constitution, laws, regulations, and general and specific major  policies, and work performance of state organs and personnel" --  is a new experience we have learned from enhancing China's  socialist democracy and people's political consultation in the  past 10-odd years. Such new clauses have important significance  in regulating and promoting the CPPCC tasks.    Concerning the attachment of an extended explanation which  reads "organize various parties, organizations, and people from  various circles attending this session to participate in the  administration and discussion of state affairs" to the key  functions of political consultations and democratic supervision,  members maintained: Apart from being an organization conducting  cooperation and consultations with the CPC and various  democratic parties, the CPPCC is also an important organization  for various mass organizations, representatives of all  nationalities, and persons from various circles who have  participated in the CPPCC, to conduct consultations and  discussions of important problems concerning the state's general  policies and principles as well as the life of people; and to  exercise democratic supervision through suggestions and  criticisms. The CPPCC's consultation and supervision  encompasses a wide range of activities, including consultations,  discussions, suggestions, criticisms, as well as all sorts of  ensuing activities, such as inspections, fact-finding tours,  investigations, studies, and submitting proposals and motions.  These are also various forms of participation in the  administration and discussion of state affairs. Adding such an  extended explanation to the CPPCC's key functions is conducive  to extensively encouraging the enthusiasm of units and  individuals who have joined the CPPCC, bringing into play the  CPPCC's overall superiority, inspiring its work initiative, and  serving China's modernization drive in a more satisfactory way.    Members noted: Enhancing the construction of a clean and  honest government is an important task of the whole society;  adding the passages "enhancing the construction of a clean and  honest government" and "having the right to report, expose, and  participate in the investigation and examination of violations  of discipline and law" will further define the rights and  obligations of CPPCC organizations and members; and is conducive  to displaying the superiority of CPPCC organizations and  members, and promoting the construction of a clean and honest  government as well as a socialist legal system. Adding the  passage "through proposals, motions, and other forms" to the  constitution to clearly list duties exercised by members, such  as submitting proposals and motions, will enable them to play  their role better.    During their examination and discussion, members have also  put forward many good opinions and suggestions on how to make  this draft amendment more perfect.</p>

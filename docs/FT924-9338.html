			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Last minute Chinese bid wins Peruvian iron company THE SHIUGANG Corporation from the People's Republic of China became the new owner of Peru's state iron producer yesterday in Lima. The investment, totalling USDollars 311.8m, is the first made by communist China in Latin America, according to Shougang directors. Shougang amply exceeded the minimum bidding requirement set by Copri, Peru's state privatisation commission. The Chinese offer for 100 per cent of Hierro Peru's shares was Dollars 120m compared with a minimum of Dollars 22m; and it has pledged to invest a further Dollars 150m over the next three years in much-needed modernisation of equipment (The minimum investment commitment was set at Dollars 60m). In addition, Shougang must assume Hierro Peru's debts, projected at Dollars 41.8m. Front runner for months in the Hierro Peru stakes had been a multinational consortium of Swiss, Chilean, Mexican and Japanese capital, headed by Santiago-based Compania Minera del Pacifico and led by former Peruvian mines minister Mr Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski. Disappointed representatives at yesterday's auction admitted, however, that the Chinese offer was unbeatable. Shougang is one of communist China's 30 top corporations and is in the mainstream of the country's economic reform. It is described as an 'autonomous state company' with extensive steel, mining and shipping interests in China and Asia, and turned in profits of Dollars 500m last year. It plans to double its current steel output over the next seven years. To maximise the lucrative freight side of the business, Shougang would ship coal from China to substitute the oil at present used to fire Hierro Peru's furnaces. Mr Julio Orihuela, Shougang's Lima representative, said the offer for Hierro Peru also included construction of a steel mill locally.</p>

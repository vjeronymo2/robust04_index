			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Travel: China in just a day - splendid - The idea of creating user-friendly cultural Disneylands is catching on - even in the far east If you are in a hurry and want to experience the glories of China in a single day, try going to Splendid China. According to its promoters it is the world's most extensive miniature panorama of famous sights. It is run by the splendidly-named Splendid China Development Company, and located in Shenzhen, the special economic zone across the border from Hong Kong. Splendid China consists of scaled-down versions of all the great buildings of China, set in a leisure park of sweeping green lawn. These range from the Potala Palace in Lhasa to the Great Wall, the Confucius Temple and the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan. Near the park, teams of day labourers are working hard on recreating famous structures from other parts of the world as well. London Bridge is more or less complete; what looks like one of the waterfronts in Amsterdam is still under scaffolding. 'It's just right for the people of Hong Kong,' remarked my Chinese guide as we weaved through jostling crowds of Hong Kong day-trippers. 'After all, they're so busy making money that most of them can only afford to take a day or two off work to visit the motherland. What better than this place, right across the border? They can take in all the wonders of China and get back to Hong Kong in less than 24 hours.' The brochure for Splendid China echoes the same sentiments. 'In a word,' it says, 'you will get a good idea of the ancient civilised country with a history of 5,000 years and travel over numerous famous rivers and mountains all over China only in one day.' The idea of creating user-friendly cultural Disneylands is catching on in various parts of China. In Beijing there is now a World Park full of famous buildings in miniature, from the White House to the Kremlin. And in Kunming, in south-west China, you can visit the newly-constructed Nationalities Village, which recreates the village dwellings of every significant ethnic group in that part of the world, from Mongolian to Bai. Girls dance in wooden courtyards, bells tinkle on gleaming stupas, and glossy Buddhas gaze out from squeaky-clean temples, far smarter than the real temples tucked away in the hills. For busy tourists - especially overseas Chinese tourists - the Nationalities Village, like Splendid China, is just the thing. Close to the hotels and the airport, it gives quick access to China's inaccessible history and diversity. In China this practice of re-creating famous and interesting buildings goes back a long way. For instance, the summer resort of Chengde, north of Beijing, which the Kangxi emperor built for his amusement nearly 300 years ago, is graced with a life-size replica of the Potala Palace, built to entice Tibetans to Beijing. In Shenzhen, though, the practice seems a particularly apt one. Shenzhen is, after all, the mecca of Chinese economic reform, an example of how enterprise and investment can provide China with the glamour and adventure of the modern world, all at once and in the same place. Splendid China is not the only adventure awaiting the traveller to Shenzhen. The whole place feels like Hong Kong transplanted into the American Wild West. There is a sense of frenetic activity with no one accountable for the outcome. Cars, trucks and taxis vie ruthlessly for space. Construction is under way everywhere, with motorways, container terminals and two airports at various stages of development. The centre of the zone is filled with high-rise apartments, shopping malls and factories dealing in everything from bicycles - one of Shenzhen's best exports - to fiber optics. Fifteen years ago Shenzhen was a village; now it has a population of more than 1m, manufacturing and reprocessing goods from materials supplied not just from Hong Kong but from the whole Pearl River delta. The city authorities are proud of Shenzhen's rapid growth. The mayor's assistant, a confident, persuasive woman in her forties, reminded me over lunch in a five-star hotel that the economic zone's current GDP growth rate is around 40 per cent per annum. Still, the strains of this rapid development are showing. Stories of triad gangs, smuggling, prostitution, the dumping of hazardous wastes and other less salubrious aspects of free enterprise abound. Some take these problems to be no more than teething pains. Other see them as a more serious indictment of the Shenzhen model. One well-known Chinese economist, a dogged critic of Shenzhen, warned me before my recent visit that it combines 'the worst of socialism and the worst of capitalism put together.' I glimpsed some of these strains when I parted from my hosts and tried to travel on to Hong Kong at the end of my day in Shenzhen. My hosts assured me I could jump on the mid-afternoon ferry to Hong Kong from the Shekou terminal at the western end of Shenzhen. The ferry, they said, was another example of Shenzhen's fine communications and openness to the outside world. But it did not turn out quite that way. After queuing for 40 minutes while two Chinese customs officers read their way solemnly through every single passport and permit presented to them, I found myself in the middle of another jostling crowd, this time of angry Hongkongers trying to get home. The ferry was in dock but would not sail. It was 'under repair,' I was told by a lone sailor washing his shirt in the cabin. The only other news - conveyed by a bored ticket attendant - was that later ferries were 'fully booked,' and that other border crossings were clogged with day-trippers. This did not seem to leave many options. At this point, however, as is often the case in China, I was rescued by a resourceful and helpful local. She was a Beijing lawyer based in Hong Kong - one of thousands of mainland Chinese emigres in Hong Kong whose interests and loyalties serve to bind the colony ever more closely to China. We chatted for a while, then she lowered her eyelashes, expressed sympathy, and offered to help. She produced half a carton of king-sized cigarettes from a plastic bag. I would understand, wouldn't I, that a little gesture to the ticket attendant would secure me a seat. This was not corruption, just the Chinese way. Clutching a packet, she wandered nonchalantly into the crowd of angry, gesticulating passengers, and disappeared from sight. Shortly afterwards she reappeared empty-handed. 'He is such a kind man,' she told me, 'and so eager to help you.' Sure enough, the attendant soon showed up, though his eagerness had worn off. He beckoned us ahead of the crowd to a boat that had mysteriously appeared from nowhere, and ushered us on board. Behind us a fight broke out between two groups of young men, both vying for seats. Shouts and curses filled the air; fists started to fly. 'Hooligans,' whispered my new friend, pulling me hastily towards the front of the ferry. 'Come with me before it is too late.' I held back. 'What's going on?' I asked her son, who by this time was caught up in the melee. He smiled reassuringly, regaining his breath and his patriotic composure. 'Nothing to be concerned about,' he said. 'Just a little . . . friction.' As we settled into our seats, the captain rushed out of his cabin and engaged in a loud altercation with the crew. 'Too many people,' he declared, and returned to his cabin. Minutes later he re-emerged, again muttering about the numbers on board. 'I must count up the passengers,' he announced. 'We can't leave until I do.' My friend, pouting a little, said she hoped the boat didn't capsize. After a long wait, the ferry set off, reassuringly high in the water. As we drew away from the jetty my friend's son looked up from his magazine and pointed to a crowd of people still milling around there. 'See those people?' he said. 'They've been told there's another boat coming. But there isn't. They were cheated, but they weren't smart enough to realise.' I leaned back and prepared for the ride ahead. My friend took a notebook from her handbag and noted down the name of the ticket attendant. 'Just in case I need his co-operation again.' There were dozens of names in the notebook, all of them, presumably, kind and eager contacts in Shenzhen. 'Now,' she said, smiling and closing her handbag. 'Tell me what you think of China's modernisation, and what will happen to the country when Deng Xiaoping passes away. And tell me what you think of Shenzhen. Isn't it going to be the Hong Kong of the future?' By this time I was weary, so I answered elliptically, the Chinese way. I told her all about Splendid China. Shenzhen can be reached from Hong Kong by train, ferry, bus and taxi. Most convenient are the frequent trains from the Kowloon terminal of the Kowloon-Canton railway to Lowu on the Hong Kong-China border. Ferries to the Shekou jetty in Shenzhen leave several times daily from the central ferry terminal on Hong Kong island. China Southern Airlines flies daily from Shenzhen to Guangzhou (Canton) and Beijing. Among the more comfortable hotels in Shenzhen is the Shangri-La, tel: (755)-223-0888, fax: (755)-223 - 9878.</p>

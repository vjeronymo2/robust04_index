			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan and S. Korean Authorities Must Not Interfere in </F> Third- Round DPRK-U.S. Talks, DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman"  -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  today answered a question put by KCNA about the outcries of  Japan and the South Korean authorities that the question of the  "special inspection" of DPRK's military sites must be resolved  at the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks.    He said:    As has been reported, the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks will  be  held in Geneva in the first week of July.    It is expected that the outstanding questions between the  DPRK and the United States including the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula and the relations between the two countries  will be solved in this round of talks in a package deal.    Japan and the South Korean authorities, however, are trying  to force a "special inspection" on military sites of the DPRK,  claiming that the "nuclear suspicion" against it must be  clarified at the talks and it must "accept a full inspection."    A sinister aim is lurking behind this fuss impudently raised  by Japan and the South Korean authorities that are not parties  to the talks.    Japan and the South Korean authorities, that did not want a  progress at the DPRK-USA talks and a fair solution to the  "nuclear issue" from the beginning, are now hurriedly running  about to put a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-USA talks, unable  to conceal their perplexity and irritation, as it has become  certain that the talks will be resumed.    Judging from this, it is clear that the ulterior intention  of  Japan and the South Korean authorities in trying to impose  inspection of military sites on the DPRK under the pretext of  its "nuclear suspicion" is to lay hurdles in the way of the  hard-won third round of DPRK-USA talks and the settlement of the  "nuclear issue" and find an excuse for promoting and justifying  their own nuclear armament.    Japan and the South Korean authorities are alleging that the  DPRK is keeping something in concealment. But we have no  nuclear weapon and feel no need to manufacture them.    As for the "suspected nuclear program" of the DPRK over  which  some forces are making much ado, it is a problem that will  naturally be resolved when DPRK-USA talks proceed successfully  and confidence is built between the DPRK and the USA.    Therefore, there is no need for Japan and the South Korean  authorities to trouble themselves about this.    If some forces, urged by a sinister intention, try to impose  inspection of military sites, which means an infringement on the  sovereignty of the DPRK, it will not be beneficial to them,  either, and will produce grave consequences.</p>

Under pressure from the Western governments and  squeezed by the UN conditions over the Lockerbie affair, the  Libyan colonel has decided to resume contacts with his former  allies. Lebanese sources revealed to CORRIERE that at the end  of December the leader had a lengthy "working" meeting with the  elusive Abu-Nidal, the Palestinian extremist sentenced to death  by the PLO and wanted by police forces all over the world.    During the meeting, which took place amid strict security  measures, al-Qadhdhafi informed Abu-Nidal of his intention to  revive the international terrorist organization that was behind  bloodthirsty attacks in the eighties.    The Libyan leader promised that, apart from the usual  sources  of funding, Abu-Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council will receive  a $50,000 check for a series of actions designed to halt the  peace process. Furthermore, Libya will reopen its training  camps to the extremist's terrorists.    According to the same sources, very substantial aid has been  allocated to other Middle Eastern groups. In particular, Ahmad  Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command has received orders to organize attacks. Jibril himself  discussed strategy and objectives with al-Qadhdhafi.    With his coffers full and with the protection of the Libyan  secret services, Abu-Nidal set to work at once. On 25 November  -- though this was not reported until the following month -- the  Venezuelan police thwarted a plan to blow up the Israeli Embassy  in Caracas. The brains behind the operation was a Palestinian,  formerly resident in Colombia, known as Yusuf Salah [name as  received]. Just a few days ago in Beirut a Jordanian diplomat  was killed by a hit man who was subsequently arrested together  with a number of accomplices. According to the Lebanese police,  the cell belongs to Abu-Nidal's gang.    The most disturbing aspect of this revived cooperation is  the  fact that al-Qadhdhafi does not even try to conceal his "bad  company." In a speech delivered 16 December the colonel said  that Libya will be the "Mecca" of guerrilla fighters from  Northern Ireland to the Philippines. At a mass rally a few days  earlier he urged the leaders of the fiercest terrorist groups to  return to Libya.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUROR OVER NEW LITERATURE TEXTBOOKS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE TEXTS  </P> <P> I staunchly applaud the insightful educators who developed the long-overdue  "Heath Anthology of American Literature" (Column One, Aug. 27). I'm personally  gratified and professionally inspired that college students will have the  opportunity to experience a more diverse and meaningful literary menu; one  which more accurately reflects the multiethnic cultural fabric in our nation's  campus populations.  </P> <P> Colleges and universities have an obligation to make great literature come  alive, to inspire students to dance with their minds. Who can say Emerson's  journals are more relevant to Latino students than a Mexican-American folk  ballad? Where more appropriate for students to discover the beauty of American  Indian writings than in a literature course?  </P> <P> As a Latino educator, I strongly support the idea of expanding the traditional  definition of the classics. Educators must refocus their creative vision and  wake up to our multiethnic challenges.  </P> <P> KEITH A. SHELDON  </P> <P> Chino Hills  </P></p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi restructuring under way ADMINISTRATORS of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison group yesterday carried out the first phase of a complex restructuring plan. This involved the approval of the half-yearly accounts of Montedison, the quoted industrial operations of the Ferruzzi family, which showed a loss of L741bn (Dollars 468m) against a loss of L188bn during the same period the previous year. Operating results were already announced at a board meeting on September 30. Net operating profit was up from L398bn to L784bn on turnover of L10,287bn. But approval was delayed because the administrators had been unable to include in the accounts the effect of a freeze for the year of debt payments. Yesterday, half-year financial charges were written at L753bn. A statement accompanying the accounts said that accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche had included exceptional losses of L243bn as a result of operations by Montedison International Holding and its subsidiaries. The debt moratorium affecting service of financial debt totalling L25,000bn has been the subject of intense negotiation with nearly L1800bn in lost interest at stake. However, yesterday's meeting was able to go ahead as planned after 21 Italian banks representing 70 per cent of the outstanding bank debt gave their formal approval to the restructuring plan of the Ferruzzi empire. Foreign banks accounting for L6,500bn of debt have refused to accept the debt moratorium until they have fully studied the restructuring plan. They are unlikely to give their answer before the end of the month. The restructuring is based round the debt moratorium followed by a subsequent consolidation of L18,900bn worth of debt at below market rates.</p>

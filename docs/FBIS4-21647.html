			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Capping It All"] </F>   [Text] The new American move to promote nuclear non-  proliferation in South Asia is yet another illustration of the  Clinton administration's tendency to come out with glib answers  to admittedly complicated issues. The proposal aims at getting  India and Pakistan to agree to cap their nuclear programmes and  accept international inspection of their nuclear production  facilities. There is hardly anything new about this approach. It  had prompted earlier unsuccessful initiatives to bring about  bilateral or regional accords on nuclear-free zones. The present  attempt is essentially to present the same idea in a more  attractive package. New Delhi must be extremely wary of the  underlying trap. The renewed move is suspect especially because  it looks like a clumsy stratagem to overcome strong  Congressional opposition to the administration's frantic bid to  scuttle the Pressler Amendment and supply F-16 combat aircraft  to Pakistan. Originally, the administration had sought to oblige  the Pakistani military establishment in return for the latter's  agreement to verified capping of that country's nuclear  programme. Since the proposal made no headway, Washington has  now come up with the idea of roping in India into this dubious  exercise. This suggests not so much an eagerness to promote  nuclear non- proliferation as an overriding need to fulfill  Pakistan's ambition to get hold of the sophisticated aircraft as  soon as possible. It is particularly significant that while a  specific incentive has been offered to Pakistan for accepting  the capping idea, no sign is yet discernible of a quid pro quo  to India, too.    The more intriguing aspect relates to the facile talk of  verifiable capping of nuclear installations. It is by now common  knowledge that the existing mechanism of verifying these has  proved to be anything but foolproof. The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] was totally in the dark about Iraq's  nuclear programme although it was a signatory to the  Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. The same fatal deficiency has  now been indicated in the case of North Korea which, too, has  formally subscribed to NPT.    India has often underscored the vital importance of an  unquestionably sound verification regime if the objective of  non- proliferation is to be achieved. But the IAEA has not yet  devised one. So long as this is the stark reality, New Delhi  must not allow itself to be cajoled much less coerced into  accepting any non- proliferation proposal. In fact, credible  verification of full compliance with nuclear obligations should  be high on the agenda of the NPT review conference next year.  The Clinton administration's bid to jump the gun is thus  entirely misconceived. Most pertinently, India is already a  co-sponsor with the US of a UN resolution seeking an  international convention for fissile material cut-off. This is  all the more reason why the US initiative limited to South Asia  lacks justification</p>

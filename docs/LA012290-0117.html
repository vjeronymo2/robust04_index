			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIANTS' CLARK NOW RICHEST PLAYER: $15-MILLION DEAL  </P> <P> All-Star first baseman Will Clark became the richest player in baseball today  with the signing of a four-year, $15-million contract with the San Francisco  Giants.  </P> <P> Under terms of the contract, Clark will average $3.75 million per season,  boosting him past the week-old record of $3.5 million belonging to Oakland  Athletics' pitcher Dave Stewart.  </P> <P> "It definitely overwhelms you to know that baseball has this much money," said  Clark during a news conference at Candlestick Park. "I did not get into it to  try to rob the bank. I got into it because I love the game."  </P> <P> Clark's attorney, Jeffrey Moorad, noted that Clark also got the largest signing  bonus in baseball history -- $2 million. Moorad said Clark will make $4.25  million in the fourth year of the contract, "So Will becomes the first  $4-million dollar player."  </P> <P> "He plays like a Hall of Famer and he should be paid like one," said Giants  General Manager Al Rosen.  </P> <P> The left-handed batting Clark had probably his best season last year, when he  finished with a .333 average, 23 home runs, 111 RBIs, 104 runs scored and 196  hits.  </P></p>

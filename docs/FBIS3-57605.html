Viktor Shevaldin, Ignalina director, said the reactor will  start to operate at a minimum output Friday and should reach its  previous 750-megawatt output by Monday.    Shevaldin said a thorough examination of the crack in the  emergency cooling system confirmed preliminary forecasts that  the stoppage should be rated zero on the International Atomic  Energy Agency scale and can be regarded as "a minor incident."    The Lithuanian State Atomic Energy Inspection gave  permission  to start the reactor when the defect was repaired.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered chairman's pay rises 29% MR RODNEY Galpin, chairman of Standard Chartered, the international bank, received a 29 per cent pay increase to Pounds 393,000 last year even though the bank's pre-tax profits fell slightly. Standard said the rise was justifiable because 'underlying' profits had risen sharply - profits before bad debts rose 25 per cent to Pounds 436.5m. However, the financial performance was hurt by a Pounds 366m charge for bad and doubtful debts, including a Pounds 272m provision to cover possible losses from Standard's involvement in an Indian stock market scandal. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 205.3m to Pounds 202m. In its annual report Standard also disclosed that it had set up Standard Chartered Holdings (International), a Dutch holding company that would hold the majority of the group's overseas subsidiaries and associate undertakings. The bulk of Standard's operations are in the Far East and Africa. The bank said the new corporate structure was intended to be more tax efficient than existing arrangements, but did not disclose further details. Mr Galpin is retiring at the annual meeting in May, to be replaced by Mr Patrick Gillam, deputy chairman.</p>

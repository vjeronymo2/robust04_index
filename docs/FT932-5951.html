			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Wall St float plan for BP subsidiary British Petroleum is planning a Wall Street flotation for its Purina Mills animal feeds arm if it is unable to sell the US business to a trade buyer at an acceptable price. BP has filed an initial application with the Securities and Exchange Commission which could lead to a flotation to raise about Dollars 215m (Pounds 139m). As well as the proceeds of the flotation BP would also receive Dollars 115m in debt repayments. Purina Mills is part of BP's nutrition business, which was put up for sale last year, when BP said it was to concentrate on its oil and gas businesses. At that time analysts said they expected the sale of the nutrition businesses to raise between Dollars 750m and Dollars 900m. As well as Purina, BP's other animal feeds businesses in Europe are still up for sale. Last week BP announced the sale of its consumer products division for Pounds 250m to a management buy-out organised by Legal &amp; General.</p>

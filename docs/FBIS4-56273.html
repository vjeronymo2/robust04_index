			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacqueline Aponte] </F>   [Text] Private enterprise has reacted favorably to the  presentation of the government's economic program, which  includes something new: 10 percent of PDVSA [Petroleos de  Venezuela, S.A.] and CVG [Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana]  shares will be transferred to workers as a way of paying social  benefits owed to them and at the same time opening basic  industries to private, local, and foreign investment.    Asked about the matter, Jorge Redmond, president of the  Confederation of Venezuelan Chambers and Associations of  Industrialists [Conindustria], said the reaction was "positive."  He remarked, however, that the event was not truly the  presentation of an economic program but rather a philosophical  orientation on economy.    He said that the unusual thing about the event was the use  of  a new method to solve the problem posed by the need to reduce  the number of public employees. He added that the unusual method  of using PDVSA and CVG shares to pay benefits offers two  positive advantages: It helps reduce the payroll, inflation, and  interest rates, and stimulates the economy.    Redmond described as "resourceful and commendable" the  government suggesting, at the presentation of its economic  program, an adjustment in the social benefits system to restore  the people's lost purchasing power. He also said that this is an  indication of President Rafael Caldera's interest in changing  the populist ideas presented during his campaign, such as  keeping gasoline prices at the current level and continuing with  the same social benefits program.    According to Berend Roosen, president of the National  Council  for Commerce and Services [Consecomercio], what the government  presented on Wednesday is only the backbone of an economic  program and that, for this reason, many things were neither said  nor explained. "Nevertheless, we were happy to hear talk about  opening the oil industry and the CVG to outside capital and the  transfer of shares of these enterprises to the workers.  Evidently, we are speaking a very similar language."    Roosen added that the government is beginning to understand  that the state's labor obligations are very high. The government  wants to relieve the pressure on the health and education  sectors through decentralization. The formula presented  yesterday will serve to transfer the services without  obligations, as the governors had been demanding.    As for the transfer of 10 percent of PDVSA and CVG shares,  Roosen said it still remains to determine how this decision will  be implemented because PDVSA as such cannot transfer its shares.  Nevertheless, the enterprise could do it through its  subsidiaries, which have been set up as corporations and can  register their shares on the stock market.</p>

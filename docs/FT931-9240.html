			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Paris plans shorter week French labour minister Martine Aubry yesterday called for the working week to be cut by two hours in 1996 as a way of reducing unemployment, an issue dominating the run-up to parliamentary elections next month, Reuter reports from Paris. 'It is inevitable,' Ms Aubry told Sunday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper. 'Let's propose, for example, a first stage to 37 hours a week in 1996, with negotiations from now until then on how it should be done.' Ms Aubry said people would have to take pay cuts but these should spare the lowest paid workers. Unemployment in France stands at 10.5 per cent of the workforce, or nearly 3m. A conservative opposition alliance is widely expected to defeat the ruling Socialists in voting on March 21 and 28.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips as Hang Seng hits a low Position covering by traders ahead of the weekend pulled a lacklustre market lower, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 lost 15.30 to 18,998.30, up 1.7 per cent on the week. The 225 index drifted between a morning high of 19,080.22 and an afternoon low of 18,946, rallying before the close on arbitrage buying. Losers outnumbered gainers 594 to 402 with 201 stocks unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks, after losing 1.21 on Thursday, shed another 3.35 to 1,515.85, while the Nikkei 300 dipped 0.52 to 279.22. The day's volume of 210m shares was down on the 265.29m shares that changed hands Thursday. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.01 to 1258.01. Leading steel makers shared in the day's declines on active trading. Nippon Steel, the day's most active stock for the third consecutive session, was off Y8 to Y366 in volume of 5.4m shares. Japan Tobacco extended its declines to make a new low of Y955,000, down Y5,000 on the day and nearly half a million off its October public offering price of Y1,438,000. In Osaka the OSE average slipped 63.82 to 21,115.19 in volume of 13.7m shares. . Roundup Wall Street's overnight fall and anticipation of yesterday's US jobs data put pressure on regional markets. HONG KONG sank 2.5 per cent to a low for the year as losses were seen across the board and the Hang Seng index finished 209.23 down at 8,221.57, having been as low as 8,135.64. The index lost 5 per cent over the week. Turnover rose to HKDollars 4.2bn as regional funds raised cash in preparation for redemptions. The latest H-share issue from China, Zhenhai Refining, plunged 30.5 cents to HKDollars 2.075 on its debut from its offer price of HKDollars 2.38. SINGAPORE fell 1.8 per cent as investors cleared positions ahead of the weekend. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 40.33 to 2,189.02 for a 2.1 per cent fall on the week. KUALA LUMPUR picked up from the day's lows with the emergence of bargain hunting but the composite index still finished down 8.39 at 977.74, having been under pressure by afternoon selling, largely from funds from the US and Japan. The index dropped 3.4 per cent over the week, amid worries about rising interest rates locally and in the US, and bearish technical indicators in several key KLSE index component stocks. SEOUL extended early losses on hefty institutional selling of blue chips, sending the market to a lower close for the third consecutive session. The composite index lost 12.58 to 1,053.63 for a 2.9 per cent fall on the week. TAIPEI closed higher in modest trade, led by state-run banks, despite investor worries over today's elections, brokers said.

MANILA lost 1.8 per cent in the shadow of Wall Street's overnight fall. The composite index fell 48.61 to 2,596.75, for a week's fall of 4.6 per cent. Petron was the main loser, falling initially to an all-time low of 18.50 pesos in early trade, before settling at 19.25 pesos, off 0.50 pesos. SYDNEY lost ground assisted by weakness in bullion. The All Ordinaries index shed 20.3 to 1,880.1, a week's loss of 1.5 per cent, in turnover of ADollars 356m. WELLINGTON ended at its lowest level for 14 months as the market continued to follow weakness in overseas markets and reflect higher domestic interest rates. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 33.5 to 1,942.56 on the day and 2.5 per cent on the week.

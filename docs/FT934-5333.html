			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Aerolineas needs Dollars 200m to avoid collapse, says Iberia AEROLINEAS Argentinas, the troubled carrier operated by Spain's Iberia, will be allowed to collapse unless the Argentine government injects about Dollars 200m into the semi-privatised airline, a senior Iberia executive has warned. Juan Saez, Iberia executive vice president, said in an interview at the weekend that without fresh funds, 'the company will be dissolved. As simple as that. It is not a political problem, it is a reality. Our pockets are empty'. His remarks substantially raise the stakes in negotiations with the government over the loss-making company's future. Iberia maintains that the airline needs fresh funds to finance a government-mandated investment programme and rebuild its balance sheet. The government, which holds 43 per cent of Aerolneas, has refused to contribute to a planned Dollars 450m capital injection for Aerolineas. Iberia owns 30 per cent of the airline. Mr Saez warned that without this support, Aerolneas would run out of cash in 'two or three months' at the end of the busy holiday season. 'When the low season comes and it needs money, there is no bank that will lend to it. And then if it cannot pay for fuel, wages or landing rights in New York, then it will collapse.' Mr Saez recognised that if this were to happen, it 'will have cost us Dollars 1bn'. He said Iberia has 'been injecting some Dollars 20m a month for current spending and today the money has run out'. A government official said: 'The situation has not changed at all.' However, the government is understood to be looking for Argentine investors to take its place. Aerolneas has lost over Dollars 300m since an Iberia-led consortium paid Dollars 1.87bn in a cash and debt for equity swap for 85 per cent of the airline in 1990. But last year the government had to take back 28 per cent of the company to avoid its collapse, following the withdrawal of Iberia's insolvent Argentine partners. The government now owns 33 per cent of the airline plus a further 10 per cent held in trust for employees. The remainder is held by Spanish and Argentine investors.</p>

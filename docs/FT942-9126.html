			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Early gains in stock index futures were reversed in technical trading as dealers awaited the outcome of today's US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. The firm start to trading after the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,126, encouraged further buying led by independent traders. The 9.30am release of UK producer output prices data, showed the figures to be in line with expectations and a further bout of buying shortly after the figure's release sent the contract to the day's peak of 3,141. Technical trading, as dealers focused on today's FOMC meeting expected to result in an increase in US interest rates, reversed earlier gains leaving the contract to drift lower and to ignore a firm start to trading in New York in the afternoon. June fell to a low of 3,104 before steadying to close at 3,106, at a 7 point discount to the underlying cash market. However, dealers reported an improvement in June in after hours trading. Volume was 13,570 contracts. An active session in the traded options brought turnover of 31,767 lots, The FT-SE 100 option traded 11,280 lots though the Euro FT-SE option had a poor day with a mere 1,040 lots dealt. British Gas was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,907 contracts transacted.</p>

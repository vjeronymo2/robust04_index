(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared by the Amex. On September 20, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange proposes to require issuers of ELNs who reserve the ability to satisfy their obligations at maturity with either cash or shares of the linked security to publish notice, no less than 10 and no more than 20 business days prior to maturity of the ELNs, of how the issuer intends to satisfy its obligations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated September 20, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II.

The Exchange's ELNs listing standards were subsequently amended to broaden the universe of securities eligible to underlie an issue of ELNs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33328 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 66041 (December 17, 1993) (order providing alternate trading volume and market capitalization requirements for the underlying security) and 34549 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43873 (August 25, 1994) (order allowing ELNs linked to sponsored American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') and other securities issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34549''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 107A of the Guide currently specifies minimum issuer qualifications, public distribution, aggregate market value guidelines, and other criteria to assist the Exchange in its case-by-case review and determination of the suitability of any hybrid security (including ELNs) for listing and trading. The Exchange now proposes to amend Section 107A of the Guide to provide additional flexibility in the listing of such securities. Specifically, it is proposed that the aggregate minimum market value criteria be changed from $20 million to $4 million, consistent with the current listing requirements for currency and index warrants under Section 106 of the Guide. The Exchange also proposes to eliminate, in favor of a case-by-case review, the minimum holder requirement for securities that are listed pursuant to Section 107A of the Guide but which are traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond trading floor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

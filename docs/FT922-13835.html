			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Long-distance bussing to reach personal ends  -Campaign trail comes full circle for party leaders It began in Grantham, Mrs Margaret Thatcher's home town, and ended in Dulwich in south London, where she bought her post-Downing Street home. In almost every other respect Mr John Major's campaign has been a contrast to that of his predecessor, Alison Smith writes. The three and a half weeks on the road have been a process of Mr Major's finding his own voice on the campaign trail. His inexperience at this level of campaigning and his inability to rouse the faithful to the heights of ecstasy they reached under Mrs Thatcher told against him. In his favour were the fact that people liked him, his mastery of his brief  -albeit in slightly bureaucratic language - and his enjoyment of going out on tour. His interest in what he was shown, whether it was a coldstore in Sheerness Docks, or machine tools in Tamworth, amazed the travelling press. He said early in the campaign: 'I don't believe you can find out what is happening in the schools or indeed anywhere else simply by sitting behind a desk in Whitehall.' The belief that if everyone in the country could just talk to him for a few minutes the Tories would win by a landslide lay behind the barstool 'Meet John Major' sessions. He handled them competently, but they lacked bite and were too low-key to give the campaign momentum. The real innovation was the speech-on-a-soapbox, a reprise of his early political days in Brixton. The soapbox first appeared at the end of March when there was disorder on a walkabout in Luton, and appeared three times afterwards. It has not been used since Mr Major said he would take it everywhere with him, but the sharper style and apparently greater confidence have remained. His tour has been the despair of press photographers. The number of factories and businesses visited was more than all the schools, hospitals, sporting venues and farms - which would be expected to yield better pictures  -put together. His speeches at the seven setpiece rallies have benefited dramatically from his working on them more himself, though this led to some longuers during the campaign day which often lacked focus. Nearly 10,000 miles and 26 days later, Mr Major is a better campaigner. But an election in a recession was not the best time for a learning curve. The banana-yellow battle bus of Mr Paddy Ashdown ended its tour in the party leader's Yeovil constituency last night, Ralph Atkins writes. Its success will be measured in the extra votes Liberal Democrats are expected to win today. The failures? It is still not clear what the party's 'My Vote' slogan actually means. The effectiveness of the leader's tour has surprised even party officials. One admitted yesterday that strategy meetings had descended into witty repartee, in the absence of decisions to be made. It could have gone horribly wrong. The punishing schedule - literally from dawn to after midnight from the Scottish Highlands to the tip of Cornwall - could have led to physical exhaustion and disgruntled journalists. One Ashdown aide said: 'If we were five points down, not up, in the opinion polls, we'd be very different.' To impartial observers the fireworks, dry-ice and streamers at the evening rallies looked out of place at the slightly dilapidated school halls often chosen as venues. But in fleeting TV pictures, they were on a par with Labour or the Tories. Mr Ashdown's message has been broad-brush and populist. Only in the last few days has his party's manifesto been subject to precise questioning in set-piece television interviews, and even then discussion on hung parliament scenarios has predominated. Introducing Mr Neil Kinnock as the next prime minister is commonplace at Labour rallies. With campaigning virtually over, this no longer carries the empty ring of impending failure, Michael Cassell writes. Mr Kinnock and his team, hopelessly exhausted yet spurred on by the sweet smell of victory, believe the ultimate prize is but hours away. The leader's voice is wrecked, but his temper has not frayed. The entourage appears deeply drained but highly relieved that the slog is over. But there is also controlled exhilaration. When an aide said: 'This has been the easy bit, from Friday we start the real job,' she meant it. Talk of how Gerald will perform, whether Gordon will strike up a healthy relationship with business, who will be the first cabinet member to get the chop, is all discussed with an impressive air of certainty. The language of speculation has drifted away. But throughout the last few hectic hours of plane-hopping, photo-calls and soundbites Mr Kinnock's men and women have been anxious that no one should go over the top in public and risk offending those who remain undecided by displaying a touch too much triumphalism. The campaign tactics surrounding the leader remained unchanged until the final hours. Mr Kinnock was enveloped in the trappings of a senior statesman, hopping from aircraft to Daimler to selected audience, his every handshake orchestrated. As the Kinnock campaign drew to a close late last night, emotions on the Labour bus fell and then rose again as the message from the final opinion polls came through. By the time Mr Kinnock had told supporters in his own constituency that Labour was set to win, spirits were as high as at any time during the campaign. Today Mr Kinnock and his team can only rest and await the nation's verdict.</p>

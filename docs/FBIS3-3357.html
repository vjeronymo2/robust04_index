Bao, 31, had recently written a letter asking Japan to  apologize and pay war reparations for crimes committed during  the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese War. Bao was detained at about 10  a.m. (0200 GMT) by several police officers when he left his  home, a close associate said. He had been under constant  surveillance for three days, since Hosokawa arrived in China,  the source said.    A resident of Shanghai, Bao fought for years for war  reparations from Japan and has already been to prison several  times for this reason. He is also a democracy movement  activist. Last Thursday, he published a letter in which he  directly addressed the Japanese prime minister, asking him to  apologize and to pay war reparations.    On Friday, several elderly Chinese were detained for  questioning when they tried to protest in front of the Japanese  embassy in Beijing.    Hosokawa ended his visit to China Monday in Shanghai. During  the visit, he recalled that he had, at the time he took office  last August, apologized for the crimes committed by the Imperial  Japanese Army in China. China officially gave up its demands  for war reparations in 1972.</p>

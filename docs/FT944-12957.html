			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Learning the tricks of the trade - Ever wondered where financial advisers get their know-how? Motoko Rich goes on a training course Stephen Harrington is a junior manager in an electronics firm who earns Pounds 27,000 a year. Wife Diana left her job four years ago to bring up their children, now aged two and six. Stephen has no death-in-service benefits and the only life cover they have is a joint life endowment policy covering their Pounds 40,000 mortgage. So what would Diana need if Stephen was to die now? While this might sound a morbid question, financial advisers deal with such issues every day. And such questions are considered protective, not morbid. This week, I was invited - along with five other journalists and a press officer - to consider the life industry's perspective during a two-day course for trainee sales agents at Legal &amp; General. Sealed off from the world in a converted country residence at Kingswood, a village in Surrey, we reviewed a range of subjects including regulation, taxation, mortgages, life assurance and pensions. When I decided to attend the course, I was sceptical; for the industry has not earned a particularly trustworthy reputation in recent times. During the past year alone, several life offices - including L&amp;G - have been fined by Lautro, the industry regulator, for a failure to control their sales forces. Then, too, there was this week's announcement of action by the Securities and Investments Board over mis-selling of personal pensions. So, it has been easy to wonder if training methods have, at least in part, been to blame for the industry's problems. Finally, as a potential consumer, I wanted to see what sales staff were taught to do before trying to part people from their money. Was it just a big con? It turned out that this was not true. Equally, though, if consumers do not have the chance to attend such courses - and most do not - they could well be conned. For the basic assumption of the entire L&amp;G course  - and the industry - is that all the services an insurance company offers do fulfil genuine needs. This, most certainly, is not always the case. This basic principle was introduced at the outset of the course. Mike, one of two earnest trainers, launched it with a session on 'the need for financial services'. He asked us to fill in the first of many work sheets; this one listed financial commitments for eight stages of life, signposted by conventional institutions such as home ownership, marriage, children and retirement. Then, we were asked to fill in a column marked: 'What Could Go Wrong'. From the answers we provided, he urged us to extrapolate the need for countless financial products. Throughout the course, the trainers produced an overhead projection slide of these life stages with irritating regularity. Woven in between factual information about taxation, social security benefits and industry regulation were references to this 'life line' and the all-important need to provide for each stage with products from the financial services industry. In many cases, though, the products they claimed were crucial would simply be over-kill and, moreover, a waste of money. It is hard to believe, for example, that a young person who is earning but still living at home needs to consider a life assurance policy or critical illness cover. Yet, from personal experience, I know that financial advisers try to target such groups. The trainers were careful to emphasise the requirement for advisers to inform clients of product risks and poor surrender yields. They also stressed constantly the importance of a 'fact find' to determine a client's legitimate needs. But there was never any mention of the fact that some of the industry's products - such as endowment policies - are now considered inappropriate for most people. By using the life line as a framework for determining client needs, the course did not take into account many changes in society such as increased periods of unemployment or multiple careers. These do not fit very soundly with most of the products offered by insurance companies: namely, policies that require regular premium payments over a long period. In many ways, the training course simply seemed out of step with the times. Nevertheless, the course was reassuring in that the company expected us to be familiar with a broad range of topics. Preparation for the classroom portion came in the form of a 400-page manual, which we were told to study for at least 40 hours. In my case, it was more like 10. At the end of the course, we took an examination modelled on the first paper of the Chartered Insurance Institute's* financial planning certificate (FPC1). At L&amp;G, the FPC1 is the first hurdle all trainees must overcome before proceeding to instruction in specific products, sales skills and, ultimately, selling itself. 'It is a relatively low-level qualification,' said Clive Sanderson, divisional director of examinations at the CII. 'But, nevertheless, it is very thorough in that it does introduce the regulatory situation and generic products.' I passed L&amp;G's mock exam by the narrowest margin. But it is slightly worrying that I achieved this benchmark qualification without a great deal of conscientious effort - especially since Dick Evemy, L&amp;G's training manager, said that 'a majority' of recruits who walk through the doors of the training centre pass it. It is even more worrying that independent financial advisers - those who are not tied to a particular company - can sell on the basis of FPC1 knowledge alone. I would not want to give financial planning advice to anyone merely on the basis of what I learned from the course. This is not an adequate foundation for giving professional advice (although there is slight relief in knowing that Lautro requires all company representatives to have more training before being allowed to approach customers). What I do believe, however, is that it is the only adequate basis for receiving professional financial advice. Without it, or some equivalent, I could easily feel that I was being blinded by jargon or concepts I did not understand. The CII produces course material for its FPC exams, and although they are marketed widely to industry sales agents, any member of the public is welcome to buy a study pack for Pounds 40. It could be the best financial investment you make. Regulators who are concerned about investor protection should not only be concerned with proper training of the industry's sales force. They should also put more effort into informing the consumer. Perhaps the new Personal Investment Authority could sponsor a course for customers called 'Let the Buyer Beware'. *The CII, 31 Hillcrest Road, South Woodford, London E18. Tel: 071-606 3835.</p>

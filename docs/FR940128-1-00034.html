			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained above, a HACCP system will not work unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records are generated during the operation of the HACCP plan, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these records are maintained and are available for review (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section IV.A.6. of this document). Thus, FDA is requiring in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.6(b)(5) that the HACCP plan provide for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping system that will document the processor's or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer's monitoring of the critical control points. Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.6(b)(5) also requires that HACCP records contain the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values obtained during monitoring, such as the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures and times. FDA has tentatively concluded that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not possible for the processor to derive the full benefits of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP system, nor is it possible for FDA to verify the operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the system, without actual values. Notations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration temperatures are satisfactory or unsatisfactory,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without recording the actual temperatures, are vague and subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to varying interpretation and thus will not ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventive controls are working. Also, it is not possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discern trends without actual values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, proposed &sect;123.6(b)(5) requires that HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records include the actual consumer complaints that may have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by the processor or importer relating to the operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of critical control points or possible critical limit deviations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has tentatively concluded that it may be necessary on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occasion for it to review these complaints in order to be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validate whether the firm is taking necessary steps to review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls and correct deviations as necessary in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not FDA's intent to gain unlimited access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry's consumer complaint files through this proposal or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engage in ``fishing expeditions'' through consumer complaint files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only those consumer complaints relating to the operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP critical control points need be included as HACCP records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's interest is solely in verifying that the HACCP system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working as it should. The agency understands the sensitivities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with consumer complaint records and invites comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this aspect of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Nonsafety Hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;123.6(c) encourages, but does not require,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and importers to include in their plans controls for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards other than hazards to health. Examples listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.6(c)(1)(i) and (ii) are decomposition not associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human illness and economic adulteration. FDA is not requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and importers to include nonsafety hazards in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plans for reasons stated previously. However, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is encouraging processors and importers to apply HACCP principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to these nonsafety hazards, and to control them in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner that processors and importers control safety hazards (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.6(c)(2)), because they are common problems in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood industry. FDA has included a guideline on economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adulteration with these proposed regulations (see Appendix D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the fact that these proposed regulations do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require HACCP controls for nonsafety hazards, such hazards as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic adulteration, decomposition not normally associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human illness, general unfitness for food, and misbranding,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute violations of the act and are subject to regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action by FDA (see sections 402(a)(3) and 403 of the act (21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 343). Inspections by FDA investigators will continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to consider and enforce these provisions of the act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

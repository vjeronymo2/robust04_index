			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAGAN DAY  </P> <P> If the members of the Truth Missions really knew the "truth" (Only in L.A.,  April 20), they would lighten up. That Christmas was originally a pagan  festival is beyond all doubt, the tree being equally common in pagan Rome and  pagan Egypt. Take a trip to the library of your choice and relax; "only 249  shopping days until Pagan Day," aka Christmas.  </P> <P> LISA VONN  </P> <P> Montecito  </P></p>

OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim  met IFP leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Ulundi today.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] The OAU  leader's visit to Ulundi for talks with the IFP and the kwaZulu  government was the first by a leader of this organization. Both  Dr. Ahmed Salim and Buthelezi made one thing clear: They had  different views and perspectives of the transition process and  especially the elections.    [Salim] I believe in this because of these discussions that  it will be vital in the interest of South Africa that everything  be done to ensure an all inclusive election where the  participation of all the political forces in the country, and  certainly the participation of Inkatha Freedom Party also is  possible.    [Buthelezi] We definitely are doing everything worthwhile  because we are very keen to participate in the elections, and  therefore even now at this last moment -- even today -- our  members of parliament I think, are talking to a select committee  of Parliament about some of the amendments which were proposed  by the IFP and the Freedom Alliance.    [Alfonso] Both leaders also confirmed that international  mediation, especially by the OAU, was of critical importance.  Dr. Buthelezi said free political activity had become almost  impossible in most parts of Natal. [end recording]</p>

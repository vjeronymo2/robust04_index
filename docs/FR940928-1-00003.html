			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> American General has issued Critical Service Bulletin SB&hyph;185, dated July 6, 1994, which specifies procedures for inspecting the wing attach shoulder bolts and the mounting holes in the wing spar and the center section spar on American General Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above, the FAA has determined that, in order to determine whether the established service life of the wing attach shoulder bolts is adequate, (1) a one-time inspection should be accomplished to reveal the condition of these bolts on the American General Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplane fleet; and (2) AD action should be taken to prevent wing attach shoulder bolt failure, which could lead to structural damage of the wing/fuselage to the point of failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other American General Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require inspecting (one-time) the wing attach shoulder bolts for fretting, scoring, wear, excessive clearance, or enlarged or elongated mounting holes (known as damage from hereon), replacing any damaged parts and repairing any damaged areas, and reporting to the FAA the results of the inspection. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with American General Critical Service Bulletin SB&hyph;185, dated July 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA will examine the inspection results and determine whether further rulemaking action is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 3,700 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 10 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,035,000 ($550 per airplane X 3,700 airplanes). This figure is based upon the assumption that no affected airplane operator has accomplished the proposed inspection, and does not take into account the cost for replacement if damaged bolts are found. The FAA has no way of determining the number of bolts that may need to be replaced based upon the results of the inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket.

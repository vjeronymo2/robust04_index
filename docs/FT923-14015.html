			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Sharp fall in exports hits German surplus: Hopes of interest rate cut replaced by fears of monetary tightening LINGERING hopes of a summer start to international economic recovery received a setback yesterday when Germany recorded a surprise fall in its trade surplus for May. Imports and exports both dropped sharply, indicating continuing weak demand from abroad and stagnation at home. Instead of the widely forecast rise in the surplus to about DM3.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn), the federal statistics office yesterday reported a drop to just DM1.1bn, against April's DM2.3bn surplus. Imports fell from DM58bn to DM51bn and exports dived from DM60.4bn to DM52.2bn. The current account deficit widened to DM4.2bn from DM1.9bn. The disappointing results were compounded by inflation figures, stuck firmly above 4 per cent, a standstill in already depressed manufacturing orders and falling capital investment - suggesting the expected emergence from the doldrums must wait until after the summer lull. Even then German hopes are pinned mostly on rising domestic demand following expiry of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge at the end of June. Hopes abroad for a cut in German interest rates have also been put on hold and replaced by speculation over the chances of further tightening of monetary policy at the Bundesbank's next council meeting on July 16. The central bank yesterday described a newspaper report that it was considering a renewed squeeze as 'speculation'. However, economists say the time is ripe for a further signal on the bank's determination to maintain monetary discipline. While an interest rates rise is widely ruled out, other measures to control fast-growing money supply are not. One possibility is a rise in banks' minimum reserve requirements, to try to curb lending. The M3 broad measure of money supply is growing at an annualised rate of 9 per cent, against the 5.5 per cent upper limit of the bank's target range. A report from the Ifo economics institute in Munich, which says manufacturing investment in west Germany will fall by a real 2 per cent this year, supports suggestions that much borrowing is to help companies manage cash-flow problems. Private mortgage demand is also unusually strong. Mr Otmar Issing, a bank council member, yesterday referred specifically to M3 expansion when he said 'there is no situation in which we could think to reduce interest rates'. Inflation, the other key factor governing interest rate policy, is still above the bank's medium-term target of 2.5 per cent. A month-on-month increase of 0.2 per cent in May, confirmed yesterday, left the annual rate at 4.3 per cent. According to the June economic survey from the BDI, the federation of German industries, next January's increase in value-added tax from 14 per cent to 15 per cent will provide another inflationary surge. The federation also warned of dangers from the east. Transfers will exceed the nominal increase in gross national product, it said, with the net result being that 'the cost of reconstruction will have to be met by cuts in purchasing power in the west'. The dire state of east Germany's economy was underlined by statistics showing that gross domestic product per inhabitant in the new states is about DM10,500 a year. This compares with more than DM65,000 in Hamburg, the richest state, and almost DM40,000 in North Rhine Westphalia, the most populous. The German post office is to shed 34,000 jobs by the end of the decade, the Deutsche Bundespost announced yesterday. Forced redundancies among the service's 385,000 employees have been ruled out.</p>

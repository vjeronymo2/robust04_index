			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev by </F> Stiliyan Ivanov; place and date not given: "Structural Reforms  in the Army Are Essential"]    [Text] [Noev] Allow me first of all to thank you for  giving me a chance to express my views on issues that have  become very topical lately. Regarding some of these issues,  certain people have even directed personal accusations against  me, charges that I consider neither fair nor correct.    [Ivanov] Is there any conflict between the civil Defense  Ministry leadership and the General Staff?    [Noev] Certain differences do exist in our approaches to  resolving the existing problems, but they are far from being as  dramatic as some people represent.    The bitter pill of the budget served as a catalyst for  speeding up the reforms. The need for reforms has been growing  for several years and now it has reached a peak. All  sociological studies show that tension has accumulated in the  Army, and those who are charged with specific responsibilities  in the defense field strongly demand that something must be  done. The differences mainly concern the speed of the reforms.  The delay in passing the new Armed Forces Act and the shortage  of funds should not, in my view, provide pretexts for inaction.  However, some action is already taking place, despite a certain  cooling in relations between certain individuals.    In the final analysis, I personally regard the differences  in  views that are developing as a condition for more correct  decisions.    [Ivanov] You are singled out for stating figures for  redundancies in the Army that are not only arousing anxiety in  the officer corps but also conflict with what Defense Minister  Aleksandrov has said. Where does the truth lie, in your opinion?    [Noev] I have never publicly presented any figures on army  redundancies, but the answers that I gave at the closed meeting  of the Parliamentary National Security Commission have  unfortunately been leaked in distorted form to the press. At  the present moment we are only talking about retirements, and  these moreover affect only very limited numbers of officers.  Minister Aleksandrov lucidly explained what it is all about.  There will be no pensioning of majors and lieutenant colonels  before September, when the new structures and staffing levels,  on which the General Staff is drafting a proposal, are to be  approved under Article 71 of the Defense and Armed Forces Act.  Later, the General Staff will propose which officers may make  up the relevant staff levels and which not. Regarding officers  with the rank of colonel, it must be made perfectly clear that  there is no question of pensioning off military doctors -- about  200 of them, or officers on the teaching staffs of the higher  military educational establishments, or of suspending military  education. Nor do the redundancies affect officers in leading  posts with direct responsibilities for combat readiness and the  functioning of the General Staff as "the Army's brain." There  are only 83 such officers in all. However, of the 921 officers  of pensionable age, excluding all those holding top positions,  about 450 of them will remain in various other posts. They  cannot in any way help to resolve the problem of the shortage of  young officers at the lower levels of the hierarchy, at platoon  and company level. The opposite is true. However, for  inexplicable reasons, a certain person is fighting like a lion  to keep them in military service, using all available means,  including some criteria that I regard as dishonorable. This is  being done to the detriment of army morale, at the expense of  fellow officers, and, in the final analysis, at the taxpayer's  expense. One asks: Why do this just now? Why not wait and see  what happens? However, the other side may counter by saying:  What is there to wait for? How long does one have to wait? Why  put it off yet again?    Certain persons are also deliberately manipulating the  problem of the monetary compensation that is envisaged. I can  state quite categorically that funds for this exist in the  budget. If a decision in principle is adopted, every colonel  who goes into the reserve may receive 18 monthly salaries in  cash, which means roughly 170,000 leva. Even after the  deduction of tax, they will be left with a considerable amount  of money for our conditions. This amount, if applied in the  simplest way, can produce 5,000 leva a month in bank interest,  Let the others say if this is "throwing people onto the  street." However, ethical standards are also needed for this.  This also forms part of the truth.    [Ivanov] What do you think about a 55,000-strong army?    [Noev] I have already told a large-circulation daily that  this is an assessment made by a top military leader who was  instructed to investigate what a fully combat-ready army would  look like as regards personnel strength within the strictures of  the 13 billion leva defense budget. I will have nothing to do  with such quantitative assessments. Interestingly, however,  they coincide with analyses made by authoritative specialist  institutes.    [Ivanov] One has the impression that you are at  loggerheads with the deputies in the Parliamentary National  Security Commission. What are the reasons for this?    [Noev] I respect the deputies in principle. At sessions of  the relevant parliament commissions I have been asked questions  that I gave frank answers to, because I believe that the more  clearly one defines one's position, the better is one  understood. It is another matter whether every one of my  answers was to their liking and whether my answer was the only  right one. However, that is what discussions are for. I accept  my partners in discussions as collaborators with whom we all  resolve national security problems together, within the limits  of our responsibilities. No one gains from shilly-shallying.    [Ivanov] What do you think should be done to improve  officers' motivation?    [Noev] Two groups of factors mainly affect motivation:  First, pay and living conditions, and second, the opportunities  for professional and personal fulfillment. Regarding the  former, everything is being done within the strictures of the  budget, and pay will rise as the state's macroeconomic  parameters improve. There are a number of possibilities for new  decisions on social and everyday issues. We are working on  them, including housing policy, and I hope to receive proposals  soon. Regarding the latter, one of our top priority tasks is to  adopt a principled cadre policy with clearly defined  opportunities for developing a career and concluding it in a  worthy manner. This is precisely what the Defense Ministry  leadership is attempting, I emphasize attempting, to do right  now.    The officer corps in sum total represents the most  disciplined and educated stratum of our society, and serves as a  bulwark for social stability. It is of key importance in the  difficult conditions of the transition. The officers deserve  recognition from society for this, and such recognition is  itself a strong source of motivation for them.    [Ivanov] When will the structural reforms begin in the Army?    [Noev] They should start as soon as possible, and I believe  that they will be to the troops' benefit.    [Ivanov] People have singled you out as President Zhelev's  man in the Defense Ministry. What is your comment on this?    [Noev] The president has spoken with me on only one  occasion. The conversation was brief, but very useful for me. I  leave it to the observers to assess who is who's man.  Sometimes, such assessments are put forward to achieve certain  aims at a specific political juncture.    [Ivanov] To return to the issue of the UN convoy, who was  right?    [Noev] On this issue we have many people who say they were  right. As far as I am concerned, I think that I was right. In  principle, this was a matter within the powers of the  government, and I put forward my arguments to this effect in  Parliament. Also right were those people -- which, in fact,  included all the deputies, from all the political forces -- who  said that, in the current specific situation, when public  opinion is highly sensitive, this issue goes beyond procedural  and technical considerations. Consultations should have been  held in advance, to show respect for the right of every  political force to state its position in a timely way in a  constructive environment, without descending to the level of  politicizing the issue. In my opinion, it was an important and  useful lesson for everyone who had a connection with the affair.</p>

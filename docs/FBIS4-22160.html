			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Zavorotnyy, Igor Chernyak article: "Will Pinochet </F> Save the Russian Military-Industrial Complex?"]    [Excerpts] In February through March, Russian aircraft led  by the new IL-96 air-dropped powerful assault forces from the  military-industrial complex at two opposite points on the  earth's globe: first in Singapore, then in Chile. The aim:  participation in the "ASIA-94" and "FIDAE-94" aerospace shows,  on which between $1 and $1.5 million was spent. [passage omitted]    "We go to all these exhibition with hope. Nowadays, we are  prepared to sell licenses, test methods, and know-how -- this  could secure a living for ourselves and affiliated plants for  some time at least," Academician Anatoliy Obukhov, chief  designer at the "Bazalt" Science and Production Association, the  Russian Federation's largest producer of mines, munitions,  aircraft bombs, and grenade launchers, explained. "Today, I no  longer see any other ways for the defense complex to survive."  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What, according to your calculations, is the  safety margin for you, for munitions producers in general?    [Obukhov] A year, I think, for all of us. After a year,  everything will be finished.    [Correspondent] But is this really such a terrible thing?  There are many countries without these types of munitions  plants, and they manage....    [Obukhov] Let's begin from the premise that cartridges,  projectiles, and aircraft weapons are still needed -- without  them, the Army and Navy, even in peaceful conditions, simply  cannot exist, not to mention the fact that the number of  localized conflicts in the world is not decreasing. Did anybody  bother to calculate how much it would cost to purchase all this  abroad for our Armed Forces before destroying our own munitions  sector? I can merely assume that nobody is going to sell us  anything on the cheap, and that they are unlikely to make the  latest models available for purchase. On top of all that, we  are in this instance providing jobs not at home but abroad, and  what is more we are falling into direct dependency on suppliers  (and it is vital to be 100-percent sure of such alliances).  But, in general, it has long been time to clarify our position:  Either we consent to the role of being the West's raw materials  appendage with all that ensues from this, or we strive to  preserve and develop our own technologies. [Obukhov ends]    And there is another factor which has been voiced in one  form  or another in many conversations. Whether Russia likes it or  not, its place on the armaments market may very soon, and  without any particular hue and cry, be taken by its powerful  southeastern neighbor. Having saturated the world with cheap  rugs, clothes, children's toys, and other consumer goods, and  having earned on the strength of this around $100 billion last  year alone, it, according to expert testimony, will calmly  undertake to buy up military technologies. A small proportion  has already been acquired from the Russian military-industrial  complex. The possible consequences of this require special  discussion, but defense workers are growing increasingly certain  that the Chinese have the power to swamp the markets with cheap  weaponry and military hardware.  <H5>  In America's Backyard </H5>   What, then, was the outcome of Russia's participation in the  Singapore and Chile exhibitions? There is no simple answer.  After all, aircraft, like weapons, are not snapped up in a  couple of days. [passage omitted]    In Santiago, we happened to strike up a conversation with  two  "defense workers" who had come here with the "Tor-M1" and  "Tunguska" complexes -- the pride of the Russian  military-industrial complex.    "We displayed the `Tor-M1' in Abu-Dhabi, Malaysia, the  Philippines, and Greece, and now we have come to Chile. There  is enormous interest everywhere," Valentin Osilov, deputy chief  designer of the "Antey" Concern, explained.    [Correspondent] How many items were sold in this time, and  to whom?    [Osilov] So far, not a single item. [Osilov ends]    The picture is the same for the "Tunguska," the only sample  of which made its way secretly to one of the NATO countries.  Likewise, no customers can be seen waiting in line for the vast  majority of other military-industrial complex products either.  Yes, of course, everyone is in raptures, the front pages of the  newspapers are littered with huge headlines like "Russians Again  Conquer the World!" but the problem is how to turn this into  business....  <H5>  Red-Brown Bill? </H5>   Revenue from the sale of weaponry from the USSR, and  subsequently from Russia, fell from $20 billion in the 1980's to  $1.9 [billion] in 1993. Much has been written about the reasons  for this -- these include the general warming up of the  situation in the world, the loss of major "clients" like Iraq or  Libya, the instability of the situation in Russia, and erratic  after-sales service, not to mention poor advertising. Would  not, therefore, Russia be better off completely renouncing such  persistent presentation of its aircraft, weaponry, and hardware  abroad?    This would hardly be sensible -- everybody we managed to  speak with was agreed on this. If only because nobody in the  whole world disputes the competitiveness of Russian products.  Yes, it is necessary to advertise them more effectively; yes,  it is vital to seek out new contacts, to convince people of the  superiority of our goods, to search for mutually acceptable  options, and ultimately to win over potential partners --  indeed, can we survive without this? There are enough experts  in the Russian Federation with a highly developed knowledge of  such sensitive matters -- including in the recently created  "Rosvooruzheniye" State Committee, the State Committee for the  Defense Sectors of Industry, and "Aviaeksport." But, even if  they were magicians, their efforts would be worthless without  powerful political support.    The following is a trite example: When the United States  heard about the preparations underway for Russia to sell  Malaysia a batch of MIG aircraft, American senators and military  experts flocked to Kuala Lumpur, and even the U.S. President's  personal representative gave the Malaysians the honor of a  visit. A mass of options was offered, right up to a significant  price cut -- if only they would take the F-16 instead. As a  result, the Americans "shoved in" their own machines, while  Russian representatives have spent over a year fighting to  settle the details of their contract. The managers of a number  of U.S. firms concerned by Russia's attempt to display its wares  in Singapore in the appropriate way also appealed to the White  House for help. And, typically, the President did not label  them "fascists" or take them to task for trying to become a  burden around the neck of the American people, but instructed  that $600,000 be allocated from the state budget to cover their  expenses at the Singapore airshow. (It is hardly a coincidence  that the Americans were given the lion's share of the time to  demonstrate their hardware, and Russia as a result, to use the  lively expression of our interlocutor, was frankly dumped.)  Bill Clinton, like, moreover, his predecessors, is not averse,  if need be, with Hillary at his side, to going to the other end  of the Earth in order at odd moments to undertake the defense of  their military-industrial complex. And advisers hardly need to  tell him that revenue losses from the trade in weapons represent  a loss of influence by the state, and the weakening of its zones  of interests, or, for instance, that he who flies ultimately  rules the world.    You have to have a pretty rich imagination to present Andrey  Kozyrev or Boris Yeltsin in the role of defenders of the  interests of the military-industrial complex.</p>

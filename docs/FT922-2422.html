			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Digital buys UK broadcast technology concern DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer group, has acquired BASYS Automation Systems from Independent Television News of the UK as part of an 'aggressive growth strategy' for the media industry and the broadcast market in particular, Reuter reports from Maynard, Massachusetts. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. UK-based BASYS, which employs 160 people worldwide, supplies news automation and management systems in more than 400 broadcast newsrooms worldwide. Digital and BASYS, which is in the broadcast automation market, will collaborate on such technologies as voice recognition, fibre-optic data distribution interface (FDDI), and Digital's recently announced Intelligent Building products. FDDI is a standard for fibre-optic local area networks, which transmit data, including graphic images, at very high speed. BASYS, which will operate as a wholly owned Digital unit, said Digital's investments, especially in open computer systems, will allow BASYS to expand product development efforts in areas such as multi-media workstations and databases, more aggressively. Digital has been cutting costs and reducing staff in the face of a weakening world economy. In April it reported a net loss for the third quarter of Dollars 294m, or Dollars 2.36 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 116.5m, or 94 cents, in the corresponding period last year.</p>

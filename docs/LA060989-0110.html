			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASHES BETWEEN RIVAL MUSLIM SECTS SPREAD IN UZBEKISTAN; 6 KILLED, 90 WOUNDED  </P> <P> At least six people were killed and 90 wounded Wednesday as ethnic clashes  involving rival Muslim sects spread to another city in the Soviet Central Asian  republic of Uzbekistan, the official Tass news agency said Thursday.  </P> <P> Thousands of people stormed the police department in the city of Kokand in  search of firearms, while as many as 600 people attacked a building belonging  to the Interior Ministry's transport department, Tass said.  </P> <P> The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported earlier Thursday that 71 were  killed in clashes between ethnic groups in Uzbekistan. The violence between the  Meskhetians and the Uzbeks began last weekend around Fergana, about 60 miles  east of Kojand.  </P> <P> The Novosti news agency said religious and ethnic differences were to blame for  the trouble in Uzbekistan.  </P> <P> The Meskhetians -- Georgians who converted to Islam when their land came under  Turkish influence between the 16th and 19th centuries -- are Shiite Muslims.  They were deported to Uzbekistan from Georgia by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944.  </P> <P> The Uzbeks, who are of Turkish descent, are members of Islam's Sunni sect.  </P> <P> "According to preliminary estimates, six people were killed and more than 90  wounded in the unrest on Wednesday," Tass reported.  </P> <P> "Sixty-one people were hospitalized. Among the casualties are militiamen,  soldiers and cadets."  </P> <P> Tass said 65 houses, six administration offices and more than 20 vehicles were  burned by the Kokand rioters. It said many of the rioters were under the  influence of drugs or alcohol.  </P> <P> "The situation in Kokand remains tense," Tass said. "More houses are burning."  </P> <P> Soviet television said 600 people were injured in Kokand in what appeared to be  the worst known single outbreak of ethnic violence in recent Soviet history.  </P></p>

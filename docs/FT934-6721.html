			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Indian SEB extends regulation The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog, has published tough new rules to ensure greater protection for investors from dishonest stockbrokers. The new regulations, which come into force on January 1, will require brokers to maintain separate accounts for clients' money, to issue contract notes within one day of the execution of an order and to settle payments within two days of execution. The rules have been widely welcomed by financial institutions in Bombay. Investors have long criticised the Bombay stock exchange, the country's largest, and other Indian exchanges for inadequate safeguards for clients and poor supervision of brokers' activities. The regulations are expected to assuage the fears of foreign financial institutions which have been increasingly active in the Indian stock market but which have also often expressed concern about the lack of transparency on Indian stock exchanges. Since it was established last year, the securities board has made a high priority of raising regulatory standards on stock exchanges. However, this has annoyed some brokers, who felt that they were being treated unfairly by a supervisory body which they have said did not understand the workings of their market. But with the support of the finance ministry, the securities board has made steady progress in more rigorous regulation and supervision. Bombay SE rival, Page 26</p>

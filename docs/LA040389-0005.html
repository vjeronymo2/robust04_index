			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Bombs exploded near a troop truck in Yugoslavia's riot-torn Kosovo province and  outside a Serbian newspaper office in Croatia, causing no injuries but sparking  fears that ethnic Albanians may be resorting to guerrilla attacks in their  fight against Serbian dominance, officials said. The blasts followed riots by  Albanians in Kosovo last week that left 24 people dead. The riots erupted after  officials in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, imposed curbs  on the southern province's autonomy to permit a crackdown on nationalists who  are accused of persecuting local Serbs.  </P></p>

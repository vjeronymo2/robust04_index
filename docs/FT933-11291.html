			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Piper Alpha claim is overturned A WORKER who witnessed the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster from a rescue vessel was not entitled to claim damages for the psychiatric injury he suffered, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. Three judges overturned a High Court ruling that Mr Francis McFarlane, a painter from Alloa, near Stirling, could claim because he had been in fear for his life and safety and the fear had caused the shock which led to his injury. Mrs Justice Smith ruled last December that Mr McFarlane was a primary victim of the disaster because of his closeness to it. He had completed his shift aboard the platform and returned to his quarters on the Tharos, which was involved in the rescue operations. She held that Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) - now EE Caledonia - the owner and operator of Piper Alpha, had owed Mr McFarlane a 'duty of care' and was therefore liable. But Lord Justice Ralph Gibson, sitting with Lords Justices Stuart-Smith and McCowan, ruled she had erred.</p>

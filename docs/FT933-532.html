			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: Smashing Pumpkins - Pop Far below the Brixton Academy's cavernous black ceiling, beneath the shadowy Italianate mock-buildings that decorate its upper walls, 1,000, perhaps 2,000 young people crush together, often crash together, illuminated occasionally by harsh white lights from the stage. Bodies rise, feet first, from this churning sea and are passed from hand to hand before sinking again. From time to time the mass raise their arms and point as one towards the front of the stage on which stand three skinny individuals lit in lurid greens, reds, blues holding guitars. The noise is overpowering, a screaming, thudding, relentless assault not just on the ears but on the body. This is the Smashing Pumpkins emphatically affirming its status as one of the hottest alternative rock bands. It is a highly enjoyable experience. (Although it helps to have been put in the mood by security guards whose purpose in life is to stop passholders seeing the concert.) What lifts the band above most of its contemporaries is its ability to use the limited and increasingly hackneyed vocabulary of loud thrash guitar rock to express a distinctive musical personality. On Siamese Dream, the latest album, the Pumpkins vary the pace with moderately complex arrangements, acoustic guitar and even a dash of cello. Live, such signposts of subletly are abandoned for simple churn and kerrang. The effect is visceral. The fact that the speakers are so loud that every bass note feels like a punch in the stomach has something to do with it, but although other bands play as loud, few are as emotionally engaging. The assault is not unrelenting. The lull in the storm is one of leader Billy Corgan's favourite tricks. The wall of guitar noise from Corgan and James Iha abates, to expose the powerful skeleton of the Pumpkins' music: the edgy, sinuous, crunching rhythm of D'Arcy, the bass player, and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. The effect can be disconcerting. When 'Today' begins in relative calm, the audience chants the lyrics with Corgan, a sort of singalong-a-max-volume, before it builds to a roar that drowns even singing along in your head. Each song is distinctly sculpted from the noise and the brief abatement of noise. Each possesses its own crushing logic. But the ceaseless ebb and flow in the tidal wave of noise prevents the set as a whole building momentum. The effect is too controlled. It is a relief when the Pumpkins finish the set by smashing through 'Cherub Rock' in one unbroken surge. The encore is also reassuring. It is a shambles. Corgan emerges in a clown suit and after 'Spaceboy' - so laid back it even contains some bottleneck guitar from Iha - the control evaporates halfway through the next song which starts with a surge of adrenalin and dribbles to an end with Corgan hectoring the audience in enjoyable ego-crazed rock-star style. After a confusing final blast of parody power chords they are gone. The audience seems unsure whether to laugh or cheer and stands as if stunned until someone turns the house lights on.</p>

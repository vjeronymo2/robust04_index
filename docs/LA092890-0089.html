			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. REPORTEDLY PLEDGES TO DEFEND ISRAEL AGAINST IRAQ  </P> <P> The United States has assured Israel that if the Jewish state is attacked by  Iraq, the United States "will stand by its commitment to Israel's security" and  retaliate against Iraq even if that requires military force, U.S. and other  diplomatic sources said here Thursday.  </P> <P> The sources said the assurance was given by Secretary of State James A. Baker  III to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy at a meeting here late Wednesday.  The sources added that Baker acted to calm Israeli concern about threats made  by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last Sunday to strike at Israel and oil  installations in Saudi Arabia if Iraq suffers unduly from the economic embargo  imposed against it by the U.N. Security Council.  </P> <P> Levy did not specifically request the assurance, the sources said, but Baker  gave what one source called "a promise that the United States will stand by its  commitment to Israel's security" in an apparent bid to to head off a possible  Israeli attempt to take the issue to the Security Council. After Hussein  threatened Israel on Sunday, Levy raised the possibility of making a protest to  the council, a source said.  </P> <P> The sources said the United States would prefer that Israel maintain the low  profile it has kept since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and not disturb the  coalition of Arab states that the United States has put together in opposition  to Hussein. However, the sources said, Baker wanted to make clear that even if  the coalition with the Arabs is damaged by the United States' overtly aiding  Israel, the U.S. commitment remains unshakable.  </P> <P> The sources also pointed to statements made before Congress on Tuesday by John  Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, as a veiled  hint of the U.S. stance. They said Kelly did not make a specific pledge to come  to Israel's aid militarily but told members of Congress that the United States  would consider an attack against Israel as a very serious matter requiring  action.  </P> <P> The sources also said U.S. officials do not consider it likely that Hussein  would launch an attack against Israel exclusively, even if the Iraqi leader was  to try to marshal support in the Arab world capable of splitting the coalition  arrayed against him.  </P> <P> Instead, they said, such an attack probably would come as part of a decision by  Iraq to strike in several directions, possibly including Saudi Arabia, and  would almost certainly bring all-out war between Hussein and the multinational  force deployed in the Persian Gulf region.  </P> <P> In a separate interview Thursday, Levy said the United States has agreed to  explore with Israeli military experts whether a proposed sale of advanced U.S.  weapons to Saudi Arabia will erode Israel's qualitative military edge in the  Middle East and, if so, what must be done to restore it.  </P> <P> "I put forward (to Baker) a proposal to have experts from Israel come over and  have a close look at whether the qualitative edge is being maintained," said  Levy, here for the U.N. General Assembly's annual session. "I'm quite convinced  there was understanding of the logic and justice of this request. And I can  tell you it will be done."  </P> <P> Washington's plan for new arms sales to Saudi Arabia and U.S. desires for  Israel to keep a low profile have caused anxiety in Israel that it is losing  out as the main U.S. ally in the Middle East.  </P> <P> While Levy did not say so in the interview, other sources familiar with the  Wednesday meeting said it began on a chilly note with Baker complaining angrily  that Israel has not been helpful to the Administration's hopes of getting the  Saudi sale through Congress without problems.  </P> <P> Specifically, the sources said, Baker charged that Israeli Defense Minister  Moshe Arens, on a recent visit to Washington, left the impression he understood  how important the sale was for Administration policy. Then, Baker reportedly  said, Arens returned home and assailed the sale as a threat to Israeli  security.  </P> <P> The sources said Baker also complained that Levy, Arens and other Israeli  Cabinet officials were creating confusion by bombarding Washington with  differing lists of what they contend Israel needs as compensation for the Saudi  sale.  </P> <P> "This tremendous amount of armaments being offered to Saudi Arabia has raised  eyebrows about Saudi Arabia's capabilities and needs," Levy said. "Who can  guarantee with surety what might happen tomorrow with these arms. They are  disturbing questions. They need to be raised, and we raised them."  </P> <P> Levy also said he made clear to Baker Israel's feeling that it should be  forgiven its $4.5 billion military aid debt to the United States, if the  Administration forgives Egypt's $7.5 billion debt because it is contributing to  the forces arrayed in Saudi Arabia against Iraq.  </P> <P> "We are not envious of Egypt, but our situation is no less serious because of  the gulf crisis," he said. "Our security burdens have increased greatly. So we  feel that if the implications of the crisis on the economies of countries like  Egypt and Turkey warrant relief, the same should apply to Israel. One should  not ignore that."  </P> <P> Levy acknowledged that Washington's request for a low Israeli profile, made  within hours after Iraq's invasion, had caused "a malaise about U.S.-Israeli  relations" in his country.  </P> <P> "The low profile was pursued so vigorously by Washington that it was made to  seem Israel had vanished from the region," he said.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES, A6-A20  </P></p>

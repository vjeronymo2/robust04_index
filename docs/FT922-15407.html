			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock accused of CND cover-up THE LABOUR leadership was yesterday accused by the Conservatives of covering up the fact that at least 24 of its candidates had been members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. On the eve of a planned Tory attack on Labour defence policy, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, challenged Mr Neil Kinnock to disclose how many of his party's candidates were still CND members. Last night's Conservative party election broadcast portrayed the Labour party and Mr Kinnock in particular as being unsuitable to take charge of Britain's defences. The broadcast claimed that at least 100 Labour MPs in the last parliament were CND members. Mr Patten has written to Mr Kinnock insisting that the public has the right to know how many Labour candidates are CND members. He wrote: 'Your shameless cover-up of Labour's strong and continuing links with unilateral disarmers cannot be allowed to continue any more.' Documents released by Conservative Central Office along with yesterday's broadcast suggested that all references to CND membership planned for inclusion in Labour's official list of candidates had been removed. Only Mr Bruce Kent, the former chairman of CND who is standing in Oxford West and Abingdon, has his CND connections mentioned. Responding to the broadcast last night, Ms Marjorie Thomson, chair of CND, said: 'The Conservative party is more concerned with leading a McCarthyite witch hunt on the membership of CND than in addressing the real defence need of this country.' Mr Tom King, defence secretary, rounded on Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, who claimed earlier this month that his party had 'nothing whatever to do with CND'. Mr King said the attempt by the party leadership to cover up CND links was 'a manifest fraud'. Labour had 165 'anti-nuclear' MPs seeking re-election and another 85 candidates with the same views standing for the first time. Mr King said Labour was determined to ensure that defence did not become an issue. The constitution of CND included the unilateral, unconditional rejection of nuclear weapons, a stance which could not be squared with Labour's election manifesto.</p>

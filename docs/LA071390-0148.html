			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A LOOK AT INDIA'S BUMBLING BUREAUCRACY;  </P> <P> NOVEL: CIVIL SERVICE OFFICIAL'S FIRST BOOK DESCRIBES THE LETHARGY AND  INCOMPETENCE OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS IN INDIA AND HOW THE COUNTRY'S TOP STUDENTS  ARE LURED INTO THE BUREAUCRATIC MAZE BY THE PAY AND BENEFITS.  </P> <P> Upamanyu Chatterjee, acclaimed novelist and listless civil servant, spends his  working days in a sickly yellow room with pockmarked concrete walls, bamboo  matting and a merciful cooling fan lodged in a far window.  </P> <P> But at the moment, he is absent from his office. Chatterjee, like any Indian  bureaucrat of his rank and slothful ingenuity, can avoid purposeful work for  weeks on end. One method is simply to disappear for long stretches of the  heat-soaked day, safe in the assumption that no one else in the government will  notice.  </P> <P> The fat woman who shares Chatterjee's office, the one-armed peon who enters to  dump string-wrapped files into his "in" box, the limping maintenance worker who  hauls a dripping hose to fill the cooling fan with water -- none can say where  Chatterjee has disappeared to or when he may return. "After some time," they  say.  </P> <P> Thirty minutes pass in silence. Chatterjee's telephone rings. No one answers,  and the ringing ceases. It rings again. Still no one moves. And again. The  fifth time, the fat woman, a fellow civil servant, picks it up and shrieks.  "No, I am not Mr. Chatterjee, nor am I his PA!" (PA means secretary.) "Kindly  instruct Mr. Chatterjee to leave his PA in his room whenever he leaves his  room, in a very responsible manner! Do you understand that?!!" She slams down  the phone.  </P> <P> It is an hour before Chatterjee, a slim 30-year-old man with hooded eyes and a  remote air, slinks into the office and settles into the throne-like chair  behind his desk. He offers coffee to the fat woman, but she politely refuses.  Chatterjee scribbles a note and hands it unobtrusively to his visitor. "She's a  nut," it reads.  </P> <P> Upamanyu Chatterjee is in some ways the Jay McInerney of India -- a precocious,  sarcastic writer catapulted to renown by a first novel that captures in the  voice of its narrator the alienated bemusement of a young generation of  educated, urban Indians.  </P> <P> Like McInerney's "Bright Lights, Big City," which satirized the precious  pretensions of the New Yorker magazine, Chatterjee's "English, August"  bulldozed through a sacred temple of India's intellectual elite -- the Indian  civil service, last refuge of the Brahmans, babus and glorified clerks who have  governed the subcontinent since the days of the British Empire, and still the  country's most important and influential public institution.  </P> <P> An obvious difference is that while McInerney kissed and told after he left the  New Yorker, where his name presumably is now mud, Chatterjee still works in the  belly of the institution he satirized, currently as the Undersecretary for  Establishment and General Administration in the Department of Culture in the  Ministry of Human Resources of the Government of India.  </P> <P> It is difficult to explain why his career as an elite civil servant has not  been tarnished by a novel that describes many of his colleagues as overweight,  lazy, confused and arbitrary drones who show up for work at 11, take lunch at  noon, sleep until 4, then return to the office to sign a few papers and go home  to drink, eat and play cards.  </P> <P> But not only has Chatterjee escaped reprimand for his unflattering portrait of  India's civil service, he has received a sort of promotion. About a year after  the book was published in 1988, he was assigned to the Department of Culture,  where the bureaucratic powers figured a budding novelist should be posted --  even if Chatterjee's duties irrelevantly involve supervising the vacation  leaves and car loans and housing allowances of other bureaucrats in his  department.  </P> <P> "Some have read it, but not a lot," he says of his superiors' benign reaction  to his novel. "There hasn't yet been a totally unfavorable review, but there  have been some who felt the book was not fair in its entirety. Some others felt  it was far too filthy, far too bawdy. But on the whole, the reactions have been  favorable."  </P> <P> The reason lies partly in the elliptic and stunningly tolerant culture of India  -- Chatterjee calls it "the Hindu tradition" -- wherein dissent is not usually  quashed or rejected, but rather absorbed, or ignored, or talked about until it  becomes part of an ever-broadening consensus.  </P> <P> So it is that "English, August," far from generating a storm of controversy  within the Indian bureaucracy it describes, has been embraced as one of the  bureaucracy's achievements. And Chatterjee, instead of assuming the angry  stance of a writer exiled from the state, has settled rather nicely into his  public career, wandering the hallways of his vast ministry by day, as he puts  it, "finding out how many peons there are in the department and what they do,"  while scribbling a sarcastic sequel to his novel in his off hours.  </P> <P> He has decided, he says, to remain in the civil service for good. He expects to  be posted to Bombay next year, when he hopes his second novel will be  published. Here again is the literary condition in India: There is no  screenplay deal in the offing, despite the enthusiastic reviews of his novel in  India's English-language press and in Britain. There can be no tenure track  teaching creative writing to underclassmen; the system doesn't work that way.  </P> <P> The uncomfortable truth, which Chatterjee appears to accept, is that an  educated Brahman who has been fortunate enough to land at the top of the Indian  social and governmental hierarchy simply doesn't leave. Writing novels may be a  pastime, but the civil service is a lifetime.  </P> <P> Chatterjee has made the calculations already -- next year he will be  transferred to the finance ministry, or the income tax department, or some  other obscure corner of the Indian government's sprawling infrastructure. The  civil service will provide him with a two- or three-bedroom apartment in  Bombay's poshest waterfront neighborhood for just $18 a month in rent, and  probably a car and driver too. Then there is the lifetime job guarantee, and  the salary, and the immeasurable prestige of belonging to the civil service . .  .  </P> <P> "You come to that invisible quality. Maybe prestige is the wrong word, maybe  it's a class-oriented word. But I can't think of a better one. It does make a  difference if you tell people, even now, in a big city, if you tell them that  you are in the service. It's difficult to pinpoint, but it's there.  </P> <P> "I would like to write all the time, but I've found out that I can't.  Economically, because -- maybe the next book will get a bigger advance, but for  this I didn't get much. And personally, because I can't write so much every  day." He once considered abandoning the civil service, but now "there's no  question of copping out.  </P> <P> "I feel completely at home in the absurdities of India, " he says. "I like it  here. . . . It's a soft life."  </P> <P> "English, August" tells the semiautobiographical story of Agastya Sen, a  talented if unenthusiastic university student who, like an estimated 100,000  college graduates in India each year, takes the national civil service  examination in the hope of securing one of 150 annual openings in the Indian  Administrative Service, or IAS, successor to the vast public bureaucracy  established by the British more than a century ago. Sen, who has spent all of  his life in the partially Westernized, urban isolation of Calcutta and Delhi,  wins one of the coveted spots and finds himself on a slow train to Madna, a  tiny outpost in the backward countryside, where he is to be trained in the art  of Indian public service.  </P> <P> In Madna he finds "a small tube-lit station, stray dogs, a few coolies, a man  selling rusks and tea, a family of beggars arguing in an unfamiliar tongue . .  . cattle and clanging rickshaws on the road, and the rich sound of trucks in  slush from an overflowing drain; he felt as though he was living someone else's  life."  </P> <P> He unpacks his bags in a one-room government guest house infested by mosquitoes  and a noisy frog, attended by a poisonous cook and engulfed by airborne  diseases. For the next nine months, Sen smokes a great deal of marijuana,  masturbates joylessly and frequently, mooches liquor from a local political  cartoonist, lies shamelessly about his past and manages to avoid learning  anything useful about the practices of government and economic development in  India, other than that the country appears ungovernable and that the  bureaucracy seems largely purposeless.  </P> <P> The novel is not exactly fast-paced, but its lethargy mirrors the rhythms of  rural India, and Chatterjee's narrative voice -- brittle, scathing, juvenile,  hilarious -- cuts through the fog around him like a cold wind.  </P> <P> "He seemed to interrupt the second of the six (or so) tea breaks of the day.  Life was a leisurely affair in Madna. Various aging fat men in the room, the  denizens of the collectorate, shuffled at seeing him and sat down demurely. . .  . Agastya felt happy to see such placid faces. He sat beside the supply  officer, who smelt like a scented eraser out of a geometry box."  </P> <P> Chatterjee says most of the letters he gets these days are from fellow members  of the service who write in amiable tones that he has captured exactly their  own experiences of serving in the Indian nether regions, where they felt  utterly at sea in the great mass of poverty, illiteracy, filth and heat, which  it was their job to manage and improve upon.  </P> <P> What does it say about India that a story of drift, purposelessness, alienation  and lethargy in the omnipresent government is welcomed as a portrait of  unchangeable truth?  </P> <P> Chatterjee himself isn't sure. He does not work for the government because he  thinks he can change India or make it a better place, he says. He joined the  civil service because everybody else he knew wanted to, because at Delhi  University, "It's really like breathing: You take the exam."  </P> <P> Like many English-speaking Indian intellectuals, and like Sen in his novel,  Chatterjee lives somewhat uncomfortably between the inexorable pull of India  and the enticements of the West. Chatterjee bristles when he talks about  expatriate Indian writers whose work he partially admires -- Salman Rushdie,  V.S. Naipaul -- because he thinks they don't belong to India at all; the India  that they write about is an India of memory, not of experience.  </P> <P> Yet Chatterjee, who has never left his native country, and who works near the  heart of Indian society, feels like an outsider himself. The countryside where  most Indians live remains alien -- it's a place, as Sen observes in the novel,  "where floods and caste wars occurred, where entire families were murdered,  where some prime minister took his helicopter just after a calamity, or just  before the elections . . . a dot in this hinterland."  </P> <P> These days Chatterjee is serious about a French woman whom he met in Delhi, and  he is thinking about marrying her. This summer, he will travel to Britain to  attend a writers seminar at Cambridge University. He wonders what he will think  of Europe when he finally sees it.  </P> <P> "I've never felt this urge to actually settle abroad or go abroad," he says. "I  was told by this chap I know who's been to Yale -- he said it's a helluva shock  if you come back. Then it's even madder."  </P> <P> Chatterjee is back where he feels more or less at home: at his desk in the  sickly yellow room. A problem has come before him, one of the half-scams of  ordinary bureaucratic life, and Chatterjee is deeply amused. His tight and  somewhat eerie smile seems to be suppressing boisterous laughter.  </P> <P> An overweight civil servant with oiled hair and a stunning repertoire of  meaningless facts about world geography has come to Chatterjee's office seeking  money. Each year, it seems, the Undersecretary for Establishment and General  Administration of the Department of Culture in the Ministry of Human Resources  of the Government of India -- for the time being, that's Chatterjee -- is  granted 150,000 rupees ($8,500) to dole out to fellow civil servants for  automobile loans. This year, in one of the perquisites of the job, Chatterjee  has reserved 52,000 rupees for himself to buy a new car. Three other  bureaucrats, including the geography expert before him, have submitted  applications for the rest.  </P> <P> "He has come here to lobby," Chatterjee explains giddily, as if the supplicant  were not even in the room. "He thinks he should get the full amount."  </P> <P> The man hunches in his chair, evidently offended, but not so much so that he  will let pass this opportunity to lobby. "It is not a question of lobbying. I  know my  </P> <P> position," he tells Chatterjee. His rival applicant, the man goes on, "will be  going in for a car of maybe 20,000 or 30,000 rupees. My car is going to cost me  110,000 rupees. I need the full amount."  </P> <P> Chatterjee leans back, still suppressing laughter. They pay him well to gather  material for his novels. He plays the scene to the end. He hems, he haws, he  waffles. The other applicants will be offended if he gives the full amount to  one person. What can he do?  </P> <P> The man shifts uncomfortably, tries another approach, retreats, then finally  asks Chatterjee to write an innocuous letter to his superior recording their  conversation. Chatterjee agrees, then schedules another meeting. The drama will  go on for months, slowly, purposelessly, to the music of whirring office fans.  </P> <P> "Whether to give it to him or divide it among the three is something I could  decide on my own, but I won't," Chatterjee explains later. "It's bound to  create a lot of unpleasantness if I make the decision. So I will mark it up to  the deputy secretary and let him decide. I think he will mark it up to the  joint secretary. . . . There's no end to it."  </P> <P> And where is the satisfaction, as opposed to the amusement, in all of this?  Chatterjee talks about the variety of his work, the shifting from topic to  topic and from post to post, the perks, the security. Sen, the protagonist of  "English, August," finds the same regimen disgusting, even horrifying. But  Chatterjee, well, he has grown into the job. He wrote his novel when the  service was new and strange. Now he has been at least partially absorbed by it.  </P> <P> "Sen's viewpoint has really wrongly been taken as mine. It's really the  viewpoint of the outsider."  </P> <P> An experienced civil servant wrote Chatterjee recently and told him that he  could only have written "English, August" when he did, because if he had waited  another three years -- say, until 1991 -- he would have become just like the  overweight men who sit around Madna playing cards, drinking whiskey, swatting  mosquitoes and managing the affairs of India without much effectiveness.  </P> <P> Chatterjee smiles as he describes the letter. "It's not a very nice thing to  say about me," he says. "But I thought he was making a very valid point."  </P></p>

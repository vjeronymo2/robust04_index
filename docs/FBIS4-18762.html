			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, April 8 (A.A.) -- Turkey's ambassador to  Germany Onur Oymen had a talk today with German Federal Foreign  Ministry State Secretary Dieter Kastrup, on the suspension of  German arms supply to Turkey.    After the meeting, Oymen told the Anatolian Agency, "we  asked  from Germany to resolve the matter at the soonest, through  diplomatic means."    During their talk the German side told Oymen that they have  received reports on Turkey's violation of the Turkish-German  agreement and that Turkey was using German arms it received  within the NATO, for domestic security reasons.    They added that Germany has suspended arms supply to Turkey  until their investigation on the matter is concluded.    Oymen told German officials that Turkey has not violated any  agreement it signed so far and that these claims were fabricated  by circles supporting the illegal terror organization.    "Friendly and allied countries should trust each other,"  Oymen said.    "The claims have no basis. We expect Germany to resolve the  matter at the soonest, through diplomatic channels," he said.</p>

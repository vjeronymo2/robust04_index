			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal </F> Democratic Party, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place  and date not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Diet deliberations on the budget  for fiscal 1994 have been delayed significantly. How are you  going to deal with this?    [Kono] It is important for us to promote budget  deliberations. In the past, an administration was always to  blame for a delay in budget deliberations. This time, however,  I want the government and the ruling parties to show a sincere  attitude to the promotion of deliberations. I want to push  deliberations as much as possible during the 38-day period from  the start of the Budget Committee session on 23 May until the  end of Diet session.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will your party submit a no-confidence  motion against the cabinet?    [Kono] I think we will because this administration does not  represent the people's will at all and it holds only 40 percent  of the total seats in the House of Representatives. But, since  there are several opposition parties, I don't know whether it  would be good for us to act alone, though there is no doubt that  we will submit the no-confidence motion.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When would be the right time to submit the  motion?    [Kono] It is necessary to pass the budget because it is  related to people's livelihood. Therefore, we must promote  budget deliberations. But whether or not we will submit the  motion right after the budget is approved is a different issue  altogether.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] would win a general election if it was held now?    [Kono] I think we would definitely win. We are always ready  to contest an election. But we want to hold it under the  single-seat electoral district system, if possible.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Which electoral system--the single-seat or  the multiseat system--would give the LDP an advantage over other  parties?    [Kono] The single-seat electoral system would give us the  greatest advantage.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is expected that if your party submits a  no-confidence motion after the bill for redistricting electoral  constituencies has been submitted to the Diet, the ruling  parties as well as some LDP members will criticize the party,  saying it is attempting to "kill political reform."    [Kono] The LDP has never said we would force the government  to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general  election. We only said we cannot trust this cabinet. The  redistricting bill can be submitted even after the cabinet has  changed. I rather think some people will start asking if we  should allow a minority ruling cabinet to redraw the electoral  districts.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the LDP's relationship  with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]?    [Kono] Although the LDP is the No. 1 opposition party, we do  not have a majority. It is natural that the LDP will cooperate  with several parties if we want to have decisive power. Since  the LDP and the SDPJ are the major opposition parties, we want  to cooperate with SDPJ, whenever possible, on Diet matters that  could result in the overthrow of the current administration.  But this is possible only if both parties share the same  perception of the current political situation.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] But there is a large gap between the  policies of the two parties. Will it become an obstacle to  cooperation?    [Kono] It could become an obstacle. We need further  discussions within the party as to whether we should start  policy consultations with the SDPJ immediately.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How about the LDP's relationship with  Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger Party]?    [Kono] I think that psychologically, the SDPJ and Sakigake  have something in common. But as far as policies are concerned,  there are more similarities between Sakigake and the LDP. Since  Sakigake is saying it will "not join the cabinet but support the  coalition until the budget is approved," we may not share with  Sakigake as many views as we do with the SDPJ in dealing with  Diet matters during budget deliberations.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Sakigake could be a partner in  coordinating policies?    [Kono] I think so.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Since you have been giving priority to the  issue of avoiding another split within the party, there is a  criticism both inside and outside the LDP that you have failed  to drastically reform the party.    [Kono] I think there is a big difference between the current  LDP and the old LDP, which had Mr. Ichiro Ozawa (Shinseito  secretary general) and other people as its members. Mr. Ozawa  used to shut himself up in the office of secretary general with  people who are now Shinseito members. My LDP is entirely  different. Mr. Michio Watanabe once said we needed a "reform  tantamount to forming the party." I think he is right. But I  also think we have done a good job in revising the seniority  system, in which certain favors were given to party members  depending on how many terms they served in the Diet and which  factions they belonged to. Though I would not say the revision  was done perfectly.</p>

Mr.  Abdur Rahim Mandokhel, who was the first speaker today, proposed  reforms in the Constitution to give it true federal,  parliamentary, and democratic orientation. He said the affairs  of the government should be conducted through mutual  accommodation and understanding between the government and the  opposition on the one hand, and the center and the provinces on  the other. The debate is still continuing.    Responding to a point of order, the minister for law and  parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider, reiterated the  government's determination not to indulge in any sort of  victimization of its political opponents. The point of order  was raised by Ejazul Islam Jatoi in the Senate this morning, who  complained that political opponents were being victimized in  Sindh. Syed Iqbal Haider, however, made it clear that the law  will take its own course against criminals, terrorists, and  plunderers of the people's money.</p>

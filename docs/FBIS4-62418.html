The meeting was attended by Kent Brown, the U.S.  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Georgia,  Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze; Valeriy  Vashakidze, the chairman of the committee for Refugees and  Displaced People, and other officials.    I am happy to get yet another opportunity to demonstrate  support for Georgian democracy and the progressive course taken  by the Georgian Government, said James Franklin Collins. The  guest regarded as useful the discussion he had had with the  Georgian head of state over current difficulties in Georgia,  basically on the issue of retaining the territorial integrity of  Georgia. We have repeatedly expressed our political support  over this issue, he said.    Members of the U.S. State Department delegation have  emphasized that the Abkhazian issue is a very difficult  political and humanitarian issue. Therefore, the United States  has not and will not spare efforts to draw the attention of the  world community to democratic processes under way in Georgia.  We can assure you that the United States has a significant  interest in a democratic Georgia, they said.    The head of state expressed special gratitude for the visit  of the U.S. delegation and emphasized the importance of meetings  held in various ministries, departments, and organizations. He  said, in particular, that this was the implementation of  agreements on bilateral cooperation signed in Washington. Each  step from your side is of a vital importance for Georgia, said  the head of state in conclusion.</p>

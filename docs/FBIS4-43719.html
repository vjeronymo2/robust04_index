			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Safe Seats"] </F>   [Excerpt] The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is  looking after its ladies. Uta Wuerfel, top candidate who failed  in the European elections, is going to Brussels, even without a  mandate. She will become head of the FDP liaison office with the  European Union Commission and the European Parliament. This  should take care of her worries that she might have to stay at  home and do nothing.    Ursula Seiler-Albring, state minister (parliamentary state  secretary) in FDP Chairman Kinkel's Foreign Ministry, will be  given a post as ambassador, probably in Vienna. [passage  omitted]</p>

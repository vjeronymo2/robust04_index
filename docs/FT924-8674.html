			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Flotsam, jetsam and Ravel - Concert At the Barbican on Sunday, Kent Nagano conducted the London Symphony in a curious programme. The first half was a showcase for John Williams' guitar, which guaranteed a full house but required little more than tactful accompaniment; in the second we got Ravel's complete Daphnis et Chloe, which is both an audience-puller and a serious test for a conductor. In Rodrigo's evergreen Concierto de Aranjuez, featherweight but elegant, Nagano missed nothing, and Williams - whom I have not heard in several years, since he moved home to Australia - not only proved that his formidable technique is still secure, but found new expressive depths and shadows in his cadenzas. So far, so admirable. Unfortunately he chose to follow the Concierto with a UK premiere, the 'Antarctica' Suite by Nigel Westlake, a colleague from his new ensemble ATTACCA. It is adapted from Westlake's score for a monster-screen movie - where for all I know, the composer's catch-as-catch-can invention may work perfectly. As re-composed for virtuoso guitar with small orchestra, however, it cut no ice to speak of: bits of ad lib solo virtuosity were pinned on to swatches of pictorial colour and that was that. No direction, no point, nothing but random effects; one would go to some trouble to avoid hearing it again. Nagano's account of Ravel's Daphnis sounded like a promising first shot. On the minus side, there were unresolved problems of balance: the nine-strong percussion section and the brass often covered vital thematic stuff from the strings, and in turn they were themselves sometimes blotted out by the LSO Chorus - far too numerous for their collective role here. Those wordless voices should be one strand in the texture, not pugnacious competition; and besides, in their testing a cappella interlude they came uncomfortably close to losing their grip on pitch. On the plus side, however, Nagano preserved the crucial balletic pulse better than most conductors. The score lived and breathed. For Chloe's heartbroken dance in piratical captivity, he found pathetic accents of speaking force - more exposed than in any account I remember, but utterly true to Ravel's intentions. In the last, 'wild' - though rigorously controlled - Danse generale, Nagano took note of something that all programme-notes are too polite to mention: that the ancient Greek Daphnis tale was expressly about sexual innocence and subsequent happy discovery. Even Diaghilev preferred to leave that decently obscure; but Ravel spelt it out in the near-orgasmic cries of his final chorus, coming quicker and more urgent as the tempo contracts from 5/4 time to 3/4 and then to 2/4, with a gross full-orchestra trill on the last chord. Nagano gave all that full value, and quite right too.</p>

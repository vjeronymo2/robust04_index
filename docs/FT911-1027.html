			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Christian democrat guilty of tax evasion A long-running court case into illegal financing of German political parties came to an end yesterday when Mr Walther Leisler Kiep, treasurer of the Christian Democratic Union, was fined DM675,000 (Pounds 228,000) on tax evasion charges, reports David Marsh from Bonn. Mr Kiep was found guilty in the Dusseldorf district court of depriving the state of DM7.4m in tax revenues by operating a fraudulent money-gathering scheme for channelling donations from big German companies. The system, under which companies were able to transfer untaxed funds to the CDU through a Cologne-based foundation, was in place between 1971 and 1981.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Leave job creation and growth in Europe to the entrepreneurs Sir, With so many 'action plans' for European economic growth now on the table, permit me to offer my own. The three-step 'Meyer plan' is easy to organise, simple to administer and guaranteed to succeed Step one: organise a conference and invite every unelected official who has proposed a growth plan or thrown his weight behind such a plan. Step Two: Shoot them all. Step Three: Repeat steps one and two as often as necessary to allow Europe's entrepreneurs the freedom they need to create jobs. Seriously, what is with you people? The wealth of Europe's great civilisations was not created by bureaucrats armed with grandiose and expensive growth plans. It was created by ambitious, clever, hard-working people who had the grit and the guts to turn ideas and dreams into marketable products and services, thus creating industries and millions of jobs. Europe continues to produce such men - and women  - in abundance. Indeed, I meet them all the time. Unfortunately for Europe, I meet them in California or elsewhere in the US where they have settled to work in a country that - despite its current leadership - continues to provide a better political environment in which to achieve commercial success than is available anywhere else in the industrialised world. For heaven's sake, we are at the end of the 20th century and we know the proper role for government in creating economic growth: it is to establish ground rules, to ensure these rules are obeyed, and otherwise to get the hell out of the way while entrepreneurs make growth happen. This works all the time; nothing else has ever worked. Why not give this approach a try? More accurately, why not try this approach again, since the last time Europe let its entrepreneurs run free they made it the world's most powerful civilisation, as well as its richest in terms of both material wealth and culture? Isn't this what you want? Or is all this talk of growth merely a cover story, designed to persuade people that something is being done while the real goal - feathering the bureaucrats' nests - continues unabated?

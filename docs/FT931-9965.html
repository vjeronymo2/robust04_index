			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt to set up banana row panel LATIN AMERICAN banana producers yesterday stepped up their fight against the European Community's present and future banana import policies within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The body's governing council agreed to set up an independent disputes panel to examine whether the existing restraints on imports of 'dollar' bananas operated by five EC member states breach international trade rules. The panel will report by the beginning of May, under expedited procedures following the breakdown of talks under the 'good offices' of Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director-general. Meanwhile, the five banana producers involved - Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela - have served notice that they will mount a challenge in Gatt against proposals for an EC-wide banana import regime, which are due to come into force on July 1. They claim the measures will cost them Dollars 1bn in lost export earnings over the next two years. The proposals, approved by EC ministers last December but still to be confirmed, would impose a prohibitive tariff on imports of dollar bananas beyond a 2m tonne quota while allowing unrestricted duty-free imports from higher-cost Caribbean suppliers with EC treaty ties. Latin American banana exports to the EC have expanded rapidly to about 2.6m tonnes in 1992. By the time the report of the panel set up yesterday has been adopted by the Gatt council the new Community rules may have already superseded the patchwork of restrictions now operated by Britain, France, Spain, Portugal and Greece. But the Latin American producers believe that a May panel verdict in their favour would help clear a legal pathway for a similar verdict later on the new measures. These, they allege, violate existing Gatt obligations, run counter to draft rules on farm trade under negotiation in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, and threaten them with economic devastation.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Building chief condemns Lamont's 'lack of action' CONSTRUCTION leaders yesterday condemned the government for failing to help the recession-wracked industry. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said he had tried to explain the severity of the recession to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, but that 'so far there has been no real response in terms of government action'. Sir Brian also highlighted job losses in the industry. He said jobs had been shed at the rate of 580 for each working day for three years. He added that 400,000 jobs had been lost during the past three years. A further 50,000 jobs were like to disappear between June and the end of this year, taking the total to more than 450,000. Sir Brian joined civil engineers, architects and surveyors in London to launch a 'battle bus' to travel to the Conservative conference. Industry leaders will beg ministers not to cut money for construction in the autumn public-spending round. They also want a cut in interest rates and measures to help the housing market such as higher thresholds for mortgage tax relief and the scrapping of stamp duty. 'We look to the chancellor's Autumn Statement to sustain public investment in vital capital building programmes,' said Sir Brian. 'Instead, we read increasingly of the threat of cuts to our capital spending programmes. So we are now intensifying our lobbying efforts.' A survey published yesterday by the confederation shows a further deterioration in building industry workloads and will increase pressure on the government. It shows that confidence over future workloads has slipped even further, with an increasing number of firms planning to shed workers in the next few months. A fifth of companies questioned were working at less than half capacity. The number of new inquiries for work was at its lowest level since last year. The survey was conducted in September among 600 of the confederation's 7,000 member companies. Ucatt, the construction union, warned yesterday that the number of jobs lost in the industry might rise to 500,000 if the government cut its Pounds 2bn housing budget.</p>

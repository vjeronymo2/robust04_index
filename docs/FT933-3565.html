			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: Signs point to extended advance AFTER another fall in long-dated gilt yields and soothing words from the UK chancellor about public borrowing, bond investors see little on the horizon to interrupt the upward movement in prices of the past few months. The drop of about 10 basis points in yields of 20-year gilts during the week brings the fall in the past month to roughly 70 basis points. In the year since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism, yields for this class of gilts have dropped by more than 2 percentage points, underlining expectations that inflationary pressures will remain muted for some time. Investors were cheered last week by comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that he was prepared for tough action in his Budget on November 30 to curb the growing gap between state spending and borrowing. Although such remarks have become obligatory for any chancellor, Mr Clarke has expressed himself with enough force to persuade many gilt practitioners that he means what he says. With a raft of government data this week - notably Wednesday's retail price index for August - about the UK economy, and an expected announcement by the Bank of England that a gilt auction of about Pounds 3bn will be held at the end of the month, trading over the next few days can be expected to pick up. In the short term, funding will provide few worries for the market, given that as the Bank has already sold about Pounds 30bn of the Pounds 45bn or so of gilts which it will probably have to despatch during this financial year. So the Bank probably sees no need to accelerate its programme of gilt sales, mainly through monthly auctions. However, expectations that the Bank will sell internationally important 10-year stock at this month's auction slowed foreign demand for this type of gilt during the past week, one factor for yields being little changed in this section of the gilt curve. Later in the 1990s, the volume of gilts needed to fund the high projected borrowing requirements may force up yields. That explains the interest in the various strategies for pulling back the state deficit, which according to the Treasury's last forecasts in March will drop only marginally to Pounds 44bn in 1994-95 from Pounds 50bn this financial year. Many private-sector economists, including some of the Treasury's outside advisers, believe significant cuts in public spending may be needed, alongside the Pounds 16bn of tax increases already scheduled for the next two years. The consensus among economists is that it would be difficult to make substantial inroads into the planned spending of Pounds 254bn in the next financial year. However later in the 1990s parts of the Pounds 70bn-a-year social security budget could be cut, especially in areas such as child benefit. Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, one of the 'seven wise men' who advise the Treasury on economic issues, favours an urgent programme of public spending cuts from 1995-96. Both Prof Minford and Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the Confederation of British Industry and another 'wise man', see no need for Mr Clarke to announce more tax increases for next April. This is on the grounds that the expected recovery will automatically push up tax revenues. However, Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School and another Treasury adviser, believes the underlying deficit is so big that a further increase in taxes of up to Pounds 4bn may be needed from 1994-95.</p>

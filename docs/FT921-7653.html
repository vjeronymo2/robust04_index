			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Headline doubled to Pounds 1.3m IN ITS first year as a public company Headline Book Publishing saw pre-tax profit double to Pounds 1.3m. The result compared with Pounds 637,000 for 1990, and was boosted by a swing from net interest payable to net interest receivable after the flotation last April. At December 31 cash stood at Pounds 1.3m. Earnings per share rose to 9p (6.9p) and the final dividend is 2.5p for a total of 3p. Sales were up 35 per cent to Pounds 11.3m and operating profit rose 45 per cent to Pounds 1.32m. The margin increased from 10.9 per cent to 11.8 per cent principally because overheads were cut to 32.9 per cent of sales. Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, managing director, said the substantial sales growth was achieved by the policy of increasing investment in publishing lists. Backlist sales of books published in previous years rose 30 per cent, and continued to build one of the most important elements in the group's longer-term strategy.</p>

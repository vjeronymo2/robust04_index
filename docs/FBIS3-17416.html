			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir </F> Shumeyko by POSTFACTUM's Lyudmila Sherova under "In the  Federation Council" rubric; place and date not given: "Vladimir  Shumeyko: Enough of Shaking the Power"]    [Text] [Sherova] Vladimir Filippovich, much is being said  now to the effect that the next treaty to be concluded after the  treaty on the delimitation of powers between the federal organs  of power and Tatarstan will be a treaty with Kaliningrad Oblast.  From whom has this initiative come?    [Shumeyko] The initiative of concluding a treaty between  Kaliningrad Oblast Administration and the federal government has  come from the Security Council. It should be pointed out that  the Potsdam Agreement remains in force in perpetuity. But  certain politicians are using its 50th anniversary to raise the  question of the oblast's status; they are starting to say in  this connection that the Potsdam Agreements are expiring  inasmuch as the Soviet Union does not exist, Stalin does not  exist, and Russia is not the Union's legal successor in this  sphere; and they propose to raise the question of Kaliningrad  Oblast's once again becoming a protectorate of Germany or being  regarded as a separate state. Along with this there is also talk  of the need for a demilitarized zone on the territory of  Kaliningrad Oblast, of the fact that the presence of troops  hinders economic development, and so on. Therefore the Security  Council has decided to sign this treaty.    [Sherova] What is it proposed to enshrine in the treaty?  What changes will there be in relations?    [Shumeyko] As we know, the local government can delegate to  the federal government as many rights and powers as the federal  government can transfer to the local government. Thus, the  Security Council reached the conclusion that as many rights as  possible must be transferred today to the government of  Kaliningrad Oblast, so that the local authorities can react  promptly and clearly to any manifestations. For Russia, a quick  and appropriate response relating to what is going on in that  region is very important.    Therefore we will prepare this treaty very thoroughly. We  will weigh up what to transfer and what to take on at the  federal level.    [Sherova] The treaty with Tatarstan elicited contradictory  comments. How valid are the fears of those who believe that  such treaties shake Russia's unity?    [Shumeyko] On the contrary, this strengthens the  Federation's unity. Tatarstan is right in the middle of the  Russian Federation and does not have external borders. Many  people say that it is written in the treaty with Tatarstan that  Tatarstan is a subject of international law -- which will enable  it to secede from the Russian Federation. Secede to where?  Either upward or underground?    Moreover, the signing of the treaty with Tatarstan led to  elections being held there in March. We in the Federation  Council have acquired two more members. By entering the  Federation Council, resolving federal problems, and  participating in the life of the Federation, Tatarstan is  becoming still more involved in all-Russia problems. I would  only welcome this treaty.    [Sherova] It will soon be three months since the Federation  Council started its work. How satisfied are you with this work?    [Shumeyko] I am satisfied, although many people say: Look,  so much time has passed, and not one law has been adopted. It  is not a matter today of the number of legislative acts that the  Federal Assembly must adopt. It is a matter of quality. We  must all be aware of one truth: If we regard the question of  the development of the Russian state as being of paramount  importance, then we must be very attentive toward the  legislative base today. On no account must this legislative base  bear a trace of political struggle. I will cite the following  example: The chairman of the Federation Council Committee for  Agrarian Questions is a member of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Just a few months  ago it would have been unthinkable for a leader of the Communist  Party to be a committe chairman in a country carrying out  democratic transformations.    The standing orders are very important for any parliament.  For deputies, standing orders are the paramount law after the  Constitution. We adopted the standing orders in half a day. I  must say that the last Supreme Soviet never adopted standing  orders but worked with temporary standing orders, because, if  the democrats' faction proposed something, the communists  rejected it, and if the communists proposed something, the  democrats rejected it without considering the substance of the  proposals.    [Sherova] What are relations like between the Federation  Council and the State Duma?    [Shumeyko] Normal. Russia is so tired of political troubles  and so tired of a confrontation that is of no use to anyone that  we must simply display concerted work. We must now adopt the  budget and tax legislation as quickly and correctly as possible.    [Sherova] Do you believe that the strategy enshrined in the  president's message and the premier's report is capable of  rallying the main political forces to resolve the set tasks?    [Shumeyko] I believe it is. Because both the Duma and we  ourselves have responded identically: to discuss in committees,  to place on the session agenda, and to coordinate the  president's message with the plan of legislative work. If we  really link the president's message with the plan of legislative  work and adopt legislation in development of the president's  message, then one way or another it will become the rails along  which everything will travel.    [Sherova] Many deputies believe that the message says a  great deal about what must be done but does not say how to do it.    [Shumeyko] Are we to require everything at once of the head  of state: an interpretation both of what is to be done and how  to do it? This resembles what things were like in old Rus: The  nobleman will come along and settle everything. In the modern  world it is impossible to pile all the work onto one person,  even if all the analysts work for him. What are the deputies  for, then? What are the government, the court, the prosecutor's  office, and all the rest for?    The head of state delivered a message which set forth -- in  my view, for the first time in the whole history of perestroyka  -- a clear program, and you get the feeling that these are the  words of a head of state who has acknowledged a number of  mistakes, named all the sensitive points, and indicated what  work needs to be done.    I myself am a production worker. In production there are  always two camps which argue and fight each other. There is the  chief designer and the chief technologist. The designer answers  the question: What is to be done? The technologist answers the  question: How is it to be done? The truth is born of this  dispute.    The head of state is the designer and is responsible for the  question of what is to be done in the state today. The  technologists are all the rest: the legislators, the  government, the prosecutor's office, the court, etc. It is they  who must answer the question of how it is to be done.    [Sherova] Do you not think that the emergence of more and  more new parties will lead to chaos in political life?    [Shumeyko] More than 100 parties are now registered at the  Ministry of Justice. But nothing has come of this. The people  live as they lived before. Politicians like to show that they  influence what the masses do. In fact they have almost no  influence. This can be both good and bad.    [Sherova] But are parties created as a tool to seize power?    [Shumeyko] If a politician does not think of seizing power,  he is simply not a politician. But an interesting situation, in  my view, has taken shape in Russia today. The question of  seizing power has become secondary and disappeared from the  agenda. This is something that politicians will never  understand. The question of strengthening power stands in first  place. All the powers that exist will be strengthened when the  Russian state is strong.    Today it is customary to personify power, which is why  people  associate presidential power with Yeltsin. I respect him, but  some people do not like him. Those who do not like him say that  presidential power is bad because Yeltsin stands up there.  They, these politicians, must understand that if they do not  find within themselves today the strength to reinforce this same  presidential power and only then fight to become president, then  nothing good will happen in Russia. But they are now shaking  this power which they subsequently want to seize. Enough of  shaking it, it is time to strengthen it.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Baxter International forms Moscow venture BAXTER International, the US hospital equipment group, is to form a 75 per cent-owned manufacturing venture in Russia to produce surgical instruments at a Moscow plant that once produced defence missile guidance systems. The move represents Baxter's first entry into manufacturing in Russia, Reuter reports from Deerfield. NIIAP, a Russian manufacturing enterprise, will own the remaining 25 per cent of the venture, which was established with the assistance of the Russian Ministry of Health and the Department of General Machine Building. Baxter said production at the plant will begin in June 1993 with full production expected in 1994. Its statement provided no volume expectations, but did say 200 would be employed. Baxter said: 'If we are successful in this venture we may explore bringing other technologies - including blood products, intravenous solutions and renal therapy - to Russia.' The venture would manufacture hand-held surgical instruments such as vascular clamps, scissors and needle holders with support from Baxter's V. Mueller division, it added. The company said Russian producers are able to supply only about 30 per cent of current demand for such products.</p>

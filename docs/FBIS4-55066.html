			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 9 (AFP) -- UN forces in the Bosnian  capital have failed to locate a Bosnian Serb tank secreted in a  Sarajevo suburb since late Friday, UN Protection Force spokesman  Eric Chaperon said here Monday. UN military observers continued  to patrol the Grbavica sector, and if the tank was found  UNPROFOR would go and fetch it, Major Chaperon said. Another UN  officer noted the Serbs were letting very few military observers  into the area.    The tank, probably a T-34, disappeared late on Friday while  being transported on a truck from Bosnian Serb headquarters at  Pale in violation of the 20-ki1ometre (12.5-mile) exclusion zone  ordered by NATO to bar heavy weaponry around Sarajevo. Chaperon  reported rising tension at Mostar in the south, and some mortar  fire at Celic and Visoko in the north-east. He said several  dozen armed Serb militiamen were still in position on the right  bank of the river Drina in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, in  defiance of an exclusion zone order.</p>

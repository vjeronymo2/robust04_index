			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greek growers set for record cotton and tobacco harvests GREEK COTTON and tobacco production are forecast to reach record levels this year after farmers in the north of the country switched crops because of a winter drought. The cotton crop is expected to reach 875,000 tonnes, a 30 per cent rise from 675,000 tonnes last year. More than 350,000 hectares were planted with cotton this year, compared with about 230,000 in 1991. 'The winter wheat crop this year in Thrace was poor because of reduced rainfall, so a much bigger acreage than usual went to cotton,' said a Cotton Board official. Northern farmers, who grow most of the field crops produced in Greece, are now more prepared to switch away from cereals. Their incomes have declined sharply following reduced harvests resulting from severe drought in three out of the past four years. Greek cotton production doubled over the past decade, thanks to improved methods of irrigation and extensive mechanisation. But the crop has remained at about 650,000 tonnes annually for several years as demand from the local textile industry tapered off. This year's tobacco crop is forecast at 173,000 tonnes, an 8 per cent increase from 160,000 tonnes in 1991. The area planted rose from 84,000 to 95,000 ha, according to the Tobacco Board. For the first time, production of the Oriental tobacco varieties traditionally grown in Greece is expected to show a slight decline this year. More farmers are growing the Virginia and Burley varieties, which sell more quickly on the local market. Production of Virginia tobacco is expected to rise this year by 50 per cent to 60,000 tonnes. Production of Burley is likely to reach 15,000 tonnes compared with 9,000 tonnes last year. The government has been encouraging the move away from Oriental varieties by providing incentives for farmers to build facilities to dry and store Virginia tobacco. Cotton and tobacco are among Greece's highest-earning agricultural exports. Cotton exports amount to Dollars 110m in an average year, while tobacco exports are worth more than Dollars 140m a year.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Henry Ford Henry Ford (1863-1947) is routinely lauded as the man who brought the world mass production lines. His idiosyncratic career (from boy racer to multi-millionaire anti-war campaigner), as well as his many barbed observations, tend to be forgotten. There was, however, more to Ford than flow lines, workers doing mindlessly repetitive tasks and the ubiquitous Model T. Marketing guru Ted Levitt has argued that Ford's genius actually lay in marketing, not manufacturing. Ford first decided that the world was ready for an affordable car; and then that mass-production techniques were the only way of providing it. Instead of controlling costs to produce lower prices, Ford set the price and challenged the organisation to ensure costs were low enough to meet the figure. Ford's masterly piece of marketing lay in his intuitive realisation that the middle-class car market existed - it just remained for him to provide the products the market wanted. Model Ts were black, straightforward and affordable. The trouble was that when other manufacturers added extras, Ford kept it simple and dramatically lost ground. The man with a genius for marketing lost touch with the aspirations of customers. Even now, Ford's achievements remain impressive. He built his first car in 1896; started his own company in 1903; and between 1908 and 1927 produced 15m Model Ts. In 1920 Ford was making a car a minute. Production was based around strict functional divides - demarcations. Ford believed in people getting on with their jobs. He did not want engineers talking to salespeople, or people making decisions without his say-so. Management and managers he dismissed as largely unnecessary. Ford did not invent the production line, he was inspired by what he had seen in the slaughterhouses of Chicago. Others - such as musket-maker Eli Whitney in the 19th century - had also made tentative steps towards the production line. But Ford transformed it into a means of previously unimagined mass production. At the centre of Ford's thinking was the aim of standardisation - something continually emphasised by the car makers of today although they talk in terms of quality, and Ford in quantity. While Ford will never be celebrated for his people management skills, he had an international perspective which was ahead of his time. He was also acutely aware that time was an important competitive weapon. 'Time waste differs from material waste in that there can be no salvage.' 'In some respects Ford remains a good role model,' says Ray Wild, principal of Henley Management College. 'He was an improviser and innovator, he borrowed ideas and then adapted and synthesised them. He developed flow lines that involved people; now, we have flow lines without people, but no one questions their relevance or importance. Although he is seen as having de-humanised work, it shouldn't be forgotten that he provided a level of wealth for workers and products for consumers which weren't previously available.'</p>

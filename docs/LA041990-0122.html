			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEADQUARTERS SALE BOOSTS NORTHROP INCOME  </P> <P> Northrop Corp. earned $96 million on sales of $1.2 billion in the first  quarter, an increase in profit that was mostly attributable to the sale of its  headquarters building, the firm said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The aerospace company posted a $67.1-million after-tax gain on the sale of the  complex in the first quarter.  </P> <P> In addition, Northrop said net income was increased by $10.7 million pretax by  investment earnings from the firm's pension fund. Under accounting rules, a  company must post as earnings certain excess investment income from an  over-funded pension fund, which applies to Northrop, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Excluding that benefit and the gain from the building sale, Northrop still  increased its profits over the anemic $9.7 million it reported in last year's  first quarter, when the firm took a $26-million charge against profits on an  electronics program.  </P> <P> The company also noted that it reduced it debt to $881 million on March 31 from  $1.13 billion.  </P></p>

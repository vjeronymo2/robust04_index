			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / 200 L&amp;G staff told to vie for 100 jobs Legal &amp; General, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, is in effect sacking half its top life-products managers by asking all 200 of them to re-apply for only 100 jobs. The managers who survive the cull will be hired on new contracts. These will tie remuneration to factors such as ability to cope with customer demands and compliance with new insurance industry regulations, and not to sales volumes. The aim of the re-organisation, to take effect next month, is to emphasise the company's commitment to a highly ethical method of selling pensions and other life products after recent public criticism of life-industry sales practices. The changes come as the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, finishes drawing up a report which sets out mechanisms for dealing with compensation claims from people who believe they were mis-sold pensions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is thought claims across the life industry will total at least Pounds 500m. The company said its management changes were linked to the need to improve standards among its managers and agents selling life products. It aimed to keep 'the best people' from its 200 existing managers, who are based in regional offices and who each typically supervise about 10 sales agents. As part of the reorganisation it is greatly reducing opportunities for managers to earn big sums from agents' sales. Instead of their earnings being based partly on an 'override' of agents' own sales commissions, these executives will have a basic salary of about Pounds 15,000. On top of this relatively small commissions will be paid, depending on how well the managers satisfy customers' requirements in areas such as collection of premiums and speed of reaction to inquiries. The managers will also qualify for other commission payments, according to how well they organise the recording of details about customers' financial and personal circumstances when they are sold new products. Such record keeping in the industry has been acknowledged to have been poor in the past. Companies are having to improve in this area to meet tighter consumer-protection regulations being introduced by the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect private investors. In the past insurance managers in some branches of the industry have been able to earn more than Pounds 100,000 a year through 'sales override'. Although estimates are difficult, it is thought that under the new arrangements the company's managers will earn far less than this. It is instituting its new arrangements for managers as part of a plan to reduce the number of its sales agents. Unlike its managers, they are mainly self-employed and paid commission only. The number of sales agents is intended to fall from 2,300 at the beginning of the year to about 1,000 by the end. In the late 1980s Legal and General had about 3,000 sales agents. Announcing the company's latest financial results last month Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said he saw little prospect of short-term improvement in the difficult conditions of the UK market. He predicted increased competition and narrower margins next year.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE IN SAN DIEGO NEAR COLLAPSE, PROSECUTOR SAYS  </P> <P> San Diego City Atty. John Witt on Wednesday said that his department's criminal  prosecution division is "in jeopardy of collapsing" because of budget cuts that  are forcing the office to forgo hundreds of misdemeanor criminal cases each  month.  </P> <P> He said those cases, which involve drug and alcohol violations, vandalism,  robbery, trespassing and domestic violence, are strong enough legally to be  prosecuted in court, but are rejected solely because there aren't enough  prosecutors.  </P> <P> The growing inability to prosecute misdemeanors is most graphic in cases of  domestic violence, Witt said. Because of manpower shortages, the 2-year-old  division's four attorneys are unable to prosecute about half of the new  domestic violence cases that surface each month. In recent months, that meant  "rejecting 50% of all incoming spousal abuse cases without any prosecution or  follow-up," Witt said.  </P> <P> "We're going nuts" trying to deal with the caseload, said Casey Gwinn, head  attorney in the domestic violence unit. While other budgets in the city have  grown slightly during the last several years, the city attorney "is cutting  back (on misdemeanor prosecutions) to maintain serious crimes at the top of the  heap. We've watched everything suffer."  </P> <P> The number of cases not going to trial would increase dramatically if the San  Diego City Council adopts the budget proposed for the fiscal year beginning  July 1, Witt said.  </P> <P> "Over the years, I have not been an alarmist, but public safety is at stake,"  Witt said during a Wednesday press conference at City Hall. "Few departments in  the city of San Diego are more central to public safety . . . yet our budget  needs continue to go unfunded."  </P> <P> Witt on Wednesday joined the growing chorus of city department heads demanding  that the council increase their budgets. Those funding pleas began shortly  after the council tentatively agreed to freeze budgets at their current levels,  an action that, because of inflation and salary increases, would force service  levels to drop.  </P> <P> But Witt said Wednesday that the proposed freeze would dramatically reduce his  office's ability to prosecute serious misdemeanor crimes because the manpower  shortage "has really grown bad" over the last two or three years.  </P> <P> The council's current budget would freeze Witt's departmental spending at $12.8  million during the next fiscal year. Witt said Wednesday that he needs $2.7  million more than that to to keep prosecutions from sliding further.  </P> <P> The 98 attorneys in Witt's department handle legal affairs for the city as well  as prosecuting misdemeanor crimes that are committed in the city. Misdemeanors  range from relatively mundane traffic violations to "real crimes, serious  crimes committed by real criminals -- child abusers, wife beaters, drug users,  prostitutes, drunk drivers, con men, (and) slumlords," Witt said.  </P> <P> Witt's concerns were outlined in a pair of recent memorandums written by Deputy  City Atty. Mary T. Nuesca, whose unit determines which misdemeanor cases go to  trial.  </P> <P> In those reports, obtained by The Times on Wednesday, Nuesca described a  criminal justice system that, because of manpower shortages, is failing to  provide citizens with basic services.  </P> <P> "We've had to prioritize the type of crimes were going to (prosecute) but the  list of what we're not going to do keeps growing," Nuesca said in an interview.  "It was in crisis proportion back in April . . . since then it's only gotten  worse."  </P> <P> Because of the manpower shortage, "most vandalisms and battery cases are  rejected even though they are both legally and trial sufficient," Nuesca wrote  in the memo.  </P> <P> Nuesca said the city attorney's office also lacks the manpower to ensure that  defendants show up for arraignments.  </P> <P> "Essentially, we punish those who show up for court," Nuesca wrote. "Those who  do not, those who rip up their (citations), who continually fail to appear for  court, are rewarded for their ongoing criminal behavior by a lack of  prosecution."  </P> <P> "It will not be long until we reject a case where prosecution might have  prevented a more serious harm, but instead we rejected the case for 'budget'  reasons," Nuesca wrote.  </P> <P> "We have to try and decide which case is a ticking time bomb" and go to trial  on those, said Gretchen North, Nuesca's supervisor in the criminal division's  screening and arraignment unit. "That terrifies us. There are good triable  cases, and we are not able to prosecute."  </P> <P> Nuesca, in the memorandums and in an interview, described a system in which:  </P> <P> Prosecutors are hamstrung by an inability to properly screen cases before  appearing in arraignments. Although the city attorney historically has not  screened paper work for routine traffic cases and some municipal code  violations, in the last six months the department has stopped screening some  trespass, prostitution, petty theft and drug paraphernalia cases.  </P> <P> "This means that, if the case is not perfect at arraignment . . . if a page of  the police report is missing, we do not have the opportunity to request the  missing page from the Police Department," Nuesca wrote. "We must dismiss the  case."  </P> <P> Manpower shortages force prosecutors to plea-bargain cases that ordinarily  would go to trial. "It's a very strange way to do business," Nuesca said. "I'm  not at all happy with it. . . . But, when someone calls in sick, we might end  up with two deputy attorneys and 20 courtrooms. You end up having to  plea-bargain."  </P> <P> Plea bargains also occur when attorneys, who are unable to pre-screen records,  fail to uncover previous records of some defendants, Nuesca said. "Because  these cases are not screened, the career criminal can come to arraignment court  and receive the same treatment/punishment as a first-time offender," Nuesca  said.  </P> <P> Relatively young attorneys are "being asked to do some of the toughest,  on-the-spot screening in court," Nuesca wrote.  </P> <P> Decisions on which cases get tried are increasingly driven by whether or not  the case will move speedily. "If drug case A triggers more paper work than drug  case B, case A isn't going to get prosecuted," Nuesca said.  </P> <P> Victims who seek criminal justice through the city attorney's office  increasingly are being left to civil remedies.  </P> <P> "I spend most of my time on the telephone with victims, explaining why we  rejected their case," Nuesca said. "I tell them we don't have any money, and  they say that they pay their taxes. . . . They have no idea (about) the state  of the criminal justice system."  </P> <P> With the exception of DUI cases, U.S. Navy personnel facing misdemeanor charges  are now tried by the military justice system. Traditionally, the military  system tried only those cases that occurred on military bases. Similarly, the  city attorney has asked the San Diego State University judicial discipline  office to handle all but the most serious misdemeanor cases that occur on that  campus.  </P> <P> Although many lesser misdemeanors are not being tried, the city attorney is  still prosecuting cases involving diving under the influence or weapons, and  cases that the district attorney downgrades from felonies to misdemeanors.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine that we'd stop doing DUI or weapons," Nuesca said. "You might  as well fold us down completely."  </P> <P> Witt on Wednesday acknowledged that, even if his department were to be  adequately funded, the city is not able to properly deal with misdemeanor  crimes because the city lacks a jail to house people who are arrested on  misdemeanor charges. "The criminal justice system is in terrible shape," Witt  said.  </P> <P> The city is seeking the money to build a misdemeanor detention facility at Otay  Mesa.  </P></p>

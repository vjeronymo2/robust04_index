			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROUGH TIMES IN A PROTECTED MARKET;  </P> <P> AUTO PRODUCTS: ARMOR ALL STILL COMMANDS 81% OF SEGMENT SALES, BUT CRACKS HAVE  STARTED TO APPEAR IN THE FIRM'S ONCE-INVINCIBLE DEFENSES IN THE FACE OF  MOUNTING COMPETITION.  </P> <P> Almost from the day that it was introduced in 1972, Armor All Protectant has  been a hit in the retail marketplace.  </P> <P> Within a few years of its debut, millions of car owners had become convinced  that they couldn't do without the waxy white spray treatment for vinyl,  leather, plastics and rubber: a classic case of a product creating its own  market.  </P> <P> By 1979, when founder Alan Forman Rypinski sold the company, then based in  Irvine, to San Francisco's McKesson Corp. for $49 million, Armor All Products  Corp. controlled 93% of the market in terms of sales dollars.  </P> <P> And since the day that it opened its doors, Armor All, now headquartered in the  southern Orange County community of Aliso Viejo, posted nothing but a string of  ever-increasing profits.  </P> <P> Until now.  </P> <P> Armor All's once-invincible grip on the market has begun to slip. The company's  longtime president has resigned. Armor All has admitted that for fiscal 1990,  which ends Saturday, it will report the first decrease in annual earnings in  its history. And Wall Street has responded by trashing the company's stock.  </P> <P> The turmoil underscores that Armor All is a textbook example of what can happen  when an entrepreneurial company grows up without changing its management style  and when success goes unchallenged for too long.  </P> <P> True, the company's current 81% market share, as reported by A. C. Nielsen  Co.'s Market Research Group, is still an awesome position that most companies  can only dream of achieving. But it signals to a plethora of would-be  challengers that there's a chink in the champion's armor.  </P> <P> It is also true that Armor All is reporting only a decline in earnings -- not a  loss -- and that the decline comes in the wake of a major expansion.  </P> <P> But the report of the earnings decline was embarrassing. It came just two  months after company President Jeffrey M. Sherman said, after three consecutive  quarters of declining profit, that the fourth quarter would pick up and that  fiscal 1990 earnings "are expected to be flat to down modestly."  </P> <P> On March 12, the company repudiated Sherman's statement and said fourth-quarter  and annual profit would be down significantly. At the same time, the company  announced the resignation of Sherman, who had been president since 1978.  </P> <P> The events caught market analysts off guard, and the company's stock promptly  lost 15% of its value.  </P> <P> Trading in the days immediately after the March 12 announcements was frenetic.  On March 13 alone, 38.8 million shares changed hands -- an average of nearly  two sales for each of the 20.9 million shares of stock outstanding.  </P> <P> By Friday, two weeks after the announcement, trading had returned to a normal  volume of about 10,000 shares a day, but the stock price closed at $14, down  35% from the $20.75 at which it began the year. For its part, McKesson, which  still owns 83% of Armor All after selling 17% of the company's stock in a  public offering that raised $41 million in 1986, has raced to reassure  investors and customers that the market reaction is excessive and that there is  nothing fundamentally wrong with the company.  </P> <P> The first step was to name Kenneth C. Hicken, longtime executive vice president  of operations at McKesson, to serve as Armor All's new president and chief  executive.  </P> <P> McKesson and Armor All also have teamed up to communicate their message to  institutional investors and to the scant handful of stock analysts who monitor  and issue reports on Armor All.  </P> <P> Company officials are being closely questioned in three areas:  </P> <P> * The sudden appearance in the market 18 months ago of a well-financed,  determined challenger. Son of a Gun! protectant, from the STP division of First  Brands Corp. in Danbury, Conn., is the first of more than 120 Armor All  imitators to capture a significant market share, climbing to 10% of the dollar  volume in less than two years.  </P> <P> * The company's ambitious expansion drive overseen by Sherman in late 1988. It  generated unforeseen costs and didn't come across with the promised profit.  </P> <P> * A corporate culture that stressed freewheeling entrepreneurial values and  failed to keep close tabs on the nuts and bolts of what had become by early  last year a major distribution operation. That style apparently ended with  Sherman's resignation and Hicken's arrival Monday at Armor All's new $7-million  corporate headquarters.  </P> <P> Some analysts believe that the company's biggest obstacle is its new,  well-heeled challenger.  </P> <P> Jeanine C. Heller, auto products analyst with Stifel Nicholas, a St. Louis,  Mo., brokerage, said she based her recommendation at the end of February that  clients sell their Armor All shares largely on the push that Son of a Gun! was  making.  </P> <P> "You cannot have a competitor spending as much as First Brands has been  spending to market Son of a Gun! without it affecting profits," she said. "They  are attacking Armor All with huge amounts of advertising and they are buying  shelf space for Son of a Gun!"  </P> <P> Heller said she believes that First Brands will pull back on its advertising to  improve profit, "but they obviously think it is worth it. Their presence could  wreak havoc with Armor All's profits."  </P> <P> Rick Bowen, vice president of marketing for First Brands' auto products  division, said the company spent $6 million last year on Son of a Gun!  advertising. In comparison, Armor All spent about $7 million advertising its  protectant.  </P> <P> In addition, both companies spend millions on incentives to retailers in an  effort to get good displays on store shelves.  </P> <P> First Brands decided to launch a challenge to Armor All's supremacy, Bowen  said, "because we figured that was one of the automotive after-market areas  showing growth and with room for us."  </P> <P> One of First Brands' strategies has been to price Son of a Gun! considerably  below Armor All. A 20-ounce bottle of Son of a Gun! retailing for $2.97 at a  Kragen Auto Parts store in Costa Mesa is displayed next to a 16-ounce bottle of  Armor All, priced at $4.47.  </P> <P> And while officials at Armor All say the challenge has not forced them to lower  prices, they have increased the fluid weight of its most popular size. A new  20-ounce bottle of Armor All Protectant now shouts "25% Free. 4 Oz. Extra" at  the top of the label. At a Chief Auto Parts store in Santa Ana, the new size  was priced at $4.49 versus $3.99 for the Son of a Gun! 20-ounce bottle.  </P> <P> Hicken, in his first interview since taking over at Armor All, acknowledged  that First Brands' challenge was forcing his company to spend considerably more  on advertising and marketing.  </P> <P> He said some of the costs will likely show up in the fourth quarter but warned  that others could be delayed until the first quarter of the company's fiscal  1991.  </P> <P> "The board of directors hasn't even seen our proposals yet," he said. "They get  them on Monday. But basically, we have increased spending for advertising and  can either take the costs in the fourth quarter, when the ads were made, or in  the quarters in which they run. It depends on whether the board wants to take  all the hits in 1990."  </P> <P> Hicken also agreed with analysts that the company has lost the confidence of  the investment community. But restoring it is perhaps the easiest of the tasks  facing him.  </P> <P> "I feel comfortable that, for 1991, the numbers we are generating are good  numbers. We intend to regain our lost face with the Street by doing  operationally what we say we are going to do."  </P> <P> Hicken said that while fiscal 1990 earnings will fall below the $27.1 million  posted in 1989, the "stumbles" that led to the decline won't be repeated in  1991. In fact, new management and financial control measures already being  instituted will result in a profit increase for fiscal 1991, he said.  </P> <P> "It is not a gloom-and-doom projection for 1991," Hicken said. "Earnings growth  will be above 1990, although probably not above 1989."  </P> <P> While declining to discuss his predecessor or the specific reasons for  Sherman's resignation, Hicken characterized the Armor All of just a year ago as  "a tremendous company that was doing hellaciously well with a bunch of go-go  entrepreneurs at the helm."  </P> <P> But in late 1988, Armor All acquired the Borden Co.'s car-care products group,  consisting of Rain Dance and Rally lines of car waxes and the No. 7 line of  polishes and additives and launched a line of Armor All waxes and washes.  </P> <P> With that $29-million acquisition, Armor All became a multiline distributor,  and the original entrepreneurial managers "suddenly found themselves in an  arena they did not have much experience in," Hicken said.  </P> <P> "Armor All was not this little whizzing company anymore, it was a substantial  corporation."  </P> <P> Several analysts suggested that Armor All's management team dropped the ball  with the Borden acquisition. (Sherman did not respond to requests for  interviews.)  </P> <P> "They needed to diversify because having a one-product company is risky, but  Borden didn't work out as well as they hoped," said analyst Heller. "With the  Borden products and the new Armor All line of wax they came out with last year,  they have about 30% of the car wax market, and that can be good," she said.  </P> <P> Hicken acknowledges that Armor All was hurt immediately after the Borden  acquisitions. He says it was because retailers had overstocked in anticipation  of a price hike by Borden and they virtually stopped buying for the next  quarter.  </P> <P> "This was their first acquisition," said Heller, "and they missed that."  </P> <P> But Hicken disputes claims that a more experienced or less complacent  management would have seen that Borden poured product into the pipeline and  would have negotiated a different deal to account for it.  </P> <P> The wax and chemicals buyer for a major automotive parts chain offers one more  reason for the revenue deficiencies from the Borden acquisition. Armor All  "didn't push the products very hard and they were priced too high," said the  buyer, who asked not be be identified because of his company's ongoing business  relationship with Armor All.  </P> <P> "A lot of buyers just backed off," the buyer said. "We thought Armor All just  bought the Borden brands to eliminate a competitor to the waxes it was bringing  out under its own name."  </P> <P> That misconception has now been corrected, with Armor All positioning its own  brand of waxes in a middle range between Rain Dance and Rally and pushing hard  for sales of all three brands.  </P> <P> Pushing hard for sales is what Armor All has done best in the past, Hicken  said. It is also at the root of the financial problems he is now charged with  curing.  </P> <P> Even as the company outgrew its entrepreneurial roots with its 1988 expansion,  he said, Armor All's management kept stressing what it had always done best --  sales and marketing. Scant attention was paid to the unexciting but  all-important accounting department, where a significant problem was  developing.  </P> <P> In its entrepreneurial phase, Armor All "had one basic product and a dozen  SKUs," the product codes denoting product type and package size. Now, Hicken  said, "there's a dozen products and more than 160 SKUs to keep track of."  </P> <P> The company has cooperative advertising pacts with hundreds of retail chains  and each quarter must estimate the next quarter's outlay for reimbursing the  retailers.  </P> <P> "There is a tremendous delay between the time the retailers earn the  cooperative monies and the time they send in their bills," Hicken said,  "Because things grew so fast, we had much bigger fourth-quarter outlays than  anticipated. Several were more than $1 million each, and every million dollars  subtracts three cents from our per-share earnings."  </P> <P> As part of the new, corporate management style that he is bringing to Armor  All, Hicken has hired Mervin McCulloch, former Deloitte &amp; Touche regional  managing partner, to serve as chief financial officer.  </P> <P> No other management changes have occurred and none are planned, Hicken said.  "We feel this is a very good team, but the train got a little derailed because  the controls couldn't keep up with the frantic pace of growth," he said.  </P></p>

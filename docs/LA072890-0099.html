			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: NEW HOCKEY TEAM SELECTS OLD FAVORITE FOR NAME:  GULLS  </P> <P> San Diego obtained a new minor league hockey team on June 14. One month and 13  days later, the team has been given a familiar name: the Gulls.  </P> <P> Vin Ciruzzi, president of the International Hockey League club, made the  announcement Friday, saying, "Our goal was to revive the essence and mystique  of the San Diego Gulls."  </P> <P> San Diego had three professional hockey teams between 1966 and 1979: the Hawks  of the Pacific Hockey League, the Mariners of the World Hockey Association and  the Gulls of the World Hockey League.  </P> <P> The Gulls, who sometimes outdrew the NHL's Los Angeles Kings during their  tenure here and routinely drew 10,000 to 11,000 fans on Saturday nights, were  considered the most successful of the three.  </P> <P> San Diego was able to use the name Gulls only after getting an OK Thursday from  Bob Breitbard, the former owner of the WHL Gulls, who still owns rights to the  name.  </P> <P> The Gulls will open their IHL season Oct. 5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FOOTBALL  </P> <P> San Diego State's football team will play a two-game series against Arizona,  beginning in 2000, Athletic Director Fred Miller announced. The Aztecs will  face the Wildcats Sept. 16, 2000, in Tucson and Sept. 15, 2001, at home.  Arizona leads the series between the two teams, 6-5, and beat SDSU, 42-10, the  last time they played, in 1979.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOCCER  </P> <P> The San Diego Nomads battled to a 0-0 tie before dropping a Western Soccer  League game to Colorado, 3-2, on penalty kicks in Denver. The Nomads fell to  7-9.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WOMEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> Manuela Maleeva, 23, ranked eighth in the world in women's singles, has entered  the Great American Bank tennis tournament to be played at the San Diego Tennis  and Racquet Club Aug. 6-12. The field also includes top-ranked Steffi Graf and  Wimbledon champ Martina Navratilova.  </P></p>

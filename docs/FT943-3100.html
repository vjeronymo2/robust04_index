			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ex-IBM chief to head Canadian films group Mr Robert Corrigan, formerly president of IBM's personal computer business, has been appointed president and chief executive of Imax, a Canadian film production company that has pioneered the use of giant screens, large-format and motion simulation. Mr Corrigan's appointment is the latest example of the increasing cross-over between the computer and entertainment industries with the development of multimedia technologies. 'The entertainment world is rapidly changing inside and outside the home,' said Mr Corrigan. He added that Imax was poised to capitalise on this by developing and delivering the next generations of hardware and software. 'We are on the threshold of a sophisticated marriage between computer technology and entertainment,' added Mr Douglas Trumbull, vice-chairman of Imax. In another example of the convergence of entertainment and electronics, Mr Strauss Zelnick, former president of 20th Century Fox who for the past two years has headed Crystal Dynamics, a leading Silicon Valley video games software developer, is to become head of BMG Entertainment North America in January. BMG is a subsidiary of Bertelsmann, the German media company. Mr Zelnick will oversee the operations of BMG in the US, including its music publishing and interactive entertainment operations. He will also lead BMG's expansion into film in the US. Time Warner's board of directors has appointed Mr Norman Pearlstine the company's next editor-in-chief, Reuter reports. Mr Pearlstine becomes the fifth editor-in-chief in Time's history on the date of Mr Jason McManus's retirement at the end of the year. He is the first editor-in-chief chosen from outside the company.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Japanese Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen discussed Japan's efforts to prop up its faltering  economy and slim its colossal current-account surplus, a U.S.  Government source said Saturday.    The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  bilateral talks dealt with Tokyo's plans to further deregulate  its markets and open them up to more foreign competition.    The United States is "very concerned" about Japan's actions  to stimulate domestic demand and liberalize the market, the  source said.    A Japanese official, meanwhile, said Fujii briefed Bentsen  on  the latest pump-primer that totals 15.25 trillion yen and said  the 6 trillion yen tax reduction envisaged by the package is  "but a first step toward a more full-fledged tax reduction in  the future."    The talks, which will be followed by a meeting of finance  officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers here,  mark the first ministerial-level bilateral talks between Japan  and the U.S. since the "framework" trade talks broke down  earlier this month.    The collapse of the framework talks, meant to reduce Japan's  chronic current-account surplus with the U.S. that totaled 60  billion dollars last year, has led to a series of tough trade  actions taken by Washington in recent days.    A few days after the February 11 summit meeting between  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton, Washington announced plans to impose sanctions on  Japan for what it perceives as limited access for foreigners to  Japan's cellular phone market.    In a bid to head off a U.S. trade tit-for-tat, the Japanese  Government has started compiling voluntary plans to liberalize  the market. The plans are scheduled to be unveiled in March.</p>

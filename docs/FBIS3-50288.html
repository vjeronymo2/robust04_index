			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Michael Rose, new commander of the UN  forces for Bosnia-Herzegovina, today talked with Presidency  Member Ejup Ganic, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, and Army  General Rasim Delic. Here is a report by Nedzad Leko:    [Begin recording] [Leko] General Michael Rose was first  received by Presidency Member Ejup Ganic. After the talks, Dr.  Ganic told foreign and domestic journalists the following:    [Ganic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation]  Speaking on behalf of the Presidency, I informed General Rose  that we are going to do everything with a view to helping his  mission here. Everybody knows that the humanitarian situation  is very tragic and we hope that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] troops headed by the general will act efficiently,  protect the humanitarian convoys, and deliver food to the  population, and we ourselves are going to do everything to help.  We do not want UN troops to be treated badly and are encouraging  Gen. Rose to act efficiently and do everything necessary.    We also touched upon other issues such as Tuzla Airport and  other details. Of course, peace negotiations were one of the  topics and we stressed that if clear political principles for  negotiations are not formulated, Geneva will continue being a  mere media zoo. Therefore, we hope that the clear political  principles that were defined at the London conference will be  confirmed in order for us to be able to continue political talks.    [Leko] Gen. Rose commented very briefly on the talks he had  with Dr. Ganic:    [Rose in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] We  had a very useful conversation. We initiated a large number of  issues. I told Dr. Ganic that UNPROFOR will do the best it can  with a view to continuing to help the delivery of humanitarian  aid and to help the peace process in this country.    [Leko] One of the questions for Gen. Rose was whether one  can expect some change in the UNPROFOR mandate with his arrival.    [Rose in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] I  do not think that we are going to see any changes in the mandate  I received in the near future.    [Leko] Today, Gen. Rose also talked with Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic and with Hasan Muratovic, chairman of the State  Commission for Relations with the United Nations. After the  formal part of Gen. Rose's visit, Dr. Silajdzic told the  journalist the following:    [Silajdzic] I will say only one thing: The most important  thing is the humanitarian convoys, that is, how are we to clear  the corridors for humanitarian convoys. I think that this is  the key question and we are going to talk about it now.  Everything else is of marginal importance at this moment.  Therefore, freeing corridors for humanitarian convoys is the  basic thing we are talking about. We are now going to continue  the talks.    [Leko] In reply to the question asked by foreign journalists  on whether he expects essential changes in UNPROFOR activity  with Gen. Rose's arrival, Dr. Silajdzic said the following:    [Silajdzic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian  translation]  As far as I can understand, the mandate has not changed and  unfortunately, as much as they would like to help, they do not  have the mandate to do so. Therefore the problem is that the  aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina is taken for granted. We are  just the other side in the conflict. The victim and aggressor  are equal. The killed and the killer are the same. Why?  Because nobody wants to interfere. The West has become a group  of noninterfering countries. Democracy and morality are  attacked in Bosnia, if that means anything to anybody. Our  principles are attacked and we are seen only as a side in a  conflict. The guns around Sarajevo and civilians waiting to be  shelled are seen as one and the same thing. I think I have said  enough.    [Leko] Would you like to see the roads for the passage of  convoys freed by military action, foreign journalists asked Dr.  Silajdzic.    [Silajdzic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian  translation]  We would like to see convoys pass because people are hungry,  people are dying, while some other people are blocking the  convoys' passage. Therefore, whoever is blocking convoys -- be  it Bosnians, Serbs, or Croats -- should be attacked because they  are killing people with starvation.    [Leko] During their meeting today, Army General Rasim Delic  informed Gen. Rose about the situation on the battlefield, the  humanitarian situation, and the cause of the conflicts in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The two generals also talked about the  problems of implementing the agreements signed so far, as well  as resolutions that have been adopted without instruments for  their implementation being developed.    Gen. Rose presented the aim of his mission, as well as  activities he is planning for the coming period. I want to help  the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly in the delivery  of humanitarian aid. In doing so I will do everything with the  means and forces I have at my disposal, Gen. Rose stressed at  the end of today's talks. [end recording]</p>

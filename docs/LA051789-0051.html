			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOBBYISTS ASKED TO AID WRIGHT DEFENSE;  </P> <P> HELP PAY LAWYERS' FEES, 100 TEXANS ARE URGED BY SPEAKER'S ALLIES  </P> <P> Acting with Speaker Jim Wright's approval, four of his allies in the House have  appealed to leading Texas corporate and labor union lobbyists to help pay the  cost of defending him against House Ethics Committee charges, Rep. Charles  Wilson (D-Tex.) said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The campaign to defray the fast-rising bills from the Speaker's eight-lawyer  team was started Monday at an Austin, Tex., meeting of more than 100 lobbyists  coordinated by Wright's chief of staff, Marshall Lynam.  </P> <P> Wilson said that the fund-raising was "distasteful" to Wright but was essential  because the Speaker would have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to  prepare his legal defense. Mark Johnson, a spokesman for the Speaker, said that  legal defense funds are permitted under House rules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defense Foundation Started  </P> <P> The Texans attending the Austin meeting, Wilson said, were told that they could  donate to Wright's campaign fund or to a newly organized Wright legal defense  foundation to be based in Ft. Worth. The defense foundation can accept  unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations or labor unions that do not  have a direct interest in legislation.  </P> <P> In addition, Wilson said, the contributions to the foundation would be made in  such a way that Wright would not know who gave money.  </P> <P> "They were all pretty enthusiastic because they know how much (Wright) means to  the state," Wilson told reporters. "We can raise whatever it takes -- we're not  going to lose this because we can't afford the lawyers."  </P> <P> In addition to Wilson, appeals for funds were made by three other Texas allies  of Wright in the House -- Jack Brooks, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, J.  J. Pickle and Martin Frost.  </P> <P> When asked for comment on the fund-raising drive, House Minority Whip Newt  Gingrich (R-Ga.) said that Wright should "step aside" as Speaker until the  charges against him have been resolved by the House ethics panel or the House  itself.  </P> <P> "The notion that we have a man sitting in the chair raising defense funds is a  problem," Gingrich said. "If we were behaving reasonably, he would step aside  and let somebody like (Rep. William H.) Natcher (D-Ky.) serve as an interim  Speaker."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gingrich Also Accused  </P> <P> However, a spokesman for Wright brushed aside the suggestion by Gingrich, who  brought the original charges against the Speaker a year ago and has himself  been accused by a Democratic congressman of violating House rules with an  unusual $105,000 book promotion fund.  </P> <P> Wilson also rejected the idea, saying that Wright has a strong case in his  defense.  </P> <P> "Politically, we're weak because of the daily pounding (in the press) that  we're taking," Wilson said. "My advice to the Speaker is to act like a Texas  jack rabbit in a hailstorm -- hunker down and take it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Speaker maintained that he was not being distracted by the  year-old investigation into his financial affairs.  </P> <P> When told that some members of the House are speculating that the investigation  eventually might cost him his leadership post, Wright replied he has read that  in the newspapers but that "my colleagues have not said that to me. I don't  think it's a prevailing sentiment. The important thing is that Congress perform  its work and not be distracted."  </P> <P> In another development, the House ethics panel questioned Henry Simon, an  attorney for George A. Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth developer who is a key figure  in the investigation of the Speaker. Other witnesses, including Mallick's son,  Michael, who played a role in an oil and gas investment that led to a quick  profit for Wright, are to be questioned later this week.  </P> <P> One of Wright's new attorneys, Stephen D. Susman of Houston, said that the  expanded inquiry into this transaction is frivolous because Wright's holdings  were in a blind trust at the time.  </P> <P> Although Susman once said he would need 30 days to be briefed on the case, he  said Tuesday that he would be ready to begin an ethics panel hearing quickly if  the committee rules against the Speaker's motion to dismiss the basic charges  on grounds that they have no basis under the panel's operating rules.  </P> <P> "It's in the best interests of my client to get this thing done quickly,"  Susman said.  </P> <P> Wright is accused of violating House rules on 69 occasions by scheming to evade  a House limit on speaking fees and by accepting $145,000 in gifts from Mallick  over a 10-year period. The Speaker has denied any wrongdoing but has said that  he may have made "technical" mistakes in filing his financial disclosure  reports.  </P></p>

Farmland ``already in'' urban development or water storage includes all such land with a density of 30 structures per 40-acre area. Farmland already in urban development also includes lands identified as ``urbanized area'' (UA) on the Census Bureau Map, or as urban area mapped with a ``tint overprint'' on the USGS topographical maps, or as ``urban-built-up'' on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not ``farmland'' and, therefore, are not subject to the Act. Farmland ``committed to urban development or water storage'' includes all such land that receives a combined score of 160 points or less from the land evaluation and site assessment criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means those activities or responsibilities of a Federal agency that involve undertaking, financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects or acquiring, managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The term ``Federal program'' does not include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs for activities on private or non-Federal lands; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) construction or improvement projects that were beyond the planning stage and were in either the active design or construction state on August 4, 1984. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For the purposes of this section, a project is considered to be ``beyond the planning stage and in either the active design or construction state on August 4, 1984'' if, on or before that date, actual construction of the project had commenced or: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) acquisition of land or easements for the project had occurred or all required Federal agency planning documents and steps were completed and accepted, endorsed, or approved by the appropriate agency; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) a final environmental impact statement was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency or an environmental assessment was completed and a finding of no significant impact was executed by the appropriate agency official; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) the engineering or architectural design had begun or such services had been secured by contract.

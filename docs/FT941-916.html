			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Management: Tests on trial - Psychometric testing of job candidates is objective - True or False? All great paintings require an act of creativity. All paintings are painted by artists. Therefore all artists are creative. True or false?'. An uncontroversial question, you might think. Yet a psychometric test containing 80 similar questions was last week criticised on the grounds of racial bias. Used by the General Council of the Bar of England and Wales to help select students for the barristers' finals course, the test is being blamed for a success rate of nearly 50 per cent for white candidates compared to less than 20 per cent for black and ethnic minority candidates. 'Nothing terrible has happened,' says Robert Wood of Pearn Kandola Occupational Psychologists who helped design the selection system. He says the test was properly applied, and points out that the number of successful black candidates was higher than in previous years. Nevertheless, the Council of Legal Education feels obliged to mount an investigation. 'Clearly there have been disparities in the selection rates. We need to look at what may have caused them,' says John Taylor, secretary of the CLE. The allegation of bias in psychometric testing is a serious one. Some 80 per cent of British companies use psychometric tests, and the number is rising. Employers use them to test for abilities as well as for personality traits. They use them to decide who to hire, who to promote, and even who to fire. An estimated 100,000 tests are used in the UK each year for selection alone. Some come from reputable firms which design the tests with great care. Others are supplied by 'bucket shops', or even come free with general packages of computer software. Employers like psychometric tests because they appear to be more objective than other ways of assessing people. Interviews often prove to be of little use in picking the right person, and are wide open to discrimination. But while there is evidence that aptitude tests at least can be good predictors of success in the job, they can be dangerous in the wrong hands. 'Psychometric testing is not a neutral tool, and must be used carefully,' says Chris Myant from the Commission for Racial Equality. He argues that nearly all tests are culturally loaded: different racial groups have had different educations, make different assumptions and may think differently, affecting their performance accordingly. In the US psychometric tests fell out of fashion a decade ago on the racial discrimination issue. They are now making a come-back, but only in cases where they have been proved to be both relevant and equally valid for different ethnic groups. In Britain the CRE recommends that all tests should have been tried out on a racially mixed group to identify bias, and that the standard of skills set in the test should be appropriate to the job in question. When eight Asian guards wanting to become British Rail drivers recently failed a verbal reasoning test, the CRE complained. It said verbal reasoning was not necessary for train drivers, and that the test was therefore discriminatory. BR subsequently changed the test, and some of the guards who initially failed are now drivers. However, even when obvious cultural references have been stripped out and the level of test is appropriate for the job in hand, tests can still favour one race or sex above another. Charles Johnson, an occupational psychologist at Psychometric Research &amp; Development who advised the Bar Council, argues that bias can creep in subtly. For instance, there is some evidence that ethnic minorities and women are less prepared to guess the right answer, which penalises them in tests where no marks are taken off for wrong replies. Moreover, people who have been brought up on a heavy diet of exams will be better at controlling the speed at which they are working, and therefore tend to score higher. In spite of these problems Johnson argues that the tests can still be useful if not too much reliance is placed on any one test and the pass mark is not set too high. One problem is the variable quality of suppliers. Saville &amp; Holds-worth, one of the largest in Britain, researches each test on different ethnic groups before selling it. If it finds that certain groups score differently it makes sure that all users are aware of the discrepancy. Moreover, reliable firms do not sell tests to anyone who has not been trained in how to use them. 'Some instruments are knocked up over a wet weekend in someone's front room and then given some energetic marketing,' warns Donald McLeod, a psychologist at Ashridge Management College. Part of the danger in psychometric tests lies in their very promise of objectivity. 'People think if it's scientific, it must be fair,' says Angela Baron, a policy adviser at the Institute of Personnel Management. 'Unless you understand how they work and what you are measuring they are open to discrimination.' The IPM recently published lengthy guidelines for companies using psychometric tests, starting with the golden rule that the tests would only be a part of a selection process, and indicating the importance of training and the need for careful monitoring. While ability tests are controversial, personality tests are even more contentious. The latter variety of psychometric test has recently become the most popular of all. The tests ask a series of questions, ranging from 'Do you prefer baths to showers?' to 'Do you consider yourself to be outgoing?', in order to assess up to 30 different personality traits. Companies feel they are getting more precise information than can be obtained otherwise, in a form that allows them to compare candidates objectively. Baron argues that employers should take care when using this sort of information in recruitment, although it could be useful in career counselling. 'You need to ask if personality is relevant to the job anyway. Often it isn't,' she says. Personality tests can be distorted by the mood of the candidate on the day, or by fake answers. More alarmingly, there is little conclusive evidence that personality test results are related to performance in the job. Academics such as Johnson, who believe in carefully monitored aptitude testing, draw the line at personality tests. 'The idea that you can get paper and pencil tests to measure something intangible - I don't believe it,' he says. At least one thing can be said for them: as there are no right or wrong answers, the question of racial bias is not so serious. Yet that is not much consolation if they are not worth a row of beans anyway.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRAWL BLAMED ON CAN OF SPRAY PAINT  </P> <P> A dispute over a can of spray paint may have ignited racial tensions and led to  a brawl at the Fenner Canyon Youth Conservation Camp, resulting in 10 inmates  being treated for injuries at hospitals in the Antelope Valley, authorities  said Friday.  </P> <P> About 32 inmates -- mostly Latinos and Asians -- who were involved in the  Thursday night melee were transferred Friday to a maximum-security youth  training facility in Chino, said Simon Cabrera, assistant superintendent at  Fenner.  </P> <P> Staff members rushed into a dormitory and used Mace to break up the fight, and  Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were called to the camp at Llano, east of  Palmdale, to quell the disturbance. The inmates used mop handles, chairs and  wooden clocks as weapons, officials said.  </P> <P> Cabrera said the brawl was a "racial disturbance" that may have been rooted in  an incident earlier this week when staff members searched the dorm for a  missing can of spray paint, which inmates sniff. A Latino inmate who had the  spray can apparently hid it under an Asian inmate's bunk, he said.  </P> <P> The camp, operated by the California Youth Authority, provides crews to aid  fire departments throughout the state. Those at the camp, including many gang  members, were convicted in Juvenile Court of crimes such as car theft, burglary  and drug offenses.  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fungus spoils appetite for US wheat - A disease that is adding to exporters' problems DISCOVERY OF a poisonous fungus in the US spring wheat crop prompted a jump in US wheat prices last week and threw wheat buying agencies in Japan into nervous consternation. Japan is one of the biggest consumers for high-protein US wheat, and one of the few that pays in cash. The crop quality concerns have since abated, but are still sufficiently significant, analysts say, to sustain firm prices for high quaility wheat worldwide. The fungus outbreak could not have come at a worse time for US wheat exporters. Winter wheat growers have just completed a healthy harvest and are beginning to realise that their biggest buyers - Russia and China - are drastically trimming their grain import intentions. With production growing and the international wheat trade slowing, the US Department of Agriculture projects world wheat stocks will rise by 2.6m tonnes this year, to 135.21m tonnes. Good crop prospects and dull export conditions left the US wheat market on the sidelines for most of the summer as relentless rains played havoc in the central Midwest and maize and soyabean prices soared. Except for a small a portion grown on the dry southern and western plains the US winter wheat crop escaped the floods. Until recently spring wheat crop prospects also appeared excellent. Three weeks ago a group of agricultural specialists and journalists conducted their annual tour of North Dakota and Minnesota spring wheat fields and announced the crop was two to three weeks late because of cool weather, but in superb condition. 'Then,' says Mr Jim Peterson, marketing specialist for the North Dakota Wheat Commission, 'we got several days of really hot weather, and with so much moisture in the ground, some of the fields were like saunas.' The cool developmental period and late steamy conditions fostered a plant disease known as 'scab' or 'head blight', which produces a fungus that can cause nausea when consumed in sufficient quantities. Hard red spring wheat is prized for its high protein levels, and is often blended with lower protein winter wheats for bread making. News of toxins in the first bushels of the North Dakota wheat harvest threw spring wheat futures prices at the Minneapolis grain exchange into a tumult. The September contract rallied 23 cents, to Dollars 3.42 a bushel (60lb) in two days, and cash prices soared above Dollars 5.50 a bushel as millers bid up the premiums they pay for high protein wheat. The scurry for protein, traders say, was encouraged by reports that Canada's spring wheat crop was more than three weeks behind normal development and in danger of an early frost. France, the world's biggest high-protein wheat producer, is also experiencing quality reductions because of heavy harvest rains. Some analysts estimated initially that as much as 20 per cent of the projected 640m bushel US spring wheat crop was affected by the fungus. But crop specialists are now calling the disease problem 'localised' and are waiting for more of the crop to be cut. The US Department of Agriculture said last week that as of August 15, only 7 per cent of spring wheat fields had been harvested. By the end of the week the September spring wheat price had moved back by 20 cents. The earlier rise 'was too strong a reaction,' says Mr Warren King, market specialist for Cargill Investors Services in Chicago. 'Wheat prices are 60 to 70 cents per bushel higher today than they were when the 1988 drought cut the spring wheat crop nearly in half. That doesn't make a lot of sense.' In the meantime, US wheat exporters are trying to calm their best customers. Japan dithered over its regular weekly offers last week, but its buyers are expected to be back in the US wheat market again today. 'They are being cautious,' says Mr Greg Dowd, crop specialist with the export marketing group US Wheat Associates. He thinks that China will buy only about 2.5m tonnes of US wheat this year, less than half of its purchases three years ago. Russia, with a good crop of its own and lingering credit problems at the USDA, may take only donated US wheat this year. The former Soviet Union bought 6m tonnes of US wheat last year. 'We'll have to scramble pretty hard to make up for loss of business that size,' Mr Dowd says. In its August 11 crop report the USDA estimated that US wheat stocks would climb to 741m bushels this year, from 529m last year, mostly because of fading export prospects.</p>

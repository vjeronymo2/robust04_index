			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y seeks extra funds for Canadian operations OLYMPIA &amp; York wants lenders to provide extra funds for its Canadian operations before paying CDollars 17m (USDollars 14.2m) in overdue interest on a series of publicly-traded bonds secured by Toronto's tallest office building. It also emerged yesterday that bankers in a loan syndicate led by JP Morgan are so infuriated by a recent O&amp;Y decision to divert cash on a collateral property from bank creditors to bondholders that they have decided to foreclose on a Dollars 160m O&amp;Y loan made last year. The foreclosure - to occur next week - would be the first seizure of O&amp;Y assets since the restructuring of the Canadian property group's debt began. It places Morgan in an awkward spot since the bank is serving as both a financial adviser to O&amp;Y and a creditor with an estimated Dollars 50m of total loan exposure. Sir Dennis Weathertone, Morgan's chairman, yesterday defended the foreclosure move and said it would not lead to a collapse of the overall O&amp;Y debt restructuring. 'We're confident we've done the right thing,' he told Morgan's annual meeting. Meanwhile, Canadian banks have yet to respond to O&amp;Y's request to draw down the remaining USDollars 130m of a USDollars 240m facility provided by four Canadian banks. The cash-strapped developer has indicated that without these funds it is unable to pay interest due on CDollars 325m in bonds secured by the 72-storey First Canadian Place. It has also failed to retire about CDollars 150m in commercial paper secured by the Exchange Tower, a 36-storey building adjacent to First Canadian Place. Interest on the bonds came due last week, but under the bond covenants, O&amp;Y has various grace periods which expire tomorrow. O&amp;Y says it has made a compromise proposal to the bondholders' trustee, Royal Trust. O&amp;Y yesterday ended the second day of its fight to stave off a potentially damaging demand for Dollars 240m in the High Court in London, but no ruling was made, Reuter reports. The appeal, which is being heard in private, is over the timing of the payment owed by the group to Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. The hearing will continue today, when a ruling could be made. If O&amp;Y loses its appeal, the money becomes due immediately.</p>

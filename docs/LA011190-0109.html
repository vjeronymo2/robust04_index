			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONVICTION IN HOME-BUYING SCHEME  </P> <P> An Inglewood couple, who promised to build homes at bargain-basement prices for  low-income investors, pleaded no contest to embezzlement charges and agreed to  repay a total of $43,000 to as many as 60 would-be homeowners.  </P> <P> Seroy and Jacqueline Flowers, who formed Flowers Home Club in 1987, entered the  plea last Friday in Torrance Superior Court to six counts each of grand theft.  </P> <P> The couple, who paid half of the restitution that day, were placed on four  years' probation by Judge Cecil J. Mills and ordered to make payments of at  least $500 a month.  </P> <P> If they fail to meet that schedule, each could go to prison for up to six  years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Burke.  </P> <P> The 31-year-old Flowers and his 27-year-old wife promised to build homes for  members of the home club for no money down and about $1,000 a month, club  members said. Members of the predominantly black club said that Seroy Flowers  appealed to them by invoking the name of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and  saying: "He took you to the bottom of the mountain, but I'm going to take you  to the mountaintop."  </P> <P> Flowers Home Club members invested from a few hundred dollars to as much as  $4,000, but Flowers didn't build a single house, Inglewood police said.  </P></p>

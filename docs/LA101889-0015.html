			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICARE SURTAX  </P> <P> I am ashamed of the senior citizens who will cause the repeal of the new  Medicare act. More importantly, I am ashamed of the Democrats who caved in to  them. May they never need the 150 days per year in a nursing home at $89 per  day now covered by Medicare. Try to buy private insurance that will cover that  for $800 a year.  </P> <P> The poor in California will be covered by Medi-Cal. It will be you, the more  affluent, whose savings will be decimated by these costs.  </P> <P> CARYL WADSWORTH  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

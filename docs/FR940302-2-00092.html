In addition, the U.K. Companies Act requires that shareholders who receive only the summary report be given the opportunity, at any time, to obtain the full annual report from the company and that companies must notify shareholders annually of this right and how the report can be obtained. When the program was instituted in the U.K. in 1990, shareholders received both reports and notice of the available option with respect to future reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NYSE rule is formulated to permit foreign issuers to distribute summary annual reports consistent with the practices of their home countries. The rule does not attempt to specify particular financial requirements. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Instead, the Exchange will review specific proposals to ensure that U.S. Holders receive adequate information. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Although the new rule is formulated to accommodate the U.K.'s program, other foreign countries may adopt different practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> NYSE Letter, supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 4. The letter clarified that the Exchange does not intend to adopt the substance of the U.K. program, and that it will permit the practice of providing shareholders with an option to receive summary annual reports as opposed to full annual reports to evolve over time. The NYSE has committed to review each home country's practices to determine their sufficiency in providing information to U.S. Holders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule also does not mandate any specific method for providing U.S. Holders with summary annual reports. As with the substantive requirements, the NYSE proposal recognizes that foreign countries will develop their own procedures for issuers to provide summary reports in lieu of full annual reports. The Exchange, however, has indicated that it will review all proposed programs to ensure that U.S. Holders have reasonable access to the full annual report and receive full disclosure of their option to receive the full report. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the NYSE rule, full annual reports must still be prepared and made available to all U.S. shareholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change to permit non-U.S. issuers to distribute summary annual reports to U.S. Holders according to the home country practice of the foreign issuer is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, in that it accommodates foreign practices while ensuring that U.S. shareholders of foreign securities and holders of ADRs continue to receive adequate information concerning the companies in which they invest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the securities markets of the world become increasingly interconnected, it is inevitable that application of certain exchange rules conflict with customs and market practices in other jurisdictions. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes that the NYSE's rule reflects an appropriate balance between the need to protect U.S. investors and the costs associated with requiring non-U.S. companies to provide U.S. investors with full annual reports while the companies home country law permits summary reports to foreign investors. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed in more detail below, we believe it is appropriate, in this limited situation pursuant to the conditions set forth in NYSE Rule 103.00, to allow foreign issuers to comply with their home country practices for the distribution of annual reports to U.S. Holders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission previously has allowed the Exchange to waive or modify certain of its listing standards for foreign companies based on the laws, customs or practices of their home countries.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24634 (June 23, 1987), 52 FR 24230 (June 29, 1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

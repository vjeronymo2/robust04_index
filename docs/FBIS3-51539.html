			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Text] Several deputies have blamed President Ramiro de  Leon Carpio for the terrorist attack that took place early  yesterday morning against the Congress building.    Vinicio Villar Anleu, legislature president, has estimated  the damage at 100,000 quetzales, adding this will entail  expenses at a time when it is necessary to make efforts to get  the country ahead.    Deputy Clodoveo Dominguez has said the person directly  responsible for this situation is President de Leon Carpio, who  has made statements that apparently seek a confrontation with  the sole purpose of progressing with his referendum.    Independent Deputies Jose Carlos Acevedo and Miguel Angel  Montepeque have also blamed President de Leon Carpio for this  act of violence, because he warned in his recent statements he  was willing to take measures, which he did not specify, should  the referendum fail.    The center's Arturo Amiel has said the president is  responsible, because he is delivering statements that incite  destabilization and he is showing he is incapable of maintaining  security in the country.    Christian Democrat Enrique Guillen Funes has described  President de Leon Carpio as a spoiled child who is making  statements without thinking what the repercussions these may  have, and--what is worse-- he is setting aside his role as the  statesman he claims to be.    Congressman Francisco Reyes Lopez, from the Guatemalan  Republican Front, has expressed regret that at this time, when  we are trying to have a referendum, someone is trying to mar the  situation with threats that, as in this case, are used by any  group or sector to create unrest.    Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega has said the bomb attack is a  way of stopping and frightening Congress, and therefore the  president should determine the origin of the attack.    Representative Eduardo Matute feels this action seeks to  incite the population to rise up against Congress, and therefore  it is an outrage against Congress.    Several deputies have agreed the government's lack of  capability to guarantee the security of Guatemalans became  evident once again with the terrorist attack executed early  yesterday morning against the Legislative Palace.    The center's Mario Mazariegos has said that unfortunately  now-- when it is very close to the referendum--various sectors  are interested in creating problems, and they are taking  advantage of the situation, while the government is incapable of  implementing a security operation to guarantee Guatemalans'  lives and calmness.    Mazariegos has warned the conditions prevailing in the  country apparently seek to lead Guatemalans to chaos, with the  only purpose of marring Congress' prestige.    Independent representative Eduardo Matute has said the  attack  carried out against a group of people in an area of 18th Street,  central zone, reflects that the security forces are incapable of  guaranteeing citizens' peace and security.    Meanwhile, Juan Francisco Alfaro Mijangos, Congress third  vice president, has said: "We must admit that the lack of  experience of those who are in the government is leading the  country to chaos due to the lack of coordinated programs such as  in the case of public security." He concluded: "Consequently,  we realize we are at the mercy of any group of power or any  sector interested in creating chaos, a situation that seems to  worsen as we get closer to the referendum."    President Ramiro de Leon Carpio is leading the country to  chaos, political leader Rodolfo Rosales Garcia Salas said today  when commenting on what he described as an "unprecedented  institutional crisis."    He added that trying to solve that problem with a referendum  is what unfortunately justifies the terrorist wave, which has  caused so far only damage to shops and public buildings.    He added that even though the terrorist actions are rejected  by all--as they endanger the lives of innocent people--President  de Leon Carpio is responsible for the situation of instability,  because he does not have the qualities of a statesman for ruling.    Rosales Garcia-Salas has assured that the constitutional  reforms proposed by the president do not satisfy the people's  needs, as these reforms are the product of settlements with  deputies who have betrayed the confidence the people gave them,  he concluded.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US fires fresh shot in oilseeds subsidy war THE US yesterday aimed another shot across the European Community's bow with the announcement of new offer to sell 870,000 tonnes of subsidised vegetable oil worth Dollars 377m to 11 countries. The subsidies, under the US Export Enhancement Program, were announced by Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, one day after the US trade representative returned from Europe without a settlement on the long-running US-EC oilseeds dispute. American farmers have been suffering from depressed soyabean prices because of a large surplus by large surpluses and calls for further subsidised ales have been made by Congressmen Jim Jontz and Tim Johnson, both democrats. 'We can think of nothing that will do more to positively affect farmer income than boosting soyabean oil exports and thereby increasing the price of soybean oil,' Mr Jontz said. 'Each 1 cent per lb increase in the price of soyabean oil increases the value in the bushel of soyabeans by over 11 cents.' In making the announcement Mr Madigan complained that the EC oilseeds policy, found twice to have violated the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 'provides production subsidies which guarantee EC oilseed producers returns roughly twice the world market level.' Mr Madigan claimed that the bundling of the subsidies would help avert sales disruption and give farms and agribusiness 'greater certainty' on sales. The following countries were targeted for sales: Algeria, China, the Dominican Republic, the former Soviet Union, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Turkey. Despite progress made on the agriculture talks in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, the US and EC remain far apart in their demands for settlement of the oilseeds dispute, although an EC offer was reported to have been received. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, is due to meet at the weekend with the trade ministers of Japan, Canada and the EC. If agreement still appears elusive, she may then begin steps to impose Dollars 1bn in US sanctions on EC food and beverage products. The EC has threatened counter-retaliation.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / MTM breaches banking covenants: Speciality chemicals group may pay no dividend after two profits warnings MTM, the troubled speciality chemicals group, yesterday announced it had breached its covenants with two banking syndicates led by Standard Chartered, the Hong Kong-based bank and Chase of the US. The company, which issued two profits warnings last month, is believed to have debts of about Pounds 70m. Standard Chartered said its exposure to the company was minimal. MTM said it was finalising a standstill agreement with its bankers, for a period initially up to April 30. The syndicate leaders are understood to have agreed arrangements but are negotiating with other syndicate members. MTM's shares fell 40p to 26p. MTM's directors said they did not expect to be able to recommend payment of a final dividend for the year ended December 31. The company has also asked its auditors, BDO Binder Hamlyn, to prepare a report on the reasons and circumstances surrounding the shortfall in profits that triggered its present crisis. MTM said it was unable to give a date when its audited final-year figures, due on March 31, will be published. However, sources close to the company said they were unlikely to be revealed before the end of April. MTM's auditors refused to sign off the accounts last month after a dispute about asset values. It was the revision in asset values that caused the breach in the group's covenants with its bankers. The covenants were dependent on certain debt and assets ratios. Postern Executive Group, the corporate management specialists, has been appointed to evaluate the group's financial and operational position. It will also recommend options for MTM's future strategic development. Mr Tom Baxter, finance director, has resigned with immediate effect, said the company. Last month the company stated he would resign when the audit was complete. Yesterday it said that although the audit was unfinished, he had completed his contribution.</p>

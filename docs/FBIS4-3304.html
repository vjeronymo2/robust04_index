			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lu Hankui (7120 3352 7608)] </F>   [Text] Nanning, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Beilun He Bridge in  Dongxing, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which was  reconstructed under a Sino-Vietnamese joint venture, officially  opened to traffic on 17 April. Measuring 111 meters in length  and 10 meters in width, it is the only bridge linking the  Dongxing Development Zone in China's Guangxi with Mang Street,  Hai Ninh County, in Vietnam's Quang Ninh Province. The original  bridge (named the Beilun He Friendship Bridge) was put into  operation after its completion in 1958 and destroyed during a  bombing in 1979. Through negotiations, relevant departments  from China and Vietnam in 1992 decided to reconstruct the bridge  at the same location using the same design and at a budgeted  total investment of 1.8 million renminbi yuan shared equally by  the two sides.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NPC and CPPCC Sessions" special program] </F>   [Text] [First Announcer] Bai Lichen, deputy of the  National People's Congress and chairman of the Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Regional People's Government, talked about the  influence of nationalities' religions over unity among  nationalities in the light of Ningxia's characteristics. He  said to reporter (Lian Jun):    [Begin recording] The Hui nationality has a population of  1.6 million in Ningxia, which is China's region where the Hui  nationality lives in most compact communities. Due to various  historical and geological reasons, the major areas where the Hui  nationlity lives in compact communities have two  characteristics: First, they are comparatively backward in  general education and economically underdeveloped. At present,  many people still live in poverty. Second, religions exert a  comparatively great influence here. Contradictions between  different religious sects and within a religious sect itself  have occurred from time to time. Therefore, we have attached  great importance to the nationalities and religious issues for a  long time; we have conscientiously implemented the party's  policies on nationalities and religion, as well as the law on  autonomy in regions inhabited by minority nationalities; we have  vigorously selected and promoted various trained personnel of  minority nationalities; and we have enabled them to play an  important role at their respective posts. Practice has made us  realize that unity among nationalities and among different  religions in areas inhabited by minority nationalities is very  important. It has a direct bearing on social stability and on  economic development. We must always pay attention to properly  handling the relationships among unity, stability, and  devleopment. [end recording]    [Second Announcer] (Wan Ling), it seems that facing the  facts, admitting the gap, strengthening unity, and deepening  reform to turn the strong points in natural resources to  economic strong points have become a consensus on reform reached  by all the deputies from the regions inhabited by minority  nationalities.    [First Announcer] You are right. We believe China's vast  expanse of regions inhabited by minority nationalities will have  a brighter future and will surely usher in an era of economic  achievements through the joint efforts by the people of all  nationalities in the regions inhabited by minority nationalities.</p>

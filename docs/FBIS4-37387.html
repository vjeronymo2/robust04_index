			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  has announced that efforts and contacts to conclude a lasting  cease-fire in Yemen are continuing. He pointed out that he had  met with the UN secretary general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to  discuss this issue and added that the contacts that Egypt is  conducting seek a cease-fire agreement.    The foreign minister continued: "We have not lost hope of  reaching a cease-fire agreement."    He said that the Yemeni issue is "complicated and requires  great efforts."    Musa added that a big gap still separates the positions of  the warring Yemeni parties and there are several reasons that  still preclude an agreement. He said this requires further  efforts by Egypt and the United Nations to reach a solution.    Musa said he hopes the fighting in Yemen will not escalate  in  such a way as to harm the prospects of "achieving a breakthrough  rather than complicating the matter further".    Noting the need to protect the Yemeni citizens in various  towns, he said current efforts are concentrating on ending the  fighting, and Egypt is contacting the United Nations and other  parties for this purpose.</p>

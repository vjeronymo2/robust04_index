			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (London Markets): The empty rituals of a bygone age EIGHTEENTH century travellers to the great sites of vanished European civilisations often found, among the shattered wreckage of once-mighty edifices, groups of superstitious peasants living a miserable subsistence life. Just like the London stock market, really. Its members, eking out a hand-to-mouth living, cannot but recall the vanished rituals of their hour of glory, the great bull market of the 1980s. One such bygone ritual, in evidence this week, comes under the general heading of the worship of strange gods; in this case, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. When the Dow rises, as it did for much of the week, the London adherents of this belief are disposed to push up the local market too. A second relic is the belief that a wave of takeover bids is about to engulf the major stocks, pushing them to 30, 50 or 100 per cent premiums over their current valuations, and funnelling a torrent of cash into institutional coffers. Thus enriched, fund managers will seek to restore their equity portfolios, bidding prices up yet again. The news, over the weekend, that the two top men at Allied-Lyons would be stepping down in the wake of the company's disastrous losses on foreign currency speculation put that company 'in play' - to use the jargon of the vanished past - as a potential takeover target. And, for a few days at least, hopes abounded of a bid not merely for Allied-Lyons but for every company in the FT-SE about which a half-decent story could be told. Allied-Lyons shares certainly benefited: the stock rose from 520p at the end of last week to close at 552p on Friday, up 32p. Separately, each of these two rituals has a strong fantasy element. Together, they form a mixture which, for a while at any rate, is capable of reawakening memories of the good old days - if not of the 1980s themselves, then at least of the Disneyland version that occurred earlier this year. The knee-jerk reaction to the Dow is not entirely irrational, of course. If the Dow is rising because US interest rates are being pushed down, then the expectation that the US economy is set for economic recovery will make the shares of UK companies with heavy dependence on the transatlantic market more attractive. But a crude unweighted index of 10 companies with particularly heavy US exposure - the drug companies, BTR, Hanson, Reuters, that sort of thing - has outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share by little more than 1 per cent. The effect has been distorted by the exceptionally strong performance by Wellcome after its results on Thursday. Buoyed up by a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to March 2, and a sharp leap in operating margins, the share price rose 63p on the day, to close at 582p. On Friday, the shares rose again, closing the week at 592p, up 76p or nearly 15 per cent. Without the Wellcome effect, the US-exposed stocks would have performed roughly in line with the market as a whole - which argues that London's reaction to the Dow's move this week has been essentially one of sympathy rather than calculation. An eighteenth-century traveller would have had no difficulty in identifying this empty ritual. The 1990s have their own rituals, of course, some of which were in evidence this week. Chairmen of underperforming companies, once lying wakeful in the early mornings for the sound of a dawn raid, must now listen nervously for the postman's tread. This week he carried what was both literally and figuratively a 'Dear John' letter for Mr John Fletcher, chairman of Budgens, the grocery chain. On Monday, the message for Mr Fletcher was that institutional shareholders, including IEP Securities, Electra and Gartmore, wanted him out. By Wednesday, Mr Fletcher was on his way, paying the price for a drop in the share price from a peak of 252p in 1987 to 45p at Tuesday's close. The stock ended the week at 40p. By Friday, the habit had spread. Tace, the engineering group, was facing a similar institutional revolt, this time led by Norwich Union. Fund managers have clearly decided that - in the absence of a posse of corporate raiders to replace underperforming managements - they will do the job themselves. Another new ritual of the 1990s is the habit of companies of announcing job reductions and rights issues simultaneously, perhaps to offset the inherently teenagerish nature of a plea for more cash ('I spent what you gave me, and now I need some more.') Whatever the reason, The trend was joined this week by T&amp;N, once better known as Turner &amp; Newall, which announced that it was cutting 2,500 jobs and asking for Pounds 119m from shareholders. Perhaps because the City remembers with affection the money it made on T&amp;N as a turnaround stock in the 1980s, or perhaps because the company is not in the construction business, the rights issue was received without too many shrieks. The shares closed the week at 163p, down 13p. Another rights issue came from Bank of Scotland. So firmly does the investment community hold to its faith that this is Britain's best-managed bank that even the revelation that it had been lending money to some all-too-feckless Sassenachs failed to dent the enthusiasm with which the request for Pounds 194m was received. By Friday, the shares were up 2p on the week, closing at 137p. After the Conservative party's poor performance in the Thursday's local elections, the market ended the week on a hesitant note, with the FT-SE closing at 2,522.7, up 51.4 since the previous Friday. Perhaps just as important as the political news, however, was the imminent ritual of the in-lieu-of-May-Day bank holiday, its origins now lost in the mists of time. How long ago that all seems] Something to do with a chap called Ozymandias, wasn't it?</p>

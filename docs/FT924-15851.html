			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Schlesinger caught out by desire to have the last word DOGGEDNESS and attention to detail stand out among the characteristics which, during a 40-year career, have made Mr Helmut Schlesinger a successful central banker. Both traits have come to the fore with a vengeance in the document at the centre of the latest Anglo-German row - and both seem, for the moment at least, to have rebounded against him. Mr Schlesinger, 68, is a courtly man with more than a touch of Bavarian charm. But he has a habitual liking - which some colleagues on the decision-making Bundesbank council can find irritating - for having the last word. During the last fortnight, the normally unflappable Mr Schlesinger has been enraged by attacks from Britain both on the Bundesbank's interest rate policies and - still worse - on his own integrity. He has been especially hurt by recent articles in British tabloid newspapers linking the Bundesbank to Germany's Nazi past. The four-page statement on 'reproaches made by some members of the British government' was his attempt to hit back. Unfortunately for him, Mr Schlesinger's perhaps justified righteous indignation over the events of the last two weeks has now been drowned in the greater tumult engendered by the new affair. Seldom can an attempt to put the record straight have produced such a twisted result. Mr Schlesinger is certainly no conspirator. When he tries to persuade recalcitrant Bundesbank council members of the merits of a policy they find unconvincing, his obvious lack of Machiavellian instincts can border on haplessness. 'Too honest for his own good' was one description after the controversial interview with Handelsblatt, the German financial daily, which the UK government charges helped prompt sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. A man with a somewhat unworldly lack of understanding for the way that journalists work, he has tried to use the press to protect his well-founded reputation for straightforwardness, decency and prudence. Yet he has somehow managed to end up in the dock appearing to be not only a weaver of intrigue but an unsuccessful one to boot. In the Bundesbank, Mr Schlesinger's reputation for homespun scholarliness is wiswspread. He has never become familiar with word processors, and writes out articles and speeches long-hand with a pen. His stamina is prodigious. On the evening of the Bundesbank's landmark cut in its Lombard rate on September 14, Mr Schlesinger travelled to Kiel in north German to deliver an exhaustive 23-page speech, replete with footnotes, on 'progress in European monetary integration' - which gave the most thorough theoretical explanation to date of why the Bundesbank was seeking a devaluation of weaker currencies in the EMS. Nothing in Mr Schlesinger's career prepared him for the peculiar challenges he has faced since he unexpectedly took over the Bundesbank presidency last August. The task of steering Germany through the reunification shoals, while at the same time trying to keep the country on track for the politically necessary goal of European integration, has been much tougher than imagined. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Mr Schlesinger's predecessor, who quit in full knowledge of the sizeable problems bequeathed to his former deputy, has considerably more experience in negotiating political quicksands. The more flexible Mr Pohl, a former journalist, would probably have handled the vicissitudes of the past few months matters with greater aplomb, according to officials who know both men well. Although also sensitive to criticism, Mr Pohl would probably have shrugged off the latest barbs, knowing that action to blunt them would have prolonged the pain. Even the astute Mr Pohl, however, owed his downfall ultimately to his failure to find a modus vivendi with Chancellor Helmut Kohl over the financing of German unity. Far more than a consequence of any personal failing, Mr Schlesinger's setback is clearly a result, above all, of the extraordinary pressures which go with the job. At today's Bundesbank press conference in Schwerin, northern Germany, Mr Schlesinger will have a further chance to set the record straight. September has been one of the toughest months of his life. Although some associates say the pressure he has faced might make him consider resignation, the most likely outcome is that Mr Schlesinger will soldier on until his planned departure next summer. The risk, for him, is that the evident toughness of the Bundesbank's uphill struggle will, by then, leave Mr Schlesinger looking not so much dogged as simply worn out.</p>

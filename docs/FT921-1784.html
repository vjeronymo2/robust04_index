			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Iranian oil monopoly faces break-up THE NATIONAL Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the state oil group, is to lose its monopoly over the country's oil industry after a critical internal review conducted by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, according to a reliable industry newsletter published today. Iran's eight refineries are to be spun off as separate commercial units from NIOC, leaving the latter to concentrate on oil exploration, production and marketing, an article in Petroleum Argus says. The report also suggests that the future of Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh as oil minister has been thrown into some doubt and will remain so until after Iran's elections on April 10. The internal review into NIOC, which has held a monopoly over all Iran's oil operations since 1973, followed strong criticism of the state company late last year for failing to meet domestic demand for kerosine. The company has also been criticised for not maximising foreign exchange revenues from crude export sales and for failing to hedge properly against last year's volatile oil prices. The article highlights a costly policy of placing 40m barrels of its 2.4m b/d crude oil exports into floating storage last year, which twice helped push down the value of Iranian crude while accruing heavy charges for the storage vessels. Petroleum Argus estimates that 'setbacks in crude marketing' last year cost Iran Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) - a quarter of the average annual income generated by NIOC, itself 90 per cent of the country's foreign exchange earnings. The decision to break up NIOC control over refining will open the way for private Iranian companies to take a bigger role in the country's petroleum products export business. However, the article says that NIOC will regain control of the National Iranian Offshore Company and National Iranian Tanker Company.</p>

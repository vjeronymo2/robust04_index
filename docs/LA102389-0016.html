			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRAUD SUIT PARALLELS U.S. PROBE OF ATTORNEYS;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: LAWYERS ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING TO FATTEN THEIR FEES FACE BOTH A  PRIVATE LAWSUIT AND A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.  </P> <P> Allegations of fraud and racketeering in a lawsuit scheduled for trial next  week in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles mirror those in a federal criminal  investigation of lawyers purportedly involved in an elaborate insurance fraud.  </P> <P> Insurance giant USF &amp; G is accusing the main defendant in the civil case,  attorney Lynn Boyd Stites, 44, of conspiring to prolong and expand litigation  in order to collect legal fees from insurers -- to the point of trying to  prevent the dismissal of a suit against an Orange County business insured by  USF &amp; G. USF &amp; G is seeking $6 million in damages.  </P> <P> Stites, who lives in Bell Canyon in eastern Ventura County, could not be  reached for comment, but his lawyers have contended in court papers that his  "litigation activities were altogether proper."  </P> <P> USF &amp; G's claims against Stites echo allegations being pursued by federal  authorities in San Diego, who are investigating an alleged insurance billing  scheme involving a network of lawyers, mostly from the San Fernando Valley,  West Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Although Stites has not been charged there, prosecutors say he masterminded a  scheme in which attorneys conspired to lengthen litigation and fatten their  fees through various legal maneuvers, such as filing spurious suits against one  anothers' clients to increase defense fees, and paying kickbacks to clients for  the right to defend them at the expense of insurance companies.  </P> <P> With the civil trial scheduled to begin Oct. 31, the criminal investigation is  casting a long shadow on the USF &amp; G case. Some unusual effects have  resulted:  </P> <P> * In the USF &amp; G case, more than a dozen potential witnesses, most of them  lawyers, refused to answer questions in pretrial depositions, invoking their  Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Many of those who took  the Fifth are targets of the criminal investigation in San Diego, including  Stites and his defense lawyers, Alan I. Arnold of Woodland Hills and Gregory S.  Bodell of West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> * Stites' lawyers sought to use the depositions as a window on the activities  of the criminal investigators -- spying on those who had spied on the lawyers.  They recently took depositions of three men who had no involvement in the  Stites-USF &amp; G dispute but who had worked undercover with federal  authorities, secretly recording conversations with Stites, Arnold and other  targets of the probe.  </P> <P> The three -- San Diego attorney Leonard Radomile and two of Radomile's clients,  businessmen John Naslund and Wayne Watson -- were questioned by Stites' lawyers  about which conversations they taped and where they concealed their recording  devices.  </P> <P> * Earlier this month, U. S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp ruled one defendant,  Stites Professional Law Corp., in default because Lynn Stites, citing the Fifth  Amendment, refused to turn over tax returns and other records sought by USF  &amp; G. The default means that the law corporation could be liable for damages  to USF &amp; G even if Stites and the other defendants are exonerated in the  trial.  </P> <P> * This summer, the U. S. attorney's office in San Diego filed court papers in  the USF &amp; G case seeking to delay the deposition of a potential witness who  may also testify in the criminal case. The delay, which was denied, was sought  "to prevent interference with the criminal proceedings," the government said.  Stites' lawyers also asked that the civil trial be delayed until the "almost  identical criminal proceeding in San Diego" is completed, but Hupp refused.  </P> <P> It was 10 years ago this month that a suspicious jewelry theft gave birth to  the dispute in the USF &amp; G case.  </P> <P> The supposed victims of the $2-million theft were Robert A. and Tiare Ogle,  operators of Newport Galleries, a jewelry business in Newport Beach. The Ogles  had taken jewelry on consignment to sell in Saudi Arabia. In October, 1979,  after buying $2 million in insurance from Lloyds of London to cover the trip,  they set off for Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> On the way, the Ogles stopped at the Cockatoo Inn in Hawthorne for a farewell  dinner with friends. As they were leaving the building, witnesses said, armed  robbers accosted them and took the jewels.  </P> <P> But Robert Ogle had an extensive police record, and police and Lloyds of London  -- after examining such things as the Ogles' deficient travel documents and  their history of being robbed of insured jewels -- concluded that the robbery  was a hoax. No criminal charges were filed against the Ogles in the incident.  </P> <P> In one of a dozen lawsuits filed against Newport Galleries and the Ogles by  those who lost their jewels, an Orange County Superior Court judge agreed. "The  entire trip to Saudi Arabia was a sham," Judge Robert J. Polis wrote. "It never  could have happened as planned and was never intended to occur. The robbery was  staged and probably nothing of value was stolen."  </P> <P> Newport Galleries had a general liability policy with USF &amp; G that did not  cover theft. But the insurance company agreed to pay for the legal defense of  Newport Galleries and the Ogles pending a court determination of its duties  under the policy.  </P> <P> To represent Newport Galleries and themselves, the Ogles hired Stites and  several of his associates, who were paid about $400,000 by USF &amp; G, court  records show.  </P> <P> One of the lawsuits was brought by owners of a $17,000 diamond bracelet. Their  lawyer was Paul Mast, a former Orange County Municipal Court judge. Run ragged  by the defense team, Mast in 1983 made a written offer to drop the suit, which  was proving too costly to pursue considering the size of his clients' loss.  </P> <P> But victory was not what Stites had in mind, Mast said later. On July 20, 1983,  over lunch at the Velvet Turtle in Long Beach, Stites and West Los Angeles  lawyer William Conkle, a former Stites partner who represented the Ogles,  proposed that Mast keep the suit alive.  </P> <P> Mast later testified in a deposition that he told Stites and Conkle "that they  had worn me down" and "that we were willing to give up and just get out of the  case."  </P> <P> But Mast said his hosts "informed me that the defense of the action was now  being paid for by USF &amp; G, an insurance company," that "never questioned  the bill." They wanted the case to go to trial, "and they were going to do  everything they possibly could to make the trial last as long as possible,"  Mast said.  </P> <P> At the time of the lunch, USF &amp; G seemed on the verge of winning a court  ruling that it had no duty to defend Newport Galleries and the Ogles. But  according to Mast, Stites had a plan to keep the insurer on the hook.  </P> <P> Mast said his hosts described the following scenario: Instead of dropping the  suit, Mast would amend it to claim that his clients had suffered emotional  distress and other damages covered by the USF &amp; G policy. Stites would help  by reviewing and rewriting the amended complaint before Mast filed it to make  certain that it fit within insurance coverage. The case would proceed to trial,  Mast would be allowed to win, and USF &amp; G would probably refuse to pay the  judgment. Both sides then would hit the insurer with bad-faith suits. "And . .  . in those lawsuits we would be able to clean up against USF &amp; G," Mast  said.  </P> <P> The "purpose of the lunch was to solicit me to engage in a conspiracy to  defraud USF &amp; G by continuing the lawsuit for the purpose of building up  attorneys' fees . . . and . . . to set USF &amp; G up for a bad-faith lawsuit  that, in the words of Mr. Conkle and Mr. Stites, we would all derive an  extremely large amount of money from," Mast testified in the deposition.  </P> <P> Following the meeting, Mast went back to his office and wrote his clients a  letter to tell them what had transpired.  </P> <P> Later in 1983, a judge ruled that USF &amp; G had no duty to defend Newport  Galleries and the Ogles. USF &amp; G asked Stites to submit any unpaid bills.  Stites suddenly produced bills for another $350,000, which the firm refused to  pay when the bills were not substantiated, according to USF &amp; G.  </P> <P> In 1985, Stites sued USF &amp; G over the unpaid bills. It was in that suit,  which was later dismissed, that Mast gave his explosive account of the lunch.  </P> <P> The following year, USF &amp; G filed the fraud suit against Stites, Conkle and  other lawyers involved in defending Newport Galleries and the Ogles. Some of  the defendants were later dismissed, including Conkle, who reached an  undisclosed settlement with USF &amp; G.  </P> <P> In a sworn declaration, Stites acknowledged having lunch with Mast but said  Mast's "contentions as to what occurred at that meeting are untrue."  </P> <P> But aside from Mast, three other lawyers who sued Newport Galleries on behalf  of jewelry owners said they were advised by either Conkle or Stites to amend  their complaints to add claims of emotional distress. None of the lawyers  amended the suits.  </P> <P> In court papers, Stites said it is worth noting that four lawyers maintained  that they were approached "to amend their pleadings; . . . none of them did  so."  </P> <P> So even if such an attempt ever occurred -- which it did not, the court papers  said -- USF &amp; G would have suffered no damages as a result, Stites said.  </P> <P> In a recent pretrial conference, lawyers for USF &amp; G said they will also  present evidence about other cases in which a "Stites Network" of lawyers  joined to "defraud various insurance companies" by billing "excessive,  unnecessary and fraudulent attorneys' fees for their own illicit gain."  </P> <P> The language is strikingly similar to that used by federal authorities in San  Diego to describe the criminal probe, which has targeted about 30 lawyers and  associates of lawyers.  </P> <P> In court papers filed in the USF &amp; G case, Assistant U. S. Atty. George D.  Hardy, who is heading the San Diego inquiry, said the criminal investigation  involves "a network of lawyers and associates . . . who have systematically and  with great deliberation" inserted themselves in complex cases to generate big  bills. "The total potential loss has been alleged to be between $50 million and  $200 million."  </P> <P> Stites hit back at Hardy in pleadings filed in the USF &amp; G case, dismissing  him as "the former insurance industry counsel" -- a reference to Hardy's prior  work at a private law firm that had insurance clients.  </P> <P> Hardy said indictments in the criminal case are expected before the end of the  year.  </P> <P> The criminal investigation began in Los Angeles in 1987 but shifted to San  Diego late last year. Since then, one lawyer and two employees of targeted law  firms have pleaded guilty to mail fraud charges and have agreed to assist  federal authorities.  </P> <P> The most recent conviction came last week when Studio City lawyer Marc I. Kent,  40, pleaded guilty to two mail fraud counts and agreed to surrender his license  to practice law.  </P> <P> During that appearance in federal court in San Diego, Kent, a Granada Hills  resident, said Stites brought him into the scheme about 1984. He said that  Stites sent insured clients to him and other attorneys, that the attorneys  would file counterclaims against one another's clients to generate more defense  fees, and that they would kick back part of their insurance billings to Stites.  </P></p>

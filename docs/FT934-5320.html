			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bowater plans workforce cuts and property sales Bowater, the US forest products group, is to reduce its workforce by about 7 per cent and sell some 70,000 acres of 'non-strategic' land to help cut costs. Over the past two years, the company has suffered from a sharp decline in the price of newsprint, which accounts for about 37 per cent of its income. The move will result in a net gain of Dollars 42m in the fourth quarter, with a Dollars 10m pre-tax charge for workforce reduction offset by Dollars 52m in net proceeds from the sale of property in four southern US states. The company owns or leases about 1.8m acres of timber land. In the final three months of last year, Bowater posted a net loss of Dollars 20.9m, or 59 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 398.9m. Analysts have forecast a small profit in the current quarter, and a loss of about Dollars 1 a share for the full year. The company said it would save about Dollars 20m a year after shedding about 450 jobs by the end of 1994. The reductions are to be spread throughout its North American operations. On Wall Street, the stock closed Dollars 1/8 higher at Dollars 20 1/8.</p>

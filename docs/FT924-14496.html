			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae profits crack record again THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 412.9m, the 19th consecutive record-breaking quarter for the company, the largest mortgage provider in the US. Fannie Mae's latest result beat the record of Dollars 402m in the second quarter, and easily outdistanced the Dollars 350.7m earned at the same stage of 1991. Mr James Johnson, chairman, said the performance was fuelled by strong growth in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issuance, which totalled Dollars 41.3bn, and record fees from sales of Remics (real estate mortgage investment conduits), which helped offset a decline in net interest income from Dollars 518.2m to Dollars 506.9m. Fannie Mae's net interest margin fell in the quarter from 139 basis points to 133 basis points. Provisions for losses were Dollars 80m in the quarter, the same as the previous period, taking total provisions to Dollars 765.8m. In response, its shares rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in New York. The Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) yesterday reported a 15 per cent improvement in third-quarter profits to Dollars 100m, or Dollars 1.08 a share. The strong profits performance sent Sallie Mae shares Dollars 1 1/2 higher to Dollars 70 1/2 .</p>

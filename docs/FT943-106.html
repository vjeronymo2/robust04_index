			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: NSW State Bank sale agreed The State Bank of New South Wales, the fifth largest bank in Australia, is to be sold to Colonial Mutual, the Melbourne-based insurance group, for ADollars 576.5m (USDollars 426.75m). The sale was formally announced yesterday by the New South Wales government, which first released plans to privatise the bank by way of a trade sale last year. The identity of the buyer, however, comes as no surprise as all the potential bidders withdrew except Colonial Mutual. When the sale process was initiated last November, NSW Treasury estimates put the price at between ADollars 400m and ADollars 700m, although some analysts suggested figures closer to ADollars 1bn. Yesterday, the NSW Treasury denied that it had received a fire-sale price for the bank, saying that the sum 'reflects the future prospects of the bank'. It also said that Colonial Mutual had undertaken to make a capital injection of ADollars 350m into the bank at the end of four years. The deal also includes a restriction that the bank cannot be sold to any of Australia's four big banking groups within three years. In addition, it is required that the bank's headquarters remain in Sydney for at least five years, while the number of branches - currently 293 - cannot fall below 260 for three years. Colonial Mutual must pay ADollars 526.5m by January, with the remainder due over a three-year period. Shortly after the sale was announced, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, placed its AA- claims paying rating of Colonial Mutual on creditwatch, with negative implications. It said that the acquisition was not expected to substantially weaken the insurer's financial profile, but that the creditwatch reflected the fact that funding and ownership structure had yet to be finalised. S&amp;P affirmed SBNSW's ratings, on the basis of the new state guarantee covering all funding liabilities and associated off-balance sheet liabilities for not less than three years.</p>

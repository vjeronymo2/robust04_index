			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Kenyan tea yield helps Finlay rise to Pounds 13.8m A higher yield from its Kenyan tea plantations helped James Finlay, the overseas trading and financial services group, to lift profits by more than 36 per cent last year. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 13.8m on turnover of Pounds 184.4m, up from a previous Pounds 165.2m. Mr Richard Capper, deputy chairman, said that the group's tea production in Kenya last year was 22.3m kg following good weather conditions in the early months of last year and improvements in husbandry. This was a marked improvement on 1991 and 1992, when production amounted to 20m kg. The increase was behind a rise in operating profits from plantations from Pounds 8.78m to Pounds 11.3m. The trading, manufacturing and merchanting activities trebled operating profits from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 3.33m on the back of increased activity in the tea trade. Operating profits in the confectionery and beverage manufacturing division, which makes Paynes Poppets and supplies all Sainsbury's own label tea and coffee, were down slightly at Pounds 3.94m, compared with a previous Pounds 4.21m. Mr Capper attributed the decline to the difficult UK market for confectionery, and the costs of a TV advertising campaign for Poppets. The merchant banking and international trade confirming division moved from a loss of Pounds 436,000 to a profit of Pounds 447,000. The oil and gas activities in North America fell into the red to the tune of Pounds 2.55m, compared with a previous profit of Pounds 310,000, mainly as a result of lower prices and increased depreciation charges. The tax charge rose from 52.8 per cent to 62.2 per cent, reflecting the losses in the US, for which there is no relief, and currency losses in Kenya, where the tax rate is higher than the UK. Earnings per share were up from 4.7p to 5p. An unchanged second interim dividend of 2.15p maintains the total for the year at 4.15p.</p>

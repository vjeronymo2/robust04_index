			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kangar, Sat -- Perlis has been hit by cholera and  health teams are taking every possible measure to prevent the  disease from spreading.    State medical and health services director Dr. Faisal  Ibrahim  said today that 10 patients who tested positive for cholera and  a carrier had been detected since the first case was reported on  April 6.    The victims, aged between seven months and 70 years, are  mostly living in housing areas and were found to have consumed  food bought from stalls.    The state cholera operations room has been opened to monitor  developments.    Dr. Faisal said health officers were carrying out  preventative activities, especially among food hawkers and  handlers in Kangar, Kuala Perlis and Arau since investigations  revealed that all the victims had consumed food obtained from  sources outside their homes.

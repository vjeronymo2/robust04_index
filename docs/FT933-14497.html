			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television We should not, I suppose, allow the dreadful mateyness of the title of BBC1's new series, Doc Martin's Casebook to put us off, though when it becomes clear that the subject of this opening programme is snoring it is hard to avoid the feeling that we are in for yet another example of tabloid television. Dr Hughes is a Cambridge GP who has been dishing out advice on local radio for the past eight years, and Tom Moffatt is the man who has always snored but who used to work shifts. Now he has been retired, and is driving his wife and family crazy (7.30). Golf And All Its Glory is described as both a showcase for golf and a celebration. Great players talk about the game and archives are used to investigate the origins of the sport (7.40 BBC2). There is nothing wrong with good television programmes being repeated; indeed television should have a repertory element. But BBC2's series of The Wednesday Play may serve to highlight the paucity in single drama today. The season begins (9.00) with 'Up The Junction', written by Nell Dunn and directed by Ken Loach.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): A fresh use for discarded policies - Poor cash-in values have prompted the launch of a novel investment trust / What's new? REFINEMENT, rather than innovation, has been the main characteristic of investments launched lately, with managers seeking to reassure still-cautious investors of the tried and tested aspects of what is on offer. The flow of new savings vehicles was inhibited by the impending arrival on the market of National Savings' First Option bond (see page 7 of this Review). Forewarned in the Budget of this unspecified competition to come 'in the summer', building societies planned to retaliate once details were announced, shying away from the idea of a pre-emptive strike at savers' money. Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust, due to begin dealing next week, is an investment trust that aims to feed on the success of the secondary market that has developed in second-hand insurance policies as a result of the poor cash-in values offered by insurance companies. Estimates suggest that, in the past five years, the number of people choosing to sell their insurance policies, either at auction or to a specialist marketmaker, rather than accept the insurance company's surrender value, has risen from less than 100 a year to nearly 8,500, worth around Pounds 50m. A policyholder can make between 15 and 30 per cent more from a sale than from cashing in with the insurance company, though sales commissions can absorb up to one-third of this difference. The policies, with-profits endowments, are bought by investors as high-return investments. However, projected returns of 14 per cent and above are usually based on the assumption that insurance companies will continue to increase bonuses attaching to policies, whereas many have been making cuts in the past year. Kleinwort says the trust will buy policies direct from individuals, so avoiding sales commissions. Assuming unchanged bonus rates over the 11-year life of the trust, the gross yield at the issue price would be 12.7 per cent. But the management charge is high and calculated in an unusual way. Set at 0.5 per cent plus VAT, it is based not on net asset value but on the original amount raised. The charge is also to be indexed to the RPI. Save &amp; Prosper has modelled its Capital Portfolio unit trust on private-client portfolios already run for some years by Fleming Private Asset Management, the stockbroking subsidiary of S&amp;P's parent Robert Fleming group. Investments are to be limited to between 20 and 25 well known blue-chip shares, reflecting the group's experience that investors like to have a clear idea of where their money is going. For the same reason, Save &amp; Prosper plans to hold an annual meeting, at which the investment manager of Capital Portfolio, Graham Ball, will explain his strategy and selection of stocks. 'Investors will be able to whinge if they are not happy,' said an S&amp;P spokesman. Charges on the Capital Portfolio unit trust are an initial 5 1/2 per cent and an annual 1 1/4 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. Stockbrokers Foster &amp; Braithwaite have launched a personal pension plan based on a Provident Life policy and a choice of three unit-linked funds: cash, managed and managed investment trust. In a seeming contradiction, the firm claims that its plan gives both investors and investment salesmen a better deal than the usual pension policy. This is because initial commission is lower but continuing charges are higher. Instead of swallowing 100 per cent of the first year's premiums, as is common with pension plans, commission and charges on the Foster &amp; Braithwaite plan account for 22 per cent. As there is no bid-offer spread on the units, the remaining 78 per cent is fully invested. However, there is a continuing annual charge of 2 per cent on regular premium policies, plus a policy charge, currently Pounds 48 a year but to be increased annually in line with the National Earnings Index, which usually outstrips the Retail Prices Index. Eurotrust, launched by Henderson, is a split-capital investment trust with 25 per cent zero-coupon preference shares and 75 per cent ordinary shares. Defining Europe as including Britain, the trust will initially be invested 12 per cent in the UK, 23 per cent in France, 14 per cent in Germany and 16 per cent in the Netherlands. Although the past is not a guide to the future, Henderson's record of investment in Europe, as reflected in the performance of two of its unit trusts, has not been brilliant. According to Finstat, Henderson European trust ranked 53rd out of 85 unit trusts in the European sector over five years and 87th out of 124 over one year. Henderson European Smaller Companies ranked 78th out of 85 over five years and 85th out of 124 over one year. Henderson European Income performed more creditably, ranking 11th out of 85 over five years and 22nd out of 124 over one year. BNP Mortgages, a subsidiary of Banque Nationale de Paris, has launched a loan aimed at people who are finding it difficult to sell inherited property. Lending up to 75 per cent of the valuation, with a maximum of Pounds 150,000, for a term of between five and 45 years, BNP says it will agree to letting of the property on a fixed-term assured tenancy or corporate let basis, but only if its solicitors approve the letting agreement, which must run for at least six months.</p>

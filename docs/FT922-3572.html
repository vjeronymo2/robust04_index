			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Equity Issues: Emerging markets sustain flow of offerings LATIN America and Asia continue to provide a steady flow of international equity offerings for emerging market investors. Banacci, one of the largest financial services holding companies in Mexico, is launching a Dollars 1.5bn global offering, consisting of a Dollars 450m international tranche, an Dollars 800m US tranche and a Dollars 200m domestic offering. Banacci's holdings include Banamex, the bank, and Accival, a leading brokerage. Goldman Sachs is the lead-manager for the primary offering. The Asian issues include a Dollars 90m global depositary share (GDS) offering for Grasim, the Indian cement, textiles and fibre group, and a Dollars 60m GDS offering for Asia Cement, a Taiwanese group. Citicorp and Merrill Lynch are joint lead-managers for the Grasim offering which comes close on the heels of a Dollars 100m international equity offering from Reliance, the Indian petrochemicals company. Although the Indian stock market has been rocked by a financial scandal, the Reliance offering was considered a success and the response to the Grasim issue so far has been 'reasonable,' according to a banker involved in the deal. The Dollars 60m issue from Taiwan's Asia Cement is expected to appeal to Asian funds in Hong Kong, London and New York. Asia Cement is the second Taiwanese company to launch a GDS offering, following the large issue from China Steel last month. Norges Kommunalbank, the Norwegian state-owned municipal financier, plans to issue a four-year NKr500m bond backed by the Kingdom of Norway, Reuter reports from Oslo. Bids open on June 15. It it is to be an open bullet loan maturing in April 1996.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Our special envoy, Joachin Yao Ouattara, reports  on the French-Ivorian military maneuvers taking place in our  country.    [Begin recording] [Ouattara] The only way to make an Army  combat-ready is to test it regularly on the field. For this  reason, Ivorian troops and units of the French Army have been  carrying out military maneuvers. The operation, codenamed Nzi  94, has a number of objectives: It is one of many  implementations of the defense accord linking Cote d'Ivoire to  France since the dawn of our independence; it is also to train  the general staffs in the joint preparation and conduct of  operations; and finally, it gives the troops a chance to operate  together and to organize the implementation of a unified  French-Ivorian command for operations in time of need.    For these military exercises of national importance, after a  10-year hiatus, the chief of defense staff of the Armed Forces  of Cote d'Ivoire [FANCI], General Robert Guei, has set very  precise goals for his men: to train the general staff to  function within a tactical framework; to test the aptitude of  military units to rural life and parachuting operations; and to  utilize the know-how of signal officers to integrate them in the  inter-allies command structure and maneuver network.    On the first day, we witnessed the parachute operation  undertaken together by Ivorian and French parachutists. This  operation took place under very good conditions.    [Guei] I am happy that everything went smoothly. Our French  brothers-in-arms have just had a 10-hour flight and joined in  the thick of the operations. You have witnessed the  demonstrations. They were very well equipped; the French command  was keen to put them in extremely difficult conditions. In the  battlefield, nothing is left to chance, and when you leave  things to chance the enemy will not spare you. This is why they  have come fully prepared. I wish you all the best.    [Unidentified French commander] The parachute operation we  have watched, undertaken by French and Ivorian parachutists, was  carried out under very good operational conditions; and I am  talking as a former commander of the 11th Parachute Division.  These were difficult conditions because the terrain is not easy  and it is hot, but this enables us to test our joint capacity  for a common engagement. And I think that is what is important.  For me, the operation has been positive. [passage omitted]    [Ouattara] The crossing of the Zambaco bridge enabled the  battalion of the Bouake Engineers Regiment to test its light  crossing equipment. Their performance no longer requires any  further demonstration.    The naval exercise took place on the Rhin, a French TSM  mobile support vessel, originally intended to maintain the  different units of the French fleet in operational condition.  The Rhin was built on 24 April 1961, launched on 17 March 1962,  and has been in service since 1 March 1964. It has a crew of 11  officers and 67 naval officers. During the exercise, three  French Mirage F-16 planes, shot at a floating object which was  pulling along behind the Rhin. Between an Ivorian patrol boat,  the Elephant of the Ivorian Navy, and the Rhin, shooting  exercises and mail transfer took place.    During air support and tactical exercises, which Defense  Minister Leon Konan Koffi witnessed, troops engaged in mock  confrotations and war games. [passage omitted]    [Koffi] We are here to witness the confrontation between  enemy troops and our soldiers and we have seen that despite a  few technical radio problems the operation was carried out under  very good conditions. Our forces succeeded in dislodging the  enemy forces. I am happy to have witnessed this operation.    [Ouattara] There was a big surprise at the end of this  maneuver. On behalf of the Higher Council of the FANCI, General  Robert Guei, the chief of staff, conferred on Minister of  Defense Leon Konan Koffi the rank of honorary sub-lieutenant for  his services to the nation.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Mate Granic, Croatian foreign </F> minister and deputy prime minister, by announcer Elizabeta Gojan  -- live]    [Text] [Gojan] Our guest in the studio is Mate Granic,  Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister.  Good evening.    [Granic] Good evening.    [Gojan] Minister Granic, negotiations within the  Croat-Muslim  transitional committee ended in Vienna late last night. You  took part in the last two days of its work. Tell us what was  exactly agreed.    [Granic] We have finally agreed on the constitution of the  federation and we also reached a preliminary agreement on the  confederation. Today, an agreement on the transitional period  was agreed upon; before that a military agreement was signed.  We agreed that both delegations should meet in Washington by  the end of the week and sign all the agreements in the White  House.    [Gojan] This will confirm what has been agreed upon.    [Granic] Correct. A Croatian delegation led by President  Tudjman is expected to leave, most probably on Thursday.    [Gojan] The talks yesterday lasted for 14 hours. These were  very long talks. Obviously, there were some problems. Can you  tell us what the problems were? According to our reports, the  Croatian standpoint was well coordinated. It was obviously the  Muslim side that had some problems.    [Granic] Problems in connection with certain definitions  arose. Each side firmly defended its standpoints. We sought  better compromise solutions. The Bosniak side spent more time  coordinating its views with Sarajevo than we did with Zagreb.    [Gojan] Tell us what the agreement to be signed by  Presidents  Tudjman and Izetbegovic in Washington by the end of the week  means for the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the Republic  of Croatia?    [Granic] The agreement will also be signed by Mr. Zubak, the  president of the presidency of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna. This also provides a guarantee for the equality  and survival of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina at all  levels, from the cantons as the basic federal units to the level  of the federation, in judiciary, economy, and all other spheres.  For the Republic of Croatia it means that an important  strategic, political, and economic goal has been accomplished --  this represents a link with Bosnia-Herzegovina, a link with the  Croat people, and a link with the Bosniak-Croat Federation.    [Gojan] Everyone agrees that the third warring party in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnian Serbs, should, necessarily, be  involved as soon as possible. Have you outlined any strategy?    [Granic] We talked, of course, about this. We agreed today  that the transitional committee -- which negotiated both in  Washington and in Vienna -- would negotiate with the third  party. We also agreed on a strategy for the negotiations. These  negotiations will probably start following the signing of the  agreement in Washington.    [Gojan] According to Ambassador Redman, the future  federation  of the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina is expected to  have about 51 percent of territory -- something that has been  denied by Momcilo Krajisnik, who says that 45 percent of the  territory is enough. How can the Bosnian Serbs be forced to  hand back these territories?    [Granic] At least 51 percent. Everything else is a matter of  negotiating positions. Not only the Bosnian-Muslim side but the  international community, too, will surely help in bringing about  a final solution.    [Gojan] Tell us, do you perhaps know which areas might be at  stake? Which side within the Federation of Croats and Muslims  may possibly get them?    [Granic] This is a matter of negotiations.    [Gojan] When do you expect these transitional measures to  end? Will they function well? When do you expect the federation  will be established?    [Granic] Everything that was agreed in Washington has been  implemented -- even at an earlier stage than envisaged. For  example, the Vienna negotiations were expected to wrap up by 15  March. They ended yesterday. Likewise, the military agreement  was signed in time. Consequently, there is no doubt that so far  everything has been taking place according to the agreed  schedule against the backdrop of positive developments on the  ground.    As for negotiations with the third party, there is a great  deal of international pressure to the effect that such  negotiations should take place as soon as possible. Right now  we are talking about the location and organization of these  talks.    [Gojan] Recently, in the media, radio, and TV, there has  been  a considerable degree of confusion about the possibility of the  Bosnian Serbs being incorporated into a possible federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, including their confederal links with the  so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Articles have been  published here saying that this perhaps means that Croatia's  occupied areas would possibly join Serbia.    [Granic] There are two certain things: Croatia will never  want anything that resembles Yugoslavia or anything that is any  kind of new link or whatever with Yugoslavia. By the same  token, the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] are Croatian territory  under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supervision. They are  integral parts of Croatia. This is what we are going to discuss.  President Tudjman will give the UN secretary general a full  plan of our proposals for a peaceful reintegration of the UNPA's  through a new UNPROFOR mandate. We will demand firm support  from the United States, the European Union, and other  international institutions.</p>

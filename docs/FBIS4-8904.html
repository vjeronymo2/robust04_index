			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 20 (AFP) - Bosnian Serb shells  pounded Wednesday [20 April] into the besieged Moslem enclave of  Gorazde, killing four people and wounding seven, according to a  local official, reached by radio. [passage omitted]    The commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir  Michael Rose, had welcomed Karadzic's announcement on allowing  UNPROFOR troops into Gorazde.    "It is important because it does bring about a cease-fire.  It does allow us to run these humanitarian and UNPROFOR  convoys," Rose said in an interview with the BBC. "It is the  first step." Any cease-fire, he said, was temporary, but he  hoped the current move would turn into a permanent cessation of  hostilities, but this depended on the willingness of the two  parties not to resume their conflict.    In Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) said UNHCR representatives reported an easing of the  Serb assault on the town.    "The last message we've got said that the shelling had died  down considerably," UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said after  contacting staff in Gorazde at 7:00 AM (0500 GMT). [passage  omitted]    Rose said Wednesday, meanwhile, that the exclusion zone for  heavy weapons around Sarajevo could well be replicated elsewhere  in the safe areas. Some 12,000 people are now without shelter  in Gorazde and the corridors of apartment blocks are full of  people. [passage omitted]</p>

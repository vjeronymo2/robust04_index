			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A recovery in UK gilts helped stock index futures rally off the day's low in a session that was dominated by renewed fears of inflation and higher interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. There was an early buyer of the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 after it opened at 3,211 and the buying sent it to 3,214 within minutes of the opening. This turned out to be the high of the day for the early interest dried up as sellers emerged, leaving September to drift lower over the next hour. Dealers said the premium was substantially eroded which gave traders an opportunity to unwind arbitrage positions. The release of revised UK GDP figures for the second quarter once again led to fears on inflation and talk of an increase in interest rates. This sent September sharply lower and over the next few hours it tested a line of resistance as it fell to the day's low of 3,167. The steady performance of gilts together with a better than expected opening on Wall Street helped the contract bounce and September finished at 3,183, down 25 on its previous close and around 9 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was 11,357 lots. It was a quiet day in traded options and total turnover was 20,598 lots. Some 8,637 contracts were traded in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME WARNER SUED BY PATHE OVER LOAN FOR MGM/UA DEAL  </P> <P> Pathe Communications Corp. sued Time Warner Inc. for $500 million in Los  Angeles Superior Court late Thursday, charging that the New York media giant  reneged on an agreement to loan Pathe $650 million toward the purchase of  MGM/UA Communications Co.  </P> <P> Pathe's suit accuses Time Warner of breach of contract, fraud, interference  with contractual relationship and unfair competition. It also denies the claims  of contractual violations made by Time Warner in a $100-million suit filed  against Pathe 13 days earlier.  </P> <P> Pathe's attorneys contend that Time Warner backed out of the MGM/UA deal  without just cause. The suit alleges that Pathe fully abided by its agreement  to bankroll half of the $1.2-billion price for MGM/UA, but that Time Warner  later decided it wanted out of the deal.  </P> <P> The suit further claims that Time Warner sought to change the terms of the  purchase agreement significantly after it was unable to find a bank willing to  fund the $650-million loan.  </P> <P> From its corporate headquarters, Time Warner issued a blistering response to  the suit, taking special aim at Pathe co-founders Giancarlo Parretti and Florio  Fiorini.  </P> <P> "Pathe's cross-complaint is just its latest attempt to divert attention from  the facts -- which are that Pathe breached its April, 1990, agreement with Time  Warner, its theatrical distribution agreement with Warner Bros. and a  video-rights distribution agreement with Warner Home Video," the company  stated.  </P> <P> "We intend to schedule the deposition of Messrs. Parretti and Fiorini  immediately. We are confident that their depositions will expose how Pathe  conducted itself in this matter and demonstrate who is telling the truth about  what happened. The deposition will certainly prove who was unable to come up  with the money."  </P> <P> Time Warner's withdrawal forced Pathe to obtain a four-month extension on its  acquisition of MGM/UA, as it desperately seeks another financial backer. Pathe  agreed to raise the price of the acquisition to $21.50 a share from $20, adding  another $100 million to the cost. As part of the revised deal, stockholders  will be paid $4 per share on July 20.  </P> <P> The stalemate between the former deal-mates has generated widespread skepticism  over Pathe's ability to complete the transaction. But Pathe Co-President  Parretti reportedly told a Paris press conference Monday that he intends to  close the acquisition by Sept. 21, a month ahead of time. Parretti did not say  where he will find the backing needed to accomplish his goal, however.  </P> <P> In its June 29 lawsuit against Pathe, Time Warner accused Pathe of violating  the agreement that the two sides reached in April. Time Warner charged that  Pathe acted as if the agreement "gave Pathe a one-way option to decide which of  its obligations it would honor, which Time Warner rights it could ignore and  which conditions it would satisfy." In particular, Time Warner said Pathe's  Parretti sold video and film rights twice, to both Time Warner and MGM/UA.  </P> <P> In its counterclaim, Pathe contends that Time Warner tried to change the terms  of the loan because it was unhappy with existing contractual restrictions on  the United Artists film library. Time Warner was to receive the library as  collateral for its financing.  </P> <P> Pathe said Time Warner failed to help it find a $200-million loan to fund  production costs, as agreed to, and refused to accept an independent valuation  of the Pathe/Cannon film libraries, insisted on other conditions Pathe could  not meet and "knowingly put Pathe at risk of losing" a $200-million  non-refundable deposit made to MGM/UA.  </P> <P> In an attached submission, Pathe also formally denied all of the assertions  made against it in Time Warner's suit.  </P></p>

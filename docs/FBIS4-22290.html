			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Caspian Oil and Gas Project </F> Consortium"]    [Text] In accordance with the Decree of the Cabinet of  Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan of 13 February 1993 "On  the Formation and Development of Production of Hydrocarbon Raw  Materials in the Kazakhstan Part of the Caspian Sea," the  Ministry of Energy and Fuel Resources of the Republic of  Kazakhstan was instructed to establish the specialized company  Kazakhstankaspiyshelf and to form an international consortium of  major oil companies. A preliminary agreement concerning the  consortium was signed on 9 June 1993.    Kazakhstan is represented in this consortium by the state  company Kazakhstankaspiyshelf, which has been assigned the role  of operator. By means of tender selection, a group of six  foreign companies was identified as potential members of the  consortium and satisfy the basic requirements of the Kazakhstan  side: The British Petroleum-Statoil (Great Britain, Norway)  alliance, British Gas (Great Britain), Shell (the Netherlands),  Agip (Italy), Mobil (the United States), and Total (France).    The main criteria for selection of members of the consortium  were: Work experience under conditions comparable to the Caspian  shelf, taking into account the high ecological vulnerability of  the territory, thorough analysis of technical and technological  proposals, and potential financial capabilities of the companies.    Implementation of the first stage of the state program for  developing the shelf deposits of oil and gas of the Caspian Sea  includes a three-year program of geological-geophysical and  ecological research.    The following basic tasks are being given to the consortium:    --conducting maritime geophysical exploration on the shelf  of  the Caspian Sea for the purpose of studying its geologic  formation and evaluating the prospects of oil and gas content;    --reequipping Kazakhstani geophysical enterprises with  modern  recording apparatuses, a processing computer complex, and other  means of supporting maritime geological prospecting work;    --training Kazakhstani technical personnel in modern methods  of conducting maritime oil prospecting work;    --technical and financial assistance for the development of  a  local infrastructure.    The foreign members of the consortium will fully finance the  execution of work of the approved program. The total sum of the  investment for the production of maritime geophysical work will  amount to several hundred million U.S. dollars, including  expenditures on the development of infrastructure, training,  ecology, and the social sphere.    Members of the consortium are extended the following  privileges:    --conduct of the first round of licensing is guaranteed  after  the conclusion of the first stage of the explorations in the  most promising areas of the shelf of the Caspian Sea only among  the members of the consortium;    --after receiving a license for prospecting and production,  members of the consortium are authorized to include in the  recoupment part expenditures for the stage of geological  exploration.    Under all circumstances, Kazakhstan is the exclusive owner  of  information and data obtained as a result of execution of the  program.</p>

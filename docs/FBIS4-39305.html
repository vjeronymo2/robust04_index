			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not share the  opinion that the absence of Russian representatives at the  celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the allied landing in  Normandy proves that the West still did not trust Russia.  Yeltsin said this today after he had bought a book by well  known Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in a bookshop in Tverskaya  Street (to mark the 195th anniversary of Pushkin's birth).    Yeltsin repeated that on June 6 the celebrations in Normandy  had just begun and each town in Normandy would celebrate the day  of its own liberation from fascists. Yeltsin announced that the  Russian delegation had been invited to one of the Normandy towns  on June 28-29.    Yeltsin underlined that established tradition was also of  importance. "When we were celebrating the fiftieth anniversary  of the battles around Moscow and Stalingrad, etc., we did not  invite any of our allies either. However, this does not stop us  from being partners in all spheres, from trusting each other,  respecting each other and resolving together international  problems," Yeltsin emphasized.    Yeltsin confirmed his intention to meet Russian writer  Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Currently, Solzhenitsyn is visiting the  Russian Far East.</p>

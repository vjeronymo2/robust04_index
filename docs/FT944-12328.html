			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Irish power utilities look to renew links Officials from Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised power utility, are this week walking the line in what was once the bandit country of South Armagh to assess what needs to be done to restore the power link with the Irish Republic. The interconnector, blown up on several occasions by the IRA in the 1970s cutting the province from the Irish grid, has become a symbol of the drive at cross-border co-operation on the back of the peace process. Following the IRA ceasefire on August 31, NIE has been in 'active discussions' with Ireland's Electricity Supply Board to agree the technical and commercial terms for supplying the south with power. Both companies say it will be relatively easy. All-island co-operation in areas such as energy, telecommunications and tourism are likely to increase in the wake of any durable political settlement for the province, as companies - public and private - look for cost savings. Just in the last week, the NIE and ESB have commissioned two cross-border emergency connections in the north-west of the province, an 'energy-poor' area. The project attracted support from a European Commission scheme. The north-south interconnector is also likely to win support from the European Union. Northern Ireland is due to launch a public inquiry on January 10 into the planned undersea link with Scottish Power. The NIE has a 15-year supply agreement with Scottish Power. Northern Ireland has allocated Ecu177m (Pounds 140m) of EU funds towards the scheme. NIE, Northern Ireland's largest company, said yesterday that the interconnector with the republic could be working again within five months. Agreement will also have to be sought on pricing, and other trading issues, once a study of demand is complete. 'It is not a massive project, but it has come to be seen as a political issue. We want to look at it as a simple commercial question,' NIE said. The company has four power stations, with total capacity of 2,300MW, which is 40 per cent higher than peak needs. A link with the south would enable it to meet ESB's projected increased energy demand. In addition, as a result of the one- hour difference in peak load times, a link would help lower consumer costs in the province by improving capacity efficiency.</p>

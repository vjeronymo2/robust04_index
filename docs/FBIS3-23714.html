That was reported by the TANJUG agency, citing  members of the U.N. forces' command who asked to remain unnamed.  Information about this is contained in a report by an expert  commission that has already been sent to U.N. headquarters in  New York.    The commission established that the shelling that resulted  in  68 deaths and left about 200 wounded was carried out from the  positions of the Muslim Army's Second Mountain Brigade--from a  spot located approximately 1-1.5 km from the boundary line  separating it from Serbian forces. Muhamed Secirbegovic,  permanent representative to the United Nations of the Muslim  government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, acknowledged the fact of  the receipt of the commission's report at U.N. headquarters.    In the opinion of Yugoslav military experts, such a powerful  impact could not have resulted from the explosion of a single  mortar shell, even a large-caliber one. What is most likely,  they believe, is that a powerful explosive device packed with  shrapnel was activated in the market simultaneously with the  mortar explosion. They report that a powerful radial-action  antipersonnel fragmentation mine capable of striking everything  within a radius of 60 to 80 meters was developed at a military  plant in Bugojno that is in the hands of the Muslims. The  POLITIKA EKSPRESS newspaper has also reported the name of the  person who organized the clandestine action--a certain Mirza  Khadzijamakovic, who back before the war underwent training as  an explosives expert in the former Yugoslavia's Ministry of  Internal Affairs. Obviously, a provocation on such a scale could  not have been carried out without the knowledge of the  highest-ranking Sarajevo leaders.    Of course, the fact of the Muslim authorities' blame for the  tragedy in the Sarajevo market does not mean that the siege of  Sarajevo should not be lifted. However, the persistence with  which NATO is insisting on bombing precisely the Serbian  positions raises questions concerning that organization's  objectivity with regard to a Yugoslav settlement.    In the past, one-sided threats against the Serbs under the  pretext that Bosnia "is a victim of aggression" have resulted  only in inflaming the conflict. Even British Defense Minister  Malcolm Rifkind was forced to admit in a recent interview on  London television that "the United Nations' presence has  unquestionably prolonged the war." Thus, if the North Atlantic  alliance, in seeking a more active role in Bosnia, really wants  a prompt end to the civil war, Brussels should take the United  Nations' mistakes into account. If an ultimatum is to be  presented, it should be presented to all three warring sides,  and not to the Serbs alone. Yet Washington's proposal to demand  that the Bosnian Serbs withdraw their artillery and tanks from  Sarajevo under the threat of air strikes suffers from  one-sidedness. Such an approach will probably be interpreted by  the other side in the conflict as covert support.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: West creates new uncertainties Whichever way one looks at it, the Nato ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their artillery surrounding Sarajevo within 10 days or face air strikes, has created a new ball game. It marks a fresh departure in the policy of the Atlantic alliance, which has never before planned to take offensive action and has always in the past refused to intervene in conflicts which do not directly threaten its own territory. The calculation of members of the alliance, of course, is that the Bosnian Serbs will comply with their demand to withdraw their heavy weapons and tanks within a 20km zone from the centre of Sarajevo or place them under United Nations control, thus making air strikes unnecessary. That calculation is based on the belief that, in contrast with previous declarations of the same kind, Nato's latest warning is likely to be taken seriously by the Bosnian Serbs, because for the first time it is tied to a specific deadline. Similar threats, notably in August 1993 and last month, did not have a deadline attached to them and could therefore be seen as insubstantial bluster, which did not need to be taken too literally. If the Bosnian Serbs fail to comply this time, Nato does not have any other choice than to carry out its threat. If it does not do so, it will lose what little credibility it still has and might as well pack its bags and admit that it has no further role to play as an effective security organisation in a post-cold war Europe. A new ball game has also been created on the ground in Bosnia, with unforeseeable consequences. The fact that Nato, some of whose members are the biggest contributors to UN forces in Bosnia, has largely abandoned its neutral role and has adopted a clear anti-Bosnian Serb stance, is likely to make the UN's peace-keeping and aid operations much more hazardous. The Bosnian Serbs have already made clear that they will not hesitate to retaliate against UN forces if air strikes are launched. But even if these air attacks do not take place, the Serbs could make life very difficult for both the peacekeepers and the aid workers, particularly in enclaves such as Srebrenica, where Canadian troops are encircled by Bosnian Serbs. The main weakness of the Nato declaration is that it concentrates entirely on the situation in Sarajevo. It does not seem to be based on a long-term strategy for the solution of the 22-month-old conflict, other than reaffirming its general support for a negotiated settlement. The best outcome is that, as the result of the UN's and Nato's more muscular stance, a separate agreement can now be negotiated for Sarajevo, demilitarising the Bosnian capital and placing it under UN administration. Such an agreement could form a building-block for an overall Bosnian peace agreement, but no more than that. There are many more complicated problems which will remain to be solved even if a satisfactory status for Sarajevo can be agreed between the warring parties. For the Bosnian Moslems, it is at least equally important that the 33 per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina's territory which is due to be allocated to them is properly consolidated and amounts to a viable nation, however small. At the moment that is certainly not the case, since most of the Moslem enclaves which have been designated as 'safe areas' by the UN are surrounded by Serb territory. Territorial disputes between Moslems and Croats continue to be the cause of some of the most bitter fighting in central Bosnia. To believe, therefore, that a comprehensive peace settlement in Bosnia is just around the corner as the result of Nato's new muscular stance is clearly an illusion. It will have achieved a worthwhile result if relief can be brought to the martyred population of Sarajevo. But that will merely switch attention to other disaster areas in Bosnia.</p>

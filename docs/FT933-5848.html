			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Closure costs leave Ferry Pickering Pounds 3.9m in loss CLOSURE costs of its loss-making Scottish operations left Ferry Pickering, the Leicestershire-based printing and packaging group, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.86m for the half year to June 30. Profits last time were Pounds 95,000. Turnover fell to Pounds 12m (Pounds 13m) with continuing activities static at Pounds 10.3m. Operating profits on continuing operations amounted to Pounds 643,000 (Pounds 445,000). Exceptional closure costs were Pounds 2.6m, with an additional Pounds 1.39m for goodwill previously written off. Directors said the Dutch printing operation had performed satisfactorily but fierce competition in the Netherlands had resulted in a reduced contribution to prof-its. The second half had begun with strong activity at the main operating plant at Hinckley, they added. Losses per share came through at 25.76p (0.6p earnings) but as expected, the interim dividend is maintained at 2.1p.</p>

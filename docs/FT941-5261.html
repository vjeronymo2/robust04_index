			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / NY spurns bizarre toilet plan There is some good news and some bad news for those feeling the call of nature on the streets of New York. The good news is that the city council has come up with an ingenious, if bizarre, plan to encourage the private sector to build and operate public toilets in the metropolis. Companies will be allowed to erect two giant advertising pillars for every toilet built, so giving them the opportunity to profit from the advertising revenues they collect. The bad news is that the scheme has become so mired in controversy that the council last week backed away from full implementation, instead opting for a small-scale experiment that will take at least a year to complete. New York is notorious for its lack of public lavatories. There used to be hundreds - in parks, public buildings, subway stations and open spaces - but they became the domain of drug addicts and vagrants when the city ran out of money to pay for attendants in the 1970s, and nearly all were closed. Apart from causing inconvenience to New Yorkers and visitors, one side-effect has been intense irritation for proprietors of bars and restaurants who find their toilets performing a public function. Many express their annoyance with strident warning notices, such as: 'Bathrooms are for the use of today's customers only.' The shortage has also spawned an unusual literary sub-genre. A widely available book called 'Where To Go: A Guide To Manhattan's Toilets' lists little-known lavatories that can be used without embarrassment. Some require considerable tenacity: the entry for the Mormon visitors' centre in Lincoln Square warns that people wanting to use the rest room are expected to sit through an introductory talk, a videotape presentation and a question-and-answer session lasting 40 minutes. The city council's proposed remedy was a plan to award a private sector franchise for the construction and operation of 200 automatic, self-cleaning public toilets similar to the ones that have become widespread in London. Admission would cost 25 cents, but the operators' main source of income would be the revenues from Paris-style advertising pillars measuring 22ft 6ins high and 5ft 6ins in diameter - two of them for every toilet. The originality of the scheme, however, has failed to impress New Yorkers. Community groups and local politicians have reacted with horror at the proposed afforestation of the city with 400 pillars, while the private sector is concerned the revenues from two pillars per toilet will not be enough for them to make a profit. Opting for caution, the city council has cut the number of toilets to 100 and the height of the pillars to 17ft. But even these may never appear, because the council has decided not to go ahead without first inviting would-be operators to conduct an experiment with a maximum of three toilets and six pillars each. Given the level of public hostility to the pillars, the experiment seems unlikely to win many converts. If it fails, the city will either have to find the money for the toilets out of its own resources: or, more likely given the continuing budgetary constraints, remain a lavatorial wilderness.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Student sponsors 'fail to get value' Recruiters do not get good value for money from sponsoring undergraduates, a report yesterday by Industrial Relations Services, an independent research company, says. Just under half of sponsored students join their sponsoring companies when they graduate, while the sponsorship can cost as much as Pounds 6,000 per student. The average annual bursary paid was Pounds 1,105, while the average monthly salary paid for vacation work by the 65 companies surveyed was Pounds 715.</p>

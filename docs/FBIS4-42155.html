			<p>BFN     [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- Several Kurds were  detained today in a large-scale police operation against the  Kurdish cultural center at the old fire station in Saarbruecken.  A Saarbruecken police spokeswoman said in response to an  inquiry that the operation had been conducted on the basis of an  arrest warrant issued by the Federal Court of Justice magistrate  against a suspected member of the banned Workers Party of  Kurdistan (PKK). Officers from the Criminal Investigation  Office, the Federal Border Guard, and the Saarland police were  involved in the operation. The Public Prosecutor's Office in  Karlsruhe is responsible for conducting the investigations.    The executive committee of the "Old Fire Station"  association, responsible for funding the Old Fire Station where  the Kurdish cultural group, among others, is based, drew up a  resolution protesting the police operation. A statement  released by the association says that approximately 100 masked  officers forced their way into the building wearing combat gear  and with weapons drawn. They searched all rooms and detained all  the approximately 50 Kurds present and took them away in  handcuffs. At least one person was seriously hurt in the  process. The Germans present were temporarily detained, but  were released once their personal information had been taken and  they had been filmed on video.</p>

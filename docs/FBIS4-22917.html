The C-3 silica  gel with a mean radius of 48 A and a 200-250 m mean grain  size made in Gorkiy is used as the matrix, and the  immunoglobulin fraction of the AIDS patient serum containing  high titres of specific antibodies (1:3,000 in the indirect  immunofluorescence reaction) is used as the ligand. The sorption  binding of monocyte EVK/IRA/3 culture cells chronically infected  with HIV-1 is summarized. Two approaches are used in the study:  immobilization of antibodies to viral proteins expressed on the  surface of affected cells on a rigid matrix and the use of  nonspecific interactions of the model system cells with the  sorbent cells. It is noted that no attempt was made to develop a  superselective sorbent (selectivity is defined here as  predominant sorption of HIV-infected cells compared to intact  model system cells). The findings make it possible to speculate  that one can develop a selective sorbent for predominant binding  of HIV-infected cells by using an inert material, e.g.,  sepharose, as the matrix, and confirm the feasibility of  immunosorption binding of cells expressing HIV proteins. The  approach aimed at removing HIV proteins, intact virions, and  circulating immune complexes from the blood or plasma with the  help of immunosorbents is recognized as promising while the use  of immunosorbents synthesized in vivo is thought to  be debatable. The immunosorbents demonstrate a selectivity rate  of 92% vs. 29% for the control group. Tables 1;  references 9:  1 Russian, 8 Western.</p>

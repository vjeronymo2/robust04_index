			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mohammad Hasan Ja'fari, member of the </F> Central Council of the Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], of  Afghanistan, with unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given]    [Text] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess Afghan  President Borhanoddin Rabbani's visit to Islamic countries and  his recent visit to Tajikistan?    [Ja'fari] These visits, which took place without the  coordination of the Jehad Council and the leaders of parties,  were made within the context of stating party and group  objectives and positions. In addition to these points,  Rabbani's visit to Tajikistan also included discussions on the  problems along the two countries' borders as well as discussions  on the return of thousands of Tajik refugees to their country.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the agreement between  Rabbani and Mubarak on arresting and handing over Egyptian  combatants who actively participated in the Afghan jehad for  many years?    [Ja'fari] This agreement has no legal and official status as  far as the jehadi groups are concerned and can be studied only  within the framework of a personal view!    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you regard Mr. Rabbani's actions as  illegal? Is this really so?    [Ja'fari] The actions by the current Afghan Government are  illegal, since Mr. Rabbani has trampled on all former  commitments as well as the Jalalabad agreement, which stipulated  the mode of participation by all the jehadi parties in managing  the country. As far as the jehadi parties are concerned, even  the decisions by the current Hall wa 'Aqd Council are  unimplementable because of the personal changes that Mr. Rabbani  has made in its composition. Moreover, none of the four major  parties of Afghanistan are members in this council.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Some believe that Hezb-e Wahdat appears  to be confused in Afghanistan's political scene and in its  approach on other groups. Is this assessment correct?    [Ja'fari] The objective of Hezb-e Wahdat is to establish a  comprehensive peace throughout Afghanistan and it has exerted  all its efforts and forces toward this end. Hezb-e Wahdat  represents 25 percent of the Shiite population in Afghanistan  and wants the rights of the Shiites to be established and social  and political justice to prevail in society. Therefore, we  expect other parties to accept and to believe in our logical  desires. Within this framework, they sometimes impose wars on  us and we have no other alternative but to defend ourselves.  But we emphasized that Hezb-e Wahdat has never fomented war.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How has Hezb-e Wahdat reacted to the  resignation by Golboddin Hekmatyar from his post as prime  minister?    [Ja'fari] As far as we know, Mr. Hekmatyar has not resigned  and this is only a rumor that has been disseminated by the news  circles of some of the groups.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] The people of Afghanistan are tired of  the war and the recent incidents. The unfavorable impact that  they have had on Afghan public opinion has even put in question  the beliefs and objectives of the jehadi groups.    [Ja'fari] If Hezb-e Wahdat's plan to end the conflicts and  to  establish a coalition government had been implemented, we would  definitely not have been witnessing the avenging and  expansionist acts by some of the parties today.    On the basis of the Hezb-e Wahdat's plan which was also  agreed on, Afghanistan's major parties comprising the Hezb-e  Wahdat, the Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], the Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], and the National-Islamic  Movement of Northern Afghanistan would form a provisional  council and run the country's affairs until elections were held.  Also, the other parties too would be in close cooperation with  the council. However, the explicit opposition by Ahmad Shah  Mas'ud, leader of the Supervisory Council of the Jami'at-e  Eslami defeated this plan and this ultimately led to the spread  of the war.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is the outcome of the many months  of  efforts by the Elections Committee?    [Ja'fari] Practically nothing.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What objectives are there behind the  formation of the Constitutional Committee by Borhanoddin Rabbani?    [Ja'fari] The formation of this committee does not fall  within the authorities of Mr. Rabbani because on the basis of  the Jalalabad agreement, the representatives of all of  Afghanistan's ethnic groups and tribes should actively  participate in the formation of such an extensive organization.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What does Hezb-e Wahdat want from the  future constitution of Afghanistan?    [Ja'fari] The recognition of the Ja'fari sect, the election  of Shiites to form one-fourth of the future government, and the  participation of the various ethnic groups on the basis of a  population count in the management of the country's affairs.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How are relations between Hezb-e Wahdat  and the other parties in Afghanistan?    [Ja'fari] Hezb-e Wahdat has good relations with all the  groups and is ready to extend a hand of friendship and peace  toward Sayyaf's Ettehad e-Eslami [Islamic Unity Party] if it  reviews and corrects its past positions.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your opinion on the social and  security situation in the various parts of Afghanistan?    [Ja'fari] Unfortunately, the security situation in most of  the country's areas is unfavorable and disorder prevails. In  other words, in each one of the country's provinces a local  government has been formed and there are no contacts between  these local governments and the central government. Of course  there are some areas in northern Afghanistan that enjoy relative  security and among these provinces we can name Jowzjan, Mazar-e  Sharif, Sarpol, and Baghlan as well as cities in central  Afghanistan, namely Bamiyan, Meydan, Gharbi, and Oruzgan. But  as far as the social situation is concerned, the repercussions  of the war have rendered the people helpless. The oppressed  people of Afghanistan and the entire land of Afghanistan are  suffering from poverty. The situation of the people is  extremely painful.    The people of Afghanistan and especially the residents in  western Kabul are living under conditions that are very  difficult to describe. The residents in the Shiite areas in  west Kabul that are governed by the central government are  suffering from the central government's disfavor and bias in  addition to having to suffer the impact of the war and they are  deprived even of the most essential living essentials such as  water and electricity.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] International organizations claim that  they are placing great assistance in the form of food and  medicine at the disposal of the Afghan Government and some of  the jehadi groups every day. What do you have to say about this?    [Ja'fari] Until now, some consignments of international  relief organizations were sent to Afghanistan. But I can say  now that no assistance from abroad is reaching the people of  Afghanistan at the present time.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Under the current situation, what  message  do you have for the leaders of Afghanistan's jehad parties?    [Ja'fari] The people of Afghanistan are sick and tired of  the  war and it is not important to them which group is confronting  whom. The people of Afghanistan seek tranquility, security, and  peace. The jehadi leaders of Afghanistan are well aware that  conflicts and clashes cannot and will not yield any victor but  that there is a balance of power in the country. Therefore, the  only alternative is to tolerate and to accept one another and  work to lay the foundation for a general understanding on the  basis of the interests of all the people of Afghanistan.</p>

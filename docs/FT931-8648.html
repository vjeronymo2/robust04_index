			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The unwelcome pay-jobs link The most useful thing I can do as British unemployment once more rises to 3m is to summarise the main features of the problem as I see them. The immediate reason for the jobless explosion is the severity of the recession and the slow recovery from it. That in turn reflects the severe collapse of property prices, which has made both individuals and companies more anxious to repay debt than to take on new commitments. It has also made the banks, whose own balance sheets have been hit, ultra-cautious about new lending. There may also be a further feedback from unemployment itself. A Barclays Bank survey suggests that 40 per cent of the adult population and 50 per cent of those at work are more hesitant about borrowing because of the fear of job loss. Businessmen who say that the recession is not the only factor are correct. But they often mistake what the fundamentals really are. For instance, Mr Percy Barnvik, the president of the ABB, the world's largest power engineering group, told the Financial Times (Jan 4) that inexorable advances in productivity were leading to large-scale permanent unemployment. This is the most frequently recurring scare in world economic history and is sometimes dignified by the name 'lump of labour fallacy'. It is based on the idea that total output is fixed, so that if fewer workers are needed in one line of activity they must end up on the scrap-heap. This fallacious diagnosis leads to fallacious remedies, mainly designed to reduce the labour supply, such as emigration, compulsory reduction of working hours, early retirement, and so on. It was embraced in the 17th century by James I of England, otherwise known as the 'wisest fool in Christendom', who wanted to carry off the unemployed to Virginia and Newfoundland. What such practical men fail to see is that unemployment is a market relationship, but one of some complexity. The most widely understood aspect is that between unemployment and inflation. There is indeed no long-term trade-off between the two. Employment is not higher in Latin America countries prone to double-digit inflation or in the former Soviet Union than it is in sound money countries. But it is true, that the move from a high rate of inflation to a lower one involves a temporary rise in unemployment, as the UK saw in the early 1980s and again in the early 1990s. Similarly an inflationary upturn is often accompanied by a temporary reduction of unemployment to abnormally low levels, as in the late 1980s. The approach via inflation does not however explain why the number of people out of work should now be so high over the average of the business cycle. UK unemployment exceeded 3m in the aftermath of the last recession. But the drop to below 1.7m in 1990 proved an unsustainable after-effect of the previous boom. It looks as if the equilibrium rate of unemployment cannot be very far from 2.5m. We need to move back a step. Just as there is a relationship that goes from unemployment to nominal pay (that is pay in money terms) there is another relationship that goes from real pay to unemployment. The higher the level of real pay per head, the smaller the number of workers likely to be offered jobs. At a common-sense level the relation is simple enough. The more that anything costs, the less of it will be bought. But it is difficult to demonstrate statistically in the national labour market, with so much else going on in the economy at the same time. There is the statistical problem of which measure of real pay best represents employers' costs. The more basic problem is that the true cost of employing labour depends on the margin above labour and other costs that a business can get away with imposing, which is difficult to explain without a good model of how the whole economy works. Such models are not easy to come by. The Treasury did have a shot at the subject in 1985 under a chancellor, Nigel Lawson, who was not afraid to talk about the link between pay and jobs. Its paper, The Relationship between Pay and Jobs, estimated that a change of 1 per cent in real wages would ultimately be associated with a change the other way of 110,000 to 220,000 jobs, an estimate still often cited. Emphasis on the word 'real' may help to explain why pay can still be a problem, even when earnings increases are, at 5 per cent a year, the lowest for several decades. But so too is inflation, down to 1 1/2 to 3 per cent, according to the measure used. Real pay per head is thus rising by 2 to 3 per cent. By contrast, Professor James Meade remarks in a fascinating memorandum to Labour's Borrie Commission (contactable via IPPR at 071 379 7400) that 'to absorb 2m extra workers into employment would require a considerable reduction in real wage costs, involving an absolute fall in the real wage rates, in order to induce employers in a free enterprise economy to expand their output sufficiently'. The level of benefits clearly affects the wage which workers are willing to accept. But of course real pay is not the only non-cyclical influence on the jobs market. Levels of education and training, international and technological developments and real interest rates all play a role. But in most markets price - in this case pay - is the final equilibrating mechanism between supply and demand after all other influences have been taken into account; and in the labour market it reacts sluggishly and incompletely. One reason for the difficulties economists have in tracing the pay-jobs relation is that they look too much at national averages and not enough at pay for specific skills and categories of workers, where market-clearing differentials have widened out in recent years. In an Economic Viewpoint of January 14, I summarised how the US has had a better jobs record than Europe, but at the expense of driving down real pay for the less skilled. There are also cultural and moral influences which economists do not much like discussing. Indeed, it is often the most enlightened businessmen who are most resistant to any talk of a link between pay and jobs and who boast of their small but well-paid labour forces. They have indeed good reason to be worried, even if their own actions are not as helpful as they think. For driving down real wages to market-clearing levels could have morally unacceptable effects on the distribution of income, unless low rates of pay are supplemented by some other means. Prof Meade's main interest is in moving from a conventional welfare state to a modest citizen's income available to all. But similar reasoning applies to workfare, special employment measures and all the other palliatives. They are all basically ways of employing people without making employers pay the full going rate. One of the best analyses I have seen is that of RS Musgrave (Workfare, 24 Garden Avenue, Samwellgate Moor, Durham, DH1 5EQ). As he says, in a totally free market the unemployed have the choice of doing nothing, or doing a job other than their usual one for a while. Governments have usually subsidised only the choice of doing nothing. Nevertheless there is no reason why job subsidies should be confined to the public sector or to special projects of any kind. Whatever is valuable in the workfare idea can be achieved by marginal employment subsidies to normal employers on a temporary and a limited basis. Of course these measures are putting sticking plaster on the problem and it will be quite a while, if ever, before the labour market can be fundamentally reformed. It was a political mistake for the Thatcher and Major governments to wind down their special employment programmes on the back of a temporary economic upturn which could not be expected to resolve the underlying jobs problem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC has expressed concern about that it calls  wild rumors about expected anarchy and violence after the  election. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said that the rumors were  triggering off a psychosis of fear.    Reports at the weekend said that many whites have been  stockpiling non-perishable supplies in anticipation of trouble.  The fears were reportedly spurred by the carnage in  Johannesburg last week, and an anonymous panic list distributed  to businesses warning about water supplies being cut off and  power pylons blown up.    Mr. Niehaus said that the ANC did not believe that there  would be more violence after the election and that there was no  need for concern.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Further decline in bund yields in prospect - Capital &amp; Credit Funding concerns, inflation fears and weak US Treasuries recently propelled German bond yields to new highs for the year. But last week's comforting news on supply and inflation helped them recoup some of their losses, and analysts say more gains are in store. 'We had some good fundamental data this week which challenged some of the more sceptical prognoses,' says Armin Kayser, German economist at Swiss Bank Corporation in Frankfurt. 'In view of these fundamentals, 7 3/4 per cent yields began to make little sense,' he says. SBC expects bund yields to decline to 7 per cent in the next three months and to fall to 6 1/2 per cent by September 1995. Among the good news last week were monetary data confirming continued deceleration of Germany's M3 money supply growth and regional inflation numbers below the 3 per cent forecast for September. The supply spectre, too, began to appear less daunting after the publication of the Bundesbank's issuance calendar for the final quarter. While another DM35bn - DM45bn in government and Treuhandanstalt debt is expected this year, only two long-dated government bonds are slated, with the rest likely to be issued in medium maturities through tap sales. All this has lent support to the long end of the German yield curve, causing the yield on the 10-year benchmark bund to fall to 7.58 per cent on Friday, from 7.70 per cent at Wednesday's close. 'With the better than feared funding calendar, the first cornerstone of the expected 'post election/easing supply pressure rally' . . . has fallen into place,' says Mr Stefan Schneider, chief economist at SG Warburg in Frankfurt. He expects 10-year yields to fall back to 7 1/4 per cent in the near term, before returning to 7 1/2 per cent by the first quarter of 1995. Bunds also gained support from the Bundesbank's announcement that tomorrow's new bund would take the form of a 10-year floating-rate note pegged to the three-month Frankfurt Interbank Rate. The market's reaction to this announcement was mixed. Some argued it reflected the Bundesbank's problems of placing more supply at the long end after recent difficult auctions. 'After the difficulties it had in placing 7 1/2 per cent Treuhand bonds in August, the Bundesbank may have wanted to avoid the risk of offering a bund with an even higher coupon and still finding no demand,' says Mr Schneider. But others said the floater would ease the supply burden at the long end, allowing the yield curve to flatten. Moreover, the issue is expected to see strong demand from the recently established money market funds, which have an enormous appetite for liquid, highly-rated money market paper. A further advantage of issuing a floating-rate bond amid still-fragile market sentiment is that it will prevent the futures selling that has preceded previous fixed-rate issues. 'A floater entails lower price risk than a fixed-rate bond, and traders don't need to sell futures ahead of the issue, which has undermined the market in the past,' says one trader. Some observers also say the decision to issue a floater may reflect the Bundesbank's expectation that long yields have peaked. 'The Bundesbank has an uncanny knack of pinpointing the turning points in the bund cycle, for example issuing 30-year paper when yields bottomed in late 1993 and in 1986, and issuing FRNs in 1990 when nominal yields peaked,' says Mr Troy Bowler, strategist at PaineWebber in London. However, although the improving inflation outlook and floating-rate issuance may lend support to bunds near-term, several risks remain: possible setbacks in the US Treasury market amid continued monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve; the forthcoming German wage round; and the German federal elections on October 16. The latter especially could spring a nasty surprise on a bund market firmly expecting a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-FDP coalition. Many market participants seem unaware that the complicated German electoral system could enable the PDS, the former East German communist party, to enter the lower house of parliament, even if it doesn't clear the 5 per cent hurdle normally needed to win parliamentary seats. Although the leader of the opposition social democrats has said he does not intend to gain office through the support of the PDS, some feel he could be swayed by the lure of chancellorship after the elections to establish some sort of SPD-Green-PDS alignment. Given these imponderables, those looking for further rate cuts from the Bundesbank will probably have to wait a little longer. Even the rate for its weekly securities repurchase agreements is expected to be held fixed at 4.85 per cent until after the elections. 'The Bundesbank is unlikely to cut rates over the next weeks with the election, further Fed hikes and the upcoming wage round being potentially destabilising factors,' says Mr Schneider.</p>

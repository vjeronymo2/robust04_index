			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: VME considers co-operation deals with equipment groups VME GROUP, the world's third largest construction equipment producer, may enter a small number of specific 'constructive co-operation agreements' with other manufacturers, said Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive. VME, jointly owned by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, has expanded its product range and geographical spread in the past three years through the acquisition of Zettelmeyer, a German producer of small earthmoving equipment, and Akerman, a Swedish hydraulic excavator company. Mr Johannesson, interviewed at Bauma, the Munich construction equipment exhibition, stressed that any further acquisitions or co-operation with other manufacturers would be in specific geographic or product areas, or could involve components. Industry speculation, fuelled at Bauma by uncertainty over unresolved takeover and joint venture discussions, has linked VME with O &amp; K, the German construction and mining equipment concern. VME had no comment yesterday on the rumours. O &amp; K is owned by Hoesch, the steel group being taken over by its German rival Krupp, which also has construction and mining equipment interests. VME has recently focused on building a strong presence in the German market. Mr Johannesson said the company's integrated German distribution network was fundamentally complete, although there were a couple of pieces still to fall in place. The Zettelmeyer acquisition gave VME an important foothold in a market where customers traditionally prefer domestically-produced equipment. But Mr Johannesson added that the German company was also benefiting from its access to Volvo BM technology. VME is in the throes of reducing its fixed asset base by 10 per cent worldwide in response to recession in most world markets and the industry's chronic overcapacity. The programme will be completed by the end of this year. The Brussels-based group lost Dollars 44.7m last year, due to heavy restructuring at Akerman in Sweden and tough market conditions, especially in North America and Brazil. Mr Johannesson said VME's resource allocation planning for this year assumes a slightly worse business environment than in 1991, but this did not imply that it foresees a deeper loss for 1992. VME is best known for its Volvo BM, Michigan and Euclid brands, which joined forces in one of the biggest international construction equipment mergers of the mid-1980s.</p>

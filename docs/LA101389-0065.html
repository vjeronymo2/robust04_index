			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS PRAISE KEMP'S HUD REFORM PLANS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: SOME HOUSE MEMBERS CAUTION THE SECRETARY AGAINST 'OVERKILL' BY  ALTERING REGULATIONS ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS.  </P> <P> Members of Congress praised Housing Secretary Jack Kemp Thursday for his  proposals to reform the beleaguered Department of Housing and Urban  Development, but they cautioned him not to engage in "overkill" in changing  agency programs.  </P> <P> "As I look at the scandals that have been revealed at HUD, it is my view that  what we have seen is a people problem, not a program problem," said Rep. Henry  B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the housing and community development  subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee.  Gonzalez's panel is one of several conducting HUD inquiries.  </P> <P> "What we have had in the last eight years at HUD are ambitious and venal people  who betrayed their public trust," Gonzalez said during a hearing at which Kemp  described his reform proposals.  </P> <P> "I make the distinction between scandalous mismanagement and the integrity of  HUD programs," Gonzalez said. "These programs work when people of good will are  there to administer them."  </P> <P> Kemp has offered a package of reforms to clean up his department, which has  been tainted by allegations of influence peddling and political favoritism  during the Ronald Reagan Administration. Some of Kemp's planned reforms will  require congressional action.  </P> <P> Kemp's proposals include naming a top financial officer for the department and  requiring public registration of all HUD lobbyists and consultants to  discourage influence peddling and mishandling of funds. He also has proposed  changes in several HUD programs to ensure that HUD money is directed to low-  and moderate-income areas.  </P> <P> Two Ohio lawmakers took issue with Kemp's proposal to change the popular  Community Development Block Grant program by increasing the proportion of funds  required to be used for the benefit of the poor.  </P> <P> The program now allows 40% of the grants made to the states to be used for  projects that do not directly benefit low-income persons. Kemp, noting that  some states have used the money for projects such as bike racks and swimming  pools, wants to reduce that share to 25%. Further, he has proposed that  wealthier communities be required to use 100% of their grants for the poor.  </P> <P> Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D-Ohio), complaining that she was "not responsible  because someone in New York got a swimming pool," insisted that the local  officials in her district operate the program effectively.  </P> <P> "To stifle a certain degree of flexibility of the program would be absolutely  outrageous," Oakar said. "Don't blame the program -- we just need better  management. . . . There's such a thing as overkill."  </P> <P> Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie (R-Ohio) said the money has been used by cities to  replace reduced federal revenue sharing and told Kemp that the fact that "you  honed in" on the Community Development Block Grant program bothered him because  the program has been effective in his district.  </P> <P> Kemp assured Oakar that he was "not out to get it (the program)," but said he  felt it would be difficult to defend a program "that allows monies to be spent  without some guidelines." He said his proposed 75% allocation to benefit the  poor was "hardly Kemp scorched-earth policy."  </P> <P> Oakar also told Kemp she would not allow the new climate of reform to deter her  from fighting for housing projects for her city.  </P> <P> "If I'm not an ombudsman for my area, I ought to be thrown out of office," she  said. "Sometimes I get the impression that what we're going to do is have a  fortress built up as an overreaction. I don't want to see that happen." Kemp  responded he would "personally fire" any HUD employee who was disrespectful to  a member of Congress.  </P> <P> In a meeting with a group of reporters later in the day, Kemp said he was  surprised -- and somewhat amused -- at Oakar's reaction.  </P> <P> "A Democrat criticizing a Republican for trying to fight poverty," he said.  "We've come full circle. I was very surprised at Mary Rose Oakar -- that she  would put herself in the position of making an inference we were targeting too  much to low income. I would love to have a debate on that."  </P> <P> Kemp told reporters he believed he was receiving "generally good marks" for his  proposals and that there "seems to be a lot of good will." Everyone, he said,  "wants to see HUD back on its feet and aimed in the right direction."  </P> <P> He added: "I don't think I have anyone in Congress saying, 'I hope Kemp screws  up.' "  </P></p>

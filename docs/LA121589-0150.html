			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> ELDERLY MAN KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT  </P> <P> A 77-year-old Costa Mesa man died Thursday in a major collision that tied up  traffic for more than three hours on MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine, police  said.  </P> <P> The victim, Marvin Arthur Tunstall, was driving south on MacArthur in the right  lane about 12:57 p.m. when he attempted to make a U-turn about 500 feet south  of Bison, Police Sgt. Ron Flathers said. As he turned across the path of  traffic, his 1985 Ford Escort was struck broadside at the driver's door by a  1984 Chevrolet Suburban driven by Joni Deatherage, 27, of El Toro, Flathers  said. Deatherage braked but was unable to avoid the collision, he said.  </P> <P> Tunstall's car was shoved across the northbound lanes of traffic and came to  rest at the curb. He suffered head and chest injuries and was pronounced dead  at the scene.  </P> <P> Although Deatherage's car drove through a chain-link fence and plunged to the  bottom of a 30-foot embankment, both she and her 21-month-old son, strapped  into a car seat, escaped major injury. They were taken to Hoag Hospital in  Newport Beach, treated and released.  </P> <P> Officials closed MacArthur to traffic until 4:30 p.m., causing congestion  throughout the afternoon.  </P></p>

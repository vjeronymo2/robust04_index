			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Beazer pays Pounds 31m for Mowlem Homes Beazer Homes, the recently-floated former Hanson subsidiary, has bought the housebuilding arm of John Mowlem, the construction and airports group, for Pounds 31m. Mr Dennis Webb, Beazer's chief executive, said the acquisition 'fits in well with our strategy to increase our volumes and market share, particularly in the south-east'. Mowlem announced at the time of its Pounds 63m rights issue last March that it planned to focus on its contracting and scaffolding business, and would sell John Mowlem Homes, along with part of its stake in London City Airport. John Mowlem Homes is a specialist housebuilder with a substantial middle-market presence in the south-east and south-west of England, where Beazer is comparatively weak. The acquisition was priced at a marginal premium to John Mowlem's Pounds 30.2m book value for its housebuilding arm, but the subsidiary also has Pounds 1.8m cash. After flotation Beazer held cash resources of Pounds 74.5m, so it is in a position to build up further John Mowlem's land bank, in addition to funding its intention of expansion into Wales and north-western England. John Mowlem had a land bank of 2,250 plots at June 30 and incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m in the year to December.</p>

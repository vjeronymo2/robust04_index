			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 28 (AFP) -- Developing countries  flatly rejected on Monday [28 March] any bid by major Western  industrial nations to raise the issue of a "social clause" in  world trade agreements at next month's GATT ministerial parley  at Marrakesh.    They argued it was up to each sovereign state to take care  of  its labour standards, and warned that linking such issues to  trade could result in protectionist measures outlawed in the  world trade pact concluded here last December.    The issue has been pushed by the United States and France,  whose 11 partners in the European Union have adopted a more  cautious stance, seeking to avoid antagonizing the developing  world.    Trade negotiators here said they feared the issue could cast  a long shadow over the parley, scheduled for April 12-15 in the  south Moroccan city to cap the seven-year Uruguay Round of GATT  trade negotiations.    Brazil, speaking for the caucus of developing nations in  GATT  (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), expressed their  "utmost concern" about proposals to include "workers rights and  international labour standards" on the agenda of the future  World Trade Organization (WTO) which is to succeed GATT.    Developing nations specifically rejected a United States  proposal for a passage referring to this issue to be added to a  draft ministerial Declaration to be adopted by the Marrakesh  conference.    The text proposed by the United States calls for  "consideration of the relationship between the trading system  and internationally recognized labour standards" to be  undertaken even before the WTO becomes operational sometime in  1995.    Developing countries considered that this would not be  "acceptable," Brazilian ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia told a  meeting of GATT delegation heads, one of the last sessions in  preparation for the Marrakesh conference.    Lampreia said the developing countries "strongly" felt it  was  not up to the preparatory committee for the WTO to discuss "any  substantive issue" which was not part of the final package of  the Uruguay Round negotiations, except "trade and environment"  which was raised in a specific draft "ministerial decision."    The ambassador pointed to a statement by GATT Director  General Peter Sutherland last January 20 in which he told  delegation heads the Marrakesh conference should "focus  primarily on the implementation" of the results of the Uruguay  Round.    The GATT chief in the same statement warned it would be  "unrealistic" to try to negotiate in the run-up to the Marrakesh  meeting "new agreements or mandates in areas which were not  envisaged" when the Round was closed on December 15.    Lampreia noted that Sutherland had underscored in his  remarks  that the participating ministers would have an opportunity, in  their individual statements to the conference, to "indicate  their wishes for new areas of activity to be taken up by the  WTO."    The Brazilian ambassador said it was "the considered view"  of  the developing nations as a group that "the attainment of higher  labour standards is fundamentally a matter of debate within each  individual sovereign state."    He warned against attempts to establish a link between such  issues and trade, "instead of reflecting any legitimate concern  for conditions of work in developing countries and the  protection of human rights."    This, he said, "can actually result in protectionist  measures  designed to nullify or offset comparative advantage, and  jeopardize the efforts being made by governments to raise wages  and improve social conditions."</p>

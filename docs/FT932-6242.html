			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Textile company fined record sum for racial bias A YORKSHIRE textile company that threatened to dismiss its night shift workers, all Asians, for refusing to accept new working practices was found guilty yesterday of racial discrimination and fined a record Pounds 229,000 by an industrial tribunal. Mainly white workers on day and evening shifts at John Haggas, a publicly quoted worsted spinner, had not been threatened with disciplinary action when they refused to take on the same extra duties last year. The award, after a three-day hearing, was the largest ever against a single employer because of the number of plaintiffs. Individually their awards were not high, the largest being Pounds 4,000. However, Mr Anthony Morris, the Leeds industrial tribunal chairman, said he would have considered higher awards if the maximum compensation allowable had been higher than Pounds 10,000. Mr Brian Haggas, chairman of John Haggas, which denied racial discrimination, said: 'Nobody was made redundant. On the face of it, this seems a very harsh ruling.' Mr Goolam Meeran, counsel for the workers, most of whom do not speak English, said he was pleased with the decision. 'I think justice has been done and more importantly, has been seen to have been done.' The case was brought to the tribunal with the assistance of the TGWU general union. Mr Morris, who said the company was guilty of direct discrimination, said it was clear that the Asian night shift workers were threatened and warned. He said the steps taken against them were not taken against the white day and evening shift workers. He awarded Pounds 1,000 each to 33 workers not affected by the change in working practices but who received a threatening letter from Mr Haggas warning that the entire night shift would be closed if their colleagues did not conform. The remaining 49, who were given final warnings, were awarded Pounds 4,000 each. Mr Robert Ginty, the general manager, said the extra work was introduced to stave off the effects of recession and disciplinary measures were brought against the night shift because it was thought they would offer opposition. Mr Morris said the company had a history of maintaining a racial split in its workforce. He ordered the company to adopt the Race Relations Code of Practice on equal treatment of the workforce.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (3): In unknown territory - Diplomats see opportunities - and new perils THE new world order of the 1990s tempts Israeli diplomacy with unprecedented opportunities. The accompanying disorder haunts it with unprecedented dangers. The good news for Israel is that its Arab neighbours can no longer rely on the Soviet Union to back them in international forums, to supply them with advanced weapons or to bail them out if they overbid their hand. They have little choice but to ingratiate themselves with the US. Operation Desert Storm cut President Saddam Hussein of Iraq's army, the most powerful in the Arab world, down to size and divided Israel's potential enemies. The danger of unconventional Iraqi attack, or of a coordinated eastern front, has receded. For the first time since the 1948 war over Israel's foundation as a state, all the parties directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict are negotiating. And since the June elections, Israel has a government which has staked its political capital on making peace, unlike its predecessor under Mr Yitzhak Shamir which appeared interested in the process largely as an exercise in public relations. The bad news from Israel's perspective is that the collapse of central control in the former Soviet Union has threatened an international supermarket in nuclear know-how and materials. The taboo of non-proliferation is eroding and other suppliers - China and India among them - are joining the rush. Israel's most dedicated foe, the Islamic regime in Iran, has the money and the motivation to buy into the nuclear family and break Israel's regional nuclear monopoly. At the same time, the end of the Cold War has reduced mainstream demand for sophisticated weapons and the recession has made it very difficult for American and other Western producers to turn away Arab business. If the choice is between thousands of aerospace jobs in St Louis, Missouri, and upsetting the Middle East balance, the jobs tend to win. The peace process itself has stimulated hardliners on both sides. Islamic fundamentalists and Palestinian rejectionists have stepped up attacks, with everything from knives and molotov cocktails to sub-machine guns and car bombs both within Israel and in the occupied territories. The Shi'ite Hizbollah, inspired actively by Iran and passively by Syria, is harassing Israel and its proxy militia in southern Lebanon and, occasionally, in Israel itself. On the Israeli side, the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have seized on the government's readiness for at least partial withdrawal on the Golan Heights to revive their campaign against territorial compromise on any front. And the most extreme are more disposed to take the law into their own hands. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister, will not be put off easily. 'I believe that we are on a path of no return,' he told a Tel Aviv University audience in mid-November. He remained confident that peace would be reached, even if it took another year or two. 'The reality of the international situation, the regional situation, the genuine need of nations and countries, is to arrive at a resolution of the dispute,' he argued. 'Therefore, even if my position was not received enthusiastically, certainly not in regard to the Golan Heights, I am convinced that we must continue on our way. 'We must distinguish between dealing with terror and continuing, even as we grit our teeth, with the negotiations, and not giving those who wish to sabotage the peace process by means of terror the pleasure of stopping the negotiations.' On a broader canvass, Mr Yossi Beilin, the deputy foreign minister, defined the object of Israeli diplomacy as 'to use the new situation in order to become a more welcome member of the international club'. The peace process has already yielded dividends. Israel now has diplomatic relations with 120 countries, the highest number in its 44 year history. Before the 1967 war, the figure was 96. After the 1973 Yom Kippur war, it fell to a low of 62. Mr Beilin mapped Israel's course: closer integration with the European Community; a constructive role in the rebuilding of the former Soviet republics; cooperation with the new US administration; a concerted international effort to restrict the transfer of nuclear capability, which he described as a 'cloud hanging over us all the time'. Although the team surrounding President-elect Bill Clinton are not exactly strangers in Jerusalem, Israel is bracing for a change of emphasis on the part of its staunchest ally and most generous benefactor. Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, the former deputy foreign minister and current frontrunner to succeed Mr Shamir as leader of the opposition Likud party, has warned his countrymen to prepare for a sharp drop in US aid, now running at Dollars 3bn a year, as the focus in the US shifts to the domestic agenda. Washington is expected nonetheless to continue working for Middle East peace, if only because the stability of a region which supplies such a large proportion of its energy needs is essential for Western economic recovery. As Mr Beilin put it: 'They understand the linkage between home and foreign policy.'</p>

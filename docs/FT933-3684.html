			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Bonn nursing row is threat to coalition: Parties fall out over who will pay for social security scheme THE STABILITY of Germany's ruling coalition was called into question this weekend in a new row over how to finance the latest addition to the country's generous social security system - nursing care for the elderly and handicapped. At the heart of the conflict is a fundamental difference on who should pay most for the future scheme, workers or employers. The Free Democratic Party (FDP), the minority partner in the government, warned that a cross-party compromise between Chancellor's Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) could destroy the fragile basis of the coalition, a year before the next elections. The FDP says that any compromise which would put a greater financing burden on employers now would be disastrous for the German economy and for the competitiveness of German companies internationally. Such a deal would also isolate the FDP and reinforce the trend towards a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU. Leading members of the FDP reacted furiously at the weekend to moves by Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister, to reopen the whole question of financing the nursing care scheme in talks with the SPD. A first round of talks on Friday saw moves towards a compromise. Mr Rudolf Dressler, social affairs spokesman for the SPD, said there was an agreement to 'put on ice' the present proposal, which is bitterly opposed by the German trade union movement. A second round of talks has been scheduled for next Saturday, two days before the unions launch a national campaign to block the proposal. The present plan is backed by the FDP because it would ease the burden on German employers, by reducing from three days to two the period they must provide guaranteed sick pay for their workers. An alternative solution under discussion would instead cancel two days from the annual list of paid holidays given to German workers, though this is likely to run into opposition from the third partner in the ruling coalition, the Bavaria-based and staunchly Roman Catholic Christian Social Union. Mr Dieter-Julius Cronenberg, FDP deputy chairman of the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, warned that, if the CDU and CSU sought compromises from their partners, it would 'destroy the basis of trust for further co-operation in the government'. Mr Kohl is determined to push through the nursing care plan before the next elections, not least because of its appeal to old voters. It would help counter the negative impact of the government's cuts in social spending which will come in next year - including cuts in both unemployment benefit and social assistance. The social cuts are under attack not only from the SPD and unions, but are also set to be criticised by the 'social' wing of the CDU itself at its annual conference in Berlin, which opens today. Hopes that Germany's three main political parties would agree on a presidential candidate will collapse today when the governing Christian Democratic Union and the opposition Social Democratic party nominate their own candidates, Judy Dempsey writes from Berlin. Mr Kohl will ask his CDU party conference in Berlin to endorse Mr Steffen Heitmann, justice minister of the eastern state of Saxony. The choice reflects Mr Kohl's determination to have as president an easterner, as well as someone who reflects conservative values aimed at attracting the hard-right wing of the CDU. By contrast, the Social Democratic party will today endorse Mr Johannes Rau, the current prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the coalition, has urged Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former foreign minister, to become its candidate. Mr Genscher has refused but, if public opinion continues to swing in his favour, may not take much more persuading to accept. Mr Kohl would not welcome his former rival as a strong president.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MAGADAN HITTING FOR THE METS -- WHEN HE PLAYS  </P> <P> The Dave Magadan situation is reminiscent of a similar situation the New York  Mets faced with Howard Johnson a few years ago.  </P> <P> The Mets were reluctant to give Johnson a regular job. He could play in the  infield and outfield, but the Mets felt he would not do well as an everyday  player.  </P> <P> Injuries forced them to give Johnson full-time duty in 1987. In the next three  seasons, he was the most consistent player on the team and hit 96 home runs.  </P> <P> Although he is the hottest hitter on the club, the Mets are reluctant to give  Magadan, also a versatile player, regular status. It can only be a matter of  time.  </P> <P> Magadan had two hits and drove in two runs Tuesday night at New York as the  Mets, behind David Cone's four-hitter, beat St. Louis, 6-0.  </P> <P> Kevin McReynolds, Orlando Mercaado and Johnson hit home runs for the Mets, who  have won nine of 11 and moved to within five games of first place in the East.  </P> <P> "I'm forced to look at the lineup card every day. I've not been told I'm a  regular," Magadan said. "I have hit safely in nine games and reached a high  point.  </P> <P> "Just two weeks ago, I hit the low point. Mike (Marshall) was hurt. I wasn't in  the lineup. Tom O'Malley was at first."  </P> <P> Manager Bud Harrelson would not say that Magadan was in the lineup to stay.  "We're flexible," he said.  </P> <P> Cone, who had a no-hitter in his last start wiped out because of rain after 3  2/3 innings, was in the rain again. "I can't worry about what I can't control,"  he said. "I just kept pitching."  </P> <P> San Diego 4, San Francisco 3 -- Clutch relief pitching by former Giant Craig  Lefferts put an end to the Giants' nine-game winning streak in this game at San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Lefferts got Will Clark with the bases loaded on a fly ball in the seventh,  then in the ninth, disposed of Kevin Mitchell with the potential tying and  winning run on base on a popup to end the game.  </P> <P> Gary Carter of the Giants set a National League record when he caught his  1,862nd game. The old record was held by Al Lopez over 18 seasons. Carter is in  his 16th.  </P> <P> Pitcher Don Robinson of the Giants hit a pinch-homer with the bases empty in  the fifth inning. It was the 12th homer of his career.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 2, Pittsburgh 1 -- Dickie Thon singled to left field with two out  in the 10th inning at Philadelphia to score John Kruk from second with the  winning run.  </P> <P> Kruk, who drove in the first run, singled and reached second on a hit by Randy  Ready. Bill Landrum was the losing pitcher.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 4-0, Atlanta 2-3 -- Charlie Leibrandt, who started his major league  career more than a decade ago with the Reds, put a halt to their six-game  winning streak in the second game at Atlanta.  </P> <P> With Chris Sabo hitting a home run and Glenn Braggs driving in the go-ahead  run, the Reds rallied for three runs in the ninth inning to win the opener.  </P> <P> But Leibrandt, in his fourth start since coming off the disabled list June 2,  was superb in the second game. He held the leaders of the West to six hits. It  was his second complete game and his first shutout in more than 1 1/2 years.  </P> <P> The Braves beat former teammate Rick Mahler, getting a two-run jump in the  first inning. First baseman Todd Benzinger's error started the attack. Jim  Presley homered in the eighth for the other run.  </P> <P> The Braves led, 2-1, until Sabo homered with one out in the ninth inning. Eric  Davis walked, stole second and scored the winning run on Braggs' single.  </P> <P> Chicago 2, Montreal 1 -- Spike Owen set a league record for a shortstop by  handling his only chance at Montreal. The Expo shortstop has gone 61 games  without an error.  </P> <P> Two of the league's best young pitchers hooked up, with the Cubs' Shawn Boskie  getting edge over Mark Gardner. Boskie had a no-hitter until one was out in the  fifth inning.  </P> <P> Ryne Sandberg walked in the fourth, stole second and scored on Andre Dawson's  single, the first hit off Gardner. Sandberg hit his 19th home run in the ninth,  and it turned out to be a needed run. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

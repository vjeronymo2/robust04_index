			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PINPOINT LANDING CAPS DISCOVERY'S BRILLIANT MISSION  </P> <P> Sweeping down over a near-record crowd of 450,000 jubilant spectators, the  space shuttle Discovery glided in to a triumphant landing here Saturday  morning, ending a five-day, $375-million mission that National Aeronautics and  Space Administration officials termed nearly perfect.  </P> <P> After 79 orbits during which the astronauts launched a $100-million satellite,  tested a heat radiator for the proposed space station and photographed large  sections of the Earth's surface in an attempt to monitor environmental damage,  Cmdr. Michael Coats and pilot John Blaha eased the 195,000-pound Discovery down  precisely on the center of the long concrete runway here at 6:36 a.m.  </P> <P> Celebrating the third successful shuttle mission since the January, 1986,  explosion that destroyed the Challenger, Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a veteran  astronaut and head of the shuttle program, exulted: "We're back."  </P> <P> Many of the crowd seemed to share his view. "It was wonderful. It gave me goose  bumps and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up," said Jackie Gillespie  of Lake Forest. "The emotional quiet before it landed was really amazing, with  everybody holding their breath," added Jim Simpson of Thousand Oaks. "It was  uplifting."  </P> <P> Coats, 43, Blaha, 46, and crew members James Bagian, 37, Robert Springer, 46,  and James Buchli, 43, made a brief, emotional appearance before boarding a jet  for Houston nearly five hours after touchdown.  </P> <P> "Thank God for America," Blaha said. "We have a free country. We have a great  educational system that produces engineering expertise that allows us to build  something like this space shuttle. So we're blessed. God bless you and God  bless America."  </P> <P> After a brief inspection of the Discovery, Truly said that the orbiter and its  heat-shielding tiles came through virtually unscathed, a sharp contrast to the  Atlantis mission in January in which the tiles were heavily pitted, most likely  as a result of insulation that broke free from the nose of one booster rocket  during separation.  </P> <P> Modifications made to Discovery to prevent insulation from breaking loose were  apparently successful, Truly said. "The vehicle is as clean as any orbiter that  I personally have ever seen," he said. "There is almost no visible tile  damage."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seven Missions Planned  </P> <P> The most important goal of this mission, the first of seven scheduled for 1989,  was the launch of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to complete a  globe-girdling communications network that allows the space agency to keep in  touch with the shuttle during 85% of its orbit.  </P> <P> One TDRS was launched before the Challenger disaster and the second on the  first post-Challenger flight. Completion of the network will allow the agency  to close five ground tracking stations for an annual savings of $27 million.  </P> <P> The TDRS system also allowed ground controllers to maintain contact with  Discovery during its re-entry blackout period when ionized gases prevent normal  communications with the ground -- the first time such contact has been  achieved.  </P> <P> With the tracking system complete, Truly said, "Now the fun begins," referring  to a series of science-oriented missions NASA has planned. In April, the  orbiter Atlantis will launch the $530-million Magellan probe to Venus, which  will use radar to map 80% of the planet's surface. Other planned scientific  missions include the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Ulysses mission to orbit  the sun and the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gamma Ray  Observatory.  </P> <P> NASA will also launch Department of Defense payloads in two classified shuttle  missions this summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experiment With Rats  </P> <P> After the landing, four crippled rats who were aboard Discovery, as well as  four others in a control group kept on the ground, were killed with injections  of sodium pentobarbital. A non-weight-bearing bone in one hind leg of each rat  was severed before launch in the experiment to learn how fast bones heal in the  weightlessness of space compared to Earth.  </P> <P> The estimated 450,000 people who viewed the landing was second in size only to  the 500,000 who viewed the July 4, 1982, landing of Columbia, the fourth  shuttle mission, which was also attended by then-President Ronald Reagan. NASA  officials had predicted only 200,000 would attend this weekend, about the same  number who had viewed the first post-Challenger landing last October. Many of  the visitors said they would not have been able to attend had the landing not  been on a Saturday.  </P></p>

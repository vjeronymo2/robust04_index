			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bank Austria defies audit authority BANK Austria, the country's largest bank, is expected to continue resisting demands that it submit to an audit by the state auditing office (Rechnungshof). Yesterday, Mr Helmut Zilk, the mayor of Vienna, ordered the bank to comply with the Rechnungshof's demand. A foundation controlled by the city has a majority stake in the bank. The national government holds another 25 per cent. The Rechnungshof's auditors attempted to enter the bank earlier this month but were blocked. Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive, said then that Bank Austria was a private company and therefore not subject to normal state audits. Mr Siegfried Sellitsch, chairman of the bank's supervisory board, said foreign shareholders, including Italy's Cariplo and Germany's Hamburg-Mannheimer-Versicherung, were particularly upset about the prospect of public control. The bank's supervisory board and board of directors are to discuss the matter on June 17. They are likely to appeal to the minister of finance and, if that fails, to Austria's supreme court for administrative cases. Mr Haiden has indicated that he would consider taking the case to the European Court.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Observer: Bad survey Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, doesn't seem too keen on chartered surveyors. Why was it, he asked a property conference yesterday, that the surveyors employed by Boots had to be trained from first principles in almost every area of commercial life from the rudiments of marketing to constructing a business plan? And why was it, he continued, that while so many Boots managers work in jobs remote from their professional training, all the surveyors in the company are in positions directly associated with property? Surely, he argued, surveyors should be capable of pursuing broader business careers. Could this view have anything to do with the fact that Boots' outgoing chairman, Sir Christopher Benson, is a well-known chartered surveyor?</p>

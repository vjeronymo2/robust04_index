			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THIS TEAM WILL REIGN ON A PARADE  </P> <P> Aguy asked a good question on a radio call-in show. When the Rams win the Super  Bowl, he wondered, will Georgia Frontiere hold the victory parade in Los  Angeles (the team's name) or in Anaheim (the team's home)?  </P> <P> Personally, I think the parade should start in one town and finish in the  other. Considering California traffic, I figure it'll take only two or three  days.  </P> <P> Anyway, let's have a parade, shall we? Win or lose the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> Because the Rams are going to the Super Bowl, you know.  </P> <P> That sound you just heard was John Robinson throwing the breakfast dishes.  </P> <P> He hates to read stuff like this. Hates to hear talk like this.  </P> <P> You know, cocky talk.  </P> <P> He's afraid the San Francisco 49ers will tack it up on their bulletin board and  then accuse the Rams of being too cocky.  </P> <P> Big-mouth Buddy Ryan and the bigger-mouth Philadelphia Eagles tried it, and  just look at what the Rams did to them. They stuck it to the Eagles,  horns-first. All that cheap talk by the Eagles really got the Rams' goats.  </P> <P> So, let me make this perfectly clear, right up front. This isn't the Rams  talking big. It's me talking big about the Rams.  </P> <P> They are going to beat the 49ers for the NFC championship Sunday at Candlestick  Park, trust me.  </P> <P> Why? Because they're there.  </P> <P> And then we all go dancing in downtown New Orleans for Super Bowl XXIV, in  which the Rams, who originated in Cleveland, will be playing . . . ta-da!  Cleveland.  </P> <P> Yes, it's going to be a Super Bowl pitting the original Los Angeles Rams  against the current Los Angeles Rams, neither of whom play in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Start planning the parade.  </P> <P> Look, you know and I know that it's not wise to underestimate the San Francisco  49ers. They have the quarterback, Joe (Magic) Montana, and the Roger Craig who  doesn't manage the baseball team, and today's catch-of-the-day specials, Jerry  Rice and John Taylor.  </P> <P> They also have this coach, George Seifert, who replaced Bill Walsh and  resembles Bob Uecker. The guy's done a nice job. He's no "genius" like Walsh,  but he's at least a semi-genius.  </P> <P> It just won't be enough.  </P> <P> The Rams are primed for prime-time. They are ready to stop fooling around with  this daytime stuff and start playing late-night football, just the way CBS and  NBC and ABC like it.  </P> <P> They learned their lesson the last time they played at night, that terrible  Monday against San Francisco. They learned that you have to keep playing for  all four quarters, no matter how late it's getting to be. And they learned to  put as many points on the board as possible, because against the Niners, too  many points aren't enough.  </P> <P> If the Rams are leading, say, 27-3, in the fourth quarter Sunday, don't turn  off your television sets. The 49ers may just be getting warmed up.  </P> <P> I'm taking the Rams in this game, though, and I don't care who knows it. I'm  picking my team, pulling for my boys. Call me Homer.  </P> <P> Beat S.F.!  </P> <P> Beat S.F.!  </P> <P> Beat S.F.!  </P> <P> So, no more of that negative-media stuff from any of you people out there. I've  had it with that. I am behind my Rams this week, 110%. No, make it 115. This is  our year.  </P> <P> I like the Rams a lot, because they are an exciting offensive team, because  they are a scrappy defensive team, and because they are not moving to Oakland  or Sacramento. I hate it when teams move to Oakland or Sacramento, don't you? I  know Kansas City does.  </P> <P> Sunday's game should be pretty entertaining. The 49ers and Craig probably will  try to run on the Rams, having seen the way the New York Giants plowed through  the Doug Reed-less L.A. defense. On the other hand, the Giants ran at the Rams  for four quarters of football, and still scored only 13 points.  </P> <P> The Rams may try to exploit a suspect San Francisco offensive line. Yet, this  same line held off Minnesota last week, keeping Montana from being sacked even  once. I expect Kevin Greene and his Ram-tough friends to take this as a  personal challenge. Come on, boys, don't rain on my parade.  </P> <P> The big thing for the Rams is to believe. To believe they can do it. To believe  the 49ers can be beaten. That's half the fight. These guys aren't unbeatable,  for heaven's sake. Green Bay beat the 49ers. The Rams beat Green Bay. Heck, the  Rams beat the 49ers.  </P> <P> I sincerely believe that the Rams are ready to rock and roll. If the 49ers want  to put that on their bulletin board, let them. I'll do the talking for the  Rams. You won't hear a peep out of them this week, so I'll take care of their  peeping. The Rams are going to win.  </P> <P> There, that wasn't so negative, was it?  </P></p>

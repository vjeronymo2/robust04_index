			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTS ON LETTER ABOUT JURY DUTY  </P> <P> Having read Judy Perry's letter in the May 28 Orange County Edition of The  Times, "How Jury Duty Alters View of Legal System," I understand her  disappointment with the vacuous, would-be jury panelists surrounding her.  </P> <P> I am reminded, therefore, of the old joke regarding anyone facing justice  before the American legal system. It goes like this: "Would you want your life  in the hands of 12 people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty?"  </P> <P> I rest my case.  </P> <P> STEPHEN C. LEE  </P> <P> La Habra  </P></p>

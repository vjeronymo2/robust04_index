			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: MERGER MANIA AT AD AGENCIES JUST WON'T SELL  </P> <P> Hype strikes again. Another big buyout looms in the advertising world with the  $725-million bid by Britain's WPP Group to take over Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which  would be the latest of half a dozen U.S. ad agencies to be bought by British  companies.  </P> <P> At the same time, U.S. companies have bought British agencies, French  advertising companies are threatening to buy the British -- and Dentsu of  Japan, one of the world's largest ad agencies, hasn't even entered the fray.  </P> <P> What's behind it? The concept of global media. That's the idea that because  hundreds of millions of people in many countries now buy similar, if not  identical products -- a Toyota in France being little different from one in  Bangkok or Baltimore -- the communications media have a growing value.  </P> <P> The spirit driving advertising mergers is similar to the thinking behind Time  Inc. merging with Warner Communications, or Sony buying CBS Records, or Rupert  Murdoch owning newspapers on three continents and launching satellite TV  channels. The idea is that a global communicator can reach more customers  economically than a national one.  </P> <P> The difficulty is in deciding which medium to put your money on. Newspapers  have survived competition from TV, but now worry about direct-response  advertising through the mails and computers. Broadcast television is worried by  cable, and cable is worried by potential competition from telephone companies  stringing fiber optics into the home.  </P> <P> The only certainty, it seems, is that an advertising agency will be part of the  process of reaching customers. No matter what medium is used, the agency will  channel the advertiser's message.  </P> <P> As Alan Gottesman, analyst for the Paine Webber investment firm, sums it up:  "If you're not sure which spoke will bear the weight, it always makes sense to  bet on the hub."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Behind the Scenes Fees  </P> <P> That's the concept, and financial markets are buying it. But a caution here for  investors who might think that advertising firms are sure-fire merger  candidates: There's a flaw in the concept and a weakness in the current  takeover wave.  </P> <P> So be wary as you see consolidation in the ad business continue, as it will.  For there are reasons smaller firms are merging into larger holding companies.  It has to do with fees and services behind the scenes, where the money really  is made in the ad business.  </P> <P> The ad game may be known for creative symbols, from the Volkswagen bug to the  California raisins, but the money is made in less glamorous production  services, in fees for filming and printing, for distribution, for this and that  service. Ogilvy's attraction for WPP in fact may lie less in its stylish ads  than in its No. 1 position in direct response advertising.  </P> <P> "Today's merger makers are not ad people," says Jerry Della Femina, head of  Della Femina, McNamee WCRS Inc., "they're building communications companies."  </P> <P> Yes, but if that's such a good idea, why aren't big American investors -- the  Bass brothers or the Pritzkers -- being more aggressive about it?  </P> <P> Simple. Because advertising is becoming a less profitable business. That's  where the flaw is. The big companies being created are not inherently more  profitable than the smaller firms they're gobbling up.  </P> <P> Advertising companies as a rule made higher returns on capital years ago than  they do today. That results, says Gottesman, from international giants adding  staff and costs at the same time that advertisers are driving down the rates  they're willing to pay.  </P> <P> So costs are growing but not profits -- guaranteeing that someday soon the very  companies now being put together will be dismantled.  </P> <P> But meanwhile, if you're small, you're at a disadvantage in bidding for  business, says Della Femina -- a creative legend who recently gave us the Joe  Isuzu commercials. Della Femina sold out last year to a British firm, White,  Collins, Rutherford &amp; Scott.  </P> <P> The British have been most prominent in advertising mergers: Saatchi &amp;  Saatchi owns Ted Bates, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample and Backer &amp; Spielvogel;  WPP owns J. Walter Thompson and now wants Ogilvy.  </P> <P> But an accounting anomaly helps explain that prominence, and therein lies  another weakness in the current takeover wave. British accounting rules allow  firms to increase reported profits through mergers faster than would be the  case for U.S. companies.  </P> <P> That makes British ad firms look more profitable than they otherwise might be  and also indicates that the economics behind those takeovers is artificial. To  the extent that it is so, the merger wave is vulnerable to correction in the  stock market.  </P> <P> But correction may not come immediately. The latest news is that French  advertising agencies are threatening the British with takeovers.  </P> <P> So the buyout game will go on until that moment when somebody wakes up and asks  whether merger prices make sense -- that moment, as Madison Avenue might put  it, when they run up the flag and nobody salutes.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With regard to U.S. moves for the revival of the  Super 301 provision, the Japanese Government observes that  "because it is President Clinton's campaign pledge, there is a  great possibility of the revival," (as stated by an official at  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). However,  some Japanese Government officials doubt whether the Super 301  provision will be actually invoked as a retaliatory measure in  the wake of the recent breakdown in the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks.    The Super 301 provision requires the U.S. Government to  consider sanctions based on an annual report on trade barriers  which is issued every spring. For this reason, the revival of  the Super 301 provision does not mean an immediate retaliatory  action. In 1989, the U.S. Government studied a possibility of  imposing sanctions against Japan over disputes concerning  satellites, supercomputers, and timber products. However,  sanctions were avoided because an agreement was reached in the  Japan-U.S. negotiations.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sudden interest rate fear upsets confidence - Market Report The stock market had the wind taken out of its sails yesterday by the turmoil in gilt-edged stocks which culminated in warning cries that the authorities planned a 'pre-emptive strike' by raising base rates without waiting for inflationary pressures to force the decision on them. The FT-SE 100 Index was down by 26.2 in late afternoon after the authorities had apparently condoned a rise in UK Treasury bill rates to 5.75 per cent from the existing 4.99 per cent rate. Such a move has traditionally been the warning for a base rate hike, but uncertainty still prevailed when markets closed in London. The Treasury bill move was not the only factor disturbing interest rate assumptions yesterday. But London was helped at the close by firmness in US Federal bonds after favourable news on US gross domestic product growth in the second quarter. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,082.6 for a net loss on the day of 13.3 points. Trading volume was not particularly heavy and there were no signs of undue selling. Most strategists continued to doubt whether the authorities intend to raise base rates in the short term, but pointed to Wednesday's money market repurchase operation as the nearest indication of policy. By the end of the session, short-dated government bonds, the most closely linked to base rate expectations, had fallen by nearly half a point. Longer dates, however, ended an erratic day with gains of around  3/8 as investors took the view that an early increase in base rates would take the steam out of inflationary pressures. The late advance in long dated gilts proved no help to the equity sector, although a gain of 23 Dow points in early trading on Wall Street did give some relief to a somewhat confused London stock market. Equities opened formly, helped by the confident trend in utility stocks following the Ofwat price review of the water industry companies and by Thursday's half time results from ICI. Encouraged also by initial gains in stock index futures, the Footsie advanced by more than 11 points. The banking sector turned easier, however, as interim results from Lloyds Bank failed to please the analysts. But gains were soon reversed when by what appeared to be an unfortunate leak of the latest British Purchasing Managers' Index, showing it at a record high of 62.2 per cent in July; the index itself was then published, a day earlier than expected. This whiff of inflation quickly hit bond prices and equities soon followed them downwards, with futures markets, as usual, setting the trend. From then on, the stock market remained in thrall to gilts and to developments on the interest rate front. A further cause for worry came when the market remembered that the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin is due on Wednesday and may well bring stronger comments on inflation prospects from the Bank. At last night's close, the FT-SE 100 Index was about one per cent down over the week, with yesterday's fall contributing substantially to the week's loss of 32 points. Most equity strategists, while accepting that base rates are likely to move up before the end of the year, had been doubtful that any early move was on the cards; however, yesterday's developments may inspire some hurried rethinking of opinions. Equity trading volume has remained good, with retail or customer business worth Pounds 1.39bn on Thursday. Seaq turnover reached 507.8m shares yesterday, compared with 657m in the previous session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index eased 2.6 to 3,640.2 yesterday, with second line stocks providing 56 per cent of total market volume.</p>

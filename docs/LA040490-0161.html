Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> KIDS SET DODGER STADIUM DATE  </P> <P> The New Kids on the Block -- the pop music group with hordes of screaming and  fainting young fans -- have made it to the big leagues.  </P> <P> MCA Concerts announced Tuesday that the New Kids will perform at Dodger Stadium  on Friday, Sept. 14.  </P> <P> Tickets will go on sale at Ticketmaster at 9 a.m. on Saturday, April 21, with  all seats $25. The event will be the first local MCA Concerts promotion outside  the Universal Amphitheatre since the 1982 Simon and Garfunkel reunion show,  also at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> The New Kids just wound up a sellout 106-date North America arena tour and are  now on a sellout European tour. The Dodger stadium date is part of a "Magic  Summer Tour" of 29 stadiums and 31 arenas -- including Joe Robbie Stadium in  Miami (50,000 seats) and Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium (55,000 seats).  </P></p>

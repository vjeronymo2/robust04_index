			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 PROSECUTORS FIRED OVER ARMENIA ROLES;  </P> <P> 4 OTHERS ASSAILED FOR FAILING TO PREVENT MURDERS IN ETHNIC CLASHES  </P> <P> Three state prosecutors in Soviet Armenia have been fired for failing to  prevent the spread of ethnic unrest in the troubled republic last month, the  Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Friday.  </P> <P> In addition, four other prosecutors were severely reprimanded and another was  told that he would not be reappointed when his term of office expires.  </P> <P> The prosecutors all worked in districts that were the scene of clashes between  Armenians, who are predominantly Christian, and minority Azerbaijanis, who are  mostly Muslim. About 20 people were killed in the violence in December alone.  </P> <P> The ethnic troubles are centered on Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region  which is under the administrative rule of the republic of Azerbaijan. Armenians  have been campaigning for a year for the area to be transferred to control of  the Armenian republic, but Soviet authorities have rejected the demand.  </P> <P> Pravda said the prosecutors had failed to prevent the murder of innocent  individuals, and accused one of the officials of making "concessions" to the  Karabakh committee, which has led the Armenian opposition. Tens of thousands of  refugees have fled the area because of the violence. Soviet officials have  accused local Armenian leaders of looking the other way or encouraging violence  against Azerbaijanis.  </P> <P> Writing in Komsomoloskaya Pravda, the Soviet youth newspaper, one of the  country's most conservative journalists Friday complained that "parallel  echelons of power" had arisen in Armenia in the wake of the violence and the  devastating earthquake that killed an estimated tens of thousands last month.  </P> <P> "Government services don't just fail to function," wrote Elena Losoto. "They  refuse to accept responsibility for their actions."  </P> <P> She said most services only pretend to exist and she suggested that neighboring  Georgia was quicker to respond to the Armenian earthquake than were Armenian  officials.  </P> <P> The rise of so-called "parallel structures," an apparent reference to the  Karabakh committee and the like, will never be stopped entirely, Losoto wrote.  She recommended the "re-creation" of the party and government apparatus in the  republic and said that until then, the burden will have to be shouldered by  Armenia's "Russian brother."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Warm Clothing  </P> <P> The newspaper Socialist Industry also criticized the Armenian authorities for  failing to distribute accumulated aid in the aftermath of the earthquake.  </P> <P> "To this day, many people, adults and children alike, are without warm outer  clothing or shoes," the newspaper said. "But sack loads are piled up in every  Yerevan (the capital) warehouse and in rail cars standing at railway sidings."  </P> <P> Many of the survivors of the quake had escaped harm by dashing outdoors without  dressing against the cold and have been left to live in tents without overcoats  and warm shoes.  </P> <P> The newspaper said $3.8 million was needed to provide clothing and shoes for  the victims and complained that money collected in a special bank account for  the victims was lying unused.  </P> <P> "Surely the voluntary contributions by the thousands and thousands of  organizations and citizens of our country can be used to provide the most  urgent needs of the countless victims of the quake," the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, according to the news agency Reuters, the Red Army newspaper  criticized the growth of independent political groups in Moldavia amid signs  that a revival of nationalist sentiment among minorities has spread to the  Soviet republic.  </P> <P> Red Star, in the first detailed account to appear in the central Soviet press,  described how groups in the republic were setting up cells in workplaces and  rejecting contacts with the ruling Communist Party.  </P> <P> "One cannot help noting that activists have continuing contacts with emissaries  arriving from similar movements in the Baltic republics and regularly exchange  with them the experience of their work," the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Moldavia -- like the Baltic republics, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia -- was  incorporated into the Soviet Union as a result of secret clauses in the 1939  Nazi-Soviet pact.  </P> <P> The criticism follows signs of a revival of nationalist feelings among ethnic  Moldavians, who make up about two-thirds of the population of the 4.2  million-strong republic, which was created in 1940 largely out of Romanian  territory.  </P> <P> In a clear parallel with developments last year in the Baltic republics,  demands have been concentrated on national culture and language which have been  suppressed under Soviet rule.  </P></p>

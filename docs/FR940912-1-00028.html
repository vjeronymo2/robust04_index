			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Cost Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fifth-year cost impacts of the proposed standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are considered to be reasonable. Total annualized cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule in the fifth year, on a nationwide basis, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated at $8.8 million. This results in a cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of about $540 per Mg of emission reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth-year national capital cost is estimated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $5.8 million. The estimated cost impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume that most of the regulated SOCMI plants with affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process units have an existing steam stripping system with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient excess capacity to treat the wastewater streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under the NSPS or will be able to modify steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stripping systems that are currently being designed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructed for compliance with other regulations (e.g., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HON) to add sufficient capacity to treat the wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams covered by the proposed NSPS that do not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control under these other regulations. The estimate also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that a small number (about 12 percent) do not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an existing steam stripper and will have to install a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. These assumptions reflect the Agency's best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate of the way the industry will comply with the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule is not expected to pose significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse economic impacts. The impact estimates are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced assuming the costs of control are passed on to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer, as is the case in competitive markets in the long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run. The EPA estimates, on average, a maximum price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase of less than 1 percent for SOCMI chemicals. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes the entire mix of chemicals produced by an affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI facility are proportionately affected by the NSPS, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that the chemicals produced at those SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities in the EPA database are reasonably representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the mix of chemicals in the industry. The market price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of specific chemicals may be greater than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average presented above. This may be especially true for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected chemicals produced in low volumes and affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals that have lower-than-average market prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemicals with lower-than-average prices could experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher-than-average control costs per unit of revenue. Due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to economies of scale in pollution control, affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals that are produced in low volumes are likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a higher-than-average cost of control per unit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production. The feature of the proposed rule that exempts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low volume wastewater streams from selected process units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may mitigate the price impact of low production volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals that produce low volume waste streams. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there will be no adverse effects on industry employment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion because the proposed standards will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appreciably affect the demand for chemicals covered by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

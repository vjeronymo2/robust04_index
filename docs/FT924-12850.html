			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Sweden deal helps to jump-start D-Mark sector SWEDEN'S DM2.5bn financing last week, the largest Eurobond in the D-Mark sector to date, is widely seen as a turning point in the market's development. Despite the importance of the currency, the D-Mark sector has lagged others in the Eurobond market, failing to modernise its practices. But volume has grown steadily this year, boosted by the strength of German markets. Changes in Bundesbank rules at the beginning of August proved an important step in bringing the market into line with more liberal market practices. But last week's Swedish deal has helped jump-start the market by showing it can attract international institutional investors if high quality, liquid paper is available. The sector is now expected to take the place of the virtually defunct Ecu bond market as the leading European currency bond market. Sweden's Eurobond was priced using a mechanism known as a fixed-price reoffer, designed to ensure greater transparency for investors, and was fixed by consensus between underwriters. This method, used in other large markets, had not been tried in the D-Mark sector, with its old-fashioned pricing structure and heavy fees. The Sweden deal was 'the sort of issue and the sort of mechanism that institutional investors like', said Mr Charlie Berman, director of capital markets at Salomon Brothers. 'The promise of price consistency created fresh institutional non-bund interest.' According to one German banker: 'Sweden caught some investors who normally abstain due to the sector's lack of liquidity.' Until now, the D-Mark sector, which has no market-making system unlike other sectors, has offered poor liquidity, although an increasing number of large, tradeable issues this year had already started to address that problem. Some dealers say a system of regulated market-making should be introduced. The market is benefiting from a coincidence of supply and demand. The turmoil in currency markets created a massive flow of funds into D-Marks, perceived as a safe haven. At the same time, European sovereign borrowers need to replenish falling foreign exchange reserves and repay the Bundesbank for its foreign exchange intervention. Meanwhile, deepening recession has caused budget deficits in some countries to balloon, further increasing funding needs. The UK, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Spain and Italy are all considering tapping the German market. As well as needing the currency, it makes sense to borrow in D-Marks while it is strong. In any case, most other markets are in poor shape and would not readily absorb large offerings. The UK's offering is likely to prove the most significant for the market. A DM5bn offering, probably over five years, is widely expected. The liquidity provided by such a large issue would boost investor confidence in the sector. There is also talk that the World Bank will launch a global offering of D-Mark bonds. However, there are doubts about the market's ability to sustain interest once this spate of sovereign funding is over. Already, swap opportunities in the sector have been eroded, so funding costs are not attractive for borrowers without a need for D-Marks. Consequently, corporate borrowers are unlikely to flock to the market. Further, the expansion of the market may have to rely on international institutional investors. 'The German government and its agencies have a huge financing requirement which could monopolise domestic investors,' said one German banker. However, the wave of offerings, expected to continue this week, may create sufficient momentum, provided the necessary support structure for the secondary market is put in place. So far, investor enthusiasm is being more than matched by bankers, for whom the D-Mark market provides a focus for activity in otherwise depressed trading conditions. Banks are acting quickly to commit resources to the sector. The demise of the Ecu bond market, in which many banks had invested heavily, has left Ecu traders with little to do. 'In our opinion, there is no doubt that resources are being redirected to the D-Mark in London, as well as in other continental centres,' said Mr Len Harwood, head of capital markets at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The deployment of traders by international investment banks will provide an important injection of liquidity. In addition, German banks, faced with fresh competition, are building their forces in an effort to maintain market share as the sector opens up.</p>

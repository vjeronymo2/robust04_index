			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / EC plans 5 per cent jobless target: Employment package urges wage restraint and lower labour costs THE European Commission is calling for wage restraint, a reduction in companies' welfare obligations, and tax incentives for training, as part of a radical plan to reduce unemployment in the European Community from the current 10.4 per cent to 5 per cent by the year 2000. The plan, spelt out yesterday by Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC social affairs commissioner, aims to combine 'solidarity and competitiveness' and will form a key element of Mr Jacques Delors' White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, due to be published next month. Although Mr Flynn rejected wholesale labour market deregulation, he went further than before in spelling out the changes required to traditional forms of labour protection and the sacrifices needed from the securely employed. 'I believe we should encourage increases in hourly wages below the rate of productivity growth, not in order to reduce wages, but in order to increase the number of jobs that can be made available,' said Mr Flynn, addressing a three-day conference on employment in Europe, organised by the Commission. He also suggested making employers' non-wage social security costs less regressive to create more jobs for the less skilled and proposed switching some of those costs from employers to general taxation. This attempt to reduce the price of labour will be greeted with suspicion by Europe's trade unions. However, Mr Flynn has couched the changes in terms that will appeal to the left: 'Europe needs a new solidarity - between those with work and those without, and between those who earn their income from wages and from investments.' He also called for a progressive reduction in average hours of work per employee and for 'minimising the financial incentives for longer hours amongst the better paid'. Mr Flynn said that tinkering with the old system would no longer suffice and that 're-regulation' was required to take account of labour market changes, such as the increase in part-time and temporary work. He proposed, for example, the restructuring of government income support schemes to be combined with income from work. Mrs Miet Smets, the Belgian labour minister, said the EC should not be made a scapegoat for unemployment and claimed that without its efforts the situation would be worse. She proposed an EC-wide energy tax to promote employment and an increase in career breaks to create jobs.</p>

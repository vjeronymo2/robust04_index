			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Appointments put MFI on path towards reflotation MFI, which was the subject of one of the largest management buy-outs in the UK, has taken an important step towards reflotation with the appointment of a financial adviser and joint stockbrokers. The indebted furniture retailing and manufacturing group has appointed County NatWest as its merchant bank adviser and Rowe &amp; Pitman and Smith New Court Corporate Finance as joint stockbrokers. The announcement triggered a rise in the shares of Asda, the food retailer, which as MFI's former parent company retains a 25 per cent stake in its offspring. Asda's shares surged 11 per cent to 39 1/2 p before closing up 3 1/2 p at 39p. Mr Derek Hunt, MFI chairman, said the group had seen strong sales in the past six weeks and was ready to begin preparations for a reflotation. Although no decision has been made as to the exact timing of the flotation, the group would prefer to see the general election out of the way. The flotation was also subject to MFI's buoyant performance being sustained and to favourable conditions on the stock market. MFI was bought out from Asda in November 1987 by a management team led by Mr Hunt, in what was at the time the largest MBO in the UK. The highly leveraged Pounds 718m buy-out soon ran into difficulties, however, as interest rates climbed and consumer spending fell sharply. The group negotiated a refinancing in the summer of 1989, and rescheduled a portion of its debt in May last year. It is still saddled with Pounds 500m of capital repayment, the first Pounds 15m of which falls in April. There will be another repayment of Pounds 25m in the autumn. Mr Hunt is cautiously optimistic about the group's trading outlook. 'We believe the bedrock was at the interims,' he said. MFI posted a 21 per cent increase in trading profits to Pounds 25m (Pounds 20.6m) in the six months to November 9 on slightly lower turnover of Pounds 319.2m (Pounds 320.4m). The pre-tax loss was trimmed to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 16m). Since then, the group has seen a strong rise in trade in the January sales, which provide more than a quarter of total turnover. In the six weeks since the sales period started in late December, there has been an improvement in group sales in the double digits in percentage terms over last year, Mr Hunt said. The improvements seen were at least in the 'higher teens', he said, and he expected to see continuing strength ahead. MFI has invested heavily in software and strengthened inventory controls, thereby releasing Pounds 18m as working capital. In its stores it has raised the proportion of products manufactured in its own factories, which has enabled it to maintain gross profit margins at about 58 per cent. Overheads have been lowered by 5 per cent on a year-on-year basis. A virtually just-in-time delivery system has been adopted for its stores and is being introduced to its factories.</p>

In particular, a treaty on the creation of a single economic  area (all existing barriers will now be removed) and  intergovernmental agreements on regional banks -- a foreign  currency bank and a clearing bank -- were signed. These and  other documents, as the two leaders pointed out at a news  conference, are designed to ensure the free movement of goods,  services, capital, and manpower, as well as the implementation  of a concerted credit-clearing, budget, tax, price, customs, and  currency policy between the two states.    A special agreement records Uzbekistan's debts to  Kazakhstan,  amounting to more than $39 million, as a state credit. It is  envisaged that this debt will be repaid this year by means of  additional deliveries of natural gas, electricity, and textile  products. Kazakhstan in turn will sell to its neighbor 2  million tonnes of grain, 600,000 tonnes of coal, and 260,000  tonnes of rolled metal, cast iron, ferroalloys, and refined  copper.</p>
